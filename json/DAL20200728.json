The programme for Government recognises the important role that the private rented sector will continue to play into the future.  The Government is seeking to address challenges in this sector, including those relating to standards, security and affordability for renters.  I am asking the Oireachtas to pass the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020 to help mitigate the adverse social and economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic which, unfortunately, have been felt by many tenants in the residential rental sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 was enacted on 27 March last.  Part 2 of that Act modifies the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 during the Covid-19 emergency period, initially for three months, to better protect tenants by prohibiting rent increases in all cases, and tenancy terminations in all but limited and exceptional cases.  Section 4(1) provides that upon the request of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, after consulting the Minister for Health and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Government may make an order to extend the emergency period for such time as it considers appropriate if it is satisfied that making the order is in the public interest, having regard to the threat to public health presented by Covid-19, the highly contagious nature of that disease and the need to restrict the movement of persons in order to prevent the spread of the disease among the population.  On 19 June 2020, the previous Government made an order extending the emergency period until 20 July 2020 in accordance with the aforementioned section 4(1).  On 20 July 2020 upon my request, a further Government order was made to extend the emergency period to expire on 1 August 2020.  This extra time has enabled me to develop policy and law for the consideration of the House today in the form the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The recitals at the start of the Bill set out the policy context in which the temporary and limited restrictions on landlords' constitutionally protected property rights are framed, in Part 2 and section 12, for the social common good.  Covid-19 has undeniably caused a crisis for the world and Ireland has not escaped, with significant adverse impacts being visited upon those who have contracted the disease, their families and their friends.  The broad social impacts of Covid-19 are closely interwoven with the adverse economic impacts.  There has been a substantial and sudden increase in unemployment.  Many in the residential rental sector have faced job losses, restricting their ability to pay rent and putting them at risk of losing their homes.<\/p> <p>There is a significant risk that some renters will have difficulty securing alternative rental accommodation and might end up in overcrowded accommodation at a time when the State is keenly focused on continuing to suppress the spread of Covid-19.  We want to minimise the occurrence of any overcrowded accommodation and, in doing so, minimise the risk of transmission of Covid-19, which has already cost this country dearly.<\/p> <p> We want the economic recovery to start now with the help of the July stimulus package.  Working together and continuing to adhere to public health advice, we can arrest the fallout for our society and economy by getting our people back to work.<\/p> <p> The Bill recognises that Covid-19 has been hard on many tenants, particularly those working in the worst affected sectors of the economy, such as hospitality and retail.  It proposes short-term and long-term solutions.  Where a tenant makes a written declaration that the economic impact of Covid-19 has rendered him or her unable to pay rent and at a significant risk of tenancy termination, my Bill provides for increased notice periods for failure to pay rent from 28 days to 90 days in respect of notices of termination served on tenants in the residential rental sector during the emergency period from the passing of this Bill to 10 January 2021.  Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears and served during the new emergency period cannot specify a tenancy termination date earlier than 11 January 2021.  There will be a prohibition of rent increases on tenancies of dwellings during the new emergency period.<\/p> <p> In the longer term, there are more permanent measures.  Amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act in the Bill provide that, before a notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can be served, a tenant will have 28 days to pay outstanding rent.  Those 28 days will start from the date of receipt by the tenant or the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, of a written rent arrears notification from the landlord, whichever date occurs later.  That is an increase from 14 days currently.  The Residential Tenancies Act will be amended to include specific requirements relating to the giving of notifications and notices of termination by landlords to tenants and the RTB in respect of arrears of rent.  The Bill also provides for a one-off extension from ten years to 12 years of the period under the Valuation Act 2001 within which a valuation list relating the rating authority area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council shall be published, with a return to the usual ten-year period from 2023.  This temporary provision is required to counter the logistical difficulties caused to that local authority by the Covid-19 restrictions.<\/p> <p> We must continue addressing the immediate and drastic economic and social consequences of Covid-19, protecting as many jobs as possible and making sure that families and businesses can survive financially.  The economic recession that the pandemic has caused is the most rapid and dramatic ever experienced by anyone in the House.  The emergency measures introduced in March, with all-party support, have prevented a much deeper social and economic crisis.<\/p> <p> Last Thursday, the Government approved my proposals to progress residential tenancy legislation before the summer recess to better protect tenants who remained vulnerable as society and business reopened after the Covid-19 lockdown.  In light of the prevailing economic situation caused by the pandemic, this Bill provides further protection during a new emergency period until 10 January 2021 for tenants who have been impacted economically by the pandemic.<\/p> <p> I will turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  There are three Parts, comprising 13 sections.  In Part 1 the preliminary and general sections 1 and 2 contain standard provisions relating to the Short Title, collective citations and definitions.<\/p> <p> Part 2 provides key and urgent enhancements to protections for tenants during an emergency period where they have been economically impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and are unable to meet their obligations under the Residential Tenancies Acts to pay the rent due.<\/p> <p> Section 3 defines \"emergency period\" to mean from the date of the passing of this Bill to 10 January 2021.<\/p> <p> Section 4 provides that Part 2 shall apply unless the tenant makes a written declaration that he or she is unable to comply with his or her obligations to pay rent due because he or she: was or is temporarily out of work due to having contracted Covid-19, without entitlement to be paid by his or her employer; or was in receipt of, or entitled to receive, the temporary wage subsidy or any other payment out of public moneys provided for by or under statute and paid for the purpose of alleviating financial hardship resulting from the loss of employment occasioned by Covid-19, including rent supplement or a supplementary welfare allowance, and, as a consequence, is at significant risk that his or her tenancy will be terminated by his or her landlord.  Such a declaration must be served on the RTB and copied to the landlord.  It shall be an offence to make a false or misleading declaration.<\/p> <p> During the emergency period and where the declaration has been made, section 5 provides that before a notice of termination is served by a landlord on foot of rent arrears, a tenant must have been afforded with a minimum of 28 days to pay his her rent arrears after a written rent arrears notice has been received by both the tenant and the RTB.  A 90-day notice of termination period will now apply where rent arrears are the basis of the termination.  The corresponding notice period for rent arrears terminations outside of the emergency period is 28 days' notice.  A notice of termination served during the emergency shall not specify a termination date that falls earlier than 11 January 2021.  A tenant cannot acquire Part 4 security of tenure as a result of this section.<\/p> <p> Section 6 provides that no rent increase can take effect during the emergency period and no increase in rent will be payable in respect of any time during that period.<\/p> <p> I am proposing a new section for insertion into the Bill by way of a Committee Stage amendment to clarify that tenants can submit the relevant declaration to the RTB by electronic means to avail of the enhanced protections under Part 2.  The Government also needs to make a technical amendment to section 4(3).<\/p> <p> Part 3 provides for amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, the Emergency Measures in Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 and the Valuation Act 2001.<\/p> <p> Section 7 provides that during the period from the date of the passing of the Act to 10 January 2021, tenancy tribunals are not required to be held in public.  This is a continuation of the provision first introduced in the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 in the interest of public health and safety.<\/p> <p> Section 8 provides for an amendment to the table to section 34 of Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide a new separate ground - 1A - for termination of a tenancy for non-payment or rent within the minimum 28-day period afforded for payment following receipt of a written rent arrears notice by both the tenant and the RTB.  The 28-day period commences upon receipt of the written rent arrears notice by the tenant or the RTB, whichever occurs later.  Section 9 is a consequential amendment to section 35 of the Residential Tenancies Act arising from the new ground 1A provided for under section 8.<\/p> <p> Section 10 inserts a new section 39A into the Residential Tenancies Acts.  The new section 39A provides that where a landlord serves a notice of termination on the failure to pay an amount of rent set under the tenancy, a copy of that notice must sent to the RTB at the same time as to the tenant.  When it receives a copy of the notice, the RTB will notify the tenant in writing of his or her right to refer a matter in connection with the notice of termination to the board for resolution under section 76.  In the resolution of any dispute arising, the RTB adjudicator shall have regard to any advice provided to the tenant by the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, when making a decision or determination.  Where there is an appeal to a tribunal, the tribunal shall also have regard to advice provided by MABS when making its determination.  This is a new provision and a further new protection for tenants.<\/p> <p> Section 11 provides for a number of amendments to section 67 of  the Residential Tenancies Act.  Paragraphs (a) and (b) provide conditions for the serving of a notice of termination where the tenant has failed to pay an amount of rent due.  The conditions are that the tenant and the RTB have been notified in writing that an such amount of rent due as is specified in the notification has not been paid, and that the rent has not been paid to the landlord within the minimum period of 28 days following receipt of that notification by the tenant, or by the RTB, whichever occurs later.<\/p> <p> Paragraph (c) provides that where the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, receives a notification that an amount of rent due has not been paid, it shall provide information in writing to assist the tenant in getting advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  Provision is also made that any notice of termination for failure by the tenant to pay an amount of rent due shall be deemed to be invalid if the landlord fails to simultaneously serve a copy of that notice on the tenant and the RTB.<\/p> <p> Section 12 amends section 5 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 in subsection (6) to redefine the revised termination date so that it cannot expire earlier than 10 August 2020.  This applies to tenancies where a notice of termination had already been served but the notice period had not expired before the 2020 Act came into law on 27 March.  Section 5(7) of the Act is also deleted to ensure that Part 2 - Operation of Residential Tenancies Act 2004 - ceases to operate at the end of the emergency period under section 3(1) of that Act.<\/p> <p> Section 13 modifies the application of section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001 by extending the period from ten to 12 years within which a valuation list in regard to the rating authority area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown shall be published, with a return to normal in 2023.<\/p> <p> This Bill is being introduced during an economic emergency.  The measures that we take now have to target those who most need our help.  The tailored approach in this Bill targets a prohibition on rent increases to those who need them.  It protects tenants from imminent tenancy termination caused by rent arrears.  The earliest they will have to leave their home is 11 January 2021.  We also recognise that some landlords also find themselves on the wrong side of Covid-19, and we recognise constitutionally protected property rights.  That is the reason this Bill balances the need to protect those worse affected by Covid-19 with the need to respect property rights and the legitimate interests of landlords.<\/p> <p> Evidence suggests that we are moving from a public health emergency into an economic recovery phase.  It is in this context of the hard-won progress that this Bill is being introduced.  We must respect the efforts that all of society have made in getting us this far.  We must adjust to this new normal.  The residential rental sector has its part to play during the economic fallout and has some time to run.<\/p> <p> This legislation seeks to protect both tenants and landlords.  Landlords accept that some tenants will face serious financial challenges over the coming weeks and months and I know that they will work with tenants to the greatest extent possible.  Landlords recognise that forbearance is required.  The provisions in this Bill will help during and after the economic fallout from Covid-19.  It will ultimately help landlords by ensuring early and active engagement by tenants with Government supports where they find themselves in difficulties paying rent.  The usual rental protections under the Residential Tenancies Acts will apply as normal from 2 August.  It is only where rent arrears is a problem during the emergency period to 10 January will the temporary prohibition on rent increases and terminations apply.<\/p> <p> Earlier this month, the RTB, in conjunction with the ESRI, published a paper entitled Exploring the Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Rental Prices in Ireland from January to June 2020: Early Insights from a Monthly Rent Index.  The analysis shows that the annual growth rate of rent amounts declined significantly compared to the period prior to the lockdown.  While the annual growth rate in March was over 3%, by April it had fallen to 0.4% and it declined again in May to 0.1%.  By June, the annual growth rate had turned negative with prices falling by 3.3% compared to the same month the previous year.<\/p> <p> The findings clearly show early downward pressure on rental prices and a lowering in the number of registrations, the latter of which is consistent with the restrictions on economic and social life brought in to stop the spread of Covid-19.  Early estimates for April through to June 2020 show annualised rent falls in Dublin, with a clear reduction in the year-on-year growth rate in other areas.<\/p> <p> My Department and the ESRI operate a programme of collaborative research principally focused on housing economics.  Under this programme, researchers from the ESRI and my Department prepared a research paper exploring the short-run implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on the private rented sector.  The research paper focused on rental payment affordability and the potential incidence of arrears during the first three months of the pandemic among non-supported private market renting households, that is, among renting households which do not receive a housing subsidy.<\/p> <p>Changes in consumption patterns arising from public health measures are also considered in this paper.  The preliminary research findings do not identify a significant rent arrears problem emerging during the first three months of the pandemic.  I understand that this report will be published today.  While tenants are legally obliged to continue to pay rent during this emergency, the Government is fully conscious that some tenants have seen a reduction in their working hours, some have lost their jobs, and others have been forced to self-isolate to protect their communities and in some cases have contracted Covid-19.   <\/p> <p> The Government has made a range of income and rental supports available to anyone in financial difficulty.  I encourage tenants encountering difficulty to engage with their landlords and the Department Of Employment Affairs and Social Protection at the earliest opportunity to seek whatever income and rental support might apply in their case.  Covid-19 has presented this country and the global community with enormous challenges over the last five months.  The pandemic will continue to present challenges in the medium to long term, particularly for those most vulnerable in society and those working in sectors most heavily impacted by it. <\/p> <p> The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, asserts the Government's ambition to meet those challenges, repair the damage that has been inflicted on our people by the pandemic and translate the renewed spirit arising from these challenging times into action.  This has been a very stressful and testing time for our people.  The economic impact of the pandemic will continue to be felt in all parts of the country and society for a long time to come.  We now need to move decisively to recover from its devastating social, economic and cultural impact. <\/p> <p> The key goal is to get as many people as possible back to work in a safe manner at the earliest possible time.  The Government is committed to helping people who need help to meet their housing needs.  It believes that everybody should have access to good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard, located close to essential services and offering a high quality of life.  We understand that the provision of more affordable housing has a profound social and economic benefit.  We believe that the State has a fundamental role in enabling the delivery of new homes and ensuring that the best use is made of existing stock.  We will prioritise the provision of public housing on public land.  We will build more social homes for families and individuals and we will make affordable homes to purchase or rent available to our working people.<\/p> <p> As Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, I know that people need to get back to work and to be able to pay their rent, mortgage and other bills as soon as possible.  This Bill will help tenants who most need it.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800003#A00800","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595926500,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin proposes to share time with Deputy Martin Browne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800007#E00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1595926500,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I do.  The programme for Government promises to improve security and affordability for renters.  The Fianna F&aacute;il election manifesto, on which the Minister campaigned vigorously, went further, promising to launch a &quot;new deal for renters&quot;.  Both documents also committed to reducing homelessness, yet the very first piece of legislation introduced by the Minister is nothing short of an attack on renters.  It strips vital protections from the vast majority of tenants at the very time when they most desperately need them.  If this Bill passes, rent increases are back on the table, as are existing and new notices to quit on all grounds.  Contrary to the Minister's claims, the protections for renters whose incomes have been hit by Covid-19 are weak, overly complex and will be very easy for a small number of rogue landlords to get around.  The result will be a significant undermining of both security and affordability for very many renters and a return to increasing levels of homelessness, particularly for families with children.<\/p><p>As the Minister knows, the private rental sector was in crisis before Covid-19.  Rents were and continue to be at unsustainably high levels.  The <i>Daft.ie<\/i>index for the second quarter of 2020 tells us that new asking rents average at &euro;1,400 across the State and at more than &euro;2,000 in Dublin.  The Residential Tenancies Board index, which combines new and existing rents, showed that at the end of the first quarter the average monthly rent was &euro;1,200 throughout the State and more than &euro;1,700 in Dublin.  That is a nationwide annual increase of 5%.<\/p> <p>Vacant possession notices to quit continued to drive family homelessness until the ban introduced by the Oireachtas by 27 March.  Limited shifts of short-term lets into the long-term rental market have been heavily offset by the loss of long-term rentals.  In the past three years, as a result of the inaction of the previous Government, we lost 17,000 rental properties in the market, with very significant consequences for renters and homelessness.<\/p> <p> We know the ban on evictions, notices to quit and rent increases introduced by the Oireachtas on 27 March gave renters a much-needed break.  It did much more than just shield tenants from the impact of Covid-19.  It led to a dramatic drop in the number of families presenting as homeless and in emergency accommodation; this was the first substantial drop we have seen since Fine Gael took office in 2016.  There was a 56% drop in April of families presenting as homeless and an even higher drop in the numbers ending up in emergency accommodation.  We now have the lowest numbers of families in emergency accommodation in three years.<\/p> <p> This confirms the argument many of us have been making that banning vacant possession notices to quit was key to reducing family homelessness.  We know from Focus Ireland and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive that vacant possession notices to quit are the single largest cause of family homelessness.  It speaks volumes that it took a health emergency for the outgoing Government to act decisively on reducing homelessness.  Great work was done by the Department dealing with housing, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and homelessness organisations in limiting the spread of the virus and key to this was decongregation and reducing numbers of families with children in emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p> There was widespread expectation that the ban on evictions, notices to quit and rent increases would be extended by the Government, and the Minister said it would be helpful to do so only a matter of weeks ago.  Many of us called for the Government to go much further and we wanted the ban to be extended for all renters until January 2021, as well as the introduction of a comprehensive rent arrears debt resolution process, including the option of debt write-downs.  However, just like with Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Simon Coveney, the previous Ministers, instead of getting legislation that protects renters, we are getting a Bill under the cover of a restrictive interpretation of the Constitution that leaves renters exposed to greater insecurity and unaffordability.  Fianna F&aacute;il's new deal for renters looks exactly like Fine Gael's old bad deal for renters.<\/p> <p> I will deal specifically with the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister claims Part 2 of the legislation protects renters whose tenancies are at risk due to Covid-19 income loss.  In many respects, I simply do not agree with this assertion.  This is a very cumbersome and complex provision, and for a small number of rogue landlords, it would be very easy to get around it.  This is in no way a criticism of the drafters, as again, just like with previous Ministers, departmental officials have been given the impossible task of trying to construct very detailed and complex legislation in short periods.<\/p> <p> The written declaration element is wholly unnecessary and it is a contradiction to research that Threshold recently published by Dr. Mick Byrne that indicates tenant-led renter protection often does not help the most vulnerable people.  It will cause real difficulty for renters with capacity issues, including those related to mental health and addiction, as well as those with literacy and language difficulties.  The threshold of \"significant risk\" to a tenancy is not defined and therefore we could see a series of disputes where landlords object to a tenant's claim that a tenancy is at significant risk clogging up the Residential Tenancies Board and preventing the vindication of these rights.<\/p> <p> We also have the case of tenants fearful of receiving a notice to quit who may feel under pressure not to object to a rent increase.  I spoke recently to a very senior and capable journalist who lives in the private rented sector.  She told me that her experience is that because there is a huge demand for rental properties, tenants will often not seek to vindicate their rights because of a fear of receiving a notice to quit on other grounds.  Just as the remainder of this Bill makes clear, if a tenant seeks the protection of this section, a notice to quit on any of the other grounds may be issued by the landlord.  Otherwise, landlords will simply proceed as normal.<\/p> <p> I accept there are some minor improvements on existing provisions with Part 3.<\/p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>I must say that the Minister is wholly overselling these as major interventions.  Increasing the rent notice period to 28 days from 14 is welcome, as is formally introducing MABS in the Residential Tenancies Board process.  However, as all the other grounds for ending a tenancy are still available, rogue landlords are likely to avoid the new rent arrears notice and look for a simpler or speedier way of getting rid of a tenant.  The idea of giving someone with an eviction due date of 1 August a paltry nine extra days is really shameful.<\/p> <p> On the issues not addressed in the Bill, vacant possession is the one I really do not understand.  It is hard to understand why the Minister did not include a ban on vacant possession notices to quit in the Bill.  Does he not understand the impact this one measure has had on levels of family homelessness?  Does he not understand the impact of an increase in families in emergency accommodation on the spread of Covid-19?  Did he consult with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive or homeless non-governmental organisations about the removal of this vital protection?  Does he not know the consequences of this significant omission?  My great fear is that the enormous progress made since March will be wiped away with this one single decision.  I have no doubt that such a measure would have been consistent with section 4(2) of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act had it been properly crafted.  <\/p> <p> I have been contacted by a very large number of renters in recent days who are bitterly disappointed that the Minister is allowing rent increases again.  Contrary to his claim that there is no constitutionally sound way of banning rent increases, I believe, and there is significant legal opinion, that it is possible.  I understand that one NGO has forwarded one legal opinion to the Minister on this issue.  It is clear that like his predecessor, he simply does not have the political will to do this.  The consequence will be real financial hardship for tenants who were already paying far too much rent before the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p> <p> The Minister had other choices.  He could have extended the ban on evictions, notices to quit and rent increases until the end of the year.  He could have amended the emergency legislation to allow limited notices to quit in cases such as wilful non-payment of rent, serious anti-social behaviour or where a property owner was at risk of homelessness.  Those provisions would have made eminent sense and allowed the vast majority of renters to be protected.  Instead he decided to do exactly what his predecessor would have done and shaft renters.  Every time I hear a Minister say that we have to balance the rights of landlords and tenants, it is almost as if somehow these two groups of people have equal power in this relationship when we know that is simply not the case.<\/p> <p> This is a very bad Bill.  It is bad for renters, it is bad for the stability of the rental market, as it will lead to increased notices to quit and an exit of landlords from the market, and it is also bad for the local economy because every rent increase takes money away from renters' disposable income to be spent on local goods and services at such a local time.  That is something that in the context of a stimulus plan makes no sense at all.  <\/p> <p> The Minister should not just believe me or listen to other members of the Opposition, he should listen to what the advocates working on the front line with renters are telling him  Threshold, in a submission to Deputies this week, has said it is too narrow, overly complex and \"will fail to protect many tenants who are at serious risk of homelessness\".  Focus Ireland, one of the country's leading family homeless charities, have said in a submission to Deputies this week that the Bill will not significantly prevent an increase in the numbers presenting as homeless.  The legislation will be open to landlords to ignore rent arrears and evict on other grounds.  The Simon Communities have called for \"an extension of the moratoria until the end of 2020 with amendments to address some of the legitimate concerns of landlords\", a sentiment I agree with wholeheartedly.  <\/p> <p> I am not surprised that Fianna F&aacute;il or indeed Fine Gael would back this Bill, all the evidence shows they have never stood by renters, but for the Green Party to support this is genuinely shocking.  This is not what that party campaigned for in the general election, or what was committed to in its manifesto, and in my view it is not what the party's Deputies were elected to this House for.<\/p> <p>I know they will not vote against the Bill, so I urge them to absent themselves from the Chamber.  If the Minister for Health could absent himself from the Chamber for the election of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it would be eminently honourable for Green Party Deputies who say they want to stand by renters simply not to come to the Chamber to vote for this legislation later this week.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in, as I have said publicly, will table significant amendments.  We look forward to what I think will be constructive amendments from other parties in opposition and commit to supporting those.  Without meaningful change to the Bill, and without real protections for all renters who are experiencing insecurity and high rents, Sinn F&eacute;in will not support the Bill because we will not support legislation that creates greater insecurity and greater unaffordability for tens of thousands of renters in the private rented sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800007#E00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595927700,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Each and every day, people in my constituency of Tipperary contact me with issues relating to housing, which is one of the main issues facing people today.  Housing is incredibly hard for people to come by.  People are waiting years for a house that is suitable for their needs.  The changes the Government wants to implement will only make that waiting list longer and leave people without a home that suits their needs or without a home altogether.  In my constituency, young people with growing families are encountering incredible difficulties in getting a home that suits them.  I am dealing with a number of cases in which young couples who are expecting a baby are forced to live apart at their parents' family homes as they wait for suitable local authority accommodation to become available to them.  Can the Government imagine the circumstances that will face them when they realise that the local authority has little to offer and they are forced to look to the private sector for accommodation, given the changes it is making with the Bill?  It will extend the ban on evictions to 10 January but that will be only for tenants who have lost jobs or income due to Covid-19, and they must confirm this to the RTB.  The Government is, in effect, watering down the supports for tenants and giving landlords the power to evict others.<\/p>  <p>  Let us look at the implications for the private rented sector of the changes the Government is suggesting.  The impact of this will be felt in all sectors of society.  The number of people looking for accommodation will increase, while competition for accommodation will get stronger and force rental prices upwards.  The availability of accommodation available to the public will drop significantly.  Homelessness will increase - the Minister can be sure of that - which will result in more and more couples like those I have mentioned having to live apart, or having to lower their standards and live in accommodation that is unsuitable for a growing young family, and they will be the more fortunate ones.<\/p>  <p>  Let us now look at those on the other side.  What about those who are forced out and have nowhere to go, who do not have the means to pay the high rents they are faced with because the market is once again geared towards landlords?  The Simon Communities have stated they do not believe the Bill will provide the preferred level of protection to vulnerable renters.  The organisation has stated it will not protect those tenants who could be made homeless if the landlord requires the property for his or her own use or wishes to sell it.  It has described this policy as having been a driver of homelessness over the period of the housing and homelessness crisis.  It is worried that removing this protection without providing comprehensive supports will lead to an increase in the number of people having to present to homeless services.<\/p>  <p>  These aspects of the Bill - forcing tenants to vacate if the landlord requires the property or intends to sell it - are the most concerning for me.  Who will be in a position to determine whether either purpose has been realised?  Is the RTB funded enough to police this?  Requiring the landlord to offer the property back to the tenant if either purpose has not been fulfilled after a year is not realistic.  Over the course of that year, the tenant will have made other arrangements if they are fortunate enough.  Otherwise, who knows what challenges they will have faced?  While the Bill provides certain protections from eviction and rent increases, those protections will be available to far fewer people.  This is an indictment of the failure of successive Governments to provide people with a fallback when it comes to accommodation, namely, the availability of local authority housing, which Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have ignored.  We are over-reliant on the private sector in our rental market.<\/p> <p>Landlords need an income and renters need accommodation but when demand outstrips supply, prices soar and those seeking houses lose out.  When demand increases because of these measures, what plans are in place to deal with the people who are going to need accommodation?<\/p> <p> I want to move on to those renters who would qualify for these protections.  The Bill requires them to self-declare that they cannot make their payments due to loss of work or income.  How are people going to be advised of how this process works?  Is it going to be a complicated, drawn-out process or has the Minister created a structure that allows it to be streamlined?  Will assistance be available to people?  Can the Government assure us that no one is going to fall through the cracks here like before?<\/p> <p> It is an absolute scandal that in this day and age people are going homeless and young people are being priced out of the rental market.  The Minister has an opportunity to reverse the trend that has seen families living in hotel rooms, bed and breakfast accommodation and even in cars.  Right now, he has a chance to address this dysfunctional rental system so I appeal to him to protect our renters now and to take the time to draw up a plan to reform the system into one that is fair, equitable, affordable and accessible.  If that is too hard for the Government to do, the Minister can just ask us.  We will be more than happy to send on Deputy &Oacute; Broin's Sinn F&eacute;in housing policy to help it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800010#H00200","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595928300,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The Labour Party will be opposing the Bill and submitting a number of amendments.  We feel that this Bill has limited protections for those impacted by Covid-19.  It seems strange, when a measure introduced in March has been seen to work to keep people out of homelessness, that we would change the provisions that were made.  Homelessness and housing have dogged political debate for years now.  They are one of the greatest crises we have had to grapple with as a nation.  Measures have finally been taken that have seen a drop in the numbers presenting, but now we are changing the very provisions that saw these numbers drop.  Because of this legislation, we can be sure that we will now see an increase in homelessness in the autumn.  The Government must prepare for that reality because this flawed Bill will not stop people losing their homes.  Unfortunately, we are going to have a debate in the autumn when we will point to this moment and say to the Minister that we told him.  I presume the Minister will use devices or excuses to explain why the Opposition is wrong and he is right.  I hope we are wrong and he is right.  There is nothing from experience to suggest that will be the case.<\/p>  <p>  The pandemic ban on evictions clearly worked to stop the increase in homelessness.  Under this Bill, no-fault evictions are back, substantial renovation evictions are back and evictions for the benefit of family members are back.  There is no beefing up of the staffing of the RTB for inspections and protections of renters in such cases.  Let us be clear about the type of people who will be most affected by these measures and the type of people who are renting in our economy.  A huge number of them are younger workers who have been most seriously affected by the economic collapse.  Some 30% of 20 to 24 year olds and 42% of 25 to 34 year olds are renting.  The job losses in sectors where large numbers of workers rent are as follows: 38% in accommodation and food; 28% in administration and support; 27% in retail; 23% in arts; and 21% in construction.  These are massive job losses in areas of the economy where a huge section of workers rent.  About 200,000 renters are in sectors most severely affected by job losses.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, the proposed law leaves too many exceptions in the terms of evictions and there is a significant risk that, from September, we will see homelessness rising again.  The changes will only give protection from eviction until January to those who can prove that they have been financially impacted upon by a limited set of circumstances and will put in place a complicated process to apply for that exception.<\/p> <p> It is important to re-emphasise the point that the Bill does not take into account in any adequate way those who have addiction issues or mental health challenges or those with lower levels of literacy.  We live in a country where 17.9% of Irish adults are functionally illiterate.  This means that they cannot access application forms or read medicine bottles.  That is one in six adults.  The House can be sure that a disproportionate number of them are in the rental sector.  The Bill will result in more people losing their homes in view of the fact that they will have to navigate a cumbersome and technical system that has been criticised by many homeless agencies.<\/p> <p> Disturbingly, the Minister plans to criminalise tenants for false declarations without doing the same in respect of landlords availing of eviction exemptions.  To do this to someone at risk of losing his or her home is despicable.  The Minister also needs to clarify whether the Bill, as proposed, will stop rent increases until January 2021 for all tenants or just those impacted by Covid-19.<\/p> <p> This is the latest last-minute Bill over many years that attempts to address issues in the body of law covering residential tenancies.  Sadly, it fails to address adequately the main excuses used for evicting tenants, which are a driving force of homelessness.  If something has successfully prevented people from losing their homes and entering homelessness, why change it?  We have tabled 12 amendments to various sections.  We look forward to debating those points with the Minister as the Bill progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800011#J00200","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595928600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that a significant amount of work has gone into this Bill and that there are some aspects of Part 3 that will be useful.  There has been a great deal of mixed messaging in the lead up to the Bill, though.  There was more today in the Minister's speech relating to the public health aspect.  We have been told on the one hand that there is a significant public health risk of evicted renters potentially moving into overcrowded accommodation and, on the other, that we are moving out of the public health emergency and into economic recovery.  We need clarity.  Are we in a public health emergency or is the Government asserting that we are exiting it?  Outside this Bill, it seems clear that the Government's messaging, and correctly so, is that we are in a public health emergency.  The reason we are in the Convention Centre Dublin and spaced so far apart is because we are in a public health emergency.  The reason for the measures that people are living with every day is because we are in a public health emergency.  When it comes to renters' rights in the private rented residential sector, however, we are being told that we are moving out of a public health emergency.  At the same time, the Minister has acknowledged that renters being evicted could create public health risks by them moving into overcrowded accommodation.  We need to have some consistency on public health messaging from the Government.<\/p>  <p>  There has been some mixed messaging in respect of the Bill.  Initially, the Minister informed people that there would be an extension until October.  Subsequently, he stated that the rent freeze would be extended.  In the past couple of days, much of the media coverage on the Bill referred to the eviction freeze being extended to January for those who self-declare and gave the impression that all evictions will be banned for tenants who are able to self-declare even though that is not the case.<\/p> <p>We know that if a tenant self-declares, he or she cannot be evicted on rent arrears but can be evicted on all of the other grounds.<\/p> <p> It is very important that the mixed messaging on this is dealt with.  If not, it is only going to lead to more confusion.  It will mean that if this Bill is passed, we are going to have more and more people getting in touch with us, people who thought they were protected, had made a self-declaration and would not be evicted but who then receive a notices to quit and eviction notices.<\/p> <p> I have a number of difficulties with this Bill.  Most tenants are excluded from the main provisions of the Bill and rent increases and evictions generally will resume for most tenants within the next few days at the start of August.<\/p> <p> I have a particular difficulty that front-line workers, many of whom are on low pay and kept essential services running during the pandemic, will not necessarily receive any protection.  It is not the case that those most vulnerable or most affected by Covid-19 will receive protection.  Everybody, to a lesser or greater degree, has been affected by Covid-19.  Front-line workers who have been under additional pressure will not necessarily receive protection here.  They have not been on a Covid-19-related payment or may have not been out of work but they may well be on low pay and they will not receive protection.  Indeed many vulnerable tenants, who will not have been on a Covid-19 payment, will not receive any protection under this Bill and there are significant issues with that.<\/p> <p> There are issues with the whole self-declaration process outlined in the Bill.  This is going to hit vulnerable tenants.  In particular, it is going to hit tenants with literacy issues, of whom we know there is a significant number.  It is also going to hit some migrant tenants for whom English is not necessarily their first language, who may not have access to public information around this and who already feel vulnerable as to the power imbalance with landlords.<\/p> <p> The penalties for getting a self-declaration wrong are going to put some people off making one, people who could legitimately make a self-declaration, and this will scare some of them away.  This will cause general confusion as to what protections are in place and for whom and what declaration are in place for people who make self-declaration.  This will create a level of conflict between some landlords and tenants as there will be misunderstandings in that regard.<\/p> <p> This Bill is going to do probably the one thing that we do not need in the private rented residential sector which is to introduce more loopholes and complexities.  That is probably the last thing the sector needs.<\/p> <p> A key test for good legislation is that it is clear, transparent, simple and easy for people to follow and understand.  If we apply that a key test to this legislation, it fails dismally.  We have seen to date that misunderstandings have occurred in the media commentary on this Bill.  If the people who are taking a close look at this Bill are under some level of confusion as to how it is going to operate, how will that apply to tenants who will not necessarily have that detailed look at it or a background in the understanding of complex legislation?  We know that from other changes in the private residential sector over the years that it can take a number of months and, indeed, years for those changes to bed in and for people to get a wide understanding of how they apply.  We are going to have those kind of difficulties with this legislation if it passes.<\/p> <p> As other Deputies said, this Bill will drive more people into homelessness.  I understand the Minister and the Department&rsquo;s constitutional concerns.  Legal advice has been sent to the Minister by the Simon Communities of Ireland in which Siobh&aacute;n Phelan SC noted that the circumstances of the public health crisis which led to the introduction of the Emergency Measures in Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 are still with us and the public health advice is replete with references to a second surge, that it seems clear from the public discourse that regional spikes are anticipated and that if this is the case, then there should be sufficient justification available for the Legislature to introduce a new power to extend the moratorium either on a delegated basis or by way of primary legislation.<\/p> <p> There is contrary legal advice that there are other options available to the Minister.<\/p> <p>In addition to that, there are a number of missed opportunities in the Bill.  There are two things the Minister could have done with this Bill that would have made a very significant difference to renters and to addressing homelessness.  It is important to acknowledge that the emergency legislation has been successful in that regard.  There are multiple reasons for that, but one of the reasons there has been a reduction in homelessness is because of the additional measures and protections afforded to renters.  The first missed opportunity is that the Minister could have brought forward legislation for tenancies of indefinite duration, to which he said he is committed.  I note his recent comments about incentivising tenancies of indefinite duration.  That should apply to all tenancies.  The five years and six months limit on tenancies should be removed and tenancies of indefinite duration should be brought in across the board.<\/p> <p> The second missed opportunity is that the Minister could have brought forward legislation to limit the grounds for eviction and to remove the provision of vacant possession from evictions and notices to quit.  That would be a very effective measure.  We know, not just from the research done by the homeless organisations but also from data from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, that more than 75% of notices to quit and evictions are given to tenants on the grounds of vacant possession, either for sale or because the landlord or a family member wishes to move into the property market.  We also know that more than 200 enforcement cases are being taken by the RTB where there is a suspicion that landlords are citing those grounds on a bogus basis.  We know there is substantial evidence of abuse of those grounds and that the result of not removing vacant possession from the grounds will be more tenants evicted into homelessness.<\/p> <p> There is a very high cost to evictions.  There is both the social and the human cost but there is also a high economic cost.  We know that evicting people into homelessness is much more costly than preventing homelessness.  We know also from research that victims of home loss experience feelings of painful loss and continued longing that can lead to depression, symptoms of psychological and social distress and a sense of helplessness.  We know that there are particularly negative consequences for children in the loss of home, and the experience of homelessness can arise from that.  We know from a study of 22,000 households in Sweden that those who have lost their home where a landlord had applied for an eviction were, sadly, four times more likely to die by suicide.<\/p> <p> The private rented sector, as a tenure and a sector, is broken in many respects.  There is mistrust between landlords and tenants in many cases.  There are loopholes that are exploited.  There is a power imbalance between the person who is renting and whose home it is and the landlord who owns the property.  I believe there is a level of fear in the sector that many tenants and landlords experience.  Tenants are afraid of getting a landlord who will exploit loopholes, will not give them back their deposit or could issue them with a notice to quit at any period on the multiple grounds for notices to quit, at no fault of the tenant.  A significant number of landlords fear getting tenants who will not pay their rent and may cause further difficulties for the landlord, which happens also.  Underpinning those fears and problems in the sector is that, traditionally, regulation of the sector has been weak.<\/p> <p> We need a stable, secure and well-regulated private residential sector which gives certainty to both tenants and landlords and where there is good security of tenure and good support for both tenants and landlords.  That should be our long-term vision for the sector.  Unfortunately, this Bill does not bring us significantly closer to that.  Unfortunately for most tenants, the private rented sector is not a tenure of choice.  It is for a small category of tenants, such as those on high incomes who might be international workers living in Ireland for a number of years, but unfortunately, for most other people it is a tenure of last choice.<\/p>  <p>That is partly because of the lack of sufficient affordable housing, including cost rental and social housing.  It is partly because the sector is not sufficiently well established.  More than 20 years ago the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector envisioned moving towards a sector in which many people would feel secure renting for the long term.  That vision has not been realised because of the many loopholes in the legislation and the lack of long-term tenancies.  A renter should be able to feel that the property is his or her home and will remain so for the years to come, so he or she can plan ahead, get involved in the community and choose a school for his or her children.  That allows people to put down roots, which is good for them, their families and their children.  That long-term stability is also good for the wider community.<\/p> <p> We should achieve the situation in other countries, where tenants can remain in a property if it is sold.  It is incredibly destructive for someone to have to move out of his or her home and possibly move to another area, with all the attendant stress and hassle, especially if the property is then rented again.  That should not be necessary.  We should be providing the protections that are the norm in other jurisdictions.  Fundamental to this is recognising that a property is not just a rental unit but a person's home and understanding everything that goes with that.  <\/p> <p> I want to touch on the research of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, of which there is media coverage today.  Front-line workers in lower-paid and less secure professions are among the most essential to the economy, particularly during the pandemic.  The ESRI analysis shows that they face the highest risk of severe outcomes from Covid-19 infection.  They face worse health outcomes, more severe illness and the possibility of hospitalisation and mortality.  They have a higher incidence of underlying conditions.  We are talking about carers, people who work in meat plants, cleaners and migrant workers.  These are the very people who are over-represented in the private rental sector.  Many of these front-line workers will not receive any protections from this Bill.  Where is the public health analysis behind this Bill and the analysis of its impact on homelessness?  Is there any serious analysis of this kind?  If there is, the Minister might share it with us.  I do not see it at the moment.  This Bill is complex, is full of loopholes, has a limited use, ignores the fact that we are still in a pandemic and passes over the fact that everybody has been affected by Covid-19.  It effectively seeks to introduce two sets of rules within the private rental sector.  I am not sure of the legal justification for that.  I will be tabling several amendments to strengthen the Bill.<\/p> <p> There are three things on which we should reflect with respect to this Bill, and which the Government and the Minister in particular should consider.  First, front-line workers have been absolutely invaluable to this country, running essential services throughout the pandemic.  Many of them will not receive protections under this Bill.  Evictions and rent increases will resume for a large cohort of essential though low-paid front-line workers.  That must be considered.  I do not think it reflects the will of this House, and I certainly do not think it reflects the will of the Irish people.  The second important point is that this Bill will resume evictions into homelessness from the private rented residential sector.  We know that in most cases, failure to pay rent is not why people are evicted into homelessness.  This Bill fails that test.  Third, when we talk about evicting more people into homelessness from the private rental sector, we should remember the reports of five people who have died in homelessness services in recent days.<\/p> <p>Substantial cuts have been made to community health teams working with homeless people.  Specifically, there have been cuts of 13% in funding to mental health community teams over the past two years, which is utterly unacceptable during a pandemic, when people are under increased stress, and especially as this Bill will allow evictions into homelessness to resume.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister address that point?  The provisions are funded by the Health Service Executive and the Minister's Department would not deal with this directly but it is the responsibility of his Government.  The vital work done by community mental health teams needs to be supported, and if anything the funding should be increased instead of cut.  There would be no support from the public for such cuts and a number of people have contacted me, aghast that the Government and this House approved a &euro;16,000 salary increase for some Ministers of State at a time when there has been a 13% cut in funding community mental health teams that work directly with homeless people.  I urge the Minister and the Government to address that matter in particular.  I thank Members for listening to my contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800012#K00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595929800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett is proposing to share his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800016#O00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1595929800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Yes.

This is a shameful betrayal of tenants that opens the door to a new wave of evictions into homelessness in the midst of a pandemic.  It allows for the unthinkable.  We were warned yet again this morning on national radio by Mr. David Nabarro of the World Health Organization that a second wave is coming and, more than ever, we must ensure physical social distancing but this Bill allows for the resumption of evictions into homelessness, where people would be put in more vulnerable positions.  They will be on the streets, in shared accommodation provided by homelessness services or couch-surfing in overcrowded conditions with relatives and friends.  How can the Government stand over allowing evictions in such scenarios when the pandemic is still with us and the public health threat remains?  It is absolutely disgraceful.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has demonstrated an ability for contriving spin on a par with Fine Gael in the way it has presented this Bill, incredibly implying the legislation \"extends\" protection for tenants when it removes protection for tenants during this pandemic.  Emergency protections that were introduced have been removed in this legislation, reopening the door to evictions that were prohibited as a result of emergency legislation in March.<\/p>  <p>  The betrayal by Fianna F&aacute;il in particular in this regard, aided by the Green Party, is striking in that Fianna F&aacute;il supported the People Before Profit and Solidarity Anti-Evictions Bill 2018, which specifically prohibited evictions on the grounds of sale, which are the type of evictions being practised by unscrupulous landlords and vulture funds.  Fianna F&aacute;il backed that Bill, Second Stage of which was passed by the D&aacute;il, and condemned Fine Gael for its refusal to support the Bill but the party is now opening the door precisely for such evictions on the grounds of sales.  The party's Members voted against such a practice in the previous D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il also voted for a People Before Profit amendment that sought to strengthen the emergency legislation to prevent evictions that was introduced in March.  Our amendment specifically indicated that all evictions should be prohibited during the period of pandemic.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party supported the measure but they are now betraying such action, leaving tenants to the wolves and vultures.  It is important to say that is not rhetoric.

I emailed the Minister last week.  If this Bill goes through, the vulture fund that has been trying for three years to evict those tenants will succeed in evicting ten households, including families who have paid their rent for years and have never missed the rent.  They are working people who will be evicted into homelessness as a result of this Bill's passing which will allow the vulture fund which bought that complex to evict them on the grounds of sale.  It is shameful and runs completely in the face of public health guidance.<\/p>  <p>  It is not just Threshold, the Simon Communities, and others who have said that at very minimum - and we are tabling amendments to this effect - the eviction ban should be maintained for everyone until the pandemic is over, or at least until the end of this year, so that no one is evicted in the middle of a public health emergency.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which is under the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach, produced a report in recent weeks saying that overcrowding was incompatible with the protection of public health during the pandemic and that the emergency ban on all evictions should be retained for the duration of the pandemic.  Even a body under the aegis of the Taoiseach is saying that the Government should not be doing what it is doing, yet the Minister is opening the door to evictions which will happen immediately.  Homelessness has decreased as a result of the eviction ban, just as we said it would.  It is now going to start to increase again as a direct result of the passage of this Bill.  How can the Minister possibly justify that in any circumstances but particularly during a pandemic when the Government will directly endanger the lives of the people who will be evicted into homelessness because of the threat of Covid-19?  The Minister is dancing to the tune of greedy vulture funds and landlords who want the right to evict tenants on the grounds of sale, refurbishment and other ways to maximise the value of their property.  That is what this is about: putting profit of landlords and vulture funds ahead of people.<\/p>  <p>  I ask that the Minster please not give us the legal excuse.  All the public health agencies, including the World Health Organization, are warning of a second wave.  It is almost inevitable we will face further spikes in Covid-19 until there is a vaccine.  The emergency context that allowed the passage of this legislation in March continues.  The suggestion that somehow this is incompatible with the Constitution is nonsense and, frankly, it is unacceptable that an Attorney General who is himself a landlord would not recuse himself from giving advice on this issue.  We absolutely reject that contention.  To assist the Minister, today I will introduce the right to housing Bill which seeks to amend the Constitution to give greater powers in the area of housing to override private property provisions and ensure the common good by protecting people's right to secure and affordable housing, in case the Minister wants to use that excuse, which is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  We will seek to amend the Bill to ensure that the protections are retained, but we will vote against it because it is an absolutely disgraceful betrayal of tenants which will directly lead to a resurgence of evictions into homelessness of families and individuals who have done nothing wrong.

I do not know if he understands the fear and insecurity in the hearts of many families as the eviction ban is lifted from 10 August.  We believe this will open the floodgates for evictions.<\/p> <p>The language in the Bill makes it clear that the Government's chief concern is explaining that the measure is temporary and in response to an emergency but that the rights of private landlords must be protected at all times, and that this is only because of Covid-19 and for a short period.  It does not seem to understand the public health threat that exists.  What I picked up from the Minister's contribution was almost a smell of fear that the Government was daring to interfere with landlords' rights, and that it could not wait to effect an emergency measure that will not protect as many people as is claimed but, rather, only a minority of tenants.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party seems to think that the Government is making a mistake.  This is not a mistake.  The Government's priority is to get back to normal and look after its own class.  The landlord parties of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, with the Green Party again acting as a mudguard, are looking after their own.  I appeal to journalists out there to carry out the research and find out how many landlords are Members of the current D&aacute;il, like they did during the lifetime of the previous D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> From 10 August, landlords will be able evict away for reasons of renovation, change of use, wanting to use the home for a relative and, chiefly, the sale of the property.  Despite this, our Library and Research Service, Threshold, the Simon Communities and so on have shown that the main reason for evictions is not rent arrears but instead all of what I have just mentioned.  The Bill shows us we are not all in this together, by any manner or means.  Any Deputy who is a landlord - I make this as a public call - should abstain from the vote.  Just as Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out that the advice given to the Government by the Attorney General reflected a vested interest, any Deputy who is a landlord has a vested interest in voting for the Bill.  Such Deputies should abstain and absent themselves from the House.  It is inconceivable that they would allow what would be a tsunami of evictions to take place after 10 August.<\/p> <p> We are still in the middle of a pandemic, and the protection proposed in the amendment we have put to strengthen the Bill should still apply to those in rental rooms and casual licensees, such as the Travelling community in particular.  If arrears are not the main issue in the context of evictions, why is that the only issue being addressed in the Bill?  It is because the Government cannot wait to give the landlords and vulture funds the freedom they need.  It is just kicking the can down the road to January, even in respect of those in arrears.  The Bill assumes that people could do better by budgeting differently, so the Government refers them to MABS, etc.  It is a total insult.  No account is taken of the permanent loss of income that many people will suffer.<\/p> <p> We are back to normal, back to rent increases and people not being able to access rental accommodation because rents are too high.  As the kids return to school and the threat to public health remains, the Government is putting many families into a very fearful and unpredictable future.  The Bill is splitting the heads of people and giving them plasters for their fingers.  That is exactly what the Government is doing to renters and people who rely on private tenancies.<\/p> <p> I will probably make a pre-recorded message of the following and have to replay it time and again.  I appeal to the Green Party not to vote for the Bill.  It is not why people voted for them and it is not the sort of change they were elected on the promise of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800017#P00400","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595930400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The ban on evictions was introduced on 27 March and it worked.  It was a very effective policy.  At the end of March, 9,907 persons were in emergency accommodation in the State.  By the end of April, that had declined to 9,335.  By the end of May, it had fallen again to 8,867.  At the end of March, 3,300 children were living in emergency accommodation.  By the end of May, that was down to 2,787.  In the space of a mere two months, the overall numbers forced to live in emergency accommodation in the State declined by more than 1,000, the number of children forced to live in emergency accommodation declined by more than 500 and the overall numbers living in emergency accommodation were the lowest in the State in the course of three whole years.  I would go as far as to suggest that was actually the most successful Government housing policy in recent years, yet the Minister is scrapping it.<\/p> <p>I know he will stand up and say he is keeping protections for people whose incomes have been hit by Covid, those who are on the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment.  However, there is no doubt and no argument that many people who have protection today will not have protection in a couple of weeks when the blanket ban is ended.<\/p> <p> The Minister should not take my word for it.  Probably more than any other organisation in the State, Threshold is grappling with the problems facing tenants and the challenges of people facing evictions.  Threshold says of the Bill that the protections are \"too narrow\" and that the Bill \"will fail to protect many tenants who are at serious risk of homelessness.\"  Those who are offered the protections are asked to supply a written declaration that their income has been hit by Covid.  The Minister or I can write a written declaration, as can the majority of people.  However, there are many people in our society who will struggle to do that, many people who are immigrants and do not have the language, and more than one or two people who are functionally illiterate.  The Minister should check out the rates of functional illiteracy in the State.  They are very high by European standards.  The private rented sector is precisely the housing sector where we will find a lot of immigrants and people who do not have full literacy skills.<\/p> <p> Much of the focus of the debate has been on the question of banning evictions.  There needs to be more focus on the issue of rent increases.  The Irish Property Owners Association has put it up on its website that although until now landlords have not been able to increase rent during the course of the ban, that does not stop them organising rent reviews.  In other words, it is \"on your marks, ready, steady, go\" for rent increases as soon as the ban is lifted.  We can expect to see rent increases throughout the country in the month of August.  The Minister could have fought a court case instead of cowering in a craven fashion before the landlords and taking the advice of an Attorney General who is a landlord himself.  He could have gone before the courts and said a ban on evictions and rent increases is in the public interest.  He need only look at the figures I quoted earlier.  He would have had strong grounds for winning such a case in any court.  However, he backed down.  This is a backward step.  It is not for the public good.  It will result in notices to quit appearing on the scene again in the month of August and an increase in homelessness.  There are important amendments to this Bill and the debate is not going to finish today.  It will continue through the week and afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800018#Q00200","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595931000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>What we needed was a real extension of the evictions ban and rent controls to bring rents down, but that is not what we got.  This Bill is a triumph of spin over substance, with the Government getting headlines about extending the evictions ban while in reality the Bill slashes the rights of tenants and opens the floodgates of evictions by removing important protections for renters.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months we have seen a decline not just in Covid-19 but also in homelessness.  Now, due to mismanagement by the Government, we are at risk of a second wave of the virus and this Bill, if it is passed, will unleash a second wave of the housing crisis.  Against the advice of the homeless charities and the demands to extend the evictions ban and rent freeze, the Government wants to make it easier for landlords to kick tenants out.  Section 12 will allow landlords once again to evict someone simply so the landlord can get a higher sale price for the house.<\/p> <p>Tenants who have done nothing wrong, paid every bill and been good neighbours could be evicted simply because the landlord does not want to sell the property with tenants <i>in situ<\/i>unaffected, as is the norm across the world and for commercial property in Ireland.  Yet again, ordinary people have less right to safety and security than businesses.  There is little to stop landlords who want to evict someone for rent arrears caused by the coronavirus from using these other clauses to get rid of them.  It means that the Government is lying when it claims that the Bill will protect those in arrears due to Covid-19.<br\/><br\/>The Government has not included protections for those in high-risk categories.  Elderly people and those with underlying conditions could now face eviction.  How are they supposed to cocoon on the streets of Dublin or in homeless shelters?  Instead of the reintroduction of evictions, we should extend the evictions ban and rent freeze until at least the end of the year.  The past week has seen five deaths of homeless people on the streets of Dublin, five people failed by the Government and the State.  How many more must die on our streets before the Government realises that this, too, is a pandemic that requires emergency measures?<br\/><br\/>The evictions ban this year managed to reduce the number of people in homelessness and we saw emergency accommodation being taken over by the State to help get people off the street.  We have seen that where there is a will there is a way to end homelessness.  However, there is no will from the Government.  Deputy Hourigan, who negotiated the programme for Government, has said that the programme will make homelessness worse.  It is a Government of landlords and developers and it seems that mortgage holders, renters and the homeless are an afterthought.  We can cure the housing crisis, but it means having a left Government with socialist policies that is willing to take on the private landlords and developers, cut rents and build public housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800019#R00200","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595931300,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Deputy Verona Murphy has been called away for just a minute, so we will move to the Rural Independent Group.

I am sorry about all of that, a Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>  <p>  Since it has been done by another Deputy and as I always do, I wish to declare an interest in this sector.  It was stated that perhaps certain Members should not partake in today's vote if they were involved in or had an interest in the matter.  That means that, if there were an issue with agriculture in future, every Deputy who farmed or had land at home would not be able to participate in a vote and Deputies who were teachers could not partake in education debates.  That is totally ridiculous.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate what the Government is trying to do.  All Deputies present, be they in government or not, are contacted every day of the week by people with housing needs and who are facing urgent situations.  That is not a gift of a certain section of Members in this D&aacute;il who believe they are the only people standing up for tenants' rights.  We are 100% committed to ensuring that tenants have rights, but also that the people who own property have rights.  Property has been talked about this morning as if it falls out of the sky and lands in people's laps.  They are mortgage holders as well.  It does not fall out of the sky at all.  There are terribly good landlords who are doing their level best.  They run their properties like a business and in a professional way just like a person running a shop, farm or anything else does.  If they were not in that sector and doing the work they do, the State would not be able to take care of the housing needs of everyone in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to see people renting indefinitely.  That has been my belief all my life.  There is a certain period in people's lives where they might have to rent, but I would love to see young couples in particular in their own homes, be it by eventually getting a local authority house or by getting up on their feet with mortgages and front doors of their own.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>For everybody in life, there is a period of time, for example, starting out, perhaps even before they get married that people set up home together and they need to rent a property or they might need to rent because of work, to get their feet under them and realise where they want to finish up in life.  It is not as though renting is a bad thing, but the one thing that is being portrayed here all the time is as if the people who own these properties are bad people and they are doing some harm.  It is the exact opposite.  They are taxpayers.  Every penny that they get, they give half of it in tax.  The people on the left here seem to continuously knock this sector, but of course they knock every businessman and woman.  They knock people who create employment.  They knock them as if they are evil people.  What would the left rather they do - leave this country and go abroad and perhaps create jobs somewhere else and leave everybody here with nothing and pay no tax here in this country?  These are the points I want to make.<\/p> <p> I am acutely aware of the situation.  I thank the Government for bringing in the regulations whereby people could not be evicted if they lost their jobs during the pandemic.  I thank the previous Government and the present Government for what they are doing in that regard, but we have to remember that it does happen that people whose jobs were not affected and who did not lose any money due to the pandemic turned around and stopped paying rent.  That has happened.  I have been contacted by people who own property and who are not receiving rent.  They have to continue paying their mortgage.  They have to insure the property and maintain it and they might not be getting one penny for it while all of that is going on.  That is wrong.  I know of cases where people who have been getting rent allowance did not pay their rent.  One has to be balanced and fair on this entire issue.  I would like to make more points but the Chair is telling me my time is up.  I am sorry if I ate into anybody else's time.  I appreciate where the Government is coming from on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800020#S01000","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595931900,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I wish the new Minister well in his role.  No doubt there will be many challenges to overcome.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides for increased notice periods for notice of termination served on tenants in rent arrears in the residential rental sector during the emergency period and up to 10 January 2021.  It is an acknowledgement by the Government that many thousands of people, including families, will have been going through an extremely stressful time as the original end point for reviewing the existing moratorium approached.<\/p>  <p>  However, everyone is not confident the Bill goes far enough.  All of us here have received emails from the Simon Community outlining its concerns that the provisions of the Bill are complex and that more vulnerable tenants will require support to navigate the new provisions.  One step that could be taken, according to Simon, is the inclusion of a duty on a landlord serving a notice to quit based on arrears, to include in the notice the list of services such as rent supplement, HAP, MABS and the RTB, which may be available to the tenant in the case of difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  Such a notice should also include information on the right of tenants to make a declaration to the RTB under section 4(1) that they are a relevant person unable to pay rent.  These seem to be small but they are significant steps that can be taken to ensure the protection of the law is extended to the most vulnerable, who need it most.<\/p>  <p>  There is something profoundly concerning about the rationale behind this and similar Bills.  On the one hand, we accept that during a public health crisis people should be supported to remain in their accommodation, but the Government and others are saying out of the other side of their mouth that as soon as this crisis has passed, we can get back to a situation whereby the scales of power are once more disproportionately stacked against the tenant.  That is not tolerable or fair.<\/p>  <p>  This is more of a legal than a political problem that we will need to address in the longer term, probably through a constitutional amendment.  In the meantime, other measures can be taken outside of the kind of emergency powers we are debating.  In my constituency of Laois-Offaly, for example, I have been calling for an extension of the RPZs.  In April, I welcomed the long-overdue designation of Tullamore as a rent pressure zone.  This followed the nationwide rent freeze that came into effect under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act in March.  The designation of Tullamore as an RPZ did provide some support and financial certainty to tenants but only in the medium term.  What is needed in Tullamore, as in every other town in the country, is social and affordable housing schemes for people who are unable to access mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  The designation of Tullamore as an RPZ was badly needed because at that time the figures from the RTB's rent index showed an increase of almost 10% in Laois and an increase of almost 6% in Offaly in the period from 2018 to 2019.  This meant that many of my constituents in Tullamore and Edenderry were paying &euro;1,000 in rent every month before the current crisis.  That was unsustainable for many families and young couples and it was leading to people being forced into homelessness.  Today, I ask the Minister to consider including Edenderry, another large town in north Offaly, in a revised list of RPZs.  Could he also indicate when the list is likely to be drawn up?<\/p>  <p>  We need to put in place a regulatory regime that is genuinely capable of responding to the rent and arrears pressures that tenants face without the threat of homelessness or eviction hanging over them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800021#T00200","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1595931900,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire.  I wish the Minister the very best.  I know how hard he worked on the housing committee.  He had some great ideas and I hope his officials will work with him and allow him to bring those ideas to fruition.<\/p>  <p>  I wish there was a Utopia.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae alluded to the view of the left that all landlords are demons, evil and bad, they plucked a property, which fell from the sky, and they make maximum profits from it, pay no tax on it and mistreat their tenants.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We need a healthy balance of people who are willing to invest, buy properties, put them out for rent and look after their tenants, and we need good tenants as well.  There are thousands in both categories.  It is very important to put that on the record.  However, we need legislation and, therefore, I welcome the Bill.  I supported the introduction of the freeze on evictions in March when the emergency period started.  I am concerned, however, that the hassle and evictions did not stop for tenants of commercial properties.  Neither did the court procedures or the vultures stop there, including the intimidation of people and eviction of families because they got in trouble with loans on their commercial properties.  That has happened in Dublin city and elsewhere and it is a very regressive trend.<\/p>  <p>  There will always be people who will abuse the good intentions and goodwill behind legislation, including this Bill.  We have situations where landlords are tormented by tenants, who cause significant levels of anti-social behaviour, throw parties, deal in drugs, commit theft and torment and abuse their neighbours.  We have seen examples of that.  We have seen huge parties of young people.  I am a supporter of young people.  I have young people in my own family.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  There were instances in Cork where a solicitor and another neighbour had to go to court to stop the parties.  That is not fair.  The neighbours have been subjected to appalling treatment.  The landlords try to deal with the issue by removing the tenant.  The Garda have been involved and recommended eviction but the landlord's hands were tied and he could not do anything about it.  Those situations are intolerable and we must address them as well in order that there is a balance and fair play.  The tenants are giving two fingers to everybody and nothing can be done with them because of the moratorium and the so-called Covid pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  I also know of cases where tenants have simply stopped paying rent and abused the current situation.  I accept that is a minority, perhaps even a tiny minority, but a heinous one.  Landlords must pay their debts, taxes and everything else.  In some cases, tenants have continued to refuse to pay their rent and have refused to vacate the property.  I refer to cases where tenants have suffered no loss of income due to the pandemic, but where people have suffered the loss of income, wages and everything else, they must be supported.<\/p> <p>This Bill is probably weak in some ways.  Like all the legislation we have had in the present climate, it is too rushed.  We have not had pre-legislative scrutiny and we have not had proper time to debate it.  Rushed legislation can often be bad legislation.  I appeal to the Minister, who has plenty of common sense, to use it and to use his experience as well.  It is very hard to create legislation that covers every aspect of every situation, but we need to protect and support decent tenants, and as I said, the vast majority of tenants are decent.  We also need to protect and support good landlords because without them the housing crisis would be far worse.  Over the past ten years the building programme from the State was non-existent, so without the landlords we would have had nothing.  We need a balance of the two.  I suppose two roads shall turn, whether right, left or whatever, but we need good, solid legislation that protects good tenants and supports landlords as well.<\/p> <p> I wish the Minister well; I will work with him.  However, the problem with this is we will go into recess on Thursday, and if anything crops up, we will have no opportunity to address it until the autumn, which is a long time to wait.  The provisions on evictions and rogue landlords have been stuck in the mud since March and are now going to be stuck until December or early January.  That is not good.  I welcome this Bill.  There are good aspects to it I want to support and there are bits of it I cannot.  Overall it is an effort by the Minister to bring his stamp to his Department.  It is rushed because of the situation we are in but I wish the Minister luck with it and want to support him.  Legislation that is for the greater good, for the greater number of people, is what we want and we should always be moving forward in that vein.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800021#T00300","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595932500,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the chance to talk about this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister and look forward to working with him.  Knowing the approachable kind of man he is, we are at least going to be able to consult him and he will listen to us.  The most important thing is that he listens to the voices of Deputies when we are relating the concerns of the constituents we represent.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the extension of time provided for in the Bill.  I must also declare that I am a connected person.  I do not rent properties myself but I am connected to a man who is renting houses.  On a point that was brought up earlier, I would be very concerned if this Bill in any way allowed vulture funds to evict people out of their houses.  I hope there is nothing in the Bill to facilitate those kinds of people.  Security of tenure is most important to tenants.  In these troubled times when people cannot pay their way, pay all the bills and make ends meet because of losing jobs due to the dreadful virus we are still enduring, we have to extend the time.  We have to protect the good tenants and the good landlords.  If we do not protect the landlords, we are going to have greater demand on fewer houses.  I know that many landlords are pulling out now.  The one thing they keep mentioning to me is the cost of the tax.  If they get &euro;1,000 a month for a house, they have to pay back &euro;500 in tax.  That is a serious matter.  If the Government could do something with the tax take it is getting from landlords, we could help to reduce the price of the houses for the tenants.<\/p>  <p>  Availability of houses in places like Killarney, Kenmare and Dingle in Kerry is scarce at present.  The local authorities for one reason or another are building a few houses now but it is not really enough.  We would have more council houses only there are so many voids and they do not have funding to repair them.  Before, we used to have the tenant purchase scheme.  When tenants got on their feet and had the funding or could go the route of buying the house, the council got that money and used it to repair vacant houses so that people could be put into them or they could be rented to people who were on the list.  I appeal to the Minister to bring forward the tenant purchase scheme to allow county councils acquire the funding to make voids fit to live in again.<\/p>  <p>  The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is not appealing to many landlords.  It is the option that the local authority gives so many tenants.  Families with three and four children have nowhere else to go.  The HAP scheme is just a hames.  The tenant has to pay so much to the landlord and so much to the local authority.  Then the local authority has to pay the landlord. It is such a rigmarole it takes three or four months to get a family housed.  I appeal to the Minister to get rid of that scheme and bring forward an ordinary long-term lease or even a short-term lease if a landlord will only rent a property for a couple of years.  I will talk more when I get another opportunity because there are certain things that can be done.

In the first instance, I would like to stress that the rental market in Ireland is a critical component of the housing market.  There are people living in private rented accommodation who do not wish to be there.  They are obliged to rent as there is no alternative.  There are individuals who are eligible for social housing who are in private rented accommodation temporarily while they wait for social housing to be provided.  There are others who do not qualify for social housing, who are earning significant money and are in private rented accommodation but have no capacity to save the deposits required to allow them to purchase their own homes.  Successive Governments over many years have failed to address this issue.  I sincerely hope that I am right in giving the Minister and the new Government the benefit of the doubt and that they will implement a housing plan that delivers the social, affordable and private housing required to avoid legislation of this nature.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that where tenants are in extreme difficulty, they should be offered social housing.  It should be facilitated immediately, keeping them from the peril of homelessness.  This would do away with landlords having to litigate with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and clogging up the courts, and in so doing would take the landlord out of peril in respect of financial institutions.  In the general spirit of a normal letting, this legislation would seem unnecessary, but as we are not in normal times, it is understandable that such legislation is required.  In most instances, it is accepted that it is required.  However, it will not be without its problems and instances of exploitation.  I welcome the fact that it is more specific and targeted than much of the legislation of late.<\/p>  <p>  What is not understandable, however, is that prior to Covid-19 it was evident that the RTB was broken.  It is not working.  For the majority of landlords and tenants being compliant is not an issue.  They acknowledge and respect compliance and want transparency.  Landlords, indeed, believe that landlords need to be held responsible.  For many, their reputation is important to them.  In the same way, tenants respect their rented accommodation as they would if they owned it but often endure tenant neighbours who do not wish to live in harmony.<\/p> <p>Many good people, tenants and landlords, do what they are supposed to do and make a call if there is a problem or simply call in.  I have even known landlords to drop in for tea and treat tenants as they would family and so on.  They are not all rogues or faceless corporations.<br\/><br\/>I want to raise an issue which if not addressed may well see the rental market only contain faceless corporations.  I want to address the issue of the significant inequity of timelines in cases dealt with by the RTB.  I have constant complaints that cases take an inordinate amount of time, whatever the issue, be it on behalf of the landlord or tenant.  Decisions made by the RTB are regarded as ridiculous and it appears that court orders are unenforceable because of a wording issue.  I believe the Minister is already aware of this issue.  As a public representative I find it impossible to get in touch with the RTB and I will be writing to the Minister in this regard as it is extremely frustrating for many constituents in Wexford.<br\/><br\/>I have constituents in abundance who have raised queries about the delay by the RTB in hearing cases being told an adjudicator is unavailable.  Some have raised issues about equity and impartiality.  There needs to be a register of tenants and landlords who breach or default on contractual obligations.  There must be mandatory disclosure of a conviction for antisocial behaviour by a prospective tenant to a landlord.  Details and findings of all RTB mediations or hearings should be published, with the <i>in camera<\/i>rule applied to protect identities, to allow transparency and consistency.  There must be a timelined and streamlined approach and where the RTB is inordinately causing the delay there must be a compensation fund that deals with this issue for the aggrieved party.  We need landlords in the property market as much as we need housing.  I remind the Minister we do not have institutional landlords in the regions or rural Ireland.  Many depend greatly on small private landlords as they are the only landlords that exist for Wexford constituents and those in other small rural and regional towns.<br\/><br\/>I hope it is the Minister's intention to secure a compensation fund for those disproportionately affected by the legislation.  Remember that in March 2020 the initial moratorium was aligned with the forbearance of the main banks and financial institutions but this is not the case now and many buy-to-let and small private landlords will be affected and will need assistance.  The legislation is necessary but I call on the Minister to consider its gravity and, as a minimum gesture, set up a task force as a matter of urgency to conduct a complete review of the RTB and ensure equity for all concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800022#U00400","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595933100,"counter":61,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht.

I have gone through the Bill and once again I thank the Oireachtas Library &amp;amp; Research Service, which does an excellent job in educating Deputies.  I come from Galway city and I have repeatedly put on the record that housing there is equally bad if not worse than in Dublin.  I will deal with the Bill in a second but I need to put it in context.  COPE is an organisation that deals with homelessness in Galway.  In 2019, 1,622 people availed of homeless services in Galway.  I am waiting on a text to confirm whether my memory is correct regarding somebody who came into my office who was on the waiting list for more than ten years and has been going from bed and breakfast to bed and breakfast for almost two years with a young family.  Of the 1,622 people, 1189 are adults and 433 are children.  I could go through the statistics.<\/p>  <p>  Osterley Lodge caters for women who are homeless.  According to a report by COPE, one woman said before she arrived at Osterley Lodge she had been sofa surfing for 18 months and that she had been in Osterley Lodge for 11 months and finding accommodation in Galway city was near impossible.  The report also states domestic abuse is an epidemic and one in five women in Ireland will fall victim to this crime at some stage of their lives.  They are not counted in the homeless figures.  This is the context in Galway city.  It is difficult to get the exact figures.  The Minister knows that since Fine Gael and the Labour Party introduced the housing assistance payment scheme in 2013 and 2014 anybody who falls under it comes off the waiting list.  From my long experience as a local councillor, and I have kept in touch with the issue, anything up to 12,000 or 13,000 people are on a waiting list in Galway for a public house.  We have a serious crisis in addition to the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  What the Minister is doing will provide extra protection for some tenants, which I welcome, but in the guise of extra protection for some tenants he is withdrawing protection for other tenants and this is simply unacceptable.  There is no recognition of the pandemic.  There is no recognition of the housing crisis or having a home as of right.  I would have thought that particularly Fianna F&aacute;il, and I have great respect for it with regard to public housing, might get in touch with its roots and realise the housing crisis cannot be solved without an absolute commitment to public housing on public land as an integral part of its plans.  Tenants and, quite clearly, landlords deserve to be treated with respect and properly under the law.  I have no difficulty acknowledging that we need landlords but we need the State as the primary landlord to send out a message to the market that a home is not a commodity.  A home is something that is the most basic fundamental right that should be enshrined in our Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking of the Constitution, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael misused the Constitution to justify their action because the Constitution also acknowledges that the common good is an extremely important objective to serve.  The Minister is not serving the common good by increasing the number of evictions among the tenants he is not protecting.  He is not serving the common good by relying on the market to provide homes.  This is not serving the common good.  In my humble opinion I have no doubt there would be no constitutional problem if the Minister sought to enshrine a home as a basic human right in our Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the extension of the notification period for all tenants to 90 days in the Bill.  The Bill is very short and it appears that what the Minister is really doing is limiting the scope of the moratorium and the scope of the rent freeze.  Quite clearly, a house in Galway cannot be got at the levels set under the housing assistance payment.  It is just not possible.  We used to have under the counter payments are now we have over the counter payments.  As the Minister well knows, families or individuals in receipt of the housing assistance payment get money that is capped and they must come up with money out of their own pockets.  What the housing assistance payment is doing, and I have said this so many times, is backing up private market rents to a level that are simply not affordable for anyone.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is an opportunity to look at putting this in context rather than limiting evictions and the rent freeze in a time when we have a serious housing crisis.  Many organisations have spoken out.  The Simon Community has spoken out and while it was positive, as I am myself, with regard to some aspects of the Bill, it points out that it does not believe the Bill provides the required level of protection to vulnerable renters.  It also states the Bill will not protect those tenants who could be made homeless because the landlords require the properties for their own use or wish to sell the properties.<\/p>  <p>  No more than the debacle at Dublin Airport and the unacceptable divisive approach of the Government in singling out people on the pandemic universal payment or the jobseeker's payment, it is doing the exact same here with our housing problem.<\/p> <p>We have the hims and hers and the landlords on that side and we Deputies on the left ostensibly complaining.  That is not part of my philosophy.  We need landlords and we must protect them properly, but we also need absolute protection for our tenants.  The rights of landlords and tenants must be enumerated in a constitutional framework where the right to a home is protected.  Protections should follow from that, with the Government right in the middle of the market, i l&aacute;r an aonaigh, ag cur in i&uacute;l do na tion&oacute;nta&iacute; agus do na tiarna&iacute; tal&uacute;n go bhfuil s&eacute; d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; tith&iacute;ochta agus gurb &eacute; an chloch is m&oacute; ar a phaidr&iacute;n teach a shol&aacute;thar do dhaoine ionas go mbeidh siad in ann p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh i gc&oacute;ras daonlathach.<\/p> <p> I will not use all of my time.  I will finish, but I appeal to Deputy Darragh O'Brien as a new Minister.  Many mistakes have been made, including the debacle at the airport and the divisive approach.  Let us stop this and unite on what is important.  Providing a home as the most basic and fundamental requirement is an essential.  Let us lead.  Let the Taoiseach and the Green Party lead.  The Government has its moment and we will support it.  Recognise that there is a crisis as we did with climate change so that actions can follow from that, not just a tinkering with the market or a charity approach.  It is a basic human right.  We all need homes so that we can participate in society.<\/p> <p> In that context, I have serious difficulties with what the Minister is doing in this Bill.  Although it will do one or two good things, it will actually reduce protections for tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800023#V00200","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595933700,"counter":63,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l an Teachta Fitzmaurice i l&aacute;thair.

He has certainly hit the ground running.  Housing was a major issue in the general election and there is much work to be done, to say the least.  I wish the Minister and the Minister of State every success in their endeavours for all our sakes.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to give the Bill a broad welcome.  It freezes rents and allows for an eviction moratorium in respect of tenants affected by Covid-19 up to 10 January 2021.  It is important that current protections be put on a sound legal basis, which is what the Bill proposes to do.  It will also provide new long-term protections for tenants separate to the measures connected with Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  Concern has been expressed about the position of those renters who do not qualify for these new legal protections.  Is it the case that these non-Covid cases, as it were, now face the possibility of having their rents increased?  Any clarification from the Minister would be most welcome.<\/p>  <p>  What is the position regarding the eviction of tenants engaged in anti-social behaviour?  It is my understanding that, under the current arrangements, a tenant engaging in anti-social behaviour cannot be served with a notice of termination but must continue to pay rent and observe the other normal terms and conditions of his or her lease during the emergency period.  What is the position under the Bill regarding the eviction of tenants who are clearly engaged in anti-social behaviour?  I would welcome some clarification.<\/p>  <p>  I will briefly mention the provisions under the strategic housing development, SHD, measures.  The Minister told the D&aacute;il last week that they would not be renewed after 31 December 2021.  That is good.  In my constituency, a number of planning permissions were given under those provisions for large-scale, high-density, multistorey, build-to-rent apartment developments.  I have in mind places like Coolock village, Howth village, Clarehall and areas generally on the city's northern fringe.  Sustainable development and local democracy were thrown out the window.  New residential guidelines issued by the then Minister facilitated that.  Development plans were overridden and the need for mixed tenure schemes was ignored.  The sooner we get back to sustainable planning for housing, the better.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to deal with the issue of affordable housing.  The programme for Government places it at the heart of the housing system, which is as it should be.  Sooner rather than later, we need to see the construction of affordable houses and the putting in place without delay of a practical and affordable housing scheme under which people know where they stand and can make applications.<\/p>  <p>  In my area, there are 200 affordable houses planned for Oscar Traynor Road in Santry and 300 affordable houses planned for the former lands of the Oblate Fathers in Belcamp.  These houses must still be constructed, but we need an affordable housing scheme under which people can apply to get them.  The possibility of constructing housing on Oscar Traynor Road has been ongoing for years.  It has been held up all over the place in the Department and Dublin City Council.  There is talk of appointing a preferred bidder, but planning permission is still required for their construction.  A housing scheme for the site was first proposed in 1991.  How long ago is that?  Will the Minister and the Minister of State please get the lead out, pursue this particular scheme and remove any administrative blockage and bureaucracy that is preventing the houses' construction?<\/p>  <p>  We need to get the cost rental scheme up and running.  In my area, there are plans for 100 cost rental units at Cromcastle in Coolock.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to address the issue of social housing.  I welcome the commitment to build 50,000 new social housing units over the next five years.  Our local authorities need to be central to this ambition.  Do they have the capacity, resources and expertise to set about building and constructing social housing like we did down through the decades?  Local authorities need to start building social housing again.  The approved housing bodies, AHBs, are doing a good job and form part of the overall policy of providing social housing, but local authorities need to be front and centre in meeting this objective.<\/p>  <p>  The Department needs to sanction proposed schemes much more quickly than it is doing currently.  Local authorities submitting schemes to the Department for approval seem to face inordinate delays in getting sanction for them.  I do not know what the problem is.  There seem to be inordinate levels of bureaucracy and red tape.  I know that the Minister dealt with this issue in opposition and is determined to cut out delays in sanctioning schemes because people are being left on waiting lists by such delays.<\/p>  <p>  We need to get people off the housing assistance payment, HAP.  I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to reduce the reliance on HAP as a social housing solution.  The HAP system has got out of control.  Landlords are making significant profits and people do not really have security.  If they are considered to be adequately housed under HAP, they go on a transfer list and that is the end of their social housing quests.  We need to reduce the reliance on HAP and build social and affordable housing.<\/p> <p> What is the position relating to local authorities buying up houses on the open market for social housing?  I have significant concerns about this.  Surely it freezes out young couples who are trying to buy houses as they cannot compete with local authorities.  In this regard, I draw attention to the Call for Housing 2020 campaign, a document produced by the Department.  It seems that a call has been made encouraging private homeowners to sell their houses to local authorities.  Surely this will cause a problem.  Surely we should build social housing rather than buying up private houses to use.  Young people are being frozen out of the market and cannot afford compete for housing, dear enough as it is.  There is, it seems, no affordable housing scheme in place.  I would like clarification on that.  I hope I have not misread the call for housing document.  It is misguided.  People should not be selling houses to local authorities.  This call should not be put out.  It might be part of the solution but I would not like it to be seen as the total solution.  I would welcome the Minister's view on that. <\/p> <p> Generally, I welcome the commitments on housing in the programme for Government.  Housing was a huge issue in the general election and people expect results.  The Minister has done a lot of work in his first month in office to get the ball rolling on the various issues.  We must build social housing and fulfil the 50,000 unit commitment over the lifetime of the Government.  We need to build affordable housing and put an affordable housing scheme in place.  These extremely important measures must be undertaken without delay.<\/p> <p> The Bill affords protections to renters and tenants during the Covid-19 emergency and sets out the criteria to be met to qualify for these protections.  I worry about other renters who do not qualify for the Covid-19 protections.  I hope sufficient protections are in place for them.  Their case also needs to be heard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800024#W00300","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595934300,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister well in his new role.  We have very challenging times ahead.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the extension of the rent freeze and ban on evictions, we need to take time to future-proof the rental sector.  We need to take a long-term view of what criteria are used to evict tenants.  We also need to encourage small landlords back into the system and protect vulnerable tenants.  Some accidental landlords may now need to move back into their rental property because they may have lost work due to Covid-19.  We must take a more robust approach to ensure no landlord is playing a dangerous game.  <\/p>  <p>  I am concerned that tenants must almost self-declare their dire situation to the Residential Tenancies Board.  What happens to the renter who does not have the wherewithal to do this, either through a lack of understanding or capacity?  Will the Department launch a public awareness campaign?  Will housing authorities write to every registered landlord, erect signage or engage in awareness?  How will this be communicated?  Timelines are also very important.  I am not sure the moving deadline is helpful.  We need a long-term strategy to provide certainty to everyone.<\/p>  <p>  In the previous Seanad, I introduced a Bill to set out new statutory deadlines for processing housing assistance payment applications and social housing support applications.  It would have halved the current social housing assessment times and set a three-week deadline for processing HAP applications.  This would have given applicants certainty and more confidence.  It was a technical Bill to address paperwork issues in housing applications that many constituents have complained about.   The Bill lapsed following the dissolution of the previous Government.  We need to look again at these kinds of short turnaround times for decisions.  More understanding is needed.  People tell me that their jobs are not secure and they are uncertain about their futures.  They are looking to go on the housing list.  I am very disappointed that the income threshold to qualify for local authority housing has not been increased for nearly ten years.  This is causing people to become homeless.  <\/p>  <p>  I am concerned that HAP is being used to solve certain problems while creating others.  Like a plaster placed on a broken bone, it does nothing to solve the crisis.  It is often used to keep families from becoming homeless but they are not securely housed as they are still at the mercy of private landlords.  We need to address this, especially for families with young children who need stability to lead full lives.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the certainty provided in the Bill, we need a longer plan.  I have spoken to so many families during the Covid crisis.  One's home is one's castle.  One woman rang me who was very upset.  She told me she knew she could not be evicted at that time but her husband had lost his job and she did not know if he would return to work.  She did not know what to do as she did not qualify for the housing list and had no help.  We must ensure that every case is examined on its individual merits.  There are genuine cases where people are not getting help.  No appeal mechanism is provided in respect of the qualification threshold for local authority housing.  In the case of someone whose income is &euro;20 over the threshold, I would not be able to make representations or ask to make an appeal on grounds such as the person's outgoings and need.  We need to put a procedure in place to deal with urgent cases.  While I understand that staff have been transferred to local authorities to deal with homelessness, which is important, the bigger picture is that every case and situation is different.  We come across cases that involve children and families who are very upset.<\/p>  <p>  I raised the issue of domestic violence with the Minister last week.  There has been a huge surge in domestic violence.  We need to ensure no family is left homeless.  We must be able to contact our local authorities to secure help for families and ensure they have a place to stay.  <\/p>  <p>  We also need to look at accommodation.  What kind of accommodation do the local authorities have?  We do not want families to be evicted or made homeless.  We must ensure that every child in the country has a home and no child is left with nowhere to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800025#X00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1595934300,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I will leave time at the end for the Minister to respond to my comments.  I congratulate him on his appointment as Minister with responsibility for housing.  It is a big portfolio but I know he brought great energy and enthusiasm to the role of Opposition spokesperson.  I agree with my colleague that he has hit the ground running.  I have no doubt that he has taken the bull by the horns in the Department to ensure delivery.  I also congratulate the Minster of State, Deputy Noonan, on his appointment to the Department.  His name is held in very high regard in Kilkenny County Council.<\/p>  <p>  We are discussing one of the most basic human rights, the right to have a roof over one's head and a house to call home.  This was one of the biggest issues, if not the biggest issue, of the last D&aacute;il.  I have no doubt the Minister will bring a new vision, energy and enthusiasm to housing but it is a massive ship to turn around.  Regardless of constituency, whether it is in an urban area such as in Dublin city and county or a rural area such as counties Cavan and Monaghan and north County Meath, the issue is the same.  People have been waiting years on housing lists for the all-important roof over their head and  place to call home.<\/p>  <p>  It is unacceptable in this day and age that people have to wait years for a home.  As my colleague, Deputy Murnane O'Connor, observed, sometimes a family's income is only &euro;20 over the threshold.  The threshold can put genuine cases out of kilter in terms of their entitlement to a council house or their ability to apply for one.  This issue will have to be addressed by the Minister in his time in the Department. <\/p> <p>The plan is very welcome and it is ambitious in its aim to deliver 50,000 social houses or homes over the lifetime of the Government.<\/p> <p> I have been a public representative for ten years.  Before my time as a public representative, I always looked around the county and could see where schemes were constantly popping up all over the place.  I would have said it was one of the most active parts of our local authority of Cavan County Council.  Over the period of ten years that I have been a public representative, however, those schemes seem to have slowed down somewhat.  There was perhaps a reluctance on the part of the local authority to be the driving force in house-building schemes.  Many housing authorities came on board to take up that mantle but, ultimately, that is the responsibility of our local authorities.<\/p> <p> I would love to see the housing sections within our local authorities going back to that all-important job of the delivery of homes.  I know they are making every effort with the resources available to them to find empty homes and to provide renting schemes such as the housing assistance payment, HAP, to get people out of their homeless or almost-homeless circumstances as a short-term measure.  Nevertheless, we really need to show vision, and we have always said the Government will be judged on its delivery.  I certainly hope we will not be found wanting when it comes to the delivery of the 50,000 social homes.<\/p> <p> The July stimulus package took account of that as part of its town and village renewal scheme.  I very much welcome that, particularly as someone who represents a rural constituency such as Cavan-Monaghan.  Many rural towns and villages throughout the constituency are dying on their feet.  One of greatest problems that businesses point to is the fact that no one lives in such towns and villages any more.  There was an effort from the previous Government to address this issue, but it is something that, as part of the town and village renewal scheme, we really need to reconsider.  There are many homes above empty shop units, of which there are also a great number.  What can we do to incentivise people to bring back footfall and capacity to our main streets?  It would have a knock-on effect on revitalising our towns and villages.<\/p> <p> The Minister might respond in the time remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800025#X00300","speaker":"1557","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595934900,"counter":69,"content":"<p>There is no facility for individual responses on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800026#Y00200","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1595934900,"counter":70,"content":"<p>There are many holes in the Bill - more than in a sieve.  What will leak out of this sieve is families into homelessness.  In my area of Dublin Mid-West, good tenants have entered homelessness through absolutely no fault of their own.  We need to protect families.  The ban on evictions, notices to quit and rent increases that was introduced last March protected families and led to a significant drop in the number of families becoming homeless.  Thanks to the ban, fewer children have had to move out of safe and secure homes into temporary accommodation, fewer children have been subjected to unstable bed and breakfast hotel accommodation, and fewer children have been forced to share one room with their parents and siblings.<\/p>  <p>  I have witnessed over the years the trauma that families experience when they receive a notice to quit, the fear that parents feel for their family's future and the fear that parents do their best to shield their children from.  Even with the best will in the world from parents, their children cannot but absorb these fears.  Once such children are forced into homelessness, they get on the not-so merry-go-round of trying to find suitable temporary accommodation.  Phone call after phone call, they are told there is no room at the inn, and phone call after phone call, parents see the spark of hope diminish in the eyes of their children.  If they do find temporary accommodation, it is exactly that - temporary - and they must repeat the same process of phone call after phone call, the next day and the day after that.  More hope is diminished in their children's eyes.  The long-term effects of child homelessness, unfortunately, will be felt by our society for many years to come.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will provide very limited protection from eviction and rent increases for renters.  Our much-appreciated front-line workers, who kept the State going during Covid-19 and are often in low-paid employment, could be in danger of becoming homeless on foot of any rent increases.  I include people working in retail who kept the shops open during Covid, the cleaners who kept our hospitals clean, the bin men who removed our waste, the security drivers who minded our business, the delivery drivers who delivered the much-needed protective personal equipment to the front line and many more low-paid workers.  If the Bill passes in its current form, it will see the removal of protection for renters.  This Fianna F&aacute;il Bill will make their circumstances even more precarious.  A round of applause in the Chamber will not keep a roof over their heads.<\/p>  <p>  It is more cost-effective for the Government to keep people in their homes than force them into homelessness.  Landlords will again be able to issue vacant-possession notices to quit or to implement such notices that were served before 27 March.  These notices have been the single greatest cause of family homelessness in recent years.  The 27 March ban on evictions resulted in a dramatic reduction in the numbers of families presenting as homeless.  Ending this ban will inevitably result in an increase in the number of families presenting as homeless.  It shows that the ban on evictions, rent increases and issuances of notices to quit is working and more families are staying in their homes as a result.  The ban on evictions should be extended to at least the end of 2020 and a three-year ban on rent increases should be introduced.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is another example of how out of touch Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are with the people they believe they represent.  The Minister should not take my word for it.  We have all received circulars from Threshold, the Simon Communities and many other organisations that have said the Bill is overly complex and that a simple extension of the current legislation to ban evictions, notices to quit and rent increases introduced would have been welcome.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have ignored these pleas.<\/p>  <p>  A few moments ago, I listened incredulously to the Minister's party colleague, Deputy Haughey, who asked him not to pursue the purchase of social housing from private homeowners.  This is another sign of how out of touch the Minister's party is.  We need to do everything possible to increase the social housing stock.  Deputy Haughey would be better off calling for real, affordable housing and an increase in the income threshold for social housing.  These are the solutions.<\/p>  <p>  As for the Green Party, this is not the change that people wanted or expected when they voted for it.  We all have an interest in saving the planet but I do not know what planet the Green Party is on, supporting the Bill.  I urge Deputies from the Green Party not to support it in its current form or, at the very least, not to enter the Chamber when the votes are called.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will require families to submit a written declaration to the landlord and the RTB to the effect that their income level has dropped or ceased due to Covid-19.  Many renters, particularly those with language, literacy or capacity issues, may not be able to engage with the written declaration process.  As a result, they could lose their entitlements to protections.  What the Bill will do, in essence, is remove safeguards put in place to stop families becoming homeless in the middle of a pandemic.  It will force more and more families into homelessness during this worldwide pandemic and that is an absolute scandal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800026#Y00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1595934900,"counter":71,"content":"<p>What I am about to say has all been said.  It is straightforward.  The Bill will fail to do what our Bill would have done, that is, to protect families, as my party colleague, Deputy Ward, stated.  We needed an extension of the legislation as it existed.  We needed to ensure there was a moratorium on all rent increases and that there would be no evictions, but we do not have that.<\/p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>We have a really complicated process whereby people who may have lost income have to make contact with their landlord and the Residential Tenancies Board.  This requires a certain skill set and it would be difficult for certain individuals to do.  We are talking about people who may have disabilities or mental health issues.  I do not think I am going off on too great a tangent in pointing out that, once again, we are seeing a composite of many failed services where they all meet together.  We are seeing the consequences of not having the mental health services, the residential beds and other services that are required in communities.  Those services are consistently and constantly reliant on NGOs, sometimes even when Government funding is going to them, to bridge the gaps that exist across the board.<br\/><br\/>The whole housing crisis comes down to the fact that we have failed to build a sufficient supply of housing.  I cannot help but think that previous Governments - the last Government in particular - thought at some point that they could just hold up the housing system and deal with it in the same way they dealt with the health service.  People would get the idea that dealing with health is a very difficult issue and it is not really possible to resolve it, but eventually we would get it all worked out.  That is what I believe happened in regard to housing.  The view was that the private system would kick into action at a certain point in time, the market would rectify everything and supply would meet demand.  That has not happened over many years and we have absolutely failed to address it.<br\/><br\/>I spoke last week in the Chamber about the fact there are 5,700 people on Louth County Council's housing list.  I noted that the number would probably be much higher except that income thresholds are very low and a huge number of people fall between stools.  The local authority in County Louth is consistently and constantly under pressure, even in respect of turning around re-lets and refurbishing its existing stock.  A lot of this is down to the requirement to service the cost associated with the council's land banks, which cost some &euro;1 million last year.  The council is currently considering proposals to increase the local property tax but that would raise an amount only sufficient to service the land banks it bought under instruction from previous Governments, including at the height of the Celtic tiger boom.  Some of those land banks are huge.  If this debt issue could be dealt with and if we had an imaginative approach to dealing with it from both the local authorities and from Departments - I am aware of a request for a meeting to discuss the matter - a real solution could be found in respect not only of social housing but also affordable housing and affordable cost rentals.  If we are to deal with this issue, that is where we have to get to.<br\/><br\/>The first thing we need is a three-year moratorium or ban on rent increases, as proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in in the Bill we put forward last week.  Our view on this will not be news to anybody.  It has been Sinn F&eacute;in policy for many years, as espoused by our spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  A moratorium is an absolute necessity and it is accepted as such by a huge number of people in our society.  Alongside that, we must seek to reform the whole rental situation.  I note that Threshold has spoken about how eventually, a complete ban on so-called renevictions will be needed, that is, where landlords claim they are either renovating or renting out to a family member for the purpose of getting rid of an existing tenant, who may then lapse into homelessness.  Threshold has proposed that the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for outlawing that practice would be the introduction of added protections for landlords which would, in effect, professionalise the entire sector.  In fairness, private landlords will claim they are at some degree of disadvantage versus the large hedge funds and so on that have bought huge numbers of apartments and houses and are able to make huge profits and operate on the basis of only paying corporate tax rates.  We need to deal with those issues.<br\/><br\/>Several speakers have referred to the need for local authority-led housing builds, particularly in the case of social housing.  We really need the Department to kick into play and give councils the capacity and resources required to do that.  Otherwise, everything we are hearing is empty talk.  There have been a number of successful social housing projects in recent times.  The Housing First initiative has enabled local authorities to provide protections to what we would term vulnerable tenants, who need an extra level of care and security.  Doing so provides several benefits.  It is of benefit to the whole community when housing is found for a person who may previously have caused problems in terms of how they reacted with the rest of the community.  Accommodating people in such circumstances also protects the local authority because it helps to avoid some of the situations that would have arisen, whether by people not taking care or sometimes through taking bad choices, which led to the destruction of local authority property.<br\/><br\/>Louth County Council has led the way in this regard and I would like to see the Housing First approach expanded and further resourced.  I am very happy to note that there is going to be a new family-orientated Housing First initiative.  I would like to know how quickly it will happen, because it is an absolute necessity.  We need to protect tenants and their rights and ensure we do not increase the numbers of people falling into homelessness.  We also need to protect communities from anti-social and anti-community behaviour.  An awful lot of the cases local authorities are dealing with involve families who may have multiple issues and problems with which the State has failed to assist them.  We leave it to their neighbours and other people who live in their community to deal with the outworkings of those problems.  We urgently need a heavily resourced, family-orientated Housing First initiative that will enable the local authority to deal with families and to engage with other services, whether Tusla, mental health services, the HSE or any other services that are required, to find a solution.  A harm-reduction approach is required that will benefit not only the family in question but also the wider community.<br\/><br\/>I have no doubt that a lot of the elected representatives in this Chamber, particularly those who previously worked as city and county councillors, have dealt with all of these issues in their own localities.  The really sad thing is that the local authorities were producing the same lists, detailing the same problems and, in some cases, the very same families, two, three or even 20 years ago.  We have absolutely failed to deal with those problems and have instead left it to communities to deal with the outworkings.  I do not want to be seen to be overly critical of local authorities.  First and foremost, some of these issues relate to other State services.  We need to have somebody who takes the lead in these matters and requisitions the required services from the relevant bodies, whether the HSE, Tusla or even schools.  This type of whole-of-service solution is absolutely required and it must happen before we can deal with the wider issue of the criminal actions that are occurring in some privately owned homes, privately rented homes and council houses.  Some of these cases relate directly to vulnerable people being put under pressure by nefarious and organised characters who are able to skirt around the edge of the law and will always have two or three people between them and the actual criminal act.<\/p> <p>We need to update all our laws and services and I would like to see a whole-of-government response to this.  When I refer to crime, I am specifically talking about the drugs epidemic with which we are dealing and the violence that goes with it.  It is happening in Drogheda, my town of Dundalk and in every village and town across this State, and it all needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p> That said, we are here to talk about this legislation.  I welcome the limited protections in the Bill, but they are too cumbersome for the people to whom they apply.  We have failed to deal with people who have now built up arrears.  We need to consider a 100% moratorium because we all know the RPZs are not preventing rent increases and we need to make it as difficult as possible for people to fall into homelessness.  We are currently putting pressure on local authorities to spend a significant amount getting people into inadequate emergency accommodation and we are not necessarily putting the money where it needs to be.  We are just wasting it.<\/p> <p> HAP, which was meant to be a short-term solution, has become the baseline for rents.  While we are all very glad of it as it gets people into necessary housing, it is the reason there are houses for rent in some local authority housing estates in Dundalk for upwards of &euro;1,400.  That is incredibly difficult for a family that cannot access HAP.  Not only is such a family up against people who can access HAP, though I am not taking away from its necessity, given the housing crisis we are in, it is also up against several young people who may be working in the likes of PayPal or some of the foreign direct investment, FDI, firms around Dundalk.  We are very glad to have those companies, but the people working in them have much more spending power than a regular family.  We need to ensure we can provide families with the supports and protections they need.  Unfortunately, this is another failure of the Government to take the required action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800026#Y00400","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595936100,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and look forward to working with him in the future.  During the Covid-19 pandemic, we have looked to Departments to show leadership and guidance to the public but they have not done so.  Clear and concise instructions need to be given and some parts of this Bill require clarification.  For example, tenants who have taken pay cuts across the board to keep their jobs and help keep our economy afloat face continued reductions in their salaries.  For some tenants, this has led to increased financial worries about rental payments and arrears.  This is a position in which many tenants find themselves.  The economy is not stable enough, at this point, to decide on what the new normal will be.  Tenants and landlords are in limbo and pinpointing a selective group in this Bill will not help flatten the curve of the rental situation we are facing.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone I have spoken to since being elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann talks about rural Ireland, because they see that rural Ireland has been forgotten.  We once thought there was only one border in Ireland, but now people say there are two.  They say that once one passes Naas one has gone over the border.  This has to stop.  I come from a construction background and have been in that sector all my life.  Before that, all my family came from the farming sector.  From being on the ground, I can see where the housing pitfalls in our society lie.  I served on Limerick City and County Council for six years and I tried to use my construction background and experience working with communities to highlight those pitfalls.  We have more voids in County Limerick than we have new houses.  Only 121 social houses were built in 2019.  The town of Askeaton has been waiting for a sewerage system for 30 years and they can no longer build there.  Oola is at capacity and they can no longer build there either.  Last week, I was in the town of Hospital, where 20 new houses are to be built, with a community group.  The capacity of the sewerage system is 15 houses, so they had to implement an on-site sewerage system to make it viable for a contractor to build the other five houses.  The capacity was not there.<\/p>  <p>  If we want to help the rental sector and have people living in rural areas, the biggest problem is infrastructure.  I have been saying that since I came into this House, and said it when I was on the council as well.  We need investment, we need to incentivise, and we need infrastructure.  There is no infrastructure in rural Ireland.  That is the bottom line.  There is nothing in any town or village one goes to.  They have not been invested in and are at capacity.  If someone wants to build a one-off house in rural Ireland, he or she has to pay massive fees to the county council.  Those fees include footpaths, water and road infrastructure.  There is none of that in rural Ireland, yet rural Ireland is being charged for it.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a massive number of voids in County Limerick, as well as across the country.  If the Government parties want to help, they should ask someone who has been involved in this sector all his life and I would tell them that planning restrictions are an issue.  Many buildings are being held up because of conservation.  We have iconic buildings that need to be protected, but townhouses are also being held up because the authorities want to protect the structures.  We can fix this with a small bit of common sense, by working with people and taking away all the bureaucratic bull that comes with planning.<\/p>  <p>  We need to get people into our towns and villages and into housing stock, but our county councils do not have the workforce to do that.  The failures of the previous Government have caused many of the problems we face today.  When the crash came in 2008, the then Government shoved everyone into education.  It focused on education, education, education.  It sent everyone to school and it forgot about the trades.  All the F&Aacute;S courses and everything else closed down and everyone was shoved into education.  Education does not build houses.  We need trades.  We are now ten years behind on trades and we are trying to do these rapid builds.  We do not have enough people in the trades because they were stopped for years.  We need to incentivise them.  A law came in which made contractors liable for apprenticeships while their apprentices were in college.  Small contractors in rural Ireland were being punished because they had to pay people while they were in college when they used to be paid by the State.  Similarly, student nurses are not being paid while they are in college and they should be.  Apprentices are only paid by the State if they have been in receipt of a social welfare payment for 12 months prior.  <\/p> <p>Young people who want a trade are being forced to go on the live register when they leave school at the age of 18 in order that they will be covered while they are in college learning a trade.  That does not make sense.  <\/p> <p> The whole system is wrong.  We can fix the rental system by being constructive.  We can help all landlords and tenants if we are constructive.  Households of two people who were working and had their wages reduced are now in financial difficulty.  They would be better off if they were not working because they would qualify for everything.  People working in this country are the worst off because they qualify for nothing.  Those with incomes marginally above the thresholds do not qualify for a medical card or the housing assistance payment, HAP, and go from pillar to post trying to pay bills.  <\/p> <p> The majority of the people leaving the country during this pandemic are not working, yet they can take a foreign holiday.  The people who are working can hardly pay their rent and are falling into arrears because they are working.  This has to change.  Certain landlords are bad and certain tenants are equally bad, but we also have some excellent landlords and tenants who are working with one another.  Some landlords are renting out a house that was left to them and on which they have a mortgage to pay.  When the tenant cannot pay the rent and falls into arrears, the house is at risk of being taken by the vulture funds and the banks.  <\/p> <p> We need to step in, reward good tenants and landlords and put measures in place to protect them.  There is nothing to protect the people trying their best.  Restrictions are needed for the bad landlords and tenants.  Checks can be done to see how good people are in their properties and how well they respect their properties.  We need a workforce in the councils who will rebuild the voids.  We can fast-track this process because every void in a town or village is connected to a sewer line and recorded in the database on capacity for that sewer line.  Let us bypass the bureaucratic bull and accept that conservation rules need to be relaxed for certain properties.  While we should keep the front facade, roof structure and streetscape, we should allow the modernisation of the rest of the building so we can move people in.  These idle voids are already registered on the ESB, sewer and water systems and included in the data.<\/p> <p> We cannot build in rural Ireland because there is no infrastructure.  There are no sewerage plants and no investment.  We hear talk about building houses but that will not work, apart from in cities.  People in rural Ireland are sick and tired of paying large fees to councils for footpaths and roads that never materialise.  We are being punished again.  We are made to pay double and triple for everything we do in rural Ireland, whether that is for a septic tank or percolation test.  The housing system is being made harder and harder for people in rural Ireland who are being made to pay three and four times more than people living in the cities.  <\/p> <p> We need investment in rural towns and villages and our infrastructure.  The Minister can do this and I believe he will listen.  The little bit we learn after the bit we know is the bit that counts, and nobody knows everything.  I am willing to give every bit of advice I can to the Minister on infrastructure.  I am willing to help him in whatever way I can so we can get people housed in Limerick and get others back into our villages.  Village can be self-contained and can provide a system for rebuilding our communities in rural Ireland.  I look forward to the Minister helping us and I will give him whatever help I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800028#AA00200","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595936700,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Having missed my original slot, I thank the Acting Chairman for accommodating me.  I extend heartfelt congratulations to the Minister on his new position.  I know why he sought this portfolio.  He deeply desires to sort out the housing crisis.  That is his agenda and I appreciate that.  The initial soundings and messages from the Minister and his approach in his first couple of weeks in office lead me to commend him.  He is grabbing the bull by the horns and getting to the bottom of our housing crisis.<\/p><p>It is no harm, however, to remind the Minister that the rent pressure being experienced by renters is not exclusive to Dublin and the urban areas.  The Minister is aware of this issue.  I will highlight to him the experiences of renters, people on social housing lists and those seeking to purchase a property for the first time in my constituency of Cork South-West.  I recently conducted a search on <i><\/i>for the area where I am from, Clonakilty town, and the result showed two or three properties for rent.  The position now is really tough.  I am lucky to be renting in Clonakilty.  I have been in that position for a couple of years.  If I was looking for a new rental property in Clonakilty or anywhere else in west Cork, it would be tough because the properties simply are not available.  There is a chronic shortage of supply and that is the crux of the issue we are facing, especially in my region.<\/p><p>People can forget about searching <i><\/i>or any of the other similar websites for a property to purchase.  Prices in west Cork are astronomical.  For people of my generation, on middle to low incomes, and even above that, most of these properties are completely out of their range.  I know the Minister is aware of this because in his contributions so far, and in his approach, he has acknowledged the challenges that people are facing. <\/p><p>There are solutions, however, and I have spoken to the Minister about some of those already.  One example, to which most speakers have referred, is the use of over-the-shop premises.  I discussed this already with the Minister.  It is a challenge.  We have spoken about voids.  I imagine that over-the-shop premises account for many of the existing voids.  We need to get these premises back into use as social housing and on the housing market.  In my area at least, the repair to lease scheme has not been successful.  Unfortunately, property owners are not availing of it.  I am not sure if that is because of the hassle of the works required to bring properties up to habitable condition, but the scheme is not working and people are not availing of it.  We need to look at other options.  <\/p><p>I would love to see a portion of these over-the-shop premises being brought into use as local authority or social housing.  That is difficult, however, because under current legislation, as I understand it, it is almost impossible to separate the ground floor retail unit, caf&eacute;, restaurant or whatever from the area above the ground floor.  We are, therefore, at an impasse.  We should introduce legislation that would allow local authorities or housing bodies to acquire the over-the-shop premises, while allowing the property owner of the downstairs unit, which may be a profitable business, to carry on.  That would be a way of bringing these over-the-shop premises back into use.  They are not habitable at the moment.  There are empty units on every high street in the country, not just in Cork South-West.  This approach would be a way of getting these properties filled.  This would have major benefits.  There is the obvious fact that housing would be provided for people where there is a chronic shortage of supply.  <\/p> <p>When we talk about social housing, everyone here, including the Minister, knows that a large proportion of those on social housing waiting lists are single people who may be elderly or a single parent.  Those are the types of people who would be perfectly suited to an over-the-shop premises with a one or two-bedroom apartment.  That is a viable solution and if the will is there, we can find a way to do it.<\/p> <p> The second benefit is that when an over-the-shop premises is filled, it automatically creates much needed footfall on the high street.  People walk down the steps from their apartments and walk into cafes, restaurants, newsagents and butcher shops.  It would create a ready footfall for the high street and the economic benefits would be massive within a town.  I would love to see that explored further.  I know it is an issue that the Minister is aware of and for which he is looking to come up with a plan.  Legislation that would allow the units to be disposed of separately would go a long way to sorting out that issue.<\/p> <p> Another issue is the chronic lack of wastewater infrastructure in our towns and villages, which is stifling and stalling the supply of housing.  Ballineen and Enniskean in west Cork are perfect examples.  In the past couple of years, small, low density developments of 20 to 30 houses have been refused planning permission because the wastewater treatment infrastructure is not in place.  That is happening throughout the country and needs to be solved.  There needs to be investment in Irish Water.  We may need to consider viable developer-led solutions to wastewater treatment that will not become a liability on local authorities or Irish Water down the line.  Something needs to be done because myriad housing developments have been stalled for that reason.  It is not only developers that are being affected because local authorities have also run into trouble in that regard.  Dunmanway, which is one of the biggest towns in my constituency, has encountered difficulties in developer-led developments and local authority and social housing initiatives.  Those kinds of issues can be overcome and we cannot let them get in the way of the provision of social and affordable housing, and housing that is available on the private market.  I urge the Minister to take action in that regard.<\/p> <p> We need to build public housing.  He knows that and has repeatedly referred to the fact that we need to build public housing on public land.  I know that is a part of the programme for Government but we need it accelerated.  Social housing units will come online shortly in Clonakilty, Skibbereen and some other towns in my area.  That will, hopefully, ease the pressure but it needs to be done faster.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Minister's affordable housing scheme, which will alleviate pressures on low and middle income earners who cannot even think about purchasing a home at the moment.  I was encouraged by he said in the D&aacute;il on that matter last week.  I would love to see the Rebuilding Ireland home loan extended and streamlined.  It is a bit bureaucratic and a paperwork headache at the moment when one applies for the scheme.  Having said that, I know of single people and couples who have availed of it and it has changed their lives.  I would like an extension of the parameters of the scheme.<\/p> <p> I would also like changes to be made to the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  There are families who are having great difficulty with equity and mortgage repayments at the moment.  Those families are trying to avail of the scheme but fall outside its parameters at the moment.  I would like those parameters extended because we will see a lot of hardship unless that happens.<\/p> <p> I will conclude by saying let us get voids into the market and social housing stock.  Let us also get over-the-shop premises into social and affordable housing schemes and build public houses on public land.  I appreciate the Minister listening to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800029#BB00200","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595937300,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a couple of issues with the Minister specifically about housing and its impact on older people and those with disabilities in our communities.  I will give an example of how our social housing system has failed a gentleman I know, an absolute gent of the highest order.  This gentleman was on the housing waiting list for 20 years - that is two decades.  He had never been offered a property and had never refused one.  The only time he sought assistance was when the third-floor apartment in which he was living was no longer suitable for his needs because he needed a double knee replacement.  Unfortunately, stories such as this are common in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath.<\/p>  <p>  I know of another gentleman who, due to diabetes and an associated infection, lost a leg.  He is still living in a house that is not suitable for his needs, two and a half years after that operation.  This young man is known in the community as somebody who can be approached and relied upon when others are in need.  He now has a profound need that is not being met because of the lack of adequate social housing in our area.<\/p>  <p>  I also raise the example of a seven year old girl with profound disabilities.  Her mum is her full-time carer and her dad works in Dublin.  Because of her dad's income, the family is not eligible for a grant to install a downstairs bedroom and bathroom for their daughter who they love with all their hearts and want to look after in the family home for as long as possible.  However, if due consideration was given to the mortgage payments of this family, they would certainly meed the relevant threshold.<\/p>  <p>  Issues such as those I have mentioned are being faced throughout the country.  People are being failed, day in and day out, by policies that are not designed to support the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p>  <p>  I turn now to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  I spoke to a constituent the other day.  He is a young man who works full time with a wife who also works full time and they have two small children.  They made the decision to move house, as many families do throughout their lives.  They sold their property at the beginning of March and we all know what came a few weeks later.  They always knew that there would be a couple of weeks of overlap before their new property was ready to go, but their mortgage was pulled.  They spent one week living in Ballymahon, another living in Tallaght, in the homes of their respective in-laws, while both of them were travelling to work in Athlone.  Situations such as this must be taken into consideration and cannot be allowed to continue.  We want and need these types of people in constituencies like mine.<\/p>  <p>  There are fundamental flaws in the housing market.  When families apply for social housing, they do not write down the area in which they want to live, but rather an area where they think they are most likely to be offered a house.  That means that people are pulled away from our smaller towns and villages into larger areas, thereby increasing rural decline in little towns dotted around constituencies such as mine.<\/p>  <p>  I also raise the issue of people who are escaping domestic abuse.  Through the actions of others, such people and their children no longer feel safe in their homes.  No viable options exist at the moment for them.  There are not sufficient beds in refuge centres for people who believe that is the best course of action for them.  My opinion is the opposite of that, and that it is the perpetrator of the abuse who should leave the home.  What is to become of these people?  What steps will this Government take to ensure that those who are being victimised and brutalised in their own homes are not forced to stay in an environment like that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800030#CC00200","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1595937300,"counter":79,"content":"<p>As no one else wants to speak, I will go back to the Minister to wrap up the debate.

In some complexes, the wiring is poor and flats are flooding.  There are infestations of rats across flat complexes in Dublin city, something that would not be accepted anywhere else.

Gu&iacute;m &aacute;dh m&oacute;r uirthi.<\/p><p>I thank all of the contributors who brought forward their views on the Bill.  We will move to Committee Stage on Thursday and I want to give a commitment to Members that I and my officials will consider any amendments brought forward, and where they are reasonable, practical and can be introduced, we will certainly consider them very openly.<\/p><p>I am also conscious of the fact that the Government has only been <i>in situ<\/i>for four weeks and this is quite a detailed Bill.  We need to pass it and have its provisions up and running from 2 August.  The measures that currently pertain in this country are based on public health grounds.  They are, and always have been, emergency measures.  Like any Minister, I was always concerned about and responsible for matters in that regard.  Any protections that we afford to tenants and people in the private rented sector should be robust, durable and should endure.  Apart from a few on the extreme side of this debate, no one suggests the emergency measures could continue for an indeterminate length of time.  From my perspective, I and my Department had to consider how we can transition out of the emergency measures introduced on public health grounds to more permanent supports.<\/p><p>I will address some of the points raised.  There are effectively two parts to the Bill.  One is the Covid emergency protections and extending them to those who need them most until 10 January 2021.  That is very clear.  The Bill will have no effect on evictions or rent increases.  Evictions cannot be imposed on a large cohort of people and there cannot be rent increases.  It is perfectly right and proper that I, as Minister with responsibility for housing, together with the Government, do that.  There is no ambiguity about the measure.  It is not cumbersome.  It is in the Bill in black and white.<\/p><p>I have noted comments from some Members regarding issues with literacy and language.  We will deal with these issues.  In any case, where a declaration needs to be signed, assistance will be provided where required.  Language barriers or literacy levels will not be an impediment to enter into these protections.  I ask people who suggest otherwise to be a little bit responsible about what they say; there has been a small bit of scaremongering in that regard. <\/p><p>We are all well aware of the Citizens Information services across the country.  Deputies and other public representatives around the country also provide assistance.  The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, has now been brought into the tent to help with rent arrears.  These bodies will advise people on what they need to do.  They do not turn away people who have literacy issues, do not speak English or are the new Irish.  Some have had said protections will not be afforded to new Irish communities or people who have issues with literary, which is simply not true.  We will make sure that will not happen.  Others have raised this matter as a genuine issue and concern, and I take that in the spirit in which it has been raised.<\/p><p>The overriding priority for me as Minister with responsibility for housing, the Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and others is to provide more permanent housing solutions for individuals and families.  A core part of the programme for Government is the delivery of more public homes on public lands.  We will empower our local authorities to do even more of that and provide affordable housing for purchase and for rent for working people.<\/p><p>  The first meeting in my Department each week is with the homeless delivery unit, which is made up of stakeholders to whom other Deputies have referred and whom I thank for their interaction.  We meet at 8 a.m. every Monday morning to determine what we need to do in the short-term to tackle homelessness across this country and to protect the most vulnerable. <\/p><p>As Minister, and when I was an Opposition Deputy and spokesperson, I had the pleasure of visiting many outreach services across the city and beyond.  As I mentioned to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle outside the Chamber, I will move outside of Dublin during the month of August and visit regional towns and cities where I can meet our partners and people who do fantastic work in the area of homelessness.<\/p><p>I must mention the tragedy of the five homeless individuals who have died over the past week.  What has happened pains me and I want to pass on my deepest and sincerest condolences to the deceased and their families and friends at what is a really distressing time.  Many of these individuals have, unfortunately, complex and chaotic lives.  I know our homeless services engaged and worked with the individuals concerned.  What has happened is particularly distressing for those staff. <\/p><p>As Minister with responsibility for housing I feel very deeply about this issue.  I know from the people who work in the sector that it is something they feel deeply about and I, like, I am sure all of my colleagues, want to put on the record of the House my deepest sympathies for the families.  The interaction of health services with housing bodies presents a challenge.  One of the successes of the Covid emergency has been the interaction between health and housing authorities in dealing with the most vulnerable, namely, the homeless community.  I intend to keep that going. <\/p><p>I have met the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and there will be a formal bilateral meeting on housing and health to determine how we can keep the wraparound services provided to our homeless communities in place.  Homeless people have come out of cocooning with better health outcomes than when they went into homelessness services.  We need to make sure that the system is maintained.  The three parties in government have committed to that in the programme for Government.  We need a Government-wide response to homelessness that has health at its centre.  We will maintain that.<\/p><p>On the protections in the Bill, we had to be guided by legal advice.  There is no question about that.  Anyone who says otherwise is incorrect.  We must make sure that any measures we introduce are legal and constitutional and can be implemented.  I have examined the large cohort of people whose salaries and wages have been affected, who have lost their jobs or whose tenancies are protected by HAP, emergency rent supplement and other measures.  They will be protected in the Bill.<\/p><p>I want to deal with some of the matters raised by Threshold.  I welcome its engagement on the Bill.  It has been most helpful, and I will expand on that.  I am also being guided by what has been done in other jurisdictions and countries with regard to bans on evictions.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin will be aware that no eviction ban was brought forward in the North.  All the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister for Communities did in the North was to extend the notice period from four to 12 weeks.<\/p> <p>That was it.  It certainly pales into insignificance when one looks at the measures brought forward in the Oireachtas by all parties in March and is certainly greatly inferior to the legislation here in front of the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> I note and have read Sinn F&eacute;in's response to the housing and eviction ban and rent pause, which comprised a one-page piece of legislation that did not actually go to the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers.  It did not mention evictions or bans on evictions, but dealt specifically with rent freezes for a three-year period.  That is a one-page piece of legislation versus a robust Bill that deals not only with the current crisis and pandemic but also with measures that will endure into the future by way of the rent arrears procedures, which I will cover now.<\/p> <p> I am aware that the moratorium had a significant impact on presentations to homeless services.  Along with officials from my Department, I have been meeting the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, on a weekly basis throughout this crisis.  The DRHE has cited the moratorium and the reduction in family breakdowns as key contributors to the reduced level of presentations.  Local authorities across all regions, including the DRHE, are aware that the current moratorium cannot continue indefinitely and have been preparing for increased presentations when it expires.<\/p> <p> As Members know, the moratorium was extended on 27 June and again by me on 20 July, at which stage it was becoming apparent that the continuation of the protections in their current format was increasingly at variation with the relaxation of restrictions in wider society and in the economy.  Restrictions on estate agents were lifted in the second phase of relaxation and lettings of rental properties are now proceeding, underpinned by new operating procedures to prevent the spread of the virus.  This enables tenants to move on where accommodation is no longer required.  Many students returned home when universities closed, and landlords are now able to place properties back on the market in response to new demands from a range of sources, including prospective tenants who have returned from abroad.<\/p> <p> Conditions at the end of July are very different from conditions when they were introduced on 27 March.  That is why we are now introducing, as I have mentioned, a more targeted and focused Bill that is grounded in economic rather than public health considerations.  We extended the current moratorium until the end of this week to make sure the Bill has time to pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p> The new Bill aims to respond directly to the challenges presented by Covid-19 by targeting additional supports to those who are having difficulty paying rent because of loss of earnings as a result of the pandemic.  We know that sectors like retail and hospitality are among the worst hit by Covid-19 and that workers in these sectors are more likely to be in rented accommodation.  We know that other grounds for termination such as intent to sell, family use and renovation were sometimes used when the underlying issue may have been associated with rent arrears.  That is why we introduced the enforcement protections under Part 7A of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 relating to complaints, investigations and sanctions, which empowers the RTB to sanction landlords who evict tenants on grounds related to intent to sell, family use or substantial renovation when they fail to act in accordance with the ground cited.  We have resourced the RTB to enforce these provisions through increased funding from this Department.  The RTB is building up a team of 15 staff to enforce these tenancy protections and almost 200 investigations have been initiated since the unit was set up.  I am keeping a particularly close eye on this and will condemn anyone who uses these grounds of eviction erroneously.  They will be prosecuted.<\/p> <p> The unit also oversees breaches of rent pressure zone protections to ensure unlawful rent increases can also be identified and landlords prosecuted.  We have also extended notice periods to provide that even where a valid notice of termination is served, a tenancy of just one year's duration would benefit from a 120-day notice period.  We know that citing an intent to sell as a termination ground does not always mean a landlord intends to sell and tenants are now protected from that through legislation with RTB enforcement.  It has become clear that the underlying reason for many tenancy terminations is rent arrears.  The main sources of RTB disputes since 2013 are rent arrears and overholding.  In 2019, rent arrears were cited in 28% of all RTB dispute applications.  That is a particular reason we are focusing this legislation specifically on rent arrears.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, we also know that some landlords have left the market.  In 2016, there were almost 320,000 registered residential tenancies and by 2019 this had declined to approximately 303,000, which represented a reduction of almost 17,000.  Clearly, many landlords are selling their properties.  Some 70% of those landlords own just one rental property and 86% own just one or two.  The vast majority of our landlords are small-scale, mom-and-pop style landlords.  Covid-19 will have affected them as well as tenants.  We will not keep landlords in the market by banning evictions indefinitely.  Where a landlord has a legitimate need, he or she should be able to terminate a tenancy.  It is reasonable to expect, especially during the fall-out from Covid-19, that some landlords might need to provide a home for a family member or to occupy the properties themselves.  Equally, financial pressures may well force a landlord to sell a property.  I know of such cases.  The law should not prevent this from happening.<\/p> <p> Clearly, we need protections that balance the rights of tenants and landlords equally to encourage more landlords to remain in the market.  This Bill aims to do just that by respecting legitimate rights to terminate tenancies for sale, family use or renovation, with the enforcement safeguard of the RTB, while at the same time supporting tenants who are most at risk of arrears through early intervention.  This can help to prolong tenancies to the benefit of tenants and landlords.  The Bill focuses on tenants who experience rent arrears and aims to protect them through a combination of short-term measures and longer-term structural changes.<\/p> <p> Research published today by the ESRI shows that the combination of income supports such as the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme, combined with a decline in consumption during lockdown, means the incidence of arrears increased by just one percentage point, from 10% to 11%, during the first three months of the pandemic.  The protections put in place at the beginning have filled the gap.  However, the research signals the risk of increased rent arrears in the future when consumption levels rise and income supports are wound down.  Recent announcements that the pandemic unemployment payment is to be extended and the wage subsidy scheme replaced until the end of March 2021 by an employment wage subsidy scheme will help to continue to abate the loss of income.  In addition, the provisions of the Bill will enable greater recourse to rent supplement, which was also identified in the ESRI report as a key tool to address arrears, at an earlier stage in the process via referral of tenants in arrears to MABS.  There is a provision in this Bill to make sure that happens.<\/p> <p> The Bill will also oblige landlords when issuing notices of arrears and notices of termination on foot of arrears to copy these notices to the RTB.  As well as enabling early intervention via MABS, these provisions also respond to another recommendation in the ESRI report on the need to gather data on the incidence of arrears.  The provisions contained in this Bill mean that every time a landlord notifies a tenant that he or she is in arrears, the RTB will become aware of it and the tenant will be immediately provided with access to support.  Building up data in this way will lead to a better understanding of the market and the impact of the arrears.<\/p> <p> The Bill also recognises the immediate risk facing those in arrears and provides that where a tenant declares himself or herself to be at significant risk of tenancy termination and eligible for Covid-19-related supports, notice periods are extended and rent increases prohibited until 10 January 2021.  This means that any tenant who is in receipt of Covid-19-related support and is experiencing difficulty with rent payments can avail of extended notice protections to enable him or her to remain in the rental property without any rent increase until 10 January 2021.  It could not be clearer.<\/p> <p> Threshold is the only specialist advice and advocacy service for tenants facing housing problems in the private rented sector in Ireland.  It advocates for policy and legal change in relation to housing and proposes solutions which are informed by evidence from its work in advising tenants and protecting tenancies.  As was mentioned earlier, it recently published a series of policy proposals for the programme for Government in the context of the pandemic.  Among the proposals it put forward in its document on the future of the rental sector in Ireland was an extension of the moratorium on evictions.  Through the Bill, a moratorium has effectively been provided for anyone at risk of rent arrears and eligible for Covid-19-related supports until 10 January 2021 at a minimum, a period of almost five and a half months.<\/p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>This builds on current protections, which prohibited evictions for a total of over four months since 27 March this year.<\/p> <p> Threshold also proposed a revision to the way landlords can evict tenants for rent arrears.  This Bill now provides that: the arrears notice goes to the RTB; the services of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service are made available as early as possible; the notice period is extended further; and if a termination is disputed, the input from engagement with MABS will be considered as part of any adjudication in that regard.<\/p> <p> Threshold proposed the implementation of a moratorium on upward rent reviews.  Rent increases for anyone at risk of arrears and eligible for Covid-19-related supports are prohibited until 10 January 2021.  Taken together with the current moratorium on rent increases, this means that tenants at risk of rent arrears and in receipt of Covid-19-related supports will have benefited from a rent freeze from 27 March this year to 10 January 2021.<\/p> <p> Threshold rightly called for a greater level of assistance to tenants who accrue rent arrears.  I have now ensured that early engagement with the RTB and MABS will ensure a greater level of assistance, including through recourse to rent supplement.  I again advise those who may be in difficulty with rent payments that the emergency rent supplement is available for them.  They should contact their local welfare offices to get assistance in that regard.  Fewer than 8,000 people are in receipt of that payment and people need to know it is available to them.<\/p> <p> Threshold also asked for the notice period for rent arrears to be revised.  Again, this is being done in the Bill.  This period has been increased from 28 days to 90 days for those at risk of tenancy terminations and in receipt of Covid-19 payments.<\/p> <p> Threshold asked that the grounds on which a tenant can be evicted for arrears be revised.  Notices of rent arrears must now be copied to the RTB and the 28-day period for payment of outstanding rent starts when the RTB or the tenant receives the notice, whichever is later.  In addition, the notice of termination must also be sent to the RTB at the same time as it is sent to the tenant, otherwise the notice is not valid, and if the termination is subject of adjudication, the adjudicator must have regard to any advice received from MABS as part of the process.  Again, this is another very significant change in protection.<\/p> <p> These policy proposals clearly demonstrate the importance Threshold places on addressing rent arrears and this is borne out by its statistics on rent arrears.  In the period from March to May 2020, it experienced a seven-fold increase in queries from tenants in rent arrears.  Queries increased to 270 in 2020, up from 38 queries in the corresponding period in 2019.  As per Threshold&rsquo;s own welcome research, these measures are being targeted at those who need it most.<\/p> <p> The measures which I have presented here today clearly demonstrate that the Bill is well aligned with the policy objectives of Threshold and with the most pressing needs of tenants in the Irish housing market.  The approach I have adopted is supported by the findings of research by the ESRI, which recognise the potential for a build-up of arrears, the need for accurate data on the incidence of arrears and the role that supports such as rent supplement and bodies such as MABS can play in helping tenants in difficulty.  The approach I have adopted here today complements measures introduced last year to protect tenants where the landlord cites intent to sell or family use but fails to act in accordance with the grounds cited.<\/p> <p> I sincerely thank my fellow Deputies for their contribution to today's debate on this important and urgent Bill.  I look forward to going through the Bill in greater detail with them on Thursday.  I earnestly hope that the Bill can be passed swiftly so that these enhanced protections can be implemented before the summer recess to help provide secure accommodation to all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800031#DD00200","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595939100,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595939100,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Vot&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800033#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1595939100,"counter":87,"content":"<p>In accordance with an order of the D&aacute;il on Friday, 24 July 2020, the division is postponed until after the Order of Business, which will be later today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800033#FF00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595939100,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 2 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1595939400,"counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800034#MM00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1595939400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Last week, we had the debacle around the Government's green list.  Its travel advice was, and is, confused and ambiguous and relies on citizens using their best judgment.  Personally, I would prefer that nobody travel abroad this year but the fact remains that we have been given advice only, not a firm instruction, much less a legal requirement.  Despite this, the Government has taken it upon itself to send officials to our airports seeking out people on the Covid payment who have decided, in their best judgment, to travel.  One section of our population is being singled out without notice or warning.  On the basis of confused advice, the Government wants to punish and make an example of people who lost their jobs because it closed down the economy to deal with the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Many of these are the same people who were excluded from the Government's stay and spend initiative, so they will not be helped to holiday at home.  Many had booked and paid for their holidays months ago but, because of the Government's ambiguous travel advice, they may not qualify for a refund and may lose substantial sums of money.  In a final insult to these people, they will be penalised if they do travel, even to one of the green list countries.  Every which way they turn, they lose.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that his Government's travel advice does not have the force of law?  Will he accept that the travel advice is confused as to the difference between green and non-green countries and on whether one needs to restrict one's movement on return?  Will he accept that the Government has uniquely chosen those who have lost their jobs for punishment should they choose to travel abroad?  I want the Taoiseach to accept this is wrong and, more importantly, to reverse this decision.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand this decision was incorporated in social welfare guidance early on Monday morning, just 24 hours after the T&aacute;naiste set out his position on RT&Eacute;.  The T&aacute;naiste also claimed that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection gets information from the airports.  At this morning's meeting of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, however, the Dublin Airport Authority categorically denied it collects such information.  Its representatives said they had no details as to who collects such data in its facilities.  Will the Taoiseach clarify who is collecting this information?  On what legal basis is it collected?

In sharp contrast to the decisions taken in Northern Ireland by the Deputy's party, the decisions taken in the Republic of Ireland have resulted in some of the most restrictive travel guidance globally.  The results of this are there for all to see.<\/p>  <p>  It must be acknowledged by all that the pandemic unemployment payment was an unprecedented and fair response to the Covid-19 emergency.  At the height of the emergency, in May, as many as 600,000 people were in receipt of that payment.  As the economy has begun to reopen, people have returned to employment and the number claiming the payment has fallen to 287,000.  By any yardstick, it was a massive national response.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald endeavoured to paint the picture that somebody is out to get somebody or that the State has adopted a punitive approach.  That is not the position of the Government.  It has been anxious to help people who were made unemployed as a result of Covid-19, hence the unprecedented numbers who received this very special payment which the Government has decided to continue until the end of March, albeit at different levels.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has carried out compliance inspections at ports and airports since 2012, as the Deputy is well aware.  These continue.  The primary purpose of these checks has always been to ensure that social welfare payments are only made to people who reside in the State and who comply with the regulations.  Since March of this year, more than 2,000 pandemic unemployment payment claims have been closed as a result of checks carried out at Dublin Airport.  The Department has informed me that the vast majority of these cases related to individuals leaving the country permanently rather than holidaymakers.  These people no longer live here and are not entitled to this payment so it has been stopped.  Most people would say that this must be checked on an ongoing basis.  It is also important that this type of thing be dealt with in respect of schemes more widely.  The Department is very clear on that.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the overall picture, we are talking about a handful of cases in which claimants have had their payment suspended because of the changes the Department made in the context of the Government's travel advice.  The Government has consistently advised that the safest thing is not to travel.  It has not been encouraging or incentivising travel and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was anxious to ensure the holiday arrangements for recipients of social welfare payments were in accord and alignment with the Government's travel advice.<\/p>  <p>We are talking about a very small number of the 287,000 who continue to receive the payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800034#MM00300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595940000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800035#NN00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1595940000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>There is no agenda in terms of endeavouring to penalise any one sector as opposed to another.

This vital 27-bed elderly care residential home and day facility is dying a slow death.  The centre is cherished by the people of Roscrea.  The management and staff of the nursing home provide an excellent service for the people of the local community.  The level and quality of care are acknowledged and appreciated by the people of Roscrea.  The facility is an integral part of the fabric of the local community.  It is almost 50 years old and no longer meets HIQA standards.  It is therefore under threat of closure in 2021.  Roscrea is a community-orientated town and its people have fought passionately to save the Dean Maxwell nursing home to allow elderly members of their community to continue living in the locality with which they are familiar.<\/p>  <p>  The current capital spending plan, introduced in 2016 by the then Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, did a serious injustice by the omission of the Dean Maxwell nursing home.  That five-year service plan, endorsed by the HSE, effectively consigns the centre to lose its 25-bed long-stay unit.  The nursing home and the people of Roscrea should not be deprived of its long-stay beds.  Traditionally, north Tipperary has had a distribution of long-stay beds between Thurles, Nenagh and Roscrea.  We had a new unit built in Thurles and a new unit for St. Conlon's in Nenagh is being progressed.  The Dean Maxwell home should not be left behind.  I request the Taoiseach to ensure the current flawed HSE service plan is reviewed, with the purpose of designing and building a new facility for the Dean Maxwell nursing home in Roscrea.<\/p>  <p>  The Dean Maxwell home is being downgraded step by step and slowly but gradually is moving towards closure, one which is unwritten and by stealth.  With the bare minimum of maintenance over the past five years, the HSE knows full well that HIQA will intervene and deem it unfit for purpose.  The HSE is a casual bystander awaiting the inevitability of closure.  It has done absolutely nothing to offer an alternative solution and seems happy to run down the clock.  It is abundantly clear that it is HSE policy to transfer long-stay beds from Roscrea to Nenagh.  The blinkered attitude of the estates management section of the HSE towards Roscrea was confirmed by its dismissive response to a proposal to provide alternative accommodation in Roscrea.  In a project that required no HSE capital funding, the developer of the primary care centre in Roscrea agreed to adapt plans to incorporate on the same site a purpose-built 40-bed nursing home.  This would operate on a lease-back agreement to be managed and run by the HSE.  With unprofessional haste and without due consideration, the HSE rejected the proposal.  It is unwilling and unable to provide a credible reason for its decision.<\/p>  <p>  As the clock ticks for the Dean Maxwell nursing home, the HSE has failed to guarantee the future of elderly care in Roscrea.  I have raised this matter in private with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.  I request their intervention to find a sensible, practical solution to retain the Dean Maxwell home in Roscrea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800035#NN01300","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1595940000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lowry for raising with me on Leaders' Questions this issue concerning the Dean Maxwell community nursing unit in Roscrea.  As has been said, this is one of a few residential units for the elderly in Tipperary which, as we are all aware, is a very large county covered by two separate HSE areas.  Like many community nursing units across the country, the Dean Maxwell unit has a long, proud and reputable history of caring for the elderly community in Roscrea since it opened in 1974.  It is a home away from home for 29 older people who cannot live independently.  It also provides day services that are open seven days a week and respite services.  It is in an older building on a very tight site.  The HSE is working closely with HIQA to ensure that standards and services are maintained in the unit.  The internal layout is restricting the types of services that can be provided by the unit and the HSE is reviewing the situation on an ongoing basis as part of its service planning for 2021 and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to state that the unit will continue to be registered with HIQA for the next three years.  In its most recent report, HIQA noted that residents spoke extremely fondly of the services and care provided within the unit.  As the Deputy alluded to, the NDP has funding to provide a new 50-bed community nursing unit in Nenagh.  That does not mean services in the Dean Maxwell nursing home will be reduced as a result.  It is important that residential units of this kind are rooted in the communities they serve and that there is local access and utilisation of such facilities.<\/p> <p>I take on board what the Deputy is saying.  The Government is committed to meeting the wider health needs of older people in Roscrea and north County Tipperary and we are conscious of the demographic pressures.  We will need more such facilities in the future not fewer.  The Dean Maxwell centre will continue to play its role.  I will request that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, meet Deputy Lowry and other public representatives from County Tipperary to discuss the current and future service needs of the Dean Maxwell unit and any potential options which may be considered into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800035#NN01400","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595940600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I appreciate that commitment from the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  There are three options available in Roscrea and I would like some action on them.

The second option is to use the 3-acre greenfield site owned by the HSE at the rear of Cr&eacute; House health centre and build a modern, HIQA-compliant community nursing home with a capital funding allocation.  The third option is to refurbish and extend the existing building.  This option is problematic as the building can only be extended to the front and this would encroach on the adjoining public car park.  This car park already overflows at Sunday masses, weddings and funerals.  There is also the issue of caring for residents while such work is ongoing. <\/p>  <p>  This is a priority issue for me.  It is imperative that the HSE service plan is revised to include Roscrea and it is vital that an elderly care project for Roscrea is included in the new revised plan.

I assure him that the Government is anxious to see the Dean Maxwell centre continue to provide and develop services so it continues to provide a highly-professional and flexible service to older people and their families in Roscrea.  It is acknowledged all round that the existing site is exceptionally tight even for an extension.  This is the case even when one allows for the local authority's offer of a adjacent car park to facilitate an expansion of the centre but that is problematic as well.

The proposed allocations to all member states would then increase as a result.  Through a series of parliamentary questions I tabled on this matter, I have been able to establish that as part of this proposed increase the allocation for Ireland was set to jump from &euro;29.9 million to &euro;176 million.  We now know this is not going to happen and there is a potential loss of &euro;146 million we will have to do without.<\/p>  <p>  The European just transition fund has in fact been slashed and with it any real prospect of delivering outcomes that can combine the retention and protection of jobs with the goal of protecting our environment.  This has been my major concern throughout this entire process.  I have said all along that the balance has been entirely wrong for the midlands, especially for the workers and families.  Workers with mortgages and young families in County Offaly have been and will continue to be the ones most directly impacted.  The vast majority of workers and families I meet now associate the transition process with the prioritisation of vague and aspirational green agendas over the creation of real and sustainable employment and, most importantly, the protection of their livelihoods.  Is it any wonder that they think like this?   The just transition process was supposed to take place over the period up to 2030 to give everybody a fair chance to adjust.  That has been dramatically shortened to just 12 months.  Bord na M&oacute;na ceased all peat production as part of its enhanced peatland rehabilitation scheme in June after months of legal battles initiated by idealistic environmentalists and a High Court decision to strike down harvesting exemptions provided by the previous Government.<\/p>  <p>  I understand &euro;15 million has been made available under the July stimulus plan for the bog rehabilitation scheme and that the Bord na M&oacute;na workers were made aware of this but we need a substantial amount of money, far more than &euro;15 million.  Despite all the rhetoric about increasing supports to make the transition process fair and protective of jobs, we have seen practically no evidence that this is happening on the ground.  Indeed, there is much frustration among communities in counties Offaly and Laois and in the wider midlands area.  An example of this can be seen in the peat and horticultural contractor sector.  They invested in new and expensive machinery in the expectation that the 2020 season was progressing, only to be told without any consultation that the harvesting was not going to happen at all.  We know from the chief executive of Offaly County Council that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has advised that legislation is required at national level to allow the council to distribute funds that are being provided.  This is despite the fact that Offaly County Council is driving the transition process and the just transition commissioner is based in the county.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that the entire process is now at risk of descending into complete dysfunction and that it is utterly failing to protect and serve the very communities and jobs it was supposed to help save?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800036#OO00400","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1595940600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  At the outset, I wish to address the &euro;146 million that was taken out of the proposed allocation to the rural development fund.  As I secured &euro;337 million in alternative funding for agriculture, we more than made up for that particular loss.  Furthermore, the Common Agricultural Policy will now have a higher share of the multi-annual financial framework than it otherwise would have had under the pre-existing proposal that came from the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  On the immediate issue of the application of just transition policies and funding to the midlands and to County Offaly specifically, the Deputy can take it that the Government is very focused on this.  As she correctly outlined, provision was made in the July stimulus programme for &euro;15 million for peat reclamation.  In addition, under the Government's programme and the ring-fenced carbon fund that will be established, specific measures and funding will also be allocated, particularly to the midlands, to provide alternative employment to workers who will be losing jobs on an ongoing basis because of the policy and regulatory changes that have occurred at both domestic and European level entailed by our climate change objectives.<\/p>  <p>  The issues pertaining to peat harvesting have, from a regulatory, planning and decision perspective, been accelerated compared with the original deadlines.  As such we are very conscious of the issues and we are prioritising the midlands where allocation of just transition funds are concerned, to create new enterprises and alternative employment.  That is why significant funding from the carbon fund will also go toward retrofitting initiatives.  There is substantial funding going from the July stimulus programme to retrofitting initiatives to create employment.  The midlands will be prioritised for the retrofitting scheme and for other measures to try to create new economic activity in the area.  We will be relying predominantly on our own resources for the just transition fund, which will be allocated through both the general carbon fund and Exchequer resources to do everything we possibly can to create, to a large extent, an alternative economy in the midlands in the future and to do so in a phased way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800036#OO00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1595940600,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his response and welcome the fact that the midlands will be prioritised.

The midlands were only recovering from the last recession and then we were hit with this.  It is going to have a detrimental effect and I believe we need to be focused on creating a huge number of jobs and not just a handful here and there.  When I raised this issue with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, he told me Bord na M&oacute;na needed to look at how to diversify to create jobs but it is not Bord na M&oacute;na's role to create jobs.  It is the Government's role to drive this.  IDA Ireland needs to take a more proactive role in helping us in the midlands to ensure job creation takes place quickly.<\/p> <p> The just transition process is happening in the larger context of our ambition to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  Only last year, a former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer stated the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 will cost the UK more than &pound;1 trillion.  He said that such a cost meant less money would be available for schools, police, hospitals and other areas of public spending.  He also warned that the target would render some industries economically uncompetitive without huge Government subsidies.  Has any such impact analysis been carried out here?

Deputy Cowen has been very strong on the just transition, to be fair, and he has led from the front on ensuring strong policy prioritisation of the just transition fund for Ireland and particularly its application to the midlands.  A useful meeting could take place with the Minister in this regard because he is genuine and sincere in wanting to create alternative employment through renewables, peat reclamation and retrofitting.

I could read out the question I raised in December 2019 and all other questions I have raised at the level of Taoiseach on mental health and the absence of services.  I have a specific question today and we could save a lot of time if the Taoiseach could just answer it.  It is on the urgent need for an independent monitoring body to implement what was A Vision for Change and is now Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Service for Everyone.  If the Taoiseach tells me he is taking this seriously and urgently, gives me a date for its implementation and assures me there will be a broad range of therapists and therapies represented on it, I will thank him and look forward to working with him.<\/p>  <p>  In 1984, the document, Planning for the Future, confirmed our mental health services were not fit for purpose.  It showed the way forward.  It took until 2006 to get another document, which was A Vision for Change.  It is a wonderful document and there is no need to change it, only to update it, as we have had done.  Theoretically, it ran out in January 2016.  Then we had a review of the literature, which took a few weeks and then months to publish.  Then it took another four years of pressure from me and other Deputies from all parties to ask for the publication of the new document, which is Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Service for Everyone.  During all this time, the mental health service is absolutely creaking at the seams.<\/p>  <p>  In Galway over the past few days, at an informal social gathering, I became aware of three suicides in a very short period involving people aged between 15 to 70.  We know that hospitals have stopped gathering data on suicides and we have no up-to-date figures.  We also know that, in a very short period, 17% of patients admitted to national spinal injuries unit at the Mater hospital had injuries associated with attempted suicide and there are many other anecdotes and stories.  At this point, I do not wish to go into any of them.  For four and a half years we have had statements on mental health.  I do not want any more statements.  Nobody in the psychology or psychiatric fields trusts any Government.  They do not trust any politician, including myself, and I accept that.  This is why there is a need for an independent monitoring body.  To show the Taoiseach's bona fides, let us stop the talking and the statements and confirm that will be set up as a matter of urgency before the end of August?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800037#PP00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1595941200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Admha&iacute;m go bhfuil feachtas pearsanta &aacute; rith ag an Teachta maidir leis an gceist seo agus go bhfuil s&iacute; ag obair go dian d&iacute;cheallach ar son daoine at&aacute; ag baint seirbh&iacute;s s&iacute;os &oacute;n tseirbh&iacute;s sl&aacute;inte.

The Mental Health Commission is such a body, which I established myself legislatively quite some time ago.  It has always had an independent approach, which is the ideal approach to mental health services, but I take the Deputy's point that it is more on the side of regulating and monitoring existing services with regard to whether they are in conformity with the law.  It seems to me that funding has not been an issue for mental health in recent years but the identification and recruitment of qualified personnel seems to have been an issue that has bedevilled the health service and that the health service has found very difficult to deal with in psychiatry, and child and adolescent psychiatry in particular and dealing with young people.<\/p>  <p>  In discussing this with regard to the programme for Government, we said we have to utilise the NGO and voluntary sectors in tandem and try to integrate them with the statutory services and, perhaps, develop a broader canvas in the utilisation of psychologists, therapists and multidisciplinary teams.  My personal view is the more we can situate mental health services in the community, with access to local multidisciplinary teams, the more effective the outcomes will be.<\/p>  <p>  A barometer of success is having less of a need for acute services.  There will always be a need for acute services but if they are full or have high occupancy it is reflective of a dearth of resources and productivity in community care.

My opinion and the Taoiseach's opinion do not matter anymore.  We have had A Vision for Change, Sharing the Vision - a Mental Health Policy for Everyone and Planning for the Future.  The common denominator in all of that is the move out of the institutions.  We are beyond that.  The common denominator is that we must have an independent monitoring body.  That body sat for two three-year periods and it did such a good job that the Government abolished it.

We can set up the independent implementation monitoring body to monitor the implementation of this, but we cannot be blind to certain constants in the mental health service.  There have been certain positives as well that must be acknowledged.  The establishment of the child and adolescent units was effective, in terms of the facilities and so forth, in reducing the number of children and teenagers in adult facilities, although there are still too many.  When no child is in an adult facility we will be satisfied.  There has been some progress, but the problem has been the recruitment of personnel, including in the child and adolescent services.  We must tackle that collectively, and if we do not get particular personnel we must work on alternatives to that.  There is no point in keeping our heads in the sand either and just passing it over to some independent implementation body.  This must be ongoing.

If politicians get into a competition as to who can bid lower, I think that would be detrimental to politics in general and, ultimately, would lead to more wealthy people becoming politicians, or wealthier parties with external sources of funding supporting their members, and fewer Independent Deputies getting elected on their own and fewer members of smaller parties which do not have the resources that some parties in this House have.  Some parties in this House are far wealthier than others.  In my view, there has to be a proper, proportionate approach to the payment of public representatives which guarantees the independence of this House from external influences and enables people to be elected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800041#TT01000","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1595943300,"counter":167,"content":"<p>We are way over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800041#TT01100","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1595943300,"counter":168,"content":"<p>The idea of competing with each other to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800041#TT01200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595943300,"counter":169,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1595943300,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I ask Deputy Paul Murphy to contain himself.

We had to defer it on an absolute basis across the board and it was an important step at the time to try to check the spread of the virus and stabilise the situation.  The evidence so far indicates that the situation has, indeed, been stabilised.  As knowledge of the virus evolves, it is fair to state that lumping outdoor and indoor events together may not be the optimal approach.  It is clear that the virus is very lethal in indoor settings and there has to be a particular focus on indoor activity and behaviour.  As Deputies have noted, outdoor behaviour is different.  I did not expect players and mentors to be included in that figure of 200, to which Deputy Gould alluded.  That has reduced the number allowed at matches to a minimal figure.

They cannot refinance their loans through the new credit guarantee unless they take out additional lending, which is not what they need.  They need support from the State to make sure that they will be able to go back on the road when the tourism season picks up or when there is a demand for their services again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800043#VV00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1595944500,"counter":221,"content":"<p>On the same issue but with regard to a different group of people, I ask the Taoiseach to support the chauffeur industry.

There were more than 140 days of negotiations before a Government was formed.  That is a shocking length of time.  It dwarfs the previous negotiating period, outlasting it by about 70 days.  Many people outside the political bubble were shocked.  They looked to their own lives and saw people knuckling down to deal with the Covid-19 crisis, getting on with life and making decisions within community organisations, businesses, etc.  They saw events in the political bubble in Leinster House move in a phenomenally slow and sluggish fashion.  People were horrified by this. <\/p><p>This period of 140 days represented a democratic deficit and a democratic crisis.  We had a Taoiseach with no mandate, a Cabinet in which many of the Ministers were unelected, newly elected Deputies who were unable to scrutinise those Ministers, and a D&aacute;il that was unable to legislate.  There was a significant crisis within the political system at a time we needed to be able to function properly to deal with the crisis that was at hand.  People in the political class did not realise the difficulty a situation such as this poses on several different levels.<\/p><p>The first is the democratic level.  A Minister making decisions for a country should have a democratic mandate giving him or her the right to make those decisions.  A collectively responsible Cabinet with its roots in the political will of the people of Ireland should make those decisions.  When designing a plan of action for the lockdown period, the Taoiseach left the Cabinet of unelected Ministers, drove past the D&aacute;il to the RT&Eacute; studios and literally launched his plans there.  The democratic process was ignored.  It was wrong and it should not have happened.  Ministers such as the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Senator Regina Doherty, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, were making decisions worth billions of euro with no mandate. <\/p><p>There was also a cost to the Exchequer.  It was estimated that these Ministers cost the Exchequer an extra &euro;40,000 annually.  Many saw an increase in their pensions because their terms as Ministers were extended.  We have heard a lot about ministerial pensions in the House today.  Many of these Ministers had their pensions radically increased or jumped into different pension brackets.  <\/p><p>It is in the gift of the Taoiseach of the day to replace Ministers who are in place without a mandate.  It is in the gift of the D&aacute;il of the day to select successors to those Ministers.  I understand that it is very difficult to replace Ministers in the short period following a general election when a Government is being formed.  This Bill allows the existing Ministers who had mandates in the previous D&aacute;il to remain in place for six weeks to make the decisions necessary to keep the country afloat.<\/p><p>However, there must be a red line.  There has to be a period after which it is recognised that the new D&aacute;il has the democratic mandate and the requisite skills and experience to replace the sitting Ministers.  This is a very simple Bill.  It simply puts the onus on the D&aacute;il to select new Ministers and appoint them six weeks after the election.  It provides that any Minister without a mandate does not have a right to remain as a Minister any longer. <\/p><p>Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go raibh g&eacute;arch&eacute;im uaf&aacute;sach sa t&iacute;r seo ag t&uacute;s na bliana mar gheall ar Covid, srl., ach bh&iacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im dhaonlathach anseo freisin &oacute;s rud &eacute; go raibh go leor Air&iacute; gan &uacute;dar&aacute;s ag d&eacute;anamh go leor cinnt&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtacha.

It is worth saying that although Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael voted against the Bill at that time, the Green Party supported it.  In the new programme for Government, the new Government has committed to introducing a right to housing Bill, so this is the Bill and all it has to do is support it.  The Minister can nod if I am correct.<\/p><p>It is important to introduce this Bill to amend the Constitution and include the right to housing.  Time and again, when we sought measures to protect the rights of tenants, such as preventing unjust economic evictions and taking over property to house people who are desperately in need, we have been told with these and other housing-related matters that we cannot do it because of the provision on the protection of private property in the Constitution.  Frankly, I have never accepted that.  In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, we discovered that things we were told we could not do by the previous Fine Gael Government because they were unconstitutional, such as eviction bans and control of rents to some extent - although not enough - could be done.  It suggests some of the legal justifications for not introducing a right to housing or taking measures to ensure housing provision for people in this country and protecting tenants etc. were spurious in the first place.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, it is important that this Bill be introduced when we think of the current efforts by the Government to dismantle the emergency protections for tenants that were introduced at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Today's disgraceful move by the new Government to remove those protections for tenants is being justified by the so-called advice from the Attorney General regarding the ban on evictions and rent increases being unconstitutional because of a constitutional protection of private property.  I reject that but just to be sure, let us have the referendum.  Let us get it clear in the Constitution that people would have a right to housing and that this is under the definition of the common good; this common good of the right to housing should override protection of private property, particularly when we are talking about the private property of landlords, vulture funds and others who seem to think their wealth is more important than the right to secure and dignified housing for ordinary people.<\/p><p>This Bill seeks to insert after Article 43.2 of the Constitution, which deals with the common good and private property, the following sections:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe State, in particular, recognises the common good as including the right to secure, affordable, dignified housing, appropriate to need, for all the residents of Ireland and shall guarantee this right through its laws, policies and the prioritisation of resources. <\/blockquote>  <p>and<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe State, accordingly, shall delimit the right to private property where it is necessary to ensure the common good and to vindicate the said right to housing for all residents of Ireland. <\/blockquote>  <p>This is what all the housing charities, non-governmental organisations and anybody concerned with housing have said is necessary.  This right to housing is necessary to end the scandal of homelessness and private property being put before the basic human right to a secure and affordable roof over a person's head.<\/p><p>There should be no reason the Government should not assist in getting this legislation through the Houses as quickly as possible so we can have the referendum and let the people decide if the right to housing should be a basic human right in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800046#YY00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1595946300,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Is

It is quite surprising the first meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee is only taking place on 30 July.<\/p> <p>This is probably one of the most critical Cabinet committees at any time, but particularly now.  The Taoiseach might explain why it has taken this long for the committee to come together, given the discussions we have had today and in recent weeks regarding housing.  During this economic crisis, I would like to have seen much more from the July stimulus that would have had direct impact on housing.  Alas, that was not to be.<\/p> <p> According to the latest official figures, some 8,876 people were homeless in May, including 2,787 children.  This is a scandal and shows that housing is not affordable for many people.  The only good news I can take from those figures, if it is possible to take any good news from it during a pandemic, is that they are down from a peak in excess of 10,000 people in February, including more than 3,500 children.  That tells us clearly that one good thing is that the emergency rent freeze and moratorium on evictions have worked, as we in the Labour Party said they would all the time.  <\/p> <p> I want to make a legal point.  I heard for a long time that putting in place a rent freeze was going to be impossible.  I heard that from the previous Government.  I heard it from Fianna F&aacute;il while supporting the previous Government.  I knew the rent freeze was possible, however, because I did it.  How was it possible, constitutionally, to bring in a rent freeze when the same people sitting around the Cabinet table said that it was not constitutional?  The Taoiseach and his party supported that and the previous Government.  <\/p> <p> A real issue regarding the Cabinet committee is its make-up and the roles of many outside bodies.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government can never deliver housing unless all the levers are in his possession.  That means that the Minister for Finance must be completely in tune, but also the local authorities.  The Minister must ensure that the local authorities are 100% in tune to ensure delivery.  That is particularly the case when it comes to affordable housing, cost rental and the measures committed to in the programme for Government.  That triumvirate has to work very closely together and I would like that reflected in how the Cabinet committee works.<\/p> <p> The main reason that homelessness is down by nearly 1,000 people in three months, including 700 fewer children, is because families are not being evicted from private rented accommodation.  The first action of this Government in the crisis, however, has been to end such legal protections in the future.  If homelessness can go down by 1,000 people in three months, it is certain that homelessness can increase just as quickly, especially when so many people are losing their jobs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800046#YY03600","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595946900,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I ask Deputy Kelly to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1595946900,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I am concluding.  I have some questions for the Taoiseach.  When will we have the full timetable regarding how often the Government's Cabinet committee on housing will meet?  When will the cost of housing, including the cost of building a house, be treated as a priority?  Finally, what is the Government going to do in the short term regarding those who have rent debt, which is going to crystallise in the coming weeks and months?  How is that situation going to be dealt with, because in some cases the cost will be thousands of euro?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800047#ZZ00300","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1595946900,"counter":285,"content":"<p>It is remarkable news that the Cabinet committee on housing did not meet in advance of the significant and hugely retrograde decision, made in the Bill now passing through the D&aacute;il, to open the door for a resumption of evictions into homelessness in the middle of a pandemic.  I find that extraordinary.  I do not know if the Government does not understand or, worse, does understand the implications of the Bill now going through the D&aacute;il.  Let us be clear, however, that it removes most of the emergency protections that were put in place to prevent people being made homeless and evicted because there is a public health emergency.  That public health emergency still exists and people made homeless now will have their health imperilled as a result of the pandemic, and the Government will be responsible.  Yet, that issue has not even been discussed at the Cabinet housing committee.  That is an extraordinary admission from the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Government, even at this stage, to pull back from that decision because the number of people presenting for homeless services has dropped dramatically as a result of the ban on evictions.  By the way, when People Before Profit put forward a Bill to ban evictions in the previous D&aacute;il, the Fianna F&aacute;il party supported it.  I do not understand why that party is now supporting a plan to lift that ban on evictions into homelessness in the midst of a pandemic, when it is really unthinkable to put people on the street, into shared accommodation where they are more vulnerable to the virus, or into overcrowded conditions, where they are also vulnerable to the virus.  <\/p>  <p>  I will quickly ask about one other issue.  Walking about Dublin city during the pandemic, I met an elderly woman from the south inner city.  She asked me to go and take a look off Aungier Street, where a row of beautiful old buildings is run-down and empty.  That elderly woman said the situation was shocking because people in her area, including her children and grandchildren, needed to be housed, yet some landlord was sitting on those empty buildings.  That story is repeated in towns, villages and cities across the country, where landlords, property owners and vulture funds sit on empty properties that could be used to house people.  That is really taunting the people on the housing waiting lists and nothing is being done about it.  <\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach have any plans to go on an aggressive campaign of getting hold of hoarded land and empty properties that could be used to house people impacted by homelessness and, more generally, to address the lack of social and affordable housing by getting that property into use in respect of the dire housing crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800047#ZZ00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1595946900,"counter":286,"content":"<p>The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020 that the Government is seeking to rush through the D&aacute;il this week is a far cry from the Fianna F&aacute;il new deal for renters that was promised by the Taoiseach just a few months ago.  In fact, he and his Government are now moving to allow for rent increases, notices to quit and the misery that will ensue in the heat of a global pandemic.  It is noteworthy that the Cabinet committee has not yet met.<\/p>  <p>  The protections in place have resulted in a significant drop in the number of families presenting as homeless and the lowest number of families in emergency accommodation in the past three years.  The emergency measures also confirm the argument that we, along with Focus Ireland and others, have made that banning vacant possession notices to quit has played an important role in reducing homelessness.  It is to the great shame of Fine Gael that it took a pandemic for the previous Government to take the actions necessary to protect renters.  It is to the great shame of the Taoiseach, however, that he is now withdrawing them as the pandemic continues.<\/p>  <p>  Many renters, as the Taoiseach will be aware, are under great financial pressure.  They do not earn huge salaries and do not have that luxury.  They believe, as I do, that there is a huge gulf in understanding between their reality and the reality of those who govern.  In that light, will the Taoiseach inform the House whether he is still drawing down the &euro;50,000 top-up from the Fianna F&aacute;il party leader's allowance?  Will he make that clear to the D&aacute;il?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800047#ZZ00500","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1595946900,"counter":287,"content":"<p>This morning, FM radio stations across the country were quoting Government sources as stating that the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020 offers protection for tenants on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the temporary wage supplement scheme, TWSS, until the new year.<\/p> <p>Those Government sources did not say that these protections will not apply to tenants on the PUP and TWSS when landlords plan to evict on the grounds of sale of property, refurbishment of property, relatives moving into the home and so on and so forth.  In fact, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government earlier told the D&aacute;il that he has information which indicates that 28% of evictions in the State take place on the grounds of rent arrears.  He also indicated that approximately three quarters of tenants who have protection from eviction today will no longer have those protections in two weeks' time.  <\/p> <p> The Taoiseach is no doubt aware that the end of the moratorium on evictions in New York city last month has resulted in an explosion of evictions in that city.  How on earth can he guarantee the D&aacute;il and renters in this country that the same thing will not happen here in the months of August, September and October, as we move towards the autumn and winter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800047#ZZ00600","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595947500,"counter":289,"content":"<p>In response to the comments of Deputy Kelly and others, I do not think there is any surprise that the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government is meeting approximately a month after the Government was formed.  I met very quickly after the formation of the Government with the Minister and his Secretary General to discuss a range of issues, including homelessness and preparations for the July stimulus programme, particularly in respect of voids.  I wanted specific funding for that and the Minister included it in the July stimulus programme.  That funding will allow local authorities to bring approximately 2,000 council houses back into operation and in which people may be able to live before the end of the year.  That funding was provided in the July stimulus programme, in addition to funding for water infrastructure and the help-to-buy scheme which will help those who are endeavouring to buy a house.  The Minister also had to deal with rates relief which was separate to the housing issue but also fell under his policy remit.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the first weeks of this Government have been spent dealing with Covid-19 and the July stimulus programme, which is a &euro;5.2 billion programme of expenditure and tax that seeks to give a lifeline to the Irish economy during this time.  I do not think that the housing committee not meeting until 30 July is a big deal.  It is a reasonable timeframe and does not mean that the Government has not been engaging on housing issues.  We have been doing so, particularly through the Cabinet sub-committee dealing with the July stimulus programme.<\/p>  <p>  I would also say that homelessness is on a downward trajectory in part due to the rent freeze and eviction moratorium but also due to the fact that more than 1,000 extra units were provided in Dublin alone, with up to 1,400 units provided nationally, for the homeless during the Covid crisis.  That had a big impact.  One of the good stories, if one can use that phrase, during this crisis has been the low level of infection among the homeless and that the virus did not spread into settings where one might have anticipated.  That is a result of the great work of all those in NGOs, the HSE and local authorities who work for homeless people.  People have worked collectively to avoid the spread of the virus within homeless settings.<\/p>  <p>  The other key factor in that downward trajectory is the fact that more and more properties are now becoming available.  We have for the first time seen the impact of Airbnb on property in Dublin and other cities.  I have said to the Minister that an opportunity now exists to purchase and access vacant leases and properties, as Deputy Boyd Barrett also said, with a view to keeping homeless figures down and to get proper, fit for purpose accommodation for people who need housing.  There has been a decline in Airbnb properties and a consequent increase in the supply of available properties because of Covid-19.  That represents an opportunity that needs to be grasped to try to get more people houses more quickly.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the point made by Deputy Kelly, the Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Housing, Planning and Local Government are on the housing Cabinet sub-committee.  It is important that they work with local authorities and I know that the relevant Minister has been in touch to discuss working with them.  I think that was the point the Deputy was making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800048#AAA00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1595947500,"counter":290,"content":"<p>The time has elapsed, Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800048#AAA00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1595947500,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I also want to deal with the questions asked by Deputies Boyd Barrett and McDonald, if I may.  On the evictions moratorium and rent freeze, the only reason we are introducing the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill is because they were not legally tenable.  The Bill will give a stronger statutory footing to protect tenants who are in rent arrears from being evicted during the Covid crisis.  Tenants who make a declaration under this legislation cannot be evicted and that will remain the situation until January.  The existing statutory instrument was grounded in the emergency legislation around Covid and given the reopening of society, it was not legally grounded or constitutional.  We are now almost six months on and we have been advised, trenchantly and strongly, that the State is vulnerable to challenges and so on.  It is not legally tenable to maintain the existing situation.  This Bill is stronger and better than similar legislation in other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland, where the Minister gave tenants 12 weeks' grace.  Statutory protection for renters in the Republic is now much stronger than that in the North.<\/p>  <p>  I say to Deputy McDonald that I was never in receipt of an annual allowance of &euro;50,000.  The allowance was &euro;30,000 and I did not take it for the first three years.  The Oireachtas passed legislation a long time ago under which leaders of Opposition parties were entitled to an allowance in respect of the overall resources of the party.  That money is taxable and I am not in receipt of it now.

The Taoiseach obviously takes an interest in this matter, as do his coalition colleagues, particularly those in the Green Party.  The Government has committed to halving carbon emissions by 2032 although, incredibly, the plan expects the next Government to do more of the heavy lifting than the current one.  That is kind of ironic.  It is polite and decent of the Taoiseach to lump most of the work onto his successors.  One never knows who will be around to do the work.<\/p>  <p>  The real question is what the Government intends to achieve over the next five years.  I would like to dig into a little detail about what areas the Government will target and what conversations have been had, given that the Cabinet committee has not met.  We need to see enormous changes to our economy that will reflect our prioritisation of the climate.  We also need to do it in a decent way through a just transition.  I have spoken about this numerous times and the Taoiseach has already referenced it today.  I share the concerns of other parliamentarians here.  I represent Littleton in County Tipperary where people lost jobs with the closure of the Bord na M&oacute;na plant.<\/p> <p>They will put together proposals on the just transition commissioner.

What will be done in respect of rail lines?  What will be done to ensure there is a greater use of rail lines?  It is a capital intensive area.  In his response the Taoiseach might outline how the Government will support that, and how it will support public enterprises and State organisations so that they are better able to do more to deal with the climate crisis we are all facing.  We need to ensure that a number of State organisations are refocused on the deep requirements they will have in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800048#AAA01200","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595948100,"counter":301,"content":"<p>The climate situation was an emergency that needed to be addressed before Covid-19.  The urgency to address the climate emergency has now been multiplied very significantly by the advent of Covid-19.  There is a very important natural intersection between the destruction of biodiversity and the proliferation of pandemics.<\/p>  <p>  Some serious scientists are, to some extent, suggesting and have evidence to believe that the frequency of pandemics in recent years is linked to the destruction of biodiversity.  H1N1, swine flu, bird flu, coronavirus, SARS, MERS and Ebola are some of the more well-known pandemics.  Why is this happening?  One very significant reason is the destruction of biodiversity, given that biodiversity acts as a natural firebreak to the spread of virus and disease.  The destruction of biodiversity, in particular the destruction of natural habitats and forests, creates the conditions where pandemics of this sort, and the jumping of viruses from animals to humans, become more likely.  We need to grasp that very important fact.<\/p>  <p>  Where are the most naturally biodiverse areas in this country?  They are the ancient woodlands which have been almost completely destroyed.  Does the Taoiseach know how much ancient woodland is left in Ireland?  Just 0.002%, and that is under pressure.  The lack of biodiversity in our forests has an impact in terms of its version of a virus, such as invasive species threatening them in, for example, Killarney National Park.<\/p>  <p>  We need to protect and nurture the ancient woodlands and allow them to expand.  We need a real focus on and investment in this area, rather than monoculture forestry and the forms of agriculture that are destroying our biodiversity in a way that is threatening not just the natural world but the ability of the planet to sustain our existence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800049#BBB00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1595948100,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Following on from my previous question, I am happy to correct my assertion that the Taoiseach's top-up was &euro;50,000.

I would have thought that was the Taoiseach's first set-piece opportunity to explicitly and comprehensively marry the agenda of climate justice and the framework in the plan for economic recovery.  The truth is that the plan is very scant on detail in terms of the Government's commitments on climate change.<\/p>  <p>  The July stimulus plan includes a commitment to a retrofitting skills training initiative to support the future expansion of the national retrofitting programme.  This is just one example.  We do not know what targets have been set in terms of the numbers to be trained and the impact their work will have on the Government's annual retrofit targets.  <\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the Government has made a commitment to increase infrastructure related spending by 12%, or &euro;1 billion.

The agenda is clearly set out in the programme for Government.  The immediate objectives of the Cabinet committee will be, for example, the climate action (amendment) Bill, which will be introduced to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann within the first 100 days of the Government, the development of a national retrofitting plan and the progression of matters in furtherance of our move to a higher rate of renewable energy, such as the marine planning and development Bill, which will be an important Bill, the wind energy guidelines and the just transition, in particular.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, we intend to hypothecate the carbon fund which will create about &euro;9.5 billion over ten years.  As the Deputy also knows, &euro;3 billion of that is earmarked to protect against fuel poverty and the bulk is earmarked for retrofitting.  The remaining money will be used for a rural environment protection scheme which will be designed to help farmers adapt to the challenges of climate change and create practices to remunerate and incentivise them to create practices that would be in alignment with our climate change objectives.<\/p>  <p>  The climate action fund was established in law through the early enactment of the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill.  In respect of Deputy McDonald's question, we will also publish a detailed all-of-Government implementation plan which will be consistent with the recommendations of the just transition commissioner's first report.  The just transition commissioner was established as a statutory office and published the terms of the trust transition plan to frame the work of a permanent commission.  There is a lot of work to be done, much of which is already under way by the Minister.  The publication of overarching legislation is an important foundation stone on which many of the actions will be based.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly said a lot will fall on the next Government.  The key decisions that will be made now will clearly have an impact on the future in terms of our performance on greenhouse gas emissions.  Building blocks have to be put in place now and will have an impact in the latter half of a ten-year period in terms of achieving a significant reduction.<\/p>  <p>  I take Deputy Boyd Barrett's point very seriously, but I do not have the scientific proof.  I am aware of the thesis on the link between weakening biodiversity and the growth of pandemics.  There can be different factors.  The growth of the world population has to be a factor and, in certain areas, it is certainly facilitating the ease of spread.<\/p> <p>We have had SARS, MERS, H1N1, the swine flu and so on.  Covid-19 is the one that got away insofar as it was not tested and contract-traced out of existence.  I spoke to a number of scientists who are of the view that we may see these more frequently now than we would have over the past 100 years.<\/p> <p> I support fully every effort to retain and strengthen our biodiversity.  The Deputy mentioned ancient woodlands.  We must do everything we possibly can to protect but also incentivise the nurturing of our biodiversity, which can recover if it is given the space to do so, both marine and on land.  That is why I favour the rural environmental protection scheme, the just transition fund and also initiatives to create more native woodland on farms.  We should try to persuade farmers to do this.  We must have a contrast to the monoculture forestry policy.  We need to grow more indigenous native Irish trees on a grander scale than we have done to date.  That is extremely important and I will work with the responsible Ministers in that regard.<\/p> <p> In terms of the retrofit agenda, obviously there will have to be a degree of upskilling.  We have to work with the institutes of technology and education and training boards, ETBs, in developing programmes to bring a greater cohort of people who will be skilled in the retrofitting area.  There will be significant opportunities in that field into the future because the Government aims to increase the number of retrofits and retrofitting activity generally.<\/p> <p> Regarding Deputy McDonald's final question, the allowance is an Opposition allowance, which ceases when one is no longer an Opposition Member or Opposition leader.  Therefore, it ceased on becoming Taoiseach.

It is unfair to single out one and say there was no mention of SNAs.  The entire roadmap is about three school settings: primary schools; special schools and special units; and post-primary schools.  That is made very clear in the document.  The overwhelming idea is a safe school community, embracing all the school staff.  That is not just teachers, principals and SNAs.  It is also caretakers, assistants and others who make the school community tick.<\/p>  <p>  This is a very important milestone for society and we need everybody behind it.  We need to keep community transmission of the virus very low.  That is the most effective way for us to keep our schools open.  It is the single most important national objective in the coming months.  Children&rsquo;s life chances are limited if they are out of school for too long.  Particularly for children with special needs, we need to do everything we can to ensure that not only do we reopen the schools but that we keep the schools open for the long haul.  That is what the roadmap is trying to provide for.  If certain events happen, can we intervene?<\/p>  <p>  There will be additional SNAs; I do not have specific figures.  There will also be substitution and supervision for SNAs because I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point that they are up closer in many respects.  Advice from the health authorities is very clear in calling for common sense and balance if a child falls or whatever.  The requirement is for 1 m distancing, but sector-specific application and balance will be applied to that.<\/p>  <p>  Primary schools are well used to the minor works grant scheme.  This year we have doubled it, which will enable them to reconfigure classrooms.  It is not for big extensions.  It can relate to plumbing and electrical adjustments.  We need more hot water flowing in many schools.  Some schools are up to speed and some are not in that regard.  I feel school administration will be innovative enough to apply that funding fairly quickly to optimise space in school settings.  We need to bear in mind that all of this was worked through with the partners in education, representing SNAs, teachers, management, parents and children.  The students&rsquo; voice was quite significant this time around during the Covid crisis.  We saw it with the assessment issue in respect of the leaving certificate.  Those discussions shaped this roadmap, which did not just come from on high, from the Department.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the advertising and recruitment, some of this is on the ongoing substitution.  The pilot projects for substitution in primary schools worked very well.  They feel confident that they can roll that out and that it will not be as big an issue at primary level because there is a greater supply of teachers.  At post-primary level there will be challenges with certain subjects such as the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects and Irish, and we need to be particularly careful there.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Deputy McDonald&rsquo;s points, I have covered the primary substitution.  A range of options are open to the Department to try to secure the additional 1,000 post-primary posts.  However, that will require a significant reduction in the post-primary pupil-teacher ratio for the first time in a long time.<\/p>  <p>  I did not realise that the allowance that I had as an Opposition leader was payable if one went into government.  I have made the point that I see the demarcation line being once I become a member of Government, I cease to benefit from that.  That is the way I have applied it.<\/p>  <p>  It is a tight timeframe for teachers and for the school community.  From talking to people on the ground, my sense is that everybody wants this to happen and they will work in a co-operative and constructive way to enable this to happen and it is very important that we do so.<\/p>  <p>  I would say to Deputy Boyd Barrett that if they can utilise community buildings or other buildings that are available, that is a decision for the schools.  There will be considerable local autonomy here and we will be supportive of the schools in using local solutions to solve their problems.  I am not aware of the specific buildings he mentioned, but we can follow up on those.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Barry, the roadmap provides for how we can assess this year&rsquo;s fifth year students in the leaving certificate next year.  Recommendations on the curriculum will be made to the schools.  They cannot change the curriculum.  I spoke to the chief inspector, Harold Hislop, last Friday.  He is a very solid individual who is very strong on assessment generally.  They will not be able to change the curriculum, but they are conscious that different cohorts of students might be at different stages of the curriculum.  Some might have a certain aspect of English and geography covered.  They have proposed to widen the choices in questions that students will have to face in next year&rsquo;s leaving certificate to take cognisance of the fact that they missed a number of months from school this year meaning that they may not have all the curriculum covered by the end of the year.

I have personally been very engaged in efforts to keep the issue high on the international agenda and have made four working visits to Israel and Palestine, most recently in December 2019.\u00a0<\/p><p>The unilateral annexation by Israel of any part of the occupied Palestinian territory would be a very clear violation of international law.  It would have no legitimacy, would not be recognised or accepted by Ireland or by the international community more generally and would be deeply damaging to the two-state solution.\u00a0<\/p><p>The programme for Government states that the Government will:<\/p> <blockquote> \tContinue to work with other Member States to give leadership within the EU to oppose any annexation or plans to apply Israeli sovereignty over territory in the West Bank, which is part of the occupied Palestinian territory.  The Government would regard any such moves as a breach of international law and would consider an appropriate response to them at both national and international level. <\/blockquote>  <p>I have been forthright in my public statements on the issue of annexation.  As I said on 23 April, in a statement which remains in line with the position of this Government:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI think it important, as a friend and partner of Israel, to be very clear about the gravity of any such step.  Annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including the UN Charter, whenever and wherever it occurs, in Europe&rsquo;s neighbourhood or globally.  This is a fundamental principle in the relations of states and the rule of law in the modern world.  No one state can set it aside at will. <\/blockquote>  <p>Ireland has made every effort over the past year to discourage this step.  I have raised this matter directly and clearly with Israeli leaders in person including with the Israeli foreign minister this week and during my visit to the region last December.  I have also made our position on this very clear to the current Israeli Government in recent days.  My officials continue to convey our views to the Israeli authorities.  I have also outlined my serious concerns about possible annexation in discussions with US representatives, most recently the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo.<\/p><p>I have engaged extensively with European partners, with a view to encouraging strong EU messages, both public and private, against such an action.  When this was discussed at the video conference meeting of EU foreign ministers of 15 May, there was broad agreement that the EU and its member states should convey our concerns directly to the new Israeli Government.  That outreach is ongoing.  I welcome the very clear statements by the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, Josep Borrell, who has stated that annexation could not pass unchallenged and would inevitably have significant negative consequences for the relationship between the EU and Israel.\u00a0<\/p><p>Ireland consistently takes the opportunity to raise this issue at the UN.  At the Security Council, Ireland recently outlined our position on annexation in a statement issued on 21 July.  This follows previous Irish statements on the Middle East in the council in April and January of this year.  Ireland also spoke out against annexation at the meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on 15 June.<\/p><p>Annexation would seriously undermine efforts to find a negotiated solution that respects the legitimate positions of both parties.  I will continue to work to keep this issue on the international agenda and to prioritise the Middle East peace process, among other issues, as we prepare to take up our seat on the UN Security Council next January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800052#EEE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1595949900,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Even prior to formal annexation, the settlements, which the Israeli Government has promised to maintain at all costs, obviously constitute a de facto annexation.

I understand why Irish people have been frustrated by moves that have damaged the prospect of a two-state solution.  Expanding settlements is part of that, as well as other decisions that have been made, in particular in regard to Jerusalem in recent years.  What we are about right now is sending a very clear signal to a new Israeli Government, which is a different government from the previous one.  It is a coalition government comprising a number of different parties that have different perspectives on how they should approach this issue.  The focus should be on intense diplomacy and clear language to provide a deterrent to the extension of Israeli sovereignty to lands in the West Bank, which are Palestinian lands.  Any change in borders has got to be negotiated and agreed by both parties and not simply imposed by one.

That is what has been achieved.  What has to happen next is that we have to use that privilege and ensure that while on the Security Council we make a real difference, in many of the areas that I hope all parties in this House will be able to support.  Ireland's membership of the Security Council will be guided by the principles and values enshrined in the UN Charter, which have informed Irish foreign policy over many decades.<\/p>  <p>  I will highlight three overarching principles that will guide our approach.  The first is building peace, including championing the UN's role in peacekeeping, reinforcing the link between peacekeeping and peace-building, and further developing co-operation on peace and security between the UN and regional organisations.  We need to ensure that peace is inclusive and fully involves civil society, particularly women and young people.<\/p>  <p>  The second is preventing conflict.  This means strengthening the full spectrum of the UN's conflict prevention activities, including preventative diplomacy, mediation and non-proliferation and disarmament, and addressing the structural drivers of conflict and insecurity, particularly climate change.<\/p>  <p>  The third is ensuring accountability.  This means upholding the rule of law, in particular international humanitarian and human rights law, prioritising the protection of civilians in conflict, ensuring humanitarian access and fighting against impunity.<\/p>  <p>  As a member of the Security Council, we will make every effort to support the meaningful inclusion of marginalised persons and groups in its work.  We will aim to ensure that peace processes involve not only governments and the parties to conflicts, but also civil society, women and young people, from the very beginning and throughout the conflict cycle.  This is one of the lessons that we have learned from our own experience of conflict on this island.  This is also in keeping with the approach Ireland has adopted in its work in support of human rights and in on international development co-operation.  This inclusive approach will also inform our broader work across a wide range of issues on the agenda of the Security Council.

The UK's accession to the common transit convention is a key and positive step.  It is important to recognise that because the UK Government has decided to be part of that convention in an effort to be helpful.  This allows EU goods to transit through the UK without undergoing full customs export and import formalities on entry and exit.  In partnership with other EU land bridge countries and the European Commission, we recently addressed some sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, challenges affecting Irish-EU goods transiting the UK back into the EU.  We will continue to work with these partners on land bridge issues.<\/p>  <p>  I have had numerous discussions with my counterparts in the UK and across the EU.  All understand the importance we attach to maintaining the land bridge as an effective route to market.  The UK Government published its border operating manual recently.  Officials from a number of Departments held a voice chat with their British counterparts to better understand their approach to applying controls on goods moving between the EU and Great Britain, including transit.  There remains a risk of substantial delays on parts of the land bridge route between the UK and France, for example, Dover-Calais, the Eurotunnel and possibly Holyhead.  While we can work to address these at the EU end, there is little we can do to mitigate the impact on Irish traders arising from queues in the UK.  In other words, what we have done is effectively secured a commitment from countries such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands that when goods arrive from the UK on Irish trucks, these trucks will enter the green lane and will not be treated the same as UK trucks arriving because the Irish trucks will be coming from another part of the Single Market and re-entering the Single Market.  The challenge for us will be in the UK.  If there are significant traffic queues to get on ships in Dover, for example, I do not envisage a situation where Irish trucks will be allowed to skip the queue.  That is where the blockage is likely to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800058#LLL00100","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1595953500,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comments.

The concern is what will happen in the UK, which is, to a large degree, out of the State's hands.  In particular, any delays involving perishable goods would have serious consequences.  Perishable items such as meat or fish that need to be transported to the Paris markets, for example, are no good if there is a delay getting them there.  One truck driver told me that nobody buys turkeys on St. Stephen's Day so if perishable products do not get to market on time, they are no good.<\/p>  <p>  I stress the potential of Rosslare Europort, which is ideally located.

Further facilities will come on line before the end of the year.  A big warehouse facility is due to be finished before the end of the year.  Shipping companies have been looking at potential direct routes from Dublin and Rosslare to the Single Market and to various ports on the EU mainland, if one wants to call it that.  However, without doubt the fastest way to get fresh and chilled goods to market quickly, if the land bridge can be used efficiently and without significant blockages in queueing systems, is to drive across the UK and use shorter ferry routes.  We want to try to ensure the land bridge can be used efficiently in the future but we expect some teething problems.  That has been predicted for some time and I have no evidence to suggest that the issues will be easily ironed out.

A step which would so clearly undermine prospects for a two-state solution could have a negative impact on stability more broadly, and this is not in anybody&rsquo;s interests.  A solution involving two states for two peoples, living side by side in peace, is the only outcome for Israelis and Palestinians that we will support.  <\/p><p>I do not see annexation as an inevitable development.  It has not happened yet and that is why Ireland has not been forced to take actions in response to annexation.  I firmly believe it would be against the interests of Israelis as well as Palestinians, and this is borne out by the fact that there is considerable unease about this proposal within Israel itself and within the Israeli Government.

The Israeli Government, when making its choices, will look at what happened to it the last time it breached international law and it has been able to act with impunity.

I wish her well in her role, and particularly so as the first woman to hold that position.  All very best wishes to her.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to be here to introduce this important legislation.  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill 2020 is in many ways a straightforward piece of legislation which has two interrelated key purposes.  The first is to place the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, on a solid statutory basis within the framework of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, while the second is to provide that employees who have been directly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic will have their social insurance records protected.  <\/p> <p>The House will recall that when the economy had to be largely shut down in mid-March, my Department responded to this unprecedented emergency by introducing the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  To enable this payment to be made quickly and regularly to a large number of people and households, my Department relied on section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act as the legal basis for this emergency payment.  Essentially, the pandemic payment was paid as an urgent payment under the legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  While this was appropriate at the time because it was an urgent response, the extension of the period for which the PUP is being made means that it is now appropriate to place it on a discrete statutory footing.  Doing so will also mean that we can make arrangements to attribute full social insurance contributions to recipients of the payment.<\/p> <p> I want to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the staff of the Department for the extraordinary efforts they put in, most especially in those early weeks, to ensure that 1.2 million weekly income support payments were processed.  In total, approximately 800,000 individuals have received at least one payment under the pandemic unemployment scheme, with the total number receiving payment at any one time peaking at just over 600,000.  While a great deal of work continues to be done, it is right that we acknowledge the outstanding public service delivered at that particularly difficult time.<\/p> <p> The House will know that on foot of the announcement of the July stimulus package last Thursday, the Government will introduced some further changes to the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment with effect from 17 September.  These changes will be introduced by way of regulation under the Bill before us today.  I will refer to them when I am going through the various sections of the Bill.  A primary purpose of the Bill is to ensure that we have the necessary legislative backing for a measure which offers support to those employees who would, in the ordinary course and were it not for Covid-19, have expected to continue in employment and to sustain and enhance their social insurance contribution records.  This Bill will allow my Department to attribute these employees with paid PRSI contributions.  This will ensure that they will maintain their entitlements to short-term payments, as well as enhancing their PRSI records for long-term entitlements such as the State pension.<\/p> <p> I will now take Members through the various provisions of the Bill.  Sections 1, 2 and 3 provide for the standard provisions as to the Short Title and construction of the Bill and the commencement provisions and definitions used in the Bill.  While the establishment of the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment will take effect on enactment, section 2 provides that PRSI contributions may be attributed back to 13 March when the economy paused.  <\/p> <p> Section 4 of the Bill provides for the insertion of new definitions into the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 arising from the Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 5 is another standard provision which extends the list of regulatory powers which require the formal consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Any regulations made under this Bill will require the consent and signature of that Minister.<\/p> <p> Section 6 of this Bill amends section 7 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, which identifies what expenditure should be charged to the Social Insurance Fund.  This section simply provides that my Department will work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to determine how much of the PUP expenditure incurred to date should now be properly charged to the Social Insurance Fund.  Given that many people in receipt of PUP had an underlying entitlement to jobseekers' benefit, any expenditure on the Covid-19 PUP benefit will, following enactment of this legislation, automatically be charged to the Social Insurance Fund.  This is an accounting mechanism that does not have any impact on the entitlements of claimants.<\/p> <p> Section 7 is another technical amendment which is required to confirm that a self-employed contributor is entitled to claim the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.<\/p> <p> Section 8 inserts a new chapter 6A into the Social Welfare Consolidation Act specifically to address a key objective of the Bill, namely, the attribution of paid social insurance contributions.  This new chapter defines the cohorts to whom contributions may be attributed.  These will be predominantly those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance, as well as those on the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, who have lost their employment since 13 March 2020 as a result of the public health crisis arising from Covid-19.  The new chapter also formally provides that employers and employees who have availed of the TWSS are exempted from the requirement to make the social insurance contributions which apply generally to all employed contributors and their employees.  It also formalises the arrangements whereby employers availing of the TWSS are required to pay a notional 0.5% rate of PRSI in respect of any top-up payments to the employee.  The amount of the subsidy paid to the employee is exempted from PRSI.<\/p> <p> The new chapter also clarifies that the contribution will be attributed at the same rate as that previously paid.  Put simply, if the employee was paying class A social insurance contributions before losing that employment as a result of Covid-19, then the attributed contribution will also be a class A contribution.  For the avoidance of doubt, a provision is included to confirm that information may be exchanged between this Department and the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that employees benefiting from the TWSS can be identified and have paid contributions attributed to them.<\/p> <p> Section 9 is a technical amendment which formally identifies the new Covid-19 PUP as a social insurance benefit within the social welfare code.<\/p> <p> Section 10 is a technical amendment to reflect the fact that section 2 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 will now include a definition of Covid-19 and it avoids repetition of that definition elsewhere in the Act.<\/p> <p> Section 11 inserts a new chapter 12B into the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to provide for the establishment of the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment scheme in its own right.  Within this new chapter, the new section 68L confirms the existing general conditions of eligibility for Covid-19 PUP, while the new section 68M confirms the PRSI contribution conditions.  The new section 68N provides for the duration of the payment to be set by regulation.  Following the launch of the stimulus package last week, I will be introduce regulations in September to specify that new applications for the payment will be accepted until 17 September.  The new section 68O provides that the weekly rates of Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment are set out in Part 6 of Schedule 2 to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  Again, in line with the stimulus package, I will provide for revised rates by way of regulation in September.  The new section 68P sets out the arrangements which apply when regulations are being introduced in relation to the Covid-19 PUP.<\/p> <p> Section 12 is a technical amendment to allow for regulations on late claims to be introduced.<\/p> <p> Section 13 of the Bill amends Schedule 2 to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 by introducing a new Part 6 to that schedule, specifying the rates of Covid-19 PUP.  These are the rates which apply currently and, as I said, I will be introducing regulations to provide the revised rates, as announced, in September.<\/p> <p> In summary, and against a background where much of our legislation has necessarily been concerned with the more negative aspects of the pandemic, the Bill before us today is here for positive reasons.  We are putting the pandemic unemployment payment on a statutory footing, which will allow for the Minister or an Accounting Officer to be properly accountable to the Oireachtas and its committees in respect of the scheme.  We are also protecting the position of employees who have lost their employment because of the Covid-19 measures in terms of their entitlement to social insurance benefits.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800061#OOO02600","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595956500,"counter":456,"content":"<p>We move on to Sinn F&eacute;in.

Social protection is important given the times we are in.  It is the bedrock of any society and its primary purpose at all times is to protect those who need it most.  Everyone will need it at some time in their lives, yet, despite this fact, on more than one occasion we have seen an ugly side to the Government when it comes to those who rely on social welfare supports.  We all remember the infamous welfare cheats cheat us all campaign, brought to us by An T&aacute;naiste. <\/p><p>  There are positive aspects to the Bill, such as ensuring that employees who are relying on the PUP and TWSS will have their social insurance contributions taken into account during this period.  However, they have been overshadowed by the Government's targeting of those in receipt of the PUP.  Not only have there been threats to stop people's payments, but they have been stopped in the case of 104 people that we know of.  It is regrettable that the Government did not address this issue over the past few days, in particular over the weekend. <\/p><p>There is a need for clarity on what exactly is going on.  The T&aacute;naiste was very clear when he spoke on television over the weekend that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is getting information from airports.  Questions about this need to be answered by the Minister.  On what legal grounds are staff from her Department obtaining information from passengers in airports?  Since what date have those staff been in airports?  What exactly is their role?  What information are they collecting?  What role do the Garda play in this departmental mission?<\/p><p>Yesterday, we heard a gentleman tell his story on &quot;Liveline&quot;.  He was approached in the airport by two garda&iacute; and told there was an immigration check.  When he returned to Ireland, his PUP had been stopped.  The Department had details of the flight he was on, including the time, date and destination.  We know this is happening. <\/p><p>We also know that the Department's website was updated to state that no jobseeker would continue to be paid his or her payment if he or she went abroad.  Does that include people who go abroad to countries listed on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's green list?  Legally, can that change be made through a publication on a Department's website rather than by legislation?  There has been utter confusion from start to finish about travel and Covid-19, but one thing the Government has been crystal clear on is that only those in receipt of the PUP will be punished if they go abroad.<\/p><p>I am concerned about the condition under section 11 that to receive the payment, people must be seeking work.  Those in receipt of the payment are not automatically jobseekers.  Some are simply waiting for their workplaces to reopen.  For example, some substitute teachers are in receipt of the PUP.  Should they seek alternative employment?  If so, where,?  Should bar workers who are waiting for their pubs to reopen seek alternative employment? <\/p><p>Those in receipt of the PUP lost their jobs through no fault of their own and the Government should not add conditions so that those who are relying on this payment can keep it.  I have tabled an amendment to remove this condition and I ask the Minister to consider it. <\/p><p>I also want to make reference to the limit to pensionable age in the same section.  We all know that those aged 66 and over were given no support when they lost work.  Some were self-employed and received nothing when their businesses failed or they had to stop working because of Covid-19.  They were left stranded.<\/p><p>I also want to make reference to the rates payable for the self-employed.  More than 15,000 self-employed people have seen their payments reduce from &euro;350 to &euro;203 and their base rate has been determined by tax returns from 2018.  I ask the Minister to consider allowing the self-employed to make a self-declaration on their 2019 income to ensure they do not suffer unfairly because of a rate based on 2018 rather than 2019.  That is causing considerable difficulties for the self-employed and their families. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800063#QQQ00400","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1595956500,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Imp&iacute;m ar an Aire tac&uacute; i gceart le heala&iacute;ont&oacute;ir&iacute; agus ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann go h&aacute;irithe, agus d&eacute;anamh cinnte nach mbeadh aon ghearradh siar ar an PUP d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; gafa leis an gcruach&aacute;s san earn&aacute;il seo.

For many thousands of those working in creative fields, the introduction of the PUP in March was very welcome.<\/p><p>Many of those who are self-employed or work as freelancers or others whose diaries were full at the time saw their work all but disappear overnight.  Many have been ably represented by the Music &amp;amp; Entertainment Association of Ireland, the Event Production Industry Covid-19 working group, EPIC and other groups or represent themselves.  Riggers, stagehands, dancers, security, ticket office staff, lighting, sound and many others make up the artistic and creative community in Ireland.  Many of them have had their pandemic unemployment payment cut or substantially reduced, and others are dreading further cuts in August.  One person said in a letter to me:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am not unemployed.  I am forced not to be employed as a direct result of Government guidelines. <\/blockquote>  <p>I read in a newspaper that the Minister said she believed that people should be actively seeking work.  If she believes that, will she tell the employers of all of these people that they need to issue P45s and redundancy payments?  That would be an absolute scandal and would go against anything that was intended.<\/p><p>I support what Deputy Kerrane said.  We should allow the self-employed to make a declaration of their income for 2019 in order that they can be properly assessed on their most recent income for the PUP into the future.  We should also remember that many of the self-employed only started their journey on self-employment last year and, therefore, only had declared income from employment and do not have declared income for 2018 unless they were directly employed. <\/p><p>The current rules also mean that a person who takes on a day's work loses the payment.  The nature of the creative industry is such that much of the sector will restart one day at a time and will not return to full employment for many months.  I ask the Minister to consider changing that provision so that people can take on some type of work.  Many have written to me to point out that they will lose opportunities to work for pay or will lose all social welfare payments because they have not filed their tax returns for this year and are not likely to do so in the next couple of months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800063#QQQ00500","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1595956500,"counter":460,"content":"<p>The PUP was a necessary blunt instrument at the beginning of this crisis.

Some of my colleagues have spoken about the weaknesses in the payment such as those relating to those of pension age.<\/p>  <p>  There are difficulties now that the rate has been cut.  There are problems for particular sole traders.

I believe it has been reinstated since but again we are in a quagmire with no clarity. <\/p> <p> A big issue in my constituency was the fact the PUP was not made available to people who work in towns such as my own of Dundalk and who came from the North, paid their PRSI and all their necessary taxes, including the USC, and who played a vital role in economy.  We were told that it was basically done and it was inferred it related to the EU.  However, the European Commission has given us information that the Government made the determination itself 100%.  That is an absolute travesty, particularly given the promises that had made by the previous Taoiseach and Government on never leaving Northern nationalists behind again. <\/p> <p>  We have a difficulty now that people who were living in the Twenty-six Counties but working in the North were covered by the PUP but they have now been cut to the lowest rate no matter what wage they were being paid.

Last week, that figure was 30,600 and, on 5 May, it was 61,900.  These figures show there has been a serious reduction in the number of people claiming the PUP and that people who have jobs are going back to work.  That is what this payment was there for.  These are not people who are unemployed; they have jobs and are waiting to go back to work.  Suggesting these people should look for jobs goes against the whole concept of this payment.  Unlike the recent Government advice, it is straightforward.  When their jobs are available, these people will go back to work.<\/p>  <p>  On 4 June, the then Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said that anyone who was working full time before the pandemic will not have their unemployment payment cut.  I spoke to a lady recently who was travelling to Scotland to visit a terminally ill relative.  She is now terrified about her return because she is in fear that her PUP will be cut.  How can it be justified that a person should be in this kind of fear when he or she is going to do something as important as this?  It goes to show the confusion around the Government's change of attitude towards people.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues and I have repeatedly raised the issue of those aged over 66 not qualifying for the PUP.  I was contacted by numerous people, including bus drivers and the self-employed.  In one case, a lady contacted me about her husband who is over 66 and who is a taxi driver.  He was told to cocoon and they did everything the health experts told them to.  She said that they have received virtually no support from the Government.  The hardship grant they applied for was not supported by the Government.  Those people, along with 21,000 others, did not receive the hardship grant because there was no support from this Government.  They also looked for a rebate on their motor tax because, as this man was cocooning, he was not driving his taxi.  The Government did not supply that either.  It was the one payment the Government could have given him if it could not give him the &euro;350.  If it was able to, at least, top up his payment to &euro;350, it would have gone some way to support this family.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has refused to support those over 66 during this pandemic.  ALONE was overwhelmed by the phone calls it was getting from elderly people who are suffering during the pandemic.  The Government did not step in support them.  Samaritans Ireland lent a hand to support ALONE in trying to deal with the thousands of calls it was getting from people who were worried and upset. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding those who are travelling, instead of Covid-testing passengers who are coming into airports, this Government is means-testing them.

D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle agus leis an Aire.<\/p>  <p>  In the beginning the words were \"comfort\" and \"health protection\".  Comfort came first for the millionaires and billionaires.  With Covid-19 they were assured there would be no penalties for the tax exiles outstaying their revenue welcome because we were all in this together.  We were all in this together for only as long as the Government needed the feel-good headlines.  In what passes for national conversation during the lockdown, the breathless \"Oohs\" and \"Aahs\" over the visitor visa for the Easter bunny drowned out the last gasps of our elderly in their nursing homes in north Kildare.  On social media, they muted the panic of the staff who we know now were fighting without PPE to protect and save their elderly patients and, indeed, to save themselves.  <\/p>  <p>  Now the headlines and the \"Oohs\" and \"Aahs\" have served their purpose.  The political babbling over.  Now we are down to business as usual.  While the millionaires and billionaires are still comforted and cosseted, those unlucky enough to lose their jobs are condemned.  In the political punch down, those who lost their jobs due to Covid must now look for work to get the Covid payment while keeping that link with their employer.  It is just absurd, but only marginally more absurd than the Government hiking their pay one day and cutting it the next, although it was agreed in principle few weeks ago, apparently.  Thank God we are all green here and we were all born yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  Not only were these unlucky workers condemned, they are now watched and reported on from the airports.  It is the kind of thing one would see in the authoritarian regime in North Korea.  I have written to the Minister about the collection and sharing of passenger information and the Data Protection Commission has done likewise.  There are serious questions to be answered by a Department still in data flux in respect of the legality of the public services card.  I have questions about the published criteria changing, about one group being treated exceptionally and about the EU ethics in this regard.  All this chaos could have been avoided if the Government had made clear statements about travelling.  People could have gotten their refunds and would not have felt they had to go on holidays because they would have lost out.  As I arrived into the D&aacute;il earlier before Leader's Questions, I heard about somebody who had lost their child benefit. <\/p> <p>They were aware of their rights and when, despite not being in receipt of the Covid payment, they were questioned at the airport on their return from holiday they found out that their child benefit was being lost.<\/p> <p> I also want to talk about the North-South aspect of this payment.  People who live in the North and work in the South have been abandoned by the Government.  That is not surprising when the T&aacute;naiste regards Belfast as overseas.  I would go so far as to say that the Government displays a disdain and spite for the working and claiming poor throughout the country.  It is a virus in this Government and electorally Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party are not immune.  When the picnic in the park slips, it slips entirely.  The working and claiming poor get cold-hearted public campaigns about cheating us all and now they are getting the tap on the shoulder.  The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s outing on \"The Week in Politics\" over the weekend signals that the mean girls&rsquo; giggling is over, but the mean Government is here to stay.  It is no longer \"more to do\" from Fianna F&aacute;il.  I think Fianna F&aacute;il is already done in - done in by Fine Gael.  As for the Green Party, in the chaos of this Government I am sure it can smell the wolves already. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800064#RRR00600","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595957700,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I apologise to Deputy Cronin for miscalling her in the beginning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800065#SSS00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1595957700,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Let us be 100% clear.  Joan Burton had nothing to do with the changes to the PUP brought by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on 12 July through the statutory instrument, SI 242\/2020.  With no public notice, the Minister changed the rules for the Covid-19 PUP and for other unemployment payments meaning that recipients could not take holidays abroad.  Previously, they were allowed two weeks in any calendar year for a holiday without losing entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  The Taoiseach has now said there should be a review of cases where people who travelled were not aware they were at risk of losing their income.<\/p><p>Some 104 individuals had the PUP stopped in the last two weeks following checks at airports and a further 44 had benefits such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance cut off.  Today on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;, the Minister for Education and Skills said the statutory instrument was not discussed at Cabinet, which is not unusual.  However, was the advice of the Attorney General sought?  That is a key question in all of this.  There are questions about the legal standing of the regulations, as the travel advisory on which it is based has no legal standing.  As the people were not informed of the changes, there is a legitimate expectation they could travel under the normal rules that previously applied.<\/p><p>Since 2007, social welfare regulations have provided that recipients of jobseeker's benefit can leave the State for two weeks of holidays.  The Minister's regulations changed that.  The T&aacute;naiste said on Sunday that people are now required to be genuinely seeking work if on the pandemic unemployment payment.  However, does that apply to those working in a pub or the entertainment industry?  The <i>gov.ie<\/i>website was changed on Monday to reflect this comment.  The Government has still not clarified this.  It is not clear if there has been a regulation stipulating that those on the pandemic unemployment payment must be actively seeking work now.  The Taoiseach has now ordered an investigation into how the Government website was changed.  The Data Protection Commissioner has asked the Department how it is getting data to block benefit payments.<\/p><p>There are key questions.  As it is a statutory instrument based on advice from another Department, is the travel ban legal?  Did the Attorney General sign off on this?  Is there a change in the conditions that apply to the pandemic unemployment payment?  Must people be actively seeking work since Monday when the website was changed?  Was this decided at Cabinet?  Is there a new regulation?  From where are the data being used to stop people coming?  What are the reasonable grounds that apply and why are people being stopped in the airport not being told it is for social welfare purposes?<\/p><p>I go back to Joan Burton.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 provided powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist with tackling fraud, but it is the Minister who changed the rules without notice earlier this month.  The legal basis for these checks is section 250(16) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by section 17 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012.  The issue here is how the regulations are changed, not social welfare inspectors at the airport.<\/p><p>Since March of this year, more than 2,000 pandemic unemployment payment claims have been closed as a result of checks carried out at Dublin Airport.  We do not know how the Department is accessing and processing all this information.  From anecdotal reports, it appears people are not being told when stopped that this is for social welfare control.  Under the law, a social welfare inspector accompanied by a garda or a garda acting for the Department must have reasonable grounds for believing that there has been a contravention of the Act.  The anecdotal evidence we have heard on various radio shows today from people who have been stopped does not seem to reflect the grounds laid out in the law.<\/p><p>The Minister and her Department have not clarified why she did not publicise the change in the regulations over two weeks ago when she introduced the statutory instrument.  The Department changed the guidance online on <i>gov.ie\/welfare<\/i>on Monday following the T&aacute;naiste's comments on &quot;The Week in Politics&quot;.  It was the Fine Gael Minister who changed the rules for people on the pandemic unemployment payment without clearing it through the Cabinet or telling the public.  It is not clear if welfare recipients are allowed to travel to a green list country.  The statutory instrument refers to the general travel advisory from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Government has not provided a definition of what essential travel is, nor has it banned people from leaving the country.<\/p><p>From where are the data for checking people leaving the country coming?  Is it on the basis of Garda checks at the airport?  What are the reasonable grounds being used?  Garda&iacute; are asking people for their names, addresses and PPS numbers, but not telling them it is for the purpose of social welfare checks.  What are the reasonable grounds for believing there has been a contravention?  The people are demanding that these questions be answered.<\/p><p>I refer the Minister to a COVID-19 law and human rights observatory document which was published by Dr. Mel Cousins of Trinity College Dublin.  It is a very interesting document entitled, Pandemic Unemployment Payment: Holidays in the Sun?  I will cite some extracts from it.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tUnlike most social welfare payments, PUP is based on an (unpublished) administrative scheme.Thus the normal rules in relation to claims, payments, decisions, appeals, etc. set out in the Social Welfare Acts do not apply.  However, this does not mean that the scheme can be operated on an arbitrary basis and the normal rules of administrative (and human rights) law apply.  So the question arises as to what is the legal basis for the decision not to make payments to people on holidays and on their return? <\/blockquote>  <p>That is a very legitimate question that demands clarification from the Minister and her Department.<\/p> <p>The document goes on to state:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe legal change to [jobseeker's benefit] was made as of 10 July.  It is not clear when exactly the change was made to the PUP conditions although it has been made as of 27 July.  Principles of administrative law would not seem to allow persons to be disqualified for a benefit on the basis of a rule which had not yet been made or of which they were unaware so the rule concerning non-payment of PUP abroad would seem to apply somewhere between 10 and 27 July (whenever it was actually made and notified to claimants). <\/blockquote> <p>This is another valid point this eminent legal practitioner has raised.  It deserves attention and it deserves to be answered.<br\/><br\/>Every point I have just raised is pertinent to the legislation.  I will briefly speak to certain sections.  We acknowledge that section 6 provides that some of the expenditure incurred to date on the PUP, which has been paid as a supplementary welfare allowance or urgent needs payment, may be charged to the Social Insurance Fund.  What is the monetary implication of this measure for the Social Insurance Fund?  Is this a raid on cash to avoid raising taxes or borrowing?  Does this risk destabilising the already weakened fund?  Is this a retrospective measure?  Are we to draw on the fund to cover costs that have been incurred through this supplementary welfare allowance?  If so, is this kind of retrospective legislation constitutional?  I again seek clarity from the Minister on that point.  There was set to be a hefty surplus in the fund, which had been identified as a source of funding to allow for the delay in raising the pension entitlement age.  Will this window of opportunity now be closed?  <br\/><br\/>Section 6 provides that some of the expenditure incurred to date on the PUP, which has been paid on a special welfare allowance or urgent needs payment, may be charged to the Social Insurance Fund.  That is worth repeating.  There is no link, however, between social insurance contributions and eligibility for the PUP.  Students, for examples, would not have sufficient PRSI contributions recorded.  Depleting the Social Insurance Fund surplus, especially when it is likely to come under pressure to pay for insolvency and redundancy payments, does not seem to be sound public policy.  <br\/><br\/>Section 9 is a technical amendment, which formally identifies the new Covid-19 PUP as a social insurance benefit within the social welfare code.  If the PUP becomes a social welfare entitlement based on payment of social insurance, will that change the situation for people travelling abroad?  I have already spoken to this issue.  Jobseeker's benefit, for example, is payable for up to two weeks of holiday abroad if travel advice is followed.  It appears, however, that quarantine is not covered.  If people travel abroad to seek work or to visit family for sound medical reasons, or if they travel within our common travel area with the UK or within the EU Common Market, can they be denied a social insurance-related entitlement?  As time goes by, there may be increased numbers of people on the PUP going abroad to seek work.  Their entitlement to a stable income needs to be secured.  <br\/><br\/>If the new definition of PUP ends up excluding people who were entitled to it as a form of supplementary welfare allowance, will the older form of PUP still be available to prevent people losing their incomes or dropping to a much lower level of income?  As we all know, supplementary welfare allowance is based on open rules, which allow discretion, and allows for people to be given money in a variety of circumstances.  It seems likely that any legislating for PUP will tighten the criteria and exclude people who may be in dire need of a supplementary welfare allowance payment.  This is again something I hope the Minister will clarify.<br\/><br\/>Like other speakers, I would also like to speak on behalf of those involved in the entertainment and culture sector.  As Members, we will all have received emails from the Music &amp;amp; Entertainment Association of Ireland.  I will quote the email that I received from somebody involved in that group:<\/p><blockquote>\tI am writing to you as a member of the Music &amp;amp; Entertainment Association of Ireland (MEAI) to express my anger at the lack of proper support for self-employed workers in the July Stimulus. <br \/><br \/>The Minister for Arts in her support package for the Arts, has failed utterly to understand how my profession works.  As a self-employed musician\/entertainer I do not need a &lsquo;Stimulus Package&rsquo; - I need a Survival Package. <br \/><br \/>As a worker in this industry, I am unable to earn a living due to the Government Guidelines on Social Distancing.  My industry is sacrificing its right to work and earn a living in order to help protect the health of the nation during this pandemic. <br \/><br \/>I am not unemployed.  I am forced not to be employed as a direct result of Government guidelines. <br \/><br \/>My colleagues in the industry are facing hardship like never before.  MEAI conducted a survey of its 4,100 members recently. <br \/><br \/>- 68.5% depend solely on the Music &amp;amp; Entertainment sector for their income. <br \/><br \/>- 31.6% had their PUP cut to the reduced rate and are now struggling to get by. <br \/><br \/>- 11.6% [have] utility bills [that are] in arrears. <br \/><br \/>- 9.7% had to sell essential equipment to cover household expenses. <br \/><br \/>- 7% have lost or are in danger of losing their vehicle. <br \/><br \/>- 3.4% in danger of losing their home. <br \/><br \/>- 17.4% are dealing with mental health worries as a result of the financial stress.  <\/blockquote> <p>The nub of what this group is asking for is an immediate reinstatement of the PUP payment of &euro;350 a week from 7 July 2020 for all its members for the duration of the crisis and until the industry is able to reopen without social distancing.  That is not an unreasonable request and I hope the Minister will give some consideration to the thousands of people in this sector who are affected by the cut to this payment.<br\/><br\/>The Covid-19 working group of the event production industry also wrote to me.  I will again quote from an email from one of its members:<\/p><blockquote>\tI&rsquo;ve spoken to 3 companies today, all in business 20+ years.  One with 6 staff, the other two have 20 plus staff.  One is an event safety consultants, one is Event Power and the final one is a sound &amp;amp; lighting company.  All three will be out of business by Sept 1st.  This package is devastating for SMEs in general but it&rsquo;s essentially a death sentence for those operating in the Live Entertainment Sector. <\/blockquote> <p>This person goes on to say:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe removal of the COVID payment to proprietary directors seems to illustrate a basic understanding of small and medium sized business.<br \/><br \/>Small business owners :<br \/><br \/>- Tend to be majority shareholders <br \/><br \/>- Tend to be employees <br \/><br \/>- are the first people into work in the morning and the last people paid - most business owners pay their staff first when times are tough<br \/><br \/>- Have personal equity tied up in the businesses e.g. houses tied to business loans. <\/blockquote> <p>These are not wealthy people.  This person continues:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe events industry is made up of hundreds of small businesses and sole traders who, although normally profitable, are depending on the COVID payments many having sunk savings and personal assets into their enterprises.<br \/><br \/>Simply owning your own business now singles you out for further impoverishment on top of the many responsibilities of company ownership and, in one swoop the government is crushing the one group who should be supported having already proven that they have the strength and drive to create a company and jobs.  <\/blockquote> <p>I will make reference to my own local area where, in 2019, the Indiependence festival in Mitchelstown generated in excess of &euro;500,000 in VAT alone for the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>This festival should have been going into its 15th edition this week, with 15,000 people descending on Mitchelstown and spending in excess of &euro;1.5 million locally.  There is nothing in the stimulus package to help events such as this to survive the next 12 months so that they can return to generating large sums for the Exchequer when the public health advice allows for same.<br\/><br\/>I again ask the Minister to please give consideration to the people who are working within this sector, with a view to revising the rules to allow them not to fall below a social floor, whereby they lose those vital protections to sustain themselves throughout this crisis.<br\/><br\/>I started off my submission in respect of the issues of the past 24 hours.  I have asked a litany of questions.  I am very hopeful that the Minister will respond to the questions I have asked because at this stage the public demands clarity in respect of the PUP and the stopping of people at airports in this State.  That has really upset thousands of genuine people going about their business and acting within the law as they see it, rather than<i>ultra vires<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800065#SSS00300","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595958900,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that there is much merit in this Bill and short of a couple of important points I would like to support it.  When I came into this Chamber in February, I wanted to be somebody who would be constructive in my engagement, who would try to find merit and who would try to work collaboratively and not simply oppose a Bill just because it came from somebody who had different beliefs about the world from mine.  However, there are significant parts of the Bill that would make it enormously difficult for me to support.  I want to tease those out with the Minister and, if possible, try to amend them to make a Bill that is fair and equitable, has a sense of decency and treats people equally.<\/p>  <p>  When the PUP was introduced in March, it was an extraordinarily appropriate measure from the Government.  It was done promptly and it gave a sense of safety to people.  It acknowledged that the previous welfare rate of &euro;203 was simply not enough to live on.  Many of us had been advocating that for a long time.  It recognised that to afford decency to people so that they might feed their families and not have to worry about the next bill coming through the door, it was an appropriate measure to give them a payment of &euro;350.  I recall talking to the then Minister, now Senator Regina Doherty, about the measure, and being sceptical and wondering if there would be a clawback.  We were assured that would not happen and that the &euro;350 would be spent very quickly in the local economy.  It would be spent in butchers' shops and on the local high street.  It would help rejuvenate an economy that was asked to stop.  That is what the PUP was supposed to do.  It fostered a sense of cohesion and gave us a sense that we were all in this together and the State had our back.<\/p>  <p>  Then the dark clouds started to emerge and the Government started to fall back into bad old habits.  The first group to receive less than the PUP was students who were told that as they were not working full time in March, they would not get the full &euro;350.  We did not even take into consideration that the same cohort of people would be working full time now and would be using the money to spend throughout the economy over the next year or so.  Then we found the TWSS would not apply to women returning from maternity leave.  That created another couple of weeks of furore and that still has not been addressed.  Now here we are falling back into that old trope that people on welfare are somehow gaming the system.  Sometimes I have to acknowledge the fact that this seems to happen at times a Government is under pressure.  We are presented with a distraction that people are in our airports, taking our money and going overseas.  That will not be allowed.  We need to confront that mentality every step of the way.<\/p>  <p>  When did the Covid-19 pandemic end?  One would think that such a victory would have merited more headlines but it seems that I missed them.  What other explanation is there for the Government's insistence that people on the PUP should return to work?  Entire sectors that shut down must have reopened after the T&aacute;naiste's television appearance at the weekend, or did it happen on 10 July when the Minister signed the statutory instrument to the effect that travel advice issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade effectively had a legal impact on just one small section of society who happened to avail of social welfare supports?  Or is there a far more sinister explanation, whereby the new Government, which is not too dissimilar to the previous Government or the one that came before that, is using the bogey person of those on social welfare as a scapegoat?  For this Government it is not as simple as telling people to get a job.  The pandemic has made it much more difficult now because we all know the reality.  Aside from the economic implications for small businesses of encouraging their staff to seek other jobs, ensuring that they incur costs and delays in recruitment when they intend to reopen, it means that staff now have to be issued with their P45s and redundancy payments, except, as I understand it, workers on the PUP cannot seek redundancy.  How can they seek employment, therefore, if they are not technically unemployed?  This is a huge gap in the Bill that will need to be rectified before we can pass it.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to change the rules.  Seeking work will have a massive implication for employers and employees, in particular around links between employers and employees and also access to redundancy.  The Government should not go ahead with these changes at all because they will destroy any sense of social cohesion that we so successfully fostered during the pandemic and because the work is not available.  The Bill must not go through with these changes until statutory redundancy rights can be restored.  This is not a minor point.<\/p>  <p>  We are more than 120 days into the situation whereby Debenhams' workers are still sitting outside Debenhams stores throughout the country because they were prohibited from accessing redundancy.  We need to make sure we change this and we should not let the Bill pass without acknowledging that.  Will the Minister provide the urgently required reassurance that employers will not be able to make employees redundant without them being able to seek redundancy?  This abuse of workers, ignored in recent weeks by the Government, is not something that should be further sanctioned by changes in public policies just because the Taoiseach went on television over the weekend and had a rant.  In recent days, backbench Government Deputies have gone on the airwaves and told the Government and anyone who will listen what a terrible and unfair idea this is.<\/p>  <p>  I have a second question for the Minister.  Will she assure us of the legality of the welfare morality checks that are happening at airports?  I listened to the radio in recent days and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, which is far more of an authority on this than any Fine Gael Minister or parliamentarian who wishes to advocate this measure, has been very clear.  The checks on passengers to establish if they were in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment of &euro;350 were discriminatory without any real justification being offered by the Government for their use.  My colleague, Deputy Shortall, asked the Taoiseach during question time earlier about the legal grounds underpinning the measure.  He could not really answer the question but he mentioned the Social Welfare Act 2012.  That has been proven to be incorrect.  The issue first came into the public consciousness on Sunday.  We have had any number of television and radio appearances from Ministers and Government backbenchers.  We have an all-day session in the D&aacute;il today and we still have no clarity on the legal grounds on which people are being discriminated against in our airports.  Mr. Liam Herrick of the ICCL raised some serious concerns on the radio this morning.  The advice on travel is just for one section of society, namely, those who are not on welfare, yet it has the force of law for all those who are on welfare.  Are they welfare checks or are they morality checks?<\/p>  <p>  My third question relates to how, as the T&aacute;naiste put it, Departments are getting information from airports.  Does the Minister accept that raises very serious concerns with regard to where the information came from and whether it has been lawfully obtained and shared?  These are dangerous issues that require clarification, in particular regarding freedom of movement and discrimination.  We must ask how people are being targeted at our airports and before we can pass this Bill we must understand the ramifications of it for people.  Is racial or ethnic profiling ongoing?  Are people from minority communities being targeted in our airports?<\/p>  <p>  I would also like questions answered immediately on where the advice to start targeting people at airports came from.  Did it come from the Cabinet?  Was it brought to the Cabinet?  A senior Minister said today on the radio that it was not.  Is that correct?  Did the Minister seek advice on its legality from the Attorney General?  Given her continued insistence that we do not need a travel ban, did she have any evidence of mass fraud or even of hundreds of people leaving the country while in receipt of the payment?<\/p> <p>Those are important questions.<\/p> <p> I will touch briefly on another sector of society which is being unfairly discriminated against by this measure, namely, the arts community.  It is welcome that all the previous speakers have raised this issue.  The Minister was previously the Minister with responsibility for culture and the arts and introduced some very worthy measures in that area.  Does she accept that the arts community is crying out for assistance at this time?  We will need the arts more than ever as the economy reopens.  We will need them to help us gather once again with friends and be comfortable in that situation.  We will need them to help us laugh and cry, and understand the trauma of the months of this pandemic.  While we expect them to meet those needs, the Government is once again asking members of the arts community to live in poverty.  That is what is being asked of them with this measure.  They will not be able to avail of the payment of &euro;350.  We have all been contacted by hundreds of artists in recent days who will be living in poverty if this measure is passed tonight.  That is unacceptable.  We ask so much of our arts community and have offered it little in return.  We have gone from having one of the lowest levels of arts sector funding in the EU to bringing in a measure that afforded artists some sense of dignity during the pandemic.  Now we are about to strip that away while at the same time asking artists to keep creating world renowned work as they have done up to this point.  That that needs to change.  We need to respect our artistic community.<\/p> <p> I seek your advice, a Cheann Comhairle.  I have an amendment to this Bill.  Is now the appropriate time to move it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800067#UUU00200","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595959500,"counter":474,"content":"<p>No, we will deal with amendments during the Committee and Report Stage debates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800068#VVV00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1595959500,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I will speak again then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800068#VVV00300","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1595959500,"counter":476,"content":"<p>We move to Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800068#VVV00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1595959500,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Hello.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800068#VVV00500","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1595959500,"counter":478,"content":"<p>All the world is a stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800068#VVV00600","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1595959500,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I wish I could be light-hearted about this Bill but unfortunately I cannot.  This is disturbing evidence of the deceit and dishonesty that is starting to characterise this Government within a very short time of entering office.  One of the first deceits is that the note that was provided on this Bill made absolutely no reference to the fact that the Government was changing the goalposts on the pandemic unemployment payment, as far as eligibility was concerned.  Let us remind ourselves that this is a payment that was given to people who lost their jobs and incomes through no fault of their own.  Public health measures initiated by the Government meant that they lost their jobs.  The vast majority of people who continue to receive the payment are not at work because they cannot return to work due to Government health measures.  Now the Government wants to punish them.  Those necessary measures, which were correctly taken to protect society, led to people losing their jobs and income.  They are the reason people cannot return to work.  The Government now wants to punish, scapegoat and treat these people with utter contempt, to the point of humiliating them when they go on holiday in line with the advice on non-essential travel provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  That is what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  I know the answer to this and have been trying to blow the whistle on it since the weekend.  Most people did not even get it because it is the intersection of the Minister's statutory instrument and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade travel advice.  The Minister's statutory instrument says that getting the pandemic unemployment payment is conditional on following the travel advice but what the travel advice says is that non-essential travel to 13 countries is allowed.  I would bet however that the Department is taking the payment off people who are travelling to those 13 countries.  If they were to appeal, they would probably win and get the payment back because there is no legal basis whatever for taking it from them.  Of course, prior to the introduction of the statutory instrument, in April and June, the Department was also doing this.  There was not even a statutory instrument in place at that point.  I have received emails from people who were stopped at the airport at that time.  In one case, a man whose partner was going on holiday had her pandemic unemployment payment and child benefit cut.  It is absolutely unbelievable what is going on.  The Department had no legal basis for doing that at the time.<\/p>  <p>  What is behind this is naked class prejudice and racial profiling.  That is what is going on because it is okay for the rich or those who have been lucky enough to be able to return to employment to go to the green list countries.  I want to make clear, by the way, that as far as I am concerned we should all be following the NPHET advice of no non-essential travel.  It is the Government that is departing from that advice.  It is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that is departing from that advice.  Even today, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, said it was actually safer to travel to the 13 countries than it is to stay here.  This begs the question of whether we should perhaps all go to Greece, Italy or Cyprus because it would be safer, except it would not be safe for the Greeks, Italians and Cypriots because we would be taking the virus with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800068#VVV00700","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1595959500,"counter":480,"content":"<p>We would miss the Deputy here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800068#VVV00800","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1595959500,"counter":481,"content":"<p>Apparently that is okay but the Government is going to punish poor people, those who have lost their job through no fault of their own, for following the advice that is on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website.  That is what is going on.  It is shocking, as are the double standards behind it.  If the Taoiseach were to decide that he fancied going to Italy, Hungary or Cyprus, would he have his salary, which is public money, docked?  He would not.  The Government is singling out people on social welfare payments.  I got a message today from a carer who was stopped.  This was a carer taking a bit of respite.  This is sickening stuff.  I suppose I should expect it from Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il but for the Green Party to do this is utterly nauseating.  I would bet that if the Minister were to look at the list of 102 people, she would find certain common characteristics, namely, they would have foreign-sounding names or look a bit foreign, even though they are residents and citizens of this country.  That is what is really going on.<\/p>  <p>  The other thing that is really going on in this Bill is an attempt to whip people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own as a result of public health advice into low-paid employment in other jobs.  That is what the Government is doing.  It is giving itself the legal right to put pressure on people who work in the arts, in live entertainment and music to go to work in a McDonald's.  It is doing so to improve the employment figures and because deep in the soul of Fine Gael there is a hatred of people who, through no fault of their own in most cases, must depend on social welfare.  It is a deep prejudice that is stamped into the DNA of Fine Gael and it is nauseating.<\/p>  <p>  It would seem there was no legal basis for any of this until now and the Government is desperately trying to rectify the situation by retrospectively bringing in this legislation to legitimise the measures.  I would love it if the Minister would answer a direct question.  Have recipients of the pandemic unemployment payment and other social welfare payments who are complying with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade travel advice and going to one of the 13 countries had their payments cut?  I repeat that I am not suggesting people should go to those countries.  I am pointing out that the confusion about travel starts with the Government's advice.  It is the Government that is saying it is okay to go to certain countries in a departure from NPHET advice.  It is members of the Government who should have their payments docked for breaching health advice because NPHET and the expert advisory group have made it clear there should not be non-essential travel.  Ministers should have their pay docked for refusing to comply with that advice and endangering the public health effort.<\/p> <p>Crucially, and this is where it really is bad, all of the public health measures and the enthusiastic commitment of people to measures that meant they had to suffer significant hardship were dependent on the principle that we are all in it together.  That is why there was such compliance, because the measures applied to everybody.  Rich or poor, no matter what a person's station in life, we were supposed to be all in it together and we were all going to suffer the same hardships.  People believed this but it seems they were fools to believe it.  At the first opportunity, the Government reverted to type and started the discrimination, inequality and bias against the least well-off, the vulnerable and those who were unlucky enough to lose jobs and still not be able to get back to work because of the public health measures the Government imposed.  This is the truth of what is going on.  Really, I am at a loss for words as to what the Government is saying.<\/p> <p> I would love if the Minister got up and said the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is that people on the payments are allowed to go to one of the 15 countries on the list.  I reiterate that I do not think anybody should be allowed to go but it should apply to everybody.  I bet people on payments are not allowed and they are losing their payments.  This was clear when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade got up today and said the Government is saying nobody should go but the very same Minister states on the Department's website that it is okay to go to 15 countries.  However, the Government will only impose penalties on certain categories of people, who tend to be the less well-off, the vulnerable and those who have lost employment.<\/p> <p> We will try to amend the legislation.  I do have to say I am disappointed our other amendment was not taken, seeing as we facilitated a rushed Bill and guillotines but nonetheless we have tabled an amendment to take out this attempt to change the goalposts behind the pandemic unemployment payment and smash up, which is what the Government is doing, the principle of solidarity that underlay the public health measures.  It would be better if the Government accepted this but we will put it to a vote later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800068#VVV00900","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595960100,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I will not spend a lot of time making the argument this is discriminatory because its discriminatory character is blatant and obvious and the point does not need to be laboured.  It does not apply to a business person travelling abroad.  It does not apply to a worker travelling abroad.  It does apply to unemployed people travelling abroad.  It is discriminatory and it is blatant.<\/p><p>I want to make my first real point on the degree of the discrimination and the penalty for ordinary people who are unemployed through no fault of their own and what it will mean for them.  <i>The Business Post<\/i>reported at the weekend that unemployed people on the pandemic unemployment payment who go abroad, even to one of the 15 countries, will have their payments docked not just for the two weeks they are away but for two more weeks when they come back and have to go into quarantine and isolation.  The sum of &euro;350 multiplied by two multiplied by two means a cut of &euro;1,400 for the people who are at the bottom of the pile in society at present.  People on jobseeker's payments will lose &euro;203 multiplied by four, which is more than &euro;800 for people trying to survive on the bare minimum finance in this society.<\/p><p>Now, we discover it is actually more than this because the Department has issued a statement stating people will lose the two weeks' payments when they go abroad and two weeks' payments when they quarantine and they will have to reapply for the payment.  If a person returns to Ireland it is open to them, how nice, to reapply for the pandemic unemployment payment.  What will the delay be there?  Will everyone who applies get their payment back?  Will other people be left without the payment?  Will other people be downgraded to jobseeker's payments?  This is really vicious stuff against the poor and unemployed.  It is typical Fine Gael stuff and Fianna F&aacute;il is joining in the chorus and the Green Party is doing this also.  What a disgrace that is.<\/p><p>I want to read an email I received from a constituent today.  It is a powerful and strong email that raises interesting points that perhaps have not surfaced so far in this debate. It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tHello Mr. Barry,<br \/><br \/>I'm writing as one of your constituents in Cork City, to ask for your help.  It's recently come up that those of us on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment cannot travel abroad, even to a Green list country, without incurring a harsh financial penalty.<br \/><br \/>I was laid off like so many back in March.  Before then, I had bought airplane tickets to see family overseas and I paid with my own money while working a full-time job.  Now me, and many like me, are being penalised for something beyond our control.  I cannot go abroad to see family without losing several weeks of payments, nor can I get a refund from the airline because the government has not guaranteed refunds or shut down travel.<br \/><br \/>If it is the safety of the country that is the government's concern, then shut down all travel for everyone who is not an essential worker overseas.  It is unfair and frankly immoral to discriminate against people who are only even on social welfare because of a global pandemic.  There should be more COVID testing in airports, than social welfare officers.<br \/><br \/>I'm asking for your help in either challenging this restriction or in applying it fairly across the board.  A wealthy person can still go abroad without issue, while the poor are once again shunned in this country.  I have paid my taxes for years in Cork, worked long and hard hours on night shifts, only for me to be told by my country that I'm now suddenly less than and utterly undeserving of what the rest may freely have.  We need a more fair Ireland, where all citizens are treated equally under the law and none are discriminated against.<br \/><br \/>I appreciate you reading this and hope you understand my ire. <\/blockquote>  <p>I will leave the name of the woman who sent me this email out of the equation as I do not have her permission to read it.  The Minister should be ashamed of herself, as should other Ministers and Government Deputies, to listen to the words of this woman.  By the way, I read a report today that the change with regard to the holidays did not even come before the Government before it was announced.  What a shambles.<\/p><p>I have some points on the proposal to cut the pandemic unemployment payment later this year.  At present, the payment is &euro;350 per week and it is being cut to a maximum of &euro;300 from 17 September and for people whose incomes were between &euro;200 and &euro;300 at the time the payment was introduced it is being reduced to &euro;250 on 17 September.  The numbers on the pandemic unemployment payment are decreasing week by week but there will still be a lot of people on the payment come 17 September.  For them it is what puts food on the table, keeps a roof over their heads and keeps the wolf from the door.  Each and every one of them now faces having the payment cut by a minimum of &euro;50 and up to &euro;100 per week.  These are workers who through no fault of their own are unemployed in the course of this pandemic.  This is just reason and just cause for those people to band together and raise their voices and organise protests against this vicious cutback.  It is also something the trade union movement in this country should oppose and strongly speak out against.  If protests are organised it should back them and if they are not organised it should organise them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800069#WWW00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1595960100,"counter":484,"content":"<p>The next slot is the Rural Independent Group.

They cannot get the payment.  They were just shut down by this pandemic.  I have major questions about the pandemic, the way it has been handled and how it originated.  There is a cohort of entertainment people.  I love Gaeilge.  T&aacute; meas agam ar an nGaeilge, an ceol, an craic, an chaint agus an rince.  Fuair Big Tom b&aacute;s.  He was from the Minister's county.  What an entertainer he was.  Every entertainer from the small boyeen with the fiddle playing in a fleadh cheoil to the small little groups and all the fleadhanna are the people who give solace and entertainment to people throughout the country gach seachtain and gach l&aacute;.  It has all stopped.  They did not stop it.  It was pulled from under their legs by the Government when it announced what had to happen.  We all supported that at the time, but it is time to re-examine it and allow these people to live.<\/p> <p> Some of the people in the entertainment industry are desperate.  Are we suggesting that the Irish artists leave their profession and look for work elsewhere, such as sweeping the streets or looking for a place on a community employment scheme?  These people have made large investments.  First, they educated and trained themselves in their profession.  They have invested a large amount in equipment and in vans to travel the roads.  It is modern equipment.  It is not only the people who are playing and performing but also the people backstage such as sound professionals and the entire entourage.  Think of the entertainment they give, such as \"Four Roads to Glenamaddy\" and the like.  As I said, the Lord have mercy on Big Tom.  There are hundreds of entertainers across rural Ireland and they are penniless.  They are proud people.  All they want to do is get up on a stage such as the one at this venue, if we were not here, and to have it full so they can entertain and bring joy and a little solace to people who have been downtrodden by what has happened.<\/p> <p> We must do something special for them and for the people over 66 years of age.  The stimulus package is no good to these people.  They cannot get loans.  The banks are already pulling loans from them.  Many have loans for vans and equipment, but nothing had started this year.  It is very unfair to judge on the basis of 2020 because their season would not have started until around St. Patrick's Day.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; s&aacute;sta.  T&aacute;im ag lorg cabhair do na daoine sin.  They must be helped.  They are part of our culture, heritage and our very being.  They entertain.  Whether it is the Br&uacute; Bor&uacute;, which the Ceann Comhairle attended once and which has wonderful Irish actors under the stewardship of Labhr&aacute;s and &Uacute;na &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, or the Siamsa T&iacute;re or bands such as those of Trudi Lalor, Louise Morrissey, Fran Curry and Muriel O'Connor - I could name them all night - people love them.  In fairness, some of them played drive-by concerts during the pandemic.<\/p> <p> Now their backs are to the wall and they are being wiped off the earth.  That is not how it should be.  They are self-employed and are not looking for anything.  They have paid their taxes and their insurance.  Above all, they give entertainment and value for money.  They reach into people's homes through the local radio stations and their records, and people love them.  It is part of our culture, d&uacute;chas and heritage.  They must be supported.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  I appeal to the new Minister.  If Donie Cassidy was here he would have her in a corner somewhere to talk to her and fight for the rights of these people.  They need to be supported.  They want to provide entertainment and their penny ha'penny worth to everybody else to enjoy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800069#WWW00400","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595960700,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of this Bill, which puts the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment on a formal statutory footing.  That should assist in providing a greater degree of certainty for the recipients of the payment.  It also allows the Minister to provide for urgent needs payments by way of supplementary welfare allowance.  This is particularly important because under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income.  In every year since 2014, over 100,000 people have had to avail of these payments.  Perhaps the Minister might inform us of what the allocation for this year&rsquo;s exceptional needs payments will be.  Will there be a reduction in the overall allocation to meet the increased demand for the pandemic unemployment payment and, if so, by how much?  This is important because it is usually those who are most financially insecure who need these payments for unforeseen circumstances and when a crisis occurs.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, people on invalidity pensions, disability allowance and carer's allowance are finding it very difficult to survive at present.  What they get every week is paltry.  It must be looked at in line with the cost of living and so forth to allow them to survive.  I appeal to the Minister to do something in regard to those payments in the forthcoming budget.  I specifically acknowledge the amendment contained in section 7 of the Bill which confirms that the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment is an unemployment benefit based on PRSI and available to self-employed contributors.  That is incredibly important because we know that many self-employed people, especially in the arts, music and cultural space, have been greatly and negatively impacted during this crisis.  They have found it very difficult to cope and survive.  It has been a very stressful time for them.  The events in the pandemic were outside of their control so they need to get fair play.<\/p>  <p>  While the letter of this Bill is good, as far as it goes, there is a genuine problem emerging in terms of how the spirit of social protection law is being applied.  We have heard in recent days of those who travelled abroad without any idea that in doing so they would face a penalty.  I dealt with a musician in Offaly who had his payment cut unfairly.  He was attending a funeral that he had to attend.  He genuinely did not know about the rules.  He told me he would not have gone to the funeral if he had known about the rules.  However, I acknowledge the help of the previous Minister, Senator Regina Doherty, in reinstating the payment.  It was reinstated after six weeks.  Communication and a change of attitude are required.  There are genuine people and genuine circumstances so we must be fair and flexible.  I also commend the Department's staff on their incredible work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800070#XXX00200","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1595960700,"counter":488,"content":"<p>First, I wish the Minister good luck with this new portfolio.  She was a good Minister in the past so I know she will be a good Minister in the future.  I, too, wish to speak about people from the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI.  I have been inundated with calls from people in the music and entertainment sector regarding the stimulus package.  They have told me about their hardships as they struggle to pay for their weekly shopping, with their utility bills in arrears.  There is the threat of losing their cars and in some cases their homes.<\/p>  <p>  The package proposed by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht fails to understand how this sector works.  The Arts Council does not represent the workers in this sector and the money ploughed into the Arts Council will not trickle down to these working musicians and entertainers.  With regard to this Bill, not enough is being done for this sector.  The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is like a farmer with 200 cows who have nothing to eat.  The farmer gets money that could feed every cow but instead he feeds ten cows and spends the rest of the money putting a cinema screen in the shed so the other 190 cows can watch the videos of the cows eating the grass.  The extra &euro;54 million the Department has provided so far, or promised to provide, could cover the cost of the music and entertainment survival subsidy scheme, ensuring each of the estimated 30,000 workers in this industry, although I believe it is probably 35,000, could have their reduced rate of PUP topped up to &euro;350 per week.  This sector needs a survival package so it can survive until it is deemed safe to reopen after social distancing measures are gone.  The sector is struggling and is being left behind.  I ask the Minister and her Department to work in conjunction with the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to ensure it is not left behind.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to highlight something to the Minister with regard to saving jobs.  I had to approach previous Ministers in the Department such as the current T&aacute;naiste.  I had to approach him one day, and I have looked through my notes to see if I could find the note to show it to the Minister.  It relates to the disgraceful action that is taking place in the Minister's Department whereby recipients of social welfare are receiving letters from the Department telling them to get their payment put into the bank.  In other words, they are bypassing the post office.  I will always give credit where it is due.  I handed one such letter to Deputy Varadkar in the D&aacute;il restaurant one day.  He said, \"That is wrong and should not be happening\".<\/p> <p>He went away and got it sorted.  I am telling the Minister there are offices around the country and people in her Department sending out these letters.  I would love to know, on the record of the D&aacute;il, what set have people working in the Department on our post office network.  Why do they hate the post offices so much that they want people to go into banks for their payments and want to stop our post offices surviving?  I wish to put on the record, in case anyone says I did not, that I am a postmaster of a small post office.  Of course I want to see my post office survive, but I want to see every other post office survive.  It is a matter of jobs in local communities and a local service.  I appeal to the Minister to go back to these people working in her Department on this.  I would love to take them out, face them and ask them why they are sending out letters telling people they have to go to the bank and leaving out the post office.  We are trying every day to keep post offices open.  I leave that job with the Minister.<\/p> <p> I am terribly worried about seasonal workers.  Before coming in the door here, I heard from a seasonal worker who worked locally in a place in Kenmare and whose seasonal work is gone from them.  They tell me they cannot get anything now.  For God's sake, will the Government please do something to try to pick up these people, including young students, who cherished every hour they had during the summer months and who have had no work at all this year.  The prospects for them are very bad.  What can we do to help these people?  They are facing into a new academic year in college.  They do not want to be a strain on their mothers or fathers.  They want to try to ensure they have their own bit of money in their pockets.  I ask the Minister to try to help these people in every way she can.  I thank her and wish her nothing but good luck for as long as she is in her position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800070#XXX00300","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595961300,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister on her appointment to a Ministry I have no doubt she will thrive in.  I am astonished, however, that the rural affairs brief has got thrown in under the Department of Social Protection.  This move seriously demotes rural affairs and was a very poor sign from Fianna F&aacute;il of its intentions for rural Ireland, once again demoting the Ministry for rural affairs.<\/p>  <p>  The PUP was introduced by the Government on 13 March 2020.  I was asked to help with more than 100 applications, which we had to send in paper form.  They got no reply, which meant we had to do them all over again.  Was there any report on what happened to the paper applications?  It was too much of a coincidence that all those we sent in never got responses.  I give credit to the staff of the Department for handling tens of thousands of applications in such an efficient manner.  I can only imagine the pressure they were under.<\/p>  <p>  One serious problem arose for young people on the Covid-19 payment or the wage subsidy scheme.  These young people were on the verge of being approved for mortgages when the banks refused to approve their applications as they were on the Covid-19 payment or the wage subsidy scheme.  This has caused heartache for so many young people through no fault of their own.  I would appreciate it if the Minister stepped in and forced these unscrupulous banks to honour the mortgage agreements agreed prior to Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  Then there are the over-66s.  I ask the Minister to reconsider doing something for the elderly people of our country who were still working when Covid hit.  They were still getting pensions.  They were working, and surely some type of payment should have been made available to them.  They too have mortgages and many bills to pay, and then Covid hit.  The very least the State could have done for these people was to bring their pensions up to the Covid payment of &euro;350.  They get up early in the morning.  They have worked hard all their lives and have got nothing in return.  They continue to be punished after last week's stimulus package, whereby those who can go on holiday this year can get &euro;125 back in some type of tax credit.  For those over 66 on a pension, this will not work and they will get nothing once again.  What did people over 66 do to deserve this, to be treated so badly by this Government and the previous Government?  It is shocking, and they are angry and will not forget for a long time to come what the Government has done to them.<\/p>  <p>  Then there are the seasonal workers, who are entitled to nothing.  I spoke to a tour guide operator on the phone just before I came here.  She cannot claim any Covid-related support.  She was told she is entitled to nothing.  This is shocking as this woman had a full schedule of work ahead of her starting, like other years, in the middle of March.  People like her have worked tirelessly down through the years and would continue to do so only for the Government's shutdown of the country.  What can these people do?  I asked this same question of the Aer Lingus officials this morning at the Covid-19 committee meeting.  Their workers' original fortnightly pay was reduced on 30 March to 50%.  As of July, they are entitled to 30% pay.  This means that although they are working, they are not getting 30% pay.  Aer Lingus employees were misinformed and told that the company would give them the 30% and that the Government would give them a Covid-19 top-up of &euro;700 fortnightly.  They, therefore, assumed they would get more than &euro;350 per week.  This is not the case.  It looks like in their payslips all they will get is a Covid-lite payment.  Some crew have filled out UP1 and UP14 social welfare forms to claim reduced work benefits.  They were told by the Citizens Information Board and the Department that they were entitled to claim.  However, HR in Aer Lingus is refusing to sign the basic Xs and Os of the social protection forms for them.  These are Aer Lingus workers.  They are not allowed to self-declare and, therefore, the company refuses to sign.  They do not get any added benefit from social welfare claims.  These are Xs and Os, and it should be no problem for any employer to fill the employer's duty.  I hope the Minister is aware of this situation with Aer Lingus and will rectify it for the employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800071#YYY00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1595961300,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I am glad to get an opportunity to speak.  I congratulate the Minister on her appointment and wish her all the very best for the duration of this D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  I want to ensure that seasonal workers who were not working the week of 6 March will be made eligible for the coronavirus payment now.  I welcome the extension of the payment for a category of people which in Kerry includes hotel workers and bus drivers.  There are many of them and they have no work.  Because they were not working the week of 6 March, they have been left behind.  That is very unfair, and I ask the Minister to address it.<\/p>  <p>  Like others, I support the call for the over-66s.  Many of them are publicans.  They have given good employment over the years, and just because they are over 66 they have been left behind.  They have insurance and utility bills and many other outstanding costs.  They are trying to keep their premises and make them available like others who are over 66.<\/p>  <p>  The TWSS only applies to people who worked the months of January and February.  In the tourism sector, many people do not work during January and February.  These people are not eligible for the wage subsidy and will, therefore, be left behind by businesses because when there is no wage subsidy for them, they will not be considered for or asked to work at all.  Another point about the wage subsidy, and I wish to make this very clear to the Minister, is that in the case of those who did work in January and February but for fewer hours, perhaps 15 or 20 hours, and who did that work diligently, their employers will be allowed to claim the wage subsidy only for those hours they worked, meaning they will be left behind again because the employees who worked 39 or 40 hours per week are entitled to the full rate of the wage subsidy.  Those employees will be considered first, and the ones who have fewer hours will not be considered at all.<\/p>  <p>  Like other speakers, I wish to make a case for entertainers and musicians all around the country who worked hard to ensure people enjoyed their evenings out, whether they were traditional musicians, the ordinary ballad group that played in lounges or pubs or even the Dublin City Ramblers, who played in Kilgarvan year after year.  They have been left behind.  They have serious costs and they gave great enjoyment and great benefit to all those who listened to them and who look forward to listening to them again.  They are not allowed to work now.  I appeal to the Minister to end the embargo on those people who played in local pubs and clubs in order that they be allowed to work as soon as possible.  They should also get some kind of financial assistance to keep them going in the meantime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800071#YYY00300","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1595961900,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister well in her new role.  It is a huge undertaking and I wish her the best.  While people have commented on rural affairs being in with the rest of the Department but I have no doubt that a good Monaghan woman will see to it that rural affairs does not take second place.<\/p>  <p>  As far as the legislation is concerned, I am pleased that the PUP will be put on a statutory footing.  It will be a social insurance benefit within the social welfare code.  However, by putting it on a statutory footing, it will come under the remit of European legislation on the co-ordination of social security.  The most recent iteration of this legislation was put in place in 2004 and all exportable benefits are covered by it.  It does not change the level of benefits as that is up to member states, but this Bill puts rules in place to govern what happens those payments when people exercise their freedom of movement.  That is one of the four freedoms under the EU.  We have a right to travel from one member state to another and, in this context, I refer to article 64 of EU Regulation No. 883\/2004, which refers to unemployed persons going to another member state.  There is quite a bit in it but I will refer to the pertinent elements.  They concern an unemployed person who satisfies the conditions of the legislation in the competent member state, that is, Ireland, for entitlement to benefits and who goes to another member state.  It states that people going to another member state \"shall be entitled to benefits for three months\".  They have to register the fact that they are looking for work within seven days but there is a seven-day period during which a person travelling from one member state to another who is on an unemployment benefit cannot have that benefit terminated.  They cannot lose their benefits.  I understand that the Department has to protect its finances but it does not, under EU legislation, have the power to terminate an unemployment payment when a person leaves their own country to travel.   At that point in time, no member state has the power to do that.<\/p>  <p>  Those who travel have obligations when they travel but, equally, they have rights and it is up to the member state to make sure those rights are in place.  If, for example, somebody from France living and working here became unemployed, claimed the PUP and had to go back to France for a family occasion such as a funeral, wedding or whatever it might be, for three or four days and returned, would their payment be stopped?  Something tells me that, under European legislation, that could not happen.  That needs to be examined.  It is not directly related to the legislation today but it is an important part of the public discourse on this issue right now.<\/p>  <p>  If someone is on a pension, he or she can travel to another member state for a week or a month and still receive his or her pension.  That is fine and that is part of the legislation. However, if one is on the PUP, one cannot leave the country at all and retain one's payment.  This payment is given to those who, through no fault of their own, lost their jobs because of measures taken by Government to close businesses, yet these people cannot leave the country for any purpose.  This is discriminatory and it penalises people who already find themselves in a vulnerable position.  I am not talking about a free-for-all, and the State has an obligation to ensure we all abide by the rules and there is no unfairness, but why are we singling people on the PUP out?  I know many of those people.  They ask me what they have done to deserve this kind of treatment.  Very few people on the PUP will go abroad on holidays unless they had booked and paid for those holidays with their after-tax income before the lockdown.  If a person goes abroad for a family reason, for example, why are they penalised?  I do not suggest we have no rules or guidelines but if somebody leaves the country, that in itself should not be a reason to stop the payment.<\/p>  <p>  Many of my colleagues have spoken about those who work in the arts and creative industries, including the music industry.  This sector is suffering hugely.  They are not unemployed, as such, but they have no possibility to work.  They did not lose their jobs.  Their jobs were closed down by the State and we all recognise this had to happen.  An issue for many in the music industry is that many are self-employed and, as of now, it seems to me - and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong - that only 2018 accounts are taken into consideration when assessing the rate of PUP.  That means some people are arbitrarily excluded or are in receipt of lower payments than they should be.  If someone started a business in 2018, their income was considerably lower than what it was in 2019 or the beginning of 2020.  The same applies to people who changed businesses, and I have come across at least three people in that position.  They were in another business or they were employed and that terminated in 2017.  They started out in 2018 and now their PUP has been cut.  Can a person produce accounts for 2019 and submit them to Revenue?  I see the Minister nodding her head and I am delighted.  That is good news for people because it takes the arbitrariness out of that decision-making.  I will wait until she confirms that is the case.<\/p>  <p>  Some other anomalies have been raised by my colleagues which she has heard before but she hears them because we hear them.  People come to us who find themselves in these situations.  Many colleagues have spoken of the over-66s, those who are self-employed, those who run pubs and those who drive coaches and minibuses.  Pubs are still closed and people cannot work.  Those in the coach and minibus industry rely largely on foreign tourists and while indigenous tourism is picking up and I support the call to holiday at home, very few of us will use those coaches or minibuses.  It looks like it will be at least nine or 12 months before that industry begins to pick up.  These people, some of whom are over 66, cannot access the PUP, even though they work and pay their taxes.  At a time we are looking at increasing the retirement age, it is a very mixed message to say that if one is over 66, one cannot receive the PUP but, at the same time, look to increase the retirement age.<\/p> <p> I support the amendment proposed by my colleague, Deputy McNamara, on the issue of seasonal workers.  They have to be taken into consideration because, as we know, tourism could not survive without them.<\/p> <p> Finally, like previous speakers, I want to express my thanks to the Department officials.  Their very efficient work in processing cases needs to be recognised.  When a citizen is in trouble and the matter is dealt with quickly, it makes a big difference to that person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800072#ZZZ00100","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595962500,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I join colleagues in wishing the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, the best of luck in her new role.  I have dealt with her in several different Departments and she has a job of work to do in her new portfolio, first of all in the area of social protection.  It is not the Minister's fault and no reflection on her, but I am saddened that rural affairs will not have a separate, independent Department.  I am sure she will do her best in this regard, as she comes from a good rural area in Monaghan.  It is important that we give the time to rural affairs as well as social protection.  I know there is an emphasis on the latter at this time.  With the situation we are in, the Minister's hands are probably full trying to cater for all the different problems that are arising.<\/p>  <p>  One such problem is the number of business people who have taken out loans and are providing employment to people.  Just because they are over 66 years of age, they are not entitled to any payment.  These people are risk takers and they are giving employment throughout the country.  Their situation is an anomaly in the whole system.  Some of them are driving buses serving the tourism industry, for example, and they are left high and dry at this time.  I see similar difficulties for people in other sectors.  In the case of plasterers, for instance, there are people who want to hand on the torch and train another generation.  That type of training opportunity might be scarce but there are people offering it.  In the case of lorry drivers, to give another example, it costs probably &euro;4,500 to &euro;5,000 to put a young person forward for the test.  Such opportunities are not plentiful and there is no point in saying they are.  Unfortunately, the people who want to give those chances are being left behind.  A sector that never got going, because it is seasonal, is the hospitality sector.  When the payments came in for workers affected by the Covid pandemic, those businesses had not yet opened their doors.  People in that industry are not getting the same opportunity other people are getting.<\/p>  <p>  I saw the Minister nodding when Deputy Harkin spoke about the particular difficulties facing small business owners.  I spoke during the week to the owner of a small photography business.  This person rents a property and has to pay for electricity and other things, Covid or no Covid.  That business is at a standstill at the moment because the owner's main work is doing school photographs and things like that.  I know there is a rates rebate, but the owner has all the general expenses of running a business to meet.  It is a small set-up and, when the whole thing is done, the owner takes something like &euro;220 or &euro;230 out of it every week.  Now Revenue, or the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, has decided this person will be getting only &euro;203 per week.  That is very harsh because the ground rent and all the different facets of running a business will still have to paid for.  No landlord will say to a tenant that he or she can forget about the rent for six months.  There might be a bit of a reduction given, but businesses will still have to contribute something.  We need to think about people in that situation.<\/p>  <p>  I join Deputy Harkin in endorsing Deputy McNamara's amendment.  It is well thought out and we should support it.<\/p>  <p>  During the Covid crisis, the farming community and the agricultural sector kept the lights on in this country.  They should be acknowledged for that, just as all front-line workers should be acknowledged.  I ask the Minister, under her social protection remit, that when it comes to the few euro the farmers get, to consider increasing the disregard when the means testing is done.  Many farmers have only small farms but they went out every morning, brought the cattle to the factories and kept the food on the table for people throughout the country.  I ask the Minister to focus, under the two parts of her portfolio, on kick-starting rural economies and regional development.  There are several large employers who are letting people go.  If we look back to 2010, it was the agricultural sector that kept a flag flying when a lot of flags were at half mast or were down altogether.  I know the Government is borrowing moneys to cover all the things that need to be done.  It is the right thing to do because we need to keep the ship sailing.  I think all boats will lift throughout Europe, although it may take a year or two to happen.  We must keep our boat afloat and ensure we keep people employed as much as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The 2020 CL&Aacute;R programme will be opening soon under the Minister's remit.  We are hearing that fewer projects will be included under the scheme in each county.  I would like clarification on that.  These are projects that support a range of initiatives, including community safety measures and other measures such as the provision of walkways and supports for children with disabilities in schools.  The programme is important because, first, it improves community safety and, second, it gives work to small operators in different towns and villages.  All the different funding streams are very welcome - I want to be very clear about that - but let us not see initiatives like this in rural areas collapsing because money is being pumped into X, Y and Z.  If we need to borrow an extra few euro to make sure these people are not forgotten, we should do so.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is from a rural area and has travelled all over the country.  She has seen the amount of work voluntary groups do in communities.  The people who run them take a bottom-up approach, filling out the forms late at night and going around every weekend or every night picking up the litter and doing other things to make their community more attractive for the people who live there and the people who visit it on holiday.  This year we are seeing Irish people who will not be going to foreign lands taking holidays in different part of our own country.  Some of them might do so again next year because of the scenery and the friendliness of the set-up they find there.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to take those points on board.  We need to knuckle down and make sure the people who took risks with their businesses are respected.  They do not know where they are because they were never given any money.  For the pubs and the sectors that have not opened yet, the year is pushing on.  We had three months or so of talks with the banks but there was little benefit for the people in those sectors who have invested a huge amount of money, whether in public houses or other types of businesses that are still not open.  A word in the ear of the banks is needed once more because those people's income is going to be totally different from what it was last year or the year before.  We must make sure they are given a kick-start.  The jump leads must be got ready to get them going the minute things open up again.<\/p> <p>The more people we keep employed in this country, the better chance we have of bringing in more taxes and generating an economy.  I ask the Minister to take on board the points I have made . <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800073#AAAA00200","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595963100,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister the best in her tenure in this Department.  I would be delighted if she had the Department of Rural and Community Affairs on its own because it is the kind of Department that requires someone with her expertise and commitment.  I regret that in the division and reallocation of Departments, we have overloaded some of them with very important issues and the Minister's is one of them.  I wish her the best of luck and we will try to help her as best we can.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill, which puts the pandemic unemployment payment on a statutory basis.  That is very important because it is a lifeline for many families and will be for the foreseeable future, until the pandemic is under some sort of control through a vaccine or treatments.  We all yearn for that to happen very quickly.  However, there are some anomalies with the payment that I would have liked to see addressed from the beginning.  Take the issue of people over 66, for example.  There is a small family business in Sligo, run by a husband and wife, which employed 13 people.  Eleven of them qualified for the payment but as the owners were both over 66 and in receipt of the contributory pension, into which they had paid for more than 40 years, the system adjudged them to have had enough.  For those over 66 who are still making such a contribution to society, it would be only reasonable for us to make up the difference between their pension and whatever full rate of payment would have otherwise applied to them.  I cannot imagine that it would be a vast amount of money but this is about moral justice, fairness and an acknowledgment of these people who have chosen not to hang up their boots at 66 but to continue with their expertise.  These small business owners and others are contributing to society and creating employment and we effectively penalised them for that in what may be the twilight of their working careers.  If this Bill does not afford the Minister the opportunity to address this issue, I hope she has at least costed it and can outline to us how much it would cost.  If we cannot do it, I ask her to explain why, because it seems only fair.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of seasonal workers is a very real one.  An amendment has been proposed on this matter and I ask the Minister to consider it carefully before making a decision on whether the Government will oppose it or not.  Other speakers also referred to the performing arts and the many musicians and small bands that would work periodically and would get some level of support through the season.  Even in this relatively locked-down period, when they cannot perform in their normal places, they are providing entertainment online and performing online concerts and so on, but that does not give them any income.  Some performers have run these events to try to raise funds for some very important charities.  I ask the Government to acknowledge that because these people make a huge contribution to our society and to our mental health.  They entertain us and ensure we have things to enjoy in our downtime.  They now find themselves with no potential to earn any income, despite being big contributors to our society.  I would like the Minister to examine this area with her officials and see what, if anything, can be done to support these people.<\/p>  <p>  Like others, I have seen the various broadcasts over the last number of days highlighting how people travelling have been approached by Department staff at the airports, supported by members of the Garda, some of whom were seconded to assist them.  I see the necessity for rules and for them to be enforced, particularly if there is any fraud, but there are huge questions over exactly what is going on.  I am not a big listener of \"Liveline\" with Joe Duffy but I happened to hear some of it today.  There was a gentleman on the show who is married to a Romanian lady who is also an Irish citizen.  They were travelling to Romania in June, with their children, to see to some ill family members of his wife.  They were last in the queue to board a Ryanair flight.  This man has a legal background and so when he was asked for his PPS number, he asked what the reasonable grounds were for the staff to be asking him that.  The staff member replied that him leaving the country was reasonable grounds.  He was in a position to inform her that under section 250(16) of the relevant Act, those were not reasonable grounds.  Reasonable grounds would be if someone saw me working on a building site when he or she knew I was claiming unemployment benefits, for example.  I imagine those are reasonable grounds.  He challenged the woman and refused to give his PPS number, as was perfectly within his rights, and she said that was fair enough.  Two garda&iacute; then intervened, masquerading as an emigration check, and asked for his passport, which he gave them.  They then proceeded to take down details from the passport and he queried this because he had not given permission for his details to be taken.  They said they were entitled to do it.  Off these people went to Romania to see to their loved ones who were ill, and they returned some weeks later to find their child benefit payment had been stopped.  That is a universal payment which people get whether they are multimillionaires or penniless.  I have a real problem with that.<\/p>  <p>  This next part may not be true but if it is, I have a huge problem with it.  In the interview, the gentleman in question said that the Department, supported by the Garda, is targeting certain flights, such as those to Romania or Poland.  That amounts to ethnic or racial profiling, which is totally wrong.  If we must have reasonable grounds to ask people for their details, the Department must establish and define what reasonable grounds are.  Officials cannot simply decide to check everyone getting on a flight to Romania because they have a prejudiced view of Romanians and think they may be cheating the system.  That is fundamentally wrong and is not the sort of ethos captured under our Constitution or, indeed, the Proclamation.<\/p>  <p>  Statements from the Department were also read out on that radio show, which fell a good bit short of the sort of explanations I would have expected.  I gather similar revelations were being broadcast in the media all week, but I just happened to hear that particular gentleman's story.  When he contacted the Department and asked about the child benefit, he was told he was not allowed to get child benefit because he left the country.  My oldest child is 16 years old and we have been getting child benefit all his life.  Before Covid, we were blessed enough to be able to go on holidays abroad most years, though not every year.  I do not remember anybody ever taking issue with us getting the child benefit payment, and nor should they have.  This gentleman has now made an official complaint to the Department.  I do not know his name but perhaps someone from the Department could listen back to today's \"Liveline\" and get all those details.  I am glad he was on that flight and had a legal background because it is important that this information gets back to us.  At best, this was an overzealous reaction by officers of the State, be they garda&iacute; or social welfare officers.  At worst, it was racial or ethnic profiling if they were selecting certain flights because some people have a prejudiced view.  I know the Minister does not hold such views, and knowing her personally, I know she would not operate in this way, so we need to get a handle on that very quickly.<\/p>  <p>  Data sharing is also an issue in such cases.  Another speaker referred to someone who was out of the country, in Glasgow or somewhere, and was contacted after the fact to be told that their PUP had been stopped.  The Department was able to cite the flight number and when and where from it departed.  That is a problem.  Of course we want to weed out actual fraud, but we cannot have a quasi-presumption of guilt without reasonable grounds.  That is the big issue people have with this.  People are entitled to go on holidays and they do.  They might even be gone for a month or two to visit a loved one abroad or a parent who is dying.<\/p> <p>I thought cutting child benefit was ridiculous, wrong and mean-spirited.  I cannot imagine how or why it could have been legal.  I hope the Minister will look into that issue and report back to the House.  This is not an issue for us to blindly defend our team, as it were, or her officials in the Minister's case.  There might be something fundamentally wrong, which might require addressing in this House so we can inform the nation that something did occur, it was wrong, it will not happen again, an apology has been made to the person concerned and the system improved so it cannot happen again.  The Irish public are entitled to that, having been appalled to hear what went on via various broadcasts in recent days.<\/p> <p> Regarding the Minister's staff, while I know there have been issues and the phrase coined some time back, towards the beginning of the crisis, was \"speed trumps accuracy\", we have now had some time at things.  I pay tribute to the staff in the Minister's Department who administered all these schemes and managed to get money to people pretty quickly, in the main.  They deserve much credit.  <\/p> <p> In making that point, however, I want to draw an analogy between the Minister's Department and other Departments and employees of the State for whom, frankly, Covid-19 has been great cover for doing nothing.  I had dealings with one State agency lately, where no one will be back in that office until the end of August.  They are working from home and it is necessary to talk to an answering machine.  Most people have been allowed to return to work, particularly in the private sector.  The staff in my office did not stop for an hour since the onset of Covid-19.  We respected the lockdown, but worked from our office and dealt with people on phones etc..  <\/p> <p> Many elements of our State agencies, Departments and local authorities, however, are using this situation as cover to lie on the couch and watch box sets, returning an odd call here and there and doing the maximum of the minimum to tick over during this period.  Productivity has fallen and that is unacceptable.  Many in the private sector are back again at full tilt.  I know the Minister has worked at full tilt throughout this time, I know I have, as have many colleagues, probably all, in the political world.  Many people are not, however, and that needs to be addressed.  Whether it is opportunism, coming from the labour relations side, laziness and-or poor management, it needs to be addressed because the country needs all its officials working at full tilt to get productivity levels up to the maximum so we get through this crisis in the best possible way.  I thank the Minister, I hope she will be able to take on board those points and I look forward to her response.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800074#BBBB00200","speaker":"1606","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595963700,"counter":498,"content":"<p>No other Deputies are offering.

I want to clarify that the Department of Rural and Community Development is a separate Department, as is the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  They are being maintained on a separate basis and I look forward to working as Minister, separately, for both Departments.<\/p>  <p>  What we have seen throughout the Covid-19 crisis is people showing solidarity at a time of national crisis.  People stayed away from their families and friends for months on end to protect each other and to ensure the virus did not spread.  We have seen our front-line workers, our nurses and doctors, do more than anyone could have expected to protect us in recent months.  All that work and those sacrifices were made to save lives.  <\/p>  <p>  The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, was introduced as a solidarity payment at a time of unprecedented crisis for this country and to help people to adhere to public health advice.  As part of that national solidarity we have seen displayed so strongly in recent months, we are asking people to adhere to the public health advice and to not travel abroad.  If it is necessary for people to travel for essential reasons, such as in the case of a bereavement, an unwell family member or health reasons, it is possible to travel and payments will not be impacted.  I want to be clear about that.  It is necessary for people to just tell staff in their social welfare office that they are going abroad and the payment will not be interrupted.<\/p>  <p>  Since the onset of Covid-19, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's range of income supports has been developed to support the implementation of the public health advice.  Restrictions for paying social welfare recipients when they are abroad are contained in primary legislation in section 189 and 249 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  Despite these restrictions, the Department has historically applied flexibility for up to two weeks absence from the State.  This has been applied via administrative measures for jobseeker's allowance and by regulation for jobseeker's benefit.  The PUP was never subject to such flexibility and there is a legislative provision preventing its continued payment outside the State in sections 189 and 249 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.<\/p>  <p>  In the midst of a global pandemic and to support the continued adoption of public health advice, the Department has temporarily suspended the flexibility which applied to jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit payments.  This required suspending administrative arrangements for the jobseeker's allowance and introducing a new regulation for jobseeker's benefit.  Since 2012, the Department's social welfare inspectors have been undertaking controlled checks at airports and ports.  These checks have a firm legal basis in section 250(16) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, and I am advised by my officials that no travel information is shared between an airport or port and the Department.  The Department's social welfare inspectors or garda&iacute; seconded to the Department are on the ground in the airport and at the ports and speak to relevant individuals accordingly, and social welfare inspectors are operating within their statutory powers.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 13 March, the Department has stopped payments to 2,500 recipients of PUP, of which 2,000 relate to Dublin Airport and 500 to other ports and airports.  Had these claims not been stopped, the Department might have incurred additional expenditure of &euro;20.5 million.  That would have meant it would have cost taxpayers &euro;20.5 million in payments to people not entitled to receive those payments.  The majority of the people concerned are not going on holidays; they are leaving the country, and once recipients live outside of the country, they are not entitled to these payments.<\/p>  <p>  A small number of people may have had to leave the country for various reasons and have since returned.  We have heard many stories tonight about people who had to leave to visit a sick relative or for some family emergency.  People who feel they were treated wrongly can request a review.  As Deputies will be aware, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has an appeals mechanism throughout its processes to which anybody is entitled to apply.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding restrictions on paying social welfare payment abroad, these are contained in primary legislation under sections 189 and 249 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 which disqualify people from receiving payments for any time they are absent from the State.  The Department, however, has allowed flexibility for those who leave the State for up to two weeks, and this flexibility has been provided by way of a regulation for contributory-based payments such as jobseeker's benefit, and by using administrative measures for other payments, such as jobseeker's allowance.  <\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>To be clear, it is set down in legislation that one does not get payments if one is outside the country.  However, we have historically applied flexibility to allow for two weeks' foreign travel.<br\/><br\/>In light of the global Covid-19 pandemic, it was not considered appropriate to retain the normal flexibility arrangements from March onwards given the strong public health advice cautioning against all foreign travel.  The Department therefore temporarily suspended this flexibility for jobseeker's schemes.  For jobseeker's allowance, this required the suspension of administrative arrangements and, for jobseeker's benefit, it required a new regulation.  It is important to note that the pandemic unemployment payment is only payable to people who are living in the State and it was never paid to people who travel abroad.  The flexibility which previously applied to other social welfare payments never applied to the pandemic unemployment payment.  The prohibition on the payment of the PUP is set out in primary legislation.  It should be remembered that the PUP was introduced when the world was in lockdown and we are not out of the woods yet.  Deputies should think back to the time when the PUP was introduced and people could only travel 2 km within their own counties.  As I said, we are not out of the woods yet and we must take the public health advice.  Deputies might remember the public reaction to the crowds who visited the Cheltenham Festival.  It was felt that people returning from the festival had brought the virus with them.  If the virus starts to spread again in six weeks' time, which I hope it does not, Deputies will be asking me why I was making payments to people who were acting against public health advice.<br\/><br\/>The Department is satisfied that the regulation is drafted on an appropriate legal basis despite comments by some in the media.  The Government is not discriminating against social welfare recipients.  Public sector staff, who must quarantine for the 14-day period, must take either annual leave or unpaid leave to cover this absence from work.  Many private companies are also applying those rules.<br\/><br\/>Issues around the green list were raised by some Deputies.  We keep everything under review in line with public health advice and if anyone has to travel for urgent reasons, for example, if there is a bereavement or somebody is sick, the Department will take account of these exceptional circumstances.  Such persons should notify the information to their local social welfare or Intreo office at the earliest possible date.<br\/><br\/>As part of its ongoing work, the Department conducts checks in ports and airports.  Since June 2012, social welfare inspectors have had legal powers to carry out these checks as part of the ongoing control work in which they are engaged.  There is nothing new here; it has been happening since 2012.  The Minister at the time, former Deputy Joan Burton, introduced that legislation and rightly so.  She wanted to stop welfare tourists.  <br\/><br\/>As I said, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is facing a somewhat different situation this year.  We are in a very different environment and large numbers of people have been leaving the country since mid-March, arising from the lockdown imposed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  In the main, those people were moving permanently from Ireland to their home countries in the same way that some people returned home to Ireland.  There were people who came back to Ireland and others who were living here and returned to their own countries.  Those people were not entitled to receive the payment when they moved out of this country.  The pandemic unemployment payment was never to be paid to people outside the State.  Social welfare inspectors increased their checks in airports and ports from mid-March to detect PUP recipients who were leaving the State permanently while still in receipt of the payment.<br\/><br\/>The pandemic unemployment payment scheme was introduced quickly and, as somebody else said, speed trumped perfection.  The payment required an online application form, none of the normal checks were applied and it was easy for some people to abuse it for that simple reason.  There was no face-to-face interview as would normally happen.  It was a one-page online application.  The work of the Department in carrying out the checks and balances that one would expect of it has resulted in potential savings of &euro;20.5 million to the State.  <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>carried a story at the weekend based on information provided by the Department.  Since 7 July, 104 PUP recipients and 44 individuals in receipt of other social welfare payments have had their payments stopped as they were leaving the country through Dublin Airport.  Of this latter group, 33 of the 44 were in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.  To be clear, if somebody goes to his or her social protection office and explains that certain circumstances require essential travel, that person will be accommodated.<br\/><br\/>A number of issues were raised about inspectors.  The DAA does not pass travel information to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Department does not have access to travel data, nor does it have access to passenger locator forms from any airport or port and it does not receive travel information from the Department of Justice and Equality.  As part of its normal control work, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection carries out compliance inspections at ports and airports throughout the course of the year.  Since 2012, social welfare inspectors have had legal powers to carry out these checks as part of the ongoing control and compliance work in which they engage.  The legal basis for the control and compliance checks is section 250(16) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by section 17 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012.  These checks are carried out as certain social welfare payments are only paid to people residing in the State.  These compliance checks involve inspectors speaking directly with passengers and any information gathered is used only for the purpose for which it is gathered.  Social welfare inspectors have legal powers under social welfare legislation to ask for PPS numbers.  Social welfare inspectors have to be approved by the DAA to work in the airport and all have clearance from the authority to work there.  They all have Dublin Airport identity cards and Garda vetting is part of the process of obtaining an identity card.  Inspectors must also undergo security awareness training.  <br\/><br\/>I note the points raised by Deputy MacSharry about a particular issue and am happy to make sure we check out the full facts of the case.<br\/><br\/>Deputies have raised a number of points and I will address as many of them as I can.  To respond to Deputy Sherlock, the Department has worked closely with the Attorney General's office on this Bill.  We would obviously not have received a stamped copy of the Bill if it was unconstitutional.  Social insurance contributions are attributed so that people who have been made unemployed during the public health crisis can maintain social insurance records.  It is important that they get the full benefit of their social insurance contributions.<br\/><br\/>While Deputy Harkin has a point, freedom of movement can be restricted in exceptional times.  That is my response to the question raised by the Deputy.<br\/><br\/>In response to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, seasonal workers will benefit from the new employment wage subsidy scheme.  The relevant Bill is sponsored by the Minister for Finance.  <br\/><br\/>Points were raised about people who are looking for work.  I know there are some sectors of the economy that have not reopened yet and hopefully they will be allowed to reopen on 10 August.  In making sure that people are looking for work, the Department will take a common sense approach.  It is okay for people to wait for the sector in which they work to reopen.<\/p> <p>It is fully understandable that people are waiting for their jobs to come back.  Unfortunately, a lot of people will not return to their jobs and that is why we want to help them get new jobs.  My Department has an allocation of &euro;112 million under the July stimulus package to help people retrain, reskill and get better jobs.  We want to help people.  In conjunction with the Department for higher education, there is a total budget of &euro;200 million to support all sorts of training, apprenticeships and schemes that we can provide to help people reskill and find new jobs in other areas.<br\/><br\/> Those resident in the North were mentioned.  The position regarding the pandemic unemployment payment for frontier workers is no different from the position for any other employment benefit.  The Deputy who raised the issue will know that EU regulations govern our treatment of frontier workers.  We have correctly followed the same approach here.  Under the current EU rules, the member state of residence is the member state responsible for the payment of unemployment benefit.  I live on the Border and can understand why people living in Northern Ireland and working in Border counties would like to avail of the PUP.  In Northern Ireland the jobseeker's benefit payment is &euro;100 compared with &euro;350 south of the Border.  Those aged under 25 in Northern Ireland will only get &euro;60.  Those who employ people living in Northern Ireland and working in the Republic can avail of the wage subsidy scheme.<br\/><br\/>The issue of seasonal workers will be addressed under the employment support subsidy, which is the follow-on from the wage subsidy scheme.  Seasonal workers will be allowed to join the scheme.<br\/><br\/> The issue of post offices was raised by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.  The matter has been brought to my attention and I have spoken to my officials about it.  I understand local offices are sending letters to people asking them to provide their bank account details.  I have taken the issue on board.<br\/><br\/>In respect of the self-employed, it is important to note that the assessment of income is based on returns to the Revenue Commissioners.  The majority of self-employed individuals declare their income through self-assessment, under which there is a common date for the payment of tax and filing of tax returns.  Individuals must file their tax on or before 31 October in the year after the year to which the return relates, which is the reason we chose 2018.  It is the last tax year for which complete data on self-employed income are available.  If people file their 2019 returns to the Revenue Commissioners, we will accept those figures.  I fully understand that in some cases the 2019 figures will be better than the 2018 figures, which means people will be entitled to higher payments. <br\/><br\/> Deputy Fitzmaurice referred to a self-employed person who is renting a premises.  The restart grant is available to self-employed people who are renting premises and paying rates.  It was increased last week from &euro;2,000 to a minimum of &euro;4,000.  Anybody who has already received &euro;2,000 can apply for a further &euro;2,000.  The maximum available is &euro;25,000.<br\/><br\/>I understand that the current situation is extremely difficult for those in the arts and entertainment industry.  I have spoken to band members.  There are no gigs or performances taking place and they are in a very difficult position.  The former Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Josepha Madigan, announced a &euro;25 million package.  As part of the July stimulus package, the Minister with responsibility for the arts, Deputy Catherine Martin, announced further supports for the industry.  There is no two ways about it; it is difficult for those in the industry and we are all concerned about them.<br\/><br\/> Concerns were expressed about redundancy.  The Bill does not interfere with redundancy legislation in any way.  An employee who has been working for the same employer for two years can claim redundancy if his or her role no longer exists from 10 August.  <br\/><br\/>Deputy McGrath raised the case of the man with a van.  Such people will get the enterprise support grant.  They have to submit information on the extra costs they have incurred as a result of Covid-19.  Some support is available for them.<br\/><br\/> In fairness, the quickest way we can get artists and publicans back to work is by keeping the virus under control.  That will only happen if we follow the public health advice.  That means people should not travel abroad.  That is the advice.  We all have to continue to play a part in protecting each other.<br\/><br\/> I have covered most of the issues that have been raised during this debate.  I thank Deputies for their contributions.  I am listening and have heard and take on board their concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800075#CCCC00300","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595964900,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill 2020: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1595964900,"counter":503,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800077#EEEE00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595964900,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1595964900,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I wish to speak to the section, which refers to the Title of the Bill.  Lets us remind ourselves of the Title.  It is the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill 2020.  In other words, this is a Bill that is supposed to be a response to a public health pandemic.  I put it to the Minister that she should change the Bill or its Title because it is clear when one reads the text and hears Government policy on the matters we have debated on Second Stage that the Government is not trying to address Covid-19 or assist in the battle against it in this legislation.  What it is doing is actually a threat in our battle against Covid-19 in a number of ways.<\/p><p>  First, it has been put to the Minister on multiple occasions, and I put it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, again today, that the Government is speaking out of both sides of its mouth on the question of non-essential foreign travel.  I believe there should be no non-essential foreign travel and that it endangers public health.  I say that not because I am an expert but because the actual experts, namely, NPHET and the expert advisory group, say that.  They say there should be no non-essential travel outside the State.  However, the Government says, unless the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is somehow no longer part of the Government, and I think it still is, that non-essential travel to 13 countries is okay.<\/p> <p>The website states that the general advisory against non-essential travel does \"not apply to those 13 countries.\"  The Minister is, therefore, penalising a specific group of people in receipt of the PUP who heed that advice, and conclude from it what anybody who understands English would conclude, that is, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Government say it is okay to travel to those 13 countries.  I do not think it is okay.  The Minister claims, she says, it is not okay but the Ministry responsible for it, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, says it is okay.  <\/p> <p> The Minister then punished people who followed that advice by cutting off their payments but not rich people who do not have to depend on the PUP or workers lucky enough that their sectors have recovered and they are back at work.  They can go to the 13 countries.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, even embellished it further earlier today by saying it is safer to go to those countries.  He actually said that today in the D&aacute;il.  There is less likelihood of getting an infection in the 13 countries than here, which begs the question, why are we not all going?  Seriously, why are we not all going?  We are less likely to get infected if we believe the Minister.  Luckily, he is not a virologist, epidemiologist, or a public health doctor, although he appears to behave as if he is because he is issuing advice on public health matters that directly conflicts with what NPHET and the expert advisory group said.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Coveney and the Government are breaking from the public health advice, sowing confusion and threatening the second wave which the Minister just said she was concerned about.  She said if there is another wave, people will blame her.  They will blame her because the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is telling people it is okay when NPHET is saying it is not okay.  They would be right to blame the Minister.  If she wants to do something about, there is a simple way.  It is not about selectively cutting off the payments of one cohort of people.  It is simply about changing the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to say it is not okay to go to those 13 countries and o further say that anybody who breaches the advice of the public health authorities will receive the same sanction, whatever that sanction is.  We are all in it together in solidarity; an injury to one is an injury to all.  She can put it whatever way she likes.  There should be one law for everybody when it comes to protecting public health.  The Minister has two laws and she is speaking out of both sides of her mouth on the issue of public health.  It is fundamentally dishonest and fundamentally damaging to the fight against Covid-19.  Frankly, the Minister should be ashamed of herself for it.<\/p> <p> The second issue whereby her actions are threatening the public effort is in selectively looking for the means to cut certain people off the Covid-19 payment which, as she rightly said, was introduced to underpin solidarity in the fight against Covid-19 in a financial way.  The point of it was to ease the hardship caused as a result of people losing their jobs and income because of Covid-19.  From the beginning, however, certain people were excluded and discriminated against, namely, the over-66s.  I thought I misheard when Deputy MacSharry - because I presume, he is now going to vote against this Bill - said he wished the Government would do something about the discrimination against the over-66s.  It is in repeated in the Bill.  A person does not get the PUP if he or she is over 66 or under 18 even if he or she is working.  What did that do?  That meant taxi drivers who were working during the height of the pandemic, and most of the taxi drivers who are still working, are over 66.  Precisely the people who should have been cocooning were working.  The Government's discrimination was, and is, threatening the health of the most vulnerable group of taxi drivers and that remains the case.  The inequity of it is threatening the fight against Covid-19.  <\/p> <p> Of course, one then begins to think about what is the real agenda behind the Bill.  It has got nothing to do with the fight against Covid-19; it is about driving people off the pandemic payment.  The Government was forced under pressure to raise the pandemic payment from her original proposal of &euro;203 up to &euro;350 because people rightly said it was not enough, and now it is desperately trying to unravel that.  That is what is going on.  This Bill gives the Minister the legislative armoury to do it and copper-fastens the distinction she has imposed that largely affects the self-employed.  <\/p> <p> Three major victims of this are artists, taxi drivers and people who work in the bar industry.  All of them are being picked on and having their incomes cut even though they cannot return to work because of the Minister's public health advice.  This is incentivising them to bang down the door of their employment and say, \"Open the bars\" because that is only way they can recover their income when, of course, the public health advice is to keep the bars closed at the moment.  That is the truth.  The Minister can cry crocodile tears about the plight of the arts workers, musicians and all the rest of it, and then do absolutely nothing about it, or, in fact, do worse than nothing by slashing their income.  That has happened and she is copper-fastening it in this Bill.  That is undermining the public health effort.  It breaks the solidarity that has underpinned that public effort and because she is breaking that solidarity she will be to blame if things go wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800077#EEEE00500","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595965500,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I too am disappointed with the Bill and with the whole situation around Covid-19.

Are we going to diminish and destroy our arts industry - our musicians, bands, dancing schools, art schools and everything else?<\/p>  <p>  Over-66s are being punished by this Government but I am not surprised.  It is scandalous.  Whether they are publicans, lorry drivers, or taxi drivers, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, they have been discriminated against from the start and they are being further discriminated against in this legislation.  The Minister is coming in here offering to be a saviour and a support mechanism.  <\/p>  <p>  She expects the schools to go back and I am glad that decision has been made.  Many of the over-66s drive school buses part time.  It suits them grand and it suits the bus companies as well.  Any companies that had school buses contracted to Bus &Eacute;ireann are getting a 50% payment but individual bus owners not contracted to Bus &Eacute;ireann did not get a shilling.  We expect those to be mobilised on 28 August and in September and to have buses and drivers ready and on the road, DOE'd, insured and with all the checks necessary for public service vehicles.  Are they going to do it on the wind?  They have not got a penny.  Many of them are on their last legs.  Some of them had savings.  Publicans have been crying on the phone to me.  Then there is the stupidity of pubs opening if they provide a &euro;9 meal.  Worse than that, they were all told ten days ago that they would be open last Monday week.  They were not told until literally hours before it that they would not.  They had their stocks opened and paid for the reopening.  It was a further kick in the teeth.  These publicans have nothing to live on .  Any of them who are over 66 are not getting a payment because they have a small pension.  All they wanted was to make up the difference between the pension and the Covid-19 payment of &euro;350 at the time.<\/p> <p>The Minister then changed and gave the &euro;350 to everybody across the board.  Parents contacted me because their kids got it.  They may have only worked four or five hours a weekend on a Saturday or Sunday night and they got the full &euro;350 payment.  Now the Government is in trouble with its finances.  It gave that out to them when it should not have because they did not expect it.<\/p> <p> All the Government needed to do was look back at their wages for the previous four weeks and give them what they had got, and they would have been reasonably happy with that.  The Government threw money out like confetti at a wedding or snuff at a wake and now it is trying to take it back.  However, it is penalising those aged over 66 and our actors.  Our actors do not ask anyone for anything.  They educate and upskill themselves.  They play, adapt and buy the equipment and look after themselves.  They give valuable entertainment to the people while so doing.  All they want is to be allowed do that, but while the pubs, etc., are closed, they cannot do it.

Deputy Boyd Barrett ignores the part of the social contract that was fulfilled.  He probably never thought he would see such a day when the State would fulfil this kind of social contract.  The State did its bit in the face of an emergency.<\/p>  <p>  However, he has raised questions on which I am confused.  The Minister has said it is overwhelmingly people who are returning home, but it would be helpful if she could furnish the House with statistics.  It clearly is not allowed for people to return to a foreign country while continuing to claim the PUP here.  That is illegal and it is right to ensure it is policed appropriately under the law.  Of the small percentage of those travellers who were Irish, if they were travelling to one of the 13 or 15 countries on the green list, do they lose the payment?  A certain degree of confusion arises in that area and clarity is needed.<\/p>  <p>  There is also an assumption, which I think it is incorrect, that only poor people are on the PUP.  The employment losses were widespread and there is a stereotype about those in receipt of it.   Some of them could be married.  The partner of a millionaire could be on the PUP because he or she lost his or her job.  They could have booked their holidays last September or October.  What if someone on the PUP is holidaying at home?  For someone on this allowance, what is the difference between holidaying at home and holidaying in one of the green-list countries?  It is a genuine question.  I am confused about that.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the other Deputies did not refer to some of the profound changes the Minister is introducing that will allow the Department to attribute paid PRSI contributions to employees who receive these payments.  That is a very significant and important provision for people.  It will allow them to ensure they retain their entitlement to short-term payments as well as enhancing their PRSI records, something that may not cross their minds but, depending on their age, may cross their minds in 20 or 25 years when they come to draw their pension or see if they are entitled to a pension.  These are critical issues that Deputies have not mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  I have considerable sympathy for what the previous Deputy said about those aged 66 and older.  However, the PUP was not thrown around like confetti at a wedding.  It was a major State intervention that saw the State honour its side of the social contract at a time of perilous need on the part of people.  I accept that some people who may not have needed it as much as others got it.  It will be spent, I am sure.  However, I did feel for those aged 66 and older who did not get it and who had to work because their pension would not have been enough to keep them going.  I ask the Minister to address some of those confusing aspects of the PUP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800079#GGGG00700","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1595966100,"counter":517,"content":"<p>The green list is not a list of holiday destinations and the public health advice is still for people not to go abroad.  UK holidaymakers discovered last week that while they were on a Spanish holiday, Spain was removed from a green list, as were all the Spanish islands, and moved to the red list.  These people have now returned home to a 14-day quarantine period they had thought would not be in place.  As the Government has stated, the green list in Ireland will constantly evolve.  Like everything else related to Covid, everything we do will be kept under review in line with public health advice.  Holidaying at home is the safest thing people can do.  I want to be clear that everything I do is in line with public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  I will deal with the changes to the payment.  In early July, we moved to a two-tier system, which meant that anybody whose earnings before the pandemic were less than &euro;200 received a payment of &euro;203, while anyone earning more than &euro;200 continued to receive the &euro;350 payment.  That system remains in place today.  There have been no changes or cuts to the payment, as some may have suggested.  From 17 September, which is still almost two months away, we will have a three-tier system of PUP, which will be linked to an individual's prior earnings.  A person whose prior earnings were less than &euro;200 will see no change and will continue to receive the &euro;203 rate of payment.  A person previously earning between &euro;200 and &euro;300 will receive a payment of &euro;250, which means that people on the payment will continue to receive more than 80% of their prior income and many will actually continue to receive a payment which is higher than when they were working.<\/p>  <p>  Anybody previously earning in excess of &euro;300 will receive a payment of &euro;300.  As I said, these changes will not take effect until 17 September.  It is important to remember that as the economy has reopened and people have returned to work, we have seen the number of people on the PUP fall from 600,000 a couple of months ago to 287,000 people today.  In the past couple of weeks alone, well over 100,000 people have closed their PUP claims.  Provided we can continue to keep the virus under control and the number of cases remains low, my hope is that we will see many more people return to work by the time these changes come into effect in mid-September.<\/p>  <p>  The people aged over 66 who do not qualify for PUP are already receiving a social welfare payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800079#GGGG00800","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1595966100,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Before calling the next speaker, I mention that we have a deadline of 10 p.m.  There are handwritten amendments, I presume, to the section.

Those who work in live entertainment have explicitly told the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response that their main fear is that people will be driven out of the sector if they are not supported.

She was here a minute ago.  I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for her patience as it would be important to have the Minister present for the debate so I will pause until her arrival.<\/p><p>One in every five children, and one in every four children in the Minister's constituency of Kerry, are in classes of more than 30.  Many are in classes much larger than this.  There are not enough teachers and there is not enough space.  This has made trying to achieve social distancing and a safe return much harder than it is in other jurisdictions.  For example, in Denmark they have been able to split classes into groups of ten and in France classes are capped at 15.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that children need to be back in school.  All parents and staff worked hard over recent months trying to keep things on the road between projects, art, essays, baking, Zoom classes, exercise with Joe Wicks and all the rest of it.  There is no doubt that people made an enormous effort.  However, we all know it is not the ideal way to get an education.  In spite of everyone's best efforts, there is no question that many children fell behind.<\/p><p>For months, we have been calling for a roadmap for education that is significantly funded and has the package required.  I am glad the Government finally responded to the pressure coming from the Opposition, parents and the public as a whole and released the plan yesterday evening.  I am concerned, however, that the roadmap fails to deliver in crucial areas and leaves parents and teachers with an incredibly short time frame to bring these plans to fruition.<\/p><p>The new school year is to start in just over four weeks.  There are just four weeks for schools to plan, recruit staff, adjust classrooms and, in some instances, build or find additional space.  We were given the roadmap and it contains diagrams of classrooms of 60 sq. m and 80 sq. m for primary schools but the Minister and I know there are many primary schools, such as Christian Brothers' primary schools that were built in the 1950s or 1960s, where the classrooms are much smaller than this.  They might be in areas of high population and they will struggle to find space, whether through converting corridors, halls or anything at all, and it will be a real challenge for them.<\/p><p>The implementation of the roadmap would clearly have been a lot more realistic if it had been published on 12 June as promised, or even a fortnight afterwards that as was subsequently promised.  I am also quite concerned about substitution.  Much concern has been raised about this throughout the State.  Last year, 500 posts a day were not being replaced.  Now, there are 200 additional substitutes.  That was not enough to meet what was required last year much less this year in the context of Covid-19.<\/p><p>The roadmap, while welcome, is not a sticking plaster for the fact we have the highest pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, in the EU.  I note the Minister's amendment, which is the Government giving itself a great big clap on the back, but it does not address the fundamental point, which is disappointing, especially given that reducing the PTR and investing in schools are meant to be programme for Government commitments.  They are not even commented on, which draws into question whether the Government is truly committed to transforming the education system.  While no one could have predicted the scale and manner of the pandemic, we have to acknowledge the failure to invest in our schools has put them in a particularly vulnerable position, which meant that ever before Covid they were stretched to breaking point.<\/p> <p>I believe the Minister must confront this.  It must be an absolute priority.  We have left our school system vulnerable, but it does not have to be this way.  In fact, tackling the PTR at primary level in the first instance can be cost neutral over the coming years because of the demographic shift.  All the Minister needs to do is hold firm against anyone in the Department who wishes to reduce the Department's workforce.  If the Minister retains teachers at primary level, she can reduce the pupil-teacher ratio at no additional cost.  It is incredible that in the midst of a pandemic, when social distancing is such a crucial issue and given the impact it has had on education, that there is no commitment in the plan to reduce the ratio and the overcrowded classes.  That is very disappointing.  It was already necessary to begin the process of tackling the oversized classes because it has an enormous impact on education.<\/p> <p> The other concern I wish to raise is children with special educational needs.  A question has arisen since yesterday and it was brought into further light by the circular supplied today, which seems to suggest that special education teachers can be moved to cover absences and to work on remote teaching.  I will return to this in my concluding remarks, but children with special educational needs are among those who have lost most in the past few months.  They must be the priority and must not be undermined by their resources being allocated elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800082#LLLL00600","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595968500,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I welcome the roadmap for returning to school.  I doubt there is anybody who does not wish to see a full return to school at the end of August or the beginning of September.  However, it is very late considering that the schools have been closed for more than four months.  It has put unfair pressure on everybody affected, such as those responsible for preparing the timetable.  Most post-primary schools would usually have the timetable prepared in June.  Now we have principals or deputy principals trying to prepare a timetable within weeks, having finally received some clarity on class size.  They are also faced with trying to recruit additional teachers at this late stage.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that class sizes are to be reduced, but it is unfortunate that it took a pandemic to bring this about.  I hope the reduction in class size is permanent and is not just while the threat from Covid remains.  The 1,080 additional teachers for post-primary schools is welcome, but I wonder how the figure was devised.  There are 723 post-primary schools and this equates to approximately 1.5 teachers per school.  If teachers are being advised not to attend work if they have flu-like symptoms, that figure will not be enough.  While I welcome the additional posts, are there sufficient teachers in the country to fill the posts?  Teachers of Irish, French and mathematics, for example, were extremely difficult to source for the past number of years so has any data been gathered on the number of teachers available for employment at present?<\/p>  <p>  The roadmap does not address procedures for staff and students with underlying health conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid-19.  How will children's educational needs be met if they are unable to attend school?  That has not been dealt with sufficiently in the document.  Children with special needs, especially autism spectrum disorder, ASD, will find returning to school after over five months off extremely difficult.  These students need to be reassured.  They need routine and as little change as possible.  A great deal of preparation is, therefore, required before returning to school.  However, again, it is so late in the day for these students and families that there is pressure on them to ensure they do not end up with school refusals.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that primary schools that are due to lose a teacher this September will have that decision deferred for at least a year.  The document also refers to additional psychologists being employed.  Where will they come from?  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, could not recruit enough psychologists to fill the vacancies it had last year.  While the roadmap is welcome, it is aspirational and late in the day.  The only thing that saves it is that there is a strong willingness among all concerned to see schools open again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800083#MMMM00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1595968500,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and I commend my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, on bringing it forward.  I will focus on the rural perspective when it comes to reopening schools post-Covid-19.  A glaringly obvious issue with the plan for reopening schools that the Minister has brought forward is the fact that there is no recruitment of primary school teachers in it.  This is a problem because schools faced issues getting substitute teachers long before we ever heard of Covid-19.  There are particular issues for rural schools.  Many newly qualified teachers are gone from those areas.  Before Covid-19, teaching principals in primary schools had great difficulty getting substitute teachers for various days.  Sometimes they just could not get them and other plans had to be put in place.  That is going to be a major issue.<\/p>  <p>  Is there a plan B in that regard, particularly in rural schools and with regard to the forming of panels?  How will those panels be put together if the teachers simply are not available?  Again, this will be difficult in rural areas.  The pilot project for the panels was mentioned as being successful, but I heard a teacher from Meath on the radio in the past few days say that the pilot in that teacher's area was unsuccessful.  That has to be looked at again.  The additional one day per week for principals is very welcome and has long been sought.  However, how will that work with regard to getting a substitute teacher in once a week every week?  Will that teacher move between schools in rural areas?<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the aid that will be made available to schools, could student teachers be employed?  They will have missed out on some placements and it would be great experience for them.  Could they be employed between now and the schools reopening to assist teachers and schools in reopening?  I refer to special educational needs teachers moving from one school to another, especially in rural areas.  How will that work and how will safety be ensured in those cases?<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to mention school transport.  It is an absolute nightmare for many parents throughout the country and particularly in rural areas.  There is a real need for discretion regarding those applying for school transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800083#MMMM00300","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1595968500,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I have good reason to focus my time on classroom sizes in Meath, as we have the highest in Ireland in Ashbourne, or on school buildings.  Lismullen national school, for example, is one of the oldest and in the most urgent need of address.  However, I wish to focus my comments on access.  The future of education has to be one of public and active transport.  That must the way of the future as it makes sense with or without Covid-19.  We must get children walking or cycling or on the bus and out of cars.  That said, there are areas that urgently need to be addressed.  Many schools have no footpath access to the front door.  One in five reported this to be the case in a recent Green-Schools survey.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that we must support and expand our school transport system.  I urge the Minister to meet representatives of the school bus transport sector.  They were out in droves protesting today.  They have been treated very badly during the pandemic.  Many were left without any State supports and they are on their knees.  The Government's back-to-school roadmap did not contain enough detail for them.  The operators I spoke to today still have a range of questions.  They want to know what obligations will be placed on them with regard to loading and unloading buses.  For example, will it be left to them to police the proposed compulsory seating arrangements?  In terms of the funding announced, there is very little detail about how the &euro;11 million will be allocated.  Time is precious as we only have four weeks.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that a comprehensive, long-term strategy for school transport is long overdue.  The service has been eroded over the years.  I refer to what is happening with concessionary passes, for example.  The service has been hollowed out and this must stop.

There are serious issues throughout education and we need to see leadership from her on them.<\/p>  <p>  This country has some of the largest class sizes in Europe, yet instead of taking the opportunity to address this issue now, nothing is being done about it.  This issue is not new; it is years old.  One of the first public meetings I attended in 2007 was on class sizes, yet we are still talking about it now.  What plans will be in place for children with underlying health conditions or with parents who have underlying health conditions and where they do not feel it is safe for them to return to the classroom?  I hope they will not be left isolated and abandoned and that there is a plan for them.  There are also children with additional needs who have experienced a delay in their diagnosis, particularly of autism.<\/p>  <p>It might be clear to everyone that these children need ASD class places, but they just do not have it written down on paper because of the delays due to Covid.  What will happen to these children?  Where will they return to in September?  Will there be any option for them?  Every single year we have the same two issues: the lack of school places, whether at primary or secondary level; and school transport.  Will the Department please look at areas that have been highlighted time and time again?  A few weeks ago I highlighted with the Minister's predecessor the issue of the lack of secondary school places for boys in Kilkenny city.  I only received a reply last week, and it leaves a lot to be desired.  There is clearly an issue - it has been raised time and time again - with secondary school places in the area.  Will the Department look at this, given that it knows there are capacity issues, actually do something about it and work with those of us who want to do something about it?  Similarly, it may be a different town or village, but every single year there are areas in people's constituencies that do not have access to school transport.  We know these issues exist, so will the Department please start being a bit proactive and look at long-term solutions?

Let us be honest: it is one of the most pressing issues at present.  Many parents have now faced over 137 days since the schools were closed and they have waited and waited for the Government's announcement on the reopening of schools.  Being a mother of five children, I know from experience how difficult it can be to homeschool children while trying to keep some bit of normality in our day-to-day lives.  I take this opportunity to commend all parents, in particular lone parents, who have been going through this very strange situation over the past four months, especially as their eager children have sought answers that the parents just did not have.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the announcement from the Government last night on the roadmap to reopening schools, and I am sure it will be warmly welcomed by parents and pupils alike, but let us be straight: this roadmap is late.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have been calling for the roadmap for some time, but here we are, just four weeks out from schools reopening, and we get this announcement only now.  This timeline does not allow schools enough time to get capital projects under way and completed in time.  For example, Clonmoney national school, in Newmarket on Fergus, County Clare, has been looking for a new extension for some time, but this project and many others seem to be caught up in a pile of red tape.  If this has been the case all along with building works, I cannot see how this will change in the next four weeks.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a lack of commitment to special education hours for schools when they reopen.  One group in our society that has been severely impacted by Covid is our people with disabilities.  For them we need to ensure that when schools reopen there are more resource hours coupled with smaller class sizes.  These are essential, first, to reopen schools safely and, second, to ensure that pupils and teachers can effectively pick up where they left off back in March.  Ireland is way above the EU average when it comes to class sizes, and that is simply not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to mention the difficult situation faced by pupils who now have to transition from primary school and secondary school.

I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for tabling the motion.<\/p>  <p>  While the roadmap deals with the immediate issue of the Covid crisis, I also wish to raise the need for new school buildings in Laois and Offaly, some of which are pressing issues, and more pressing now, given the demands on the system.  The plan the Government has presented includes 1,080 new secondary teaching posts to be filled, 200 substitute staff positions and &euro;75 million in capital grants, but all this is to be done within four weeks.  That is a huge task, and it is debatable whether it can be achieved.  Meeting social distancing guidelines will be very difficult, considering how overcrowded many of our classrooms are.  Many of them are small, and in a lot of them across my constituency, Laois-Offaly, it would just not be possible to achieve social distancing of 1 m, let alone 2 m.  For years Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for the EU average of 20 students to each teacher.  If we had that now, we would be in a much better position.  According to the INTO, 17.2% of children in Laois are in classrooms of more than 30 pupils, and 17.1% of children in Offaly are in a similar situation.  Decades of underdevelopment in our education system have left many of our schools run-down and not fit for purpose.  As I mentioned, two schools in particular are in real difficulty.  Trying to achieve social distancing in them will be nearly impossible due to the inadequate, unfit, cramped conditions of their buildings.  Scoil Mhuire, in Abbeyleix, which has more than 300 pupils, urgently needs extensive work carried out.  While work is planned to stop the water from coming in through the roof, which has been caught in plastic containers and buckets for nearly a year now, work is also needed on the plumbing, sewerage system and electrics in the school.  That is in the short term.  What they really need is a new school.  There are 2 acres of vacant land at the rear owned by the parish which can be used for this.  Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in, in Portarlington, is also badly in need of a new building.  This secondary school currently accommodates more than 1,000 pupils in almost 30 prefab accommodation classrooms.  It is not fit for purpose.  They need a new school.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the roadmap, I call on the Minister to include these two schools and to prioritise them for funding in the new capital programme for schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800084#NNNN00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1595969100,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words following &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;

 <\/blockquote>  <p>I am happy to be here to address directly the motion put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in as it gives me another opportunity to highlight the comprehensive plan, the roadmap to the reopening of our schools, which I published yesterday, following Cabinet approval.  The interests of students and their families as well as the safety of the staff in the sector have been the paramount considerations throughout as the challenges before us from Covid-19 have been worked through.  Coming from an education sector background, and as a regular contributor to the debates on education in the D&aacute;il before becoming Minister for Education, I was keenly aware of the interest in education but also the concerns and at times the anxieties of students, their families, their school communities and, more generally, how those challenges were being addressed.<\/p><p>Since my appointment as Minister, the number one priority for me, Government, my Department and the wider schools sector has been to reopen our schools fully and safely at the start of the new school year.  We said that in reopening our schools we would be guided by the available public health advice and comprehensive engagement with stakeholders, including the school management bodies and staff representatives, as well as students and parents.  There has never been any doubt but that I as Minister, my Department, school leaders and staff all want to see schools reopen as normal in the new school year in late August and into September based on their normal timeframes.<\/p><p>Yesterday I brought proposals to Cabinet which outlined a comprehensive funding package and plan to provide the necessary supports and clear guidance for primary and post-primary schools to return safely in the new term.  I also sought approval to publish a roadmap for the full return to schools, described yesterday by An Taoiseach as the most comprehensive and detailed sectoral plan he has seen.  Cabinet agreed to both, and I was able to publish the roadmap yesterday together with details of the &euro;375 million-plus in additional funding necessary to support the roadmap.<\/p><p>The motion from Sinn F&eacute;in before the House calls for a roadmap.  We have delivered the roadmap.  The Deputies were aware that it was my intention to publish such a roadmap by the end of this month.  That has been the intention for the last number of weeks.  My colleagues in Government and I have always recognised that schools would need to be supported to reopen.  The roadmap I published outlines a comprehensive range of measures being provided to support the full reopening of schools in time for the start of the new school year in late August, early September.  The roadmap was developed following intensive engagement with stakeholders from the education sector, including staff unions of teachers, SNAs, school caretakers and secretaries, representatives of principals and deputy principals, school management bodies and representatives of parents and post-primary students.<\/p> <p>The roadmap and the funding package recognise the challenges faced by schools in ensuring the safe return of more than 1 million students and approximately 100,000 staff in 4,000 schools in the context of Covid-19.  It sets out clear plans and practical guidance on the measures schools will need to take to operate safely and minimise the risk of the introduction and spread of infection in schools.<\/p> <p> The roadmap and its accompanying documentation provides schools with guidance on training, checklists for schools on preparing for reopening and guidance for operating schools safely in a Covid context.  It advises on areas across logistics, curriculum, teaching, managing school activities, supporting pupils with additional needs, administration and well-being.  In other words, it is a comprehensive plan.<\/p> <p> My Department has prepared a suite of support materials for schools, including guidance on curriculum, well-being of students, well-being of staff as well as protocols for minimising the risk of spread of infection in schools.  In addition, I also published template Covid-19 response plans for schools.  These plans provide clear and practical guidance and support to schools on the range of  measures that need to be put in place to bring everyone back to school safely.<\/p> <p> The funding supports are comprehensive across a wide range of areas.  There will be funding for replacement staff for those who cannot come to school as they are at very high risk of Covid-19.  This includes teaching staff, special needs assistants and administrative staff.  This can occur where staff members who are identified in line with HSE guidance as at very high risk of Covid-19 are advised to cocoon.  Funding for additional supply panels at primary level is provided for.  This will ensure more certainty around the availability of substitutes for primary schools.  Also in the package is funding for more than 1,000 additional teachers at post-primary level to help with physical distancing and class sizes.  This will include 120 additional guidance posts.  There will be funding to provide release days for teaching principals at primary level to meet the administrative burden arising from the changes and the impacts of Covid-19.  This will mean that all teaching principals will have one release day per week and this is something which I am particularly pleased to be able to deliver as I consider it an essential support to reduce the burden on these principals.  In addition, there will be some release time for deputy principals in primary schools.  Enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures are particularly important and the additional funding being provided will enable schools to have daily cleaning arrangements and to purchase supplies of hand sanitiser and any other personal protective equipment, PPE, necessary.  There is also funding for enhanced supervision, which is a key control measure to support schools in minimising interaction of students from different classes, in line with public health advice.  Funding will be provided to support school leadership, especially principals, in getting the schools ready.  All schools will be able to employ an aide to help get the school ready.  As announced in the July stimulus package, funding of &euro;75 million will support minor capital works for all schools.<\/p> <p> As I said, reopening schools is a priority for Government and has been my priority since becoming Minister for Education and Skills.  In preparing for the reopening of schools, we know that most students, and indeed their families and school staff, will be looking forward to going back, reconnecting with school, reconnecting with staff and friends and settling back into school work.  There is a strong emphasis in the roadmap on safety, and on practical arrangements, but also on ensuring the well-being of the students and of the entire staff community.  <\/p> <p> One of the key elements to ensuring that schools once they reopen can remain open is to prevent the Covid-19 virus from getting into a school in the first instance.  This will mean students, their families and staff playing their roles in keeping the virus out of their school by ensuring those who have symptoms or suspect they have the virus stay out of school, by maintaining best practice in terms of hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette in school and by minimising social contacts and respecting physical distancing practices.<\/p> <p> Reopening our schools is not just a matter of achieving a certain minimum physical distancing.  It is about getting students re-engaged fully with learning and socialising with their peers.  For some it will be about preparing for examinations, for others it will involve transitioning to school life or to a different level in terms of moving from primary to post-primary.  Students need the support of their families, teachers and school staff in readjusting to school life and physical learning environments again.<\/p> <p> It is realistic to predict that all students, parents, teachers and other school staff will experience a broad range of feelings as part of the return to school.  This may include a mixture of excitement, happiness and relief but may also include anxiety and fear.  This is understandable given these circumstances and there is a response in place to support the well-being of our school communities as part of the planning to return to school.<\/p> <p> I can assure the House that there is full engagement with the education stakeholders and that everyone is committed to supporting schools to prepare at a local level for their reopening.  There will also be comprehensive communication with students and parents so that they are fully informed over the coming weeks.  That information campaign has already commenced.  My Department is providing dedicated and direct contact channels to schools so that where issues might arise they can be resolved quickly.  Government has provided a comprehensive plan and supports to ensure we can reopen our schools but we must all continue to work together to achieve the goal of seeing our schools reopen.  <\/p> <p> I am the first to acknowledge the support and engagement of my counterpart in Northern Ireland on matters vitally important to our sectors.  However, it is worth noting that, North of the Border, return to school guidance was issued by the Department of Education in Northern Ireland on 24 June setting out plans to reopen on 24 August to certain year groups.  It is expected that some schools will only be able to return partially with a minimum standard of blended learning.  This will include a minimum 40% face-to-face learning in primary and perhaps 50% in post-primary.  No additional funding has yet been committed to support schools in their preparations for reopening.  Detailed guidance has yet to issue on curriculum, transport and well-being measures as well as catering, risk assessments and human resources management.<\/p> <p> The Sinn F&eacute;in motion suggests that the summer programmes have fallen far short of Government announcements.  In fact, the number of participating schools and students and the eligibility for those programmes exceeds previous years.  Deputies may wish to note that 245 schools are participating in the summer-based programme for children with complex needs, benefiting 3,900 students.  These programmes are providing a crucial stepping stone in rebuilding the connection between students and their schools before they return more fully in the autumn as there is a particular focus on re-establishing relationships, building connections, meeting emotional needs and re-engaging in routines to support participation and learning.<\/p> <p> As the Taoiseach reiterated today, since coming into office, this Government has been working tirelessly on reopening our society and the reopening of our schools is a vital part of that.  Government has committed the necessary supports and funding to the schools sector.  Therefore, I ask this House to reject the Sinn F&eacute;in motion and to support my countermotion which recognises the work undertaken by Government, my Department and the education partners working in collaboration to develop the roadmap to reopen our schools and over the coming weeks to see it delivered successfully.<\/p> <p> As I said in the Seanad earlier today, these are changed times.  As a country we have stood up to the challenges before us and we have seen great resilience, tremendous community spirit and a shared responsibility to contribute to the fight against the virus.  We are now committed to reopening our society in every sense and the schools sector is now preparing to get our students back into classrooms in the coming weeks.  Government is fully committed to supporting that return and has shown the scale of that commitment in the support package announced yesterday.  I know Deputies in this House will support our students, our schools and our communities in getting back to school as normal in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p> Faoi mar a bh&iacute; riamh, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800084#NNNN00400","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595969700,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I am not sure which motion the Minister has read because the Sinn F&eacute;in motion does not call for a roadmap.  It calls for the reduction of class sizes in line with the European average of 20:1, which she failed to address.  She did not use any of her ten minutes to acknowledge that, at primary level, we have the highest class sizes in Europe.  Nor did she acknowledge the fact that one in five of our children is in classes of more than 30 pupils and this makes the challenge of returning to school in a safe way all the more challenging for our boards of management, teachers and principals, who will have to see how they can work within the guidelines to ensure what all of us want, which is that children go back to school in late August and September.  The reality is that class size in this State is a shameful indictment of successive Governments in relation to the lack of funding and support for primary education.  Instead of calling on the House to reject this motion, this was an opportunity for the Minister to commit to dealing with the fact that we have class sizes that are way above what we should have.  Does the Minister believe it is appropriate or right that one in five children in Donegal or, on average, across the State is in classes of more than 30 children and that we have some children in classes as big as 35?<\/p> <p>Last year, we learned that there were a number of children who were in classes above 40 in number.  That is the legacy we are faced with and this is an opportunity to address it, as set out in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.<\/p> <p> I welcome the publication of the plan to get our schools reopened in late August or September.  However, I am concerned that it is late in the day and I believe the Minister has placed a huge challenge and task on boards of management, teachers and principals to deliver on it.  I have no doubt they will move heaven and earth to get their schools equipped and ready in time.  My big concern relates to substitute teachers.  I say this because the Minister has announced no reduction in class sizes at primary level but is instead proposing to establish supply panels with a total of 200 teachers.  These are not additional teachers to go into schools but will be replacing existing vacancies.  This is something I welcome and which the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, was calling for before the pandemic.  The problem is that 3,500 substitute teachers, on average, go into our primary schools every single day.  As our spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, pointed out, 500 vacancies in primary schools cannot be filled by substitute teachers because the numbers are not there.  The supply panels of 200 teachers are not going to cut it, particularly given that those teachers will not be able to present at school with a head cold, a runny nose and so on because of infection control measures.  I am very concerned that the whole system could unravel.<\/p> <p> As someone who comes from a Gaeltacht area, the fact that there is no Gaeltacht supply panel is a huge missed opportunity which needs to be rectified.  There are three supply panels indicated for Donegal but none at all serving the Gaeltacht area.  This issue is not unique to my county and it must be dealt with wherever it arises throughout the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800085#OOOO00300","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595970300,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of yesterday's roadmap for reopening schools.  However, it is too little too late and it is light on detail.  It is also a missed opportunity to address our spiralling pupil-teacher ratio, which is one of the highest in the OECD.  Throughout this pandemic, we have seen the value of front-line workers.  It is time for the Government to show its appreciation of them.  A clap once a week does not pay the bills and it does not put a roof over their heads.  We need to end the two-tier pay system for teachers and provide pay equality for school secretaries.  Our pupils and teachers deserve better.  We need to engage with teachers on the return to school, consult them and listen to and address their concerns.  We need to provide more support for teaching principals in particular.  They cannot be expected to project-manage the reopening of schools and keep up with the inevitable avalanche of paperwork while teaching classes four or five days a week.  We need to look at how transition year will function in our new normal.  We need a specific plan for schools in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme.  A total of 25% of schools in my county of Kildare are DEIS schools.  We must protect and enhance the extra support provided to those schools.<\/p>  <p>  The plan to return to school mentions using existing space better.  Our schools are already at breaking point, with long delays in the schools building programme.  St. Paul's school in Monasterevin is long overdue a new building.  For more than 20 years, the school management has been doing its best, adding prefab after prefab and using the sports hall to host classes.  Eighteen of its 27 classrooms are prefabs.  Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in in Portarlington has almost 30 prefabs.  I spoke in the House a number of weeks ago about St. Anne's special school in the Curragh and how an algorithm had decided it was to lose two teachers.  I have been in contact with the Department of Education and Skills to seek a reversal of this cut.  Unfortunately, the teachers who were let go have moved on, leaving a deficit of experience that cannot be easily replaced.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to revisit the back to school plan to ensure the voices of children of different abilities, and their families, are heard.  She must liaise with those families because every time there is an announcement, they are left behind.  That needs to change.  We must fast-track the roll-out of broadband and ensure schools and pupils are provided with the technology required to do things differently.  We need to ensure families in direct provision are given the supports they require to make sure they are not left behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800086#PPPP00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1595970300,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion brought forward by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  The lockdown ended for most of us weeks ago.  Lots of people have gone back to work, we can socialise again and some form of normality has returned.  However, this is not the case for children who attend special education schools and their families, who are still in lockdown.  For these children, school is a lifeline, social outlet and the place where they receive their much-needed support and their education.  Children who attend special education facilities often have complex medical needs and disabilities and a one-size-fits-all solution will not work for them.  The families of these children are at breaking point.  They have struggled for months to look after their children, some of whom need full-time care and attention, while trying to work and look after their other children since schools closed in March.  They have endured the heartache of having to watch their children regress in the past few months and to see them frustrated, confused and upset by their situation.<\/p>  <p>  The summer provision plan proved to be a major disappointment for many families because the Government failed to plan for increased capacity, which meant many children could not be accommodated.  The reopening plan provides very limited detail on special education facilities.  It is vague and does not address the specific challenges in those schools.  I am very concerned that it could lead to a situation where children with special educational needs are left behind.  We need plans to deal with the unique orientation challenge that will face them when they return.  We need a plan to deal with situations where children are too vulnerable to return to school for medical reasons.  We need an additional, dedicated strategy for these schools to provide clarity on how they will reopen and stay open and to ensure no child is left behind.  Will the Minister clarify whether she will publish a dedicated strategy for special education schools?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800086#PPPP00300","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1595970300,"counter":569,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that the lockdown and the disruption to the education of children from preschool to secondary school will have had an impact of the capacity of those children to learn.  The impact will be greater for children with special learning requirements and children who are marginalised or from vulnerable or disadvantaged sections of society.  The fear is that the longer such children are out of school, there is a real possibility that many may not return to education.  For vulnerable and disadvantaged children, prolonged closures will also have a significant negative impact on their well-being because of the disruption to essential school-based services they often depend on, such as breakfast clubs, school meals and mental health supports, which will cause additional stress and anxiety for them.  Children with disabilities or special needs will also be seriously impacted by the lockdown.  They already face an uphill struggle in the education system and the problems thrown up by Covid will add to the already heavy burden on them.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the reopening of schools is done safely and consistent with Covid-19 health guidelines.  It is vital that measures are taken to protect students, staff, teachers and their families to ensure a full and safe return to school.  Irish primary school classes have an average of 25 students, compared with an EU average of 20 and an OECD average of 21.  Sinn F&eacute;in is looking to bring class sizes in line with the European average.  According to the INTO, studies have shown that students in disadvantaged areas do better in smaller classes.  However, we should also ensure, particularly in the current environment, that facilities such as toilets, cloakrooms, etc., are suitable and adhere to the Covid health and safety guidelines.  Parents, students and teachers are looking for proper guidance going forward as schools reopen.  So far, the Government's response has been confusing and inconsistent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800086#PPPP00400","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speech","time":1595970300,"counter":570,"content":"<p>Our grandparents' generation, particularly our grandmothers, used to say that education was no burden.  Some 80 or 90 years ago, a child might well have come to the kitchen table at age 12, 13 or 14 to tell of an offer of a job in a factory or on the docks, which was a chance to leave school and go into employment.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>The mothers of those families - our grandmothers - would say that education is no burden.  Not only is it not a burden, but is also the great liberator which saves families from poverty and young people from disadvantage.  It gives them the life chance they need to maximise their potential.  The tragedy of education is that so many people fall through its cracks.  In Ireland, one third of primary school children in disadvantaged schools leave with basic reading problems, and 17.9% of our adult population is functionally illiterate.  If one compares two three year olds, one from a disadvantaged family and one from an advantaged or regular family, the disadvantaged three year old has one third of the oral language capacity of the advantaged one.  That is 400 words versus 1,200 words, before they come anywhere near a school gate.  In America, where the prison system has been privatised, the prisons predict how much spare capacity and prison cells they will need in 15 years by looking at the literacy rates of ten year olds in their districts.<\/p> <p> Education is absolutely the great liberator.  The most powerful thing in the world, which can change not just a village or a family but an entire country, is a girl with a book.  That is why it is so infuriating, dispiriting and upsetting to see education and those who work and believe in it being so disrespected in the last number of months.  SNAs had to endure a bungled redeployment programme.  Teachers, principals and parents listened to Minister after Minister giving different advice and sound bites about the potential for reopening schools.  We had the spectre of blended learning hanging over us for the entire summer.  Then we had the leaving certificate and student representatives hearing about the delay in leaving certificate results in the media.<\/p> <p> The package the Minister has produced is welcome.  All of us have a responsibility to speak positively about the potential for this package to open schools because if we do not open them next month or in September, we are going to lose an entire generation of vulnerable young people who are not legally required to be in school if they are over 16 years of age.  Schools and teachers have been much maligned by people writing columns in newspapers who do not have a cat's clue what it is like to work in a school or with a vulnerable young person.  Teachers are holding schools, and sometimes families, together by their fingernails and often ensure that young people do not make the wrong choice at the wrong time.  They have been holding on to a whole generation of 16 and 17 year olds while they have been out of the school buildings and hoping, praying and encouraging them to come back in September.  If we lose that generation, we will most likely lose them forever.  That is a burden on them, and on all of us.<\/p> <p> This package has to work and we want it to, but we have grave problems with some of its elements, which we hope the Minister can address over the next few weeks.  The lateness of the package is not the Minister's fault and I would not necessarily blame Fianna F&aacute;il for it either because it has only been in office for a few weeks.  However, myself, Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and Gannon, representatives from other political parties and members of the Covid-19 committee have been calling for a package for months.  We asked for it in April, May and June and we asked again this month.  It has arrived and it is substantial.  However, principals have said to me that it should have come with a magic wand because they need to magic up some teachers and school buildings that do not exist.  It is our collective responsibility as politicians to show a little bit of leadership, to provide some certainty, and to suggest to the Irish people that this can work and that we can open schools.  It is not just about opening schools, but ensuring they stay open as well.<\/p> <p> I spoke earlier about disrespect and how SNAs, teachers, parents and education have been disrespected.  This package suggests that special educational needs teachers will be used as substitutes.  That is not just disrespectful to the profession they lead and the work they do keeping vulnerable students in touch and connected with education, but it is also disrespectful to those young people who need the individual attention and special educational expertise those teachers provide.  Suggesting that they can just be shifted over to a substitute position is unfair and disrespectful and it cannot work.<\/p> <p> As regards the transport situation, I understand that parents have to apply for school transport for their children by this Friday.  Some 120,000 children and young people, 14,200 of whom have special educational needs, use this service.  However, the school transport operators are in no position to make a firm commitment this week or by this Friday on whether they can do the job.  The least we can do is delay the date by which parents have to apply for that transport scheme.  That is another practical suggestion for the Minister. <\/p> <p> I refer again to education being no burden and being a great liberator.  Education is a life chance for young people to be everything they can possibly be and we, as a collective and an Oireachtas, cannot get this wrong.  When the Government holds its Citizens' Assembly on education, which we support and want to be constructive within, we have to deal with the disrespect that has been shown to education down through the generations.  We must also address the fact that it is not funded enough, that our class sizes are some of the highest in Europe, that our literacy rates are a national scandal and that we could do so much more if we realised the eternal power of education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800086#PPPP00500","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595971500,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for bringing forward this motion.  It is appropriate and the right time for us to have a discussion about classroom sizes.  One of the interesting aspects of having been a local authority representative and coming from that background into the D&aacute;il Chamber is that when a motion is on the cl&aacute;r for a local authority, it is taken very seriously.  It is necessary to know what will be said regarding the actions that will ensue if the motion passes and there is a suggestion that the implications of that motion will be seen at some point in the near future.  In this House, however, it seems that when a motion is put forward on something important that the Government changes it, takes the spirit out of it and, rather than dealing with the substance of what the motion asks for, the Government uses it as a chance to clap itself on the back and state that everything is grand and we will keep on going as we are, even though that makes no sense.<\/p>  <p>  Education is phenomenally important.  The question we have all been asking ourselves in recent months, throughout the pandemic, is what does it take for us to value education.  Does it take a pandemic?  Does it take the health risks associated with large classroom sizes, rather than the educational inequality of that situation, for us to invest in our schools?  Does it take 130 days of school buildings being closed for us to recognise the role of our schools, not only as sites for learning but also for socialisation and well-being?  Does it take parents assisting with students learning at home for us to recognise the expertise and dedication of our teachers and our special needs assistants?  Does it take a digital divide for us to realise that material inequality affects educational chances?<\/p>  <p>  I note that we talk about the digital divide, because that one seems easy and solvable.  I promise the House, however, that for the vast majority of kids on the receiving end of the digital divide there is also an inability to access a table on which to do their homework.  They are waking up in conditions of overcrowding and they are sometimes stepping in as caregivers to younger siblings as their parents went off to work in retail.  We can talk about the digital divide, therefore, but what we are actually talking about, and we do not say it, is the poverty being experienced in households throughout Dublin and Ireland which is impacting upon educational chances.  <\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed that it has taken a global pandemic for lessons to be learned.  The notorious underfunding and understaffing of our schools have compounded the issues concerning the reopening of schools and we cannot ignore it anymore.  All we have seen in recent months is a crystallisation of realities that existed long before then.  We cannot continue to expect education to solve societal ills, to provide opportunity and to be a magic bullet, if we continuously underfund it, pass the costs on to families and then just leave it and pretend everything is okay.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the recent work by the previous Government to reduce classroom sizes, but let us look at the facts.  We have gone from an average in our primary classrooms of 24.9 pupils in 2014-15 to 24.3 pupils in 2018-19.  We still fall drastically short of the OECD average of 21 and the EU average of 20, with one in five primary school classroom sizes having over 30 pupils and 45% of all 3,000 plus primary schools having at least one classroom with more than 30 pupils.  It is impossible to teach in a classroom with more than 30 pupils.  It is doubly impossible to learn in a classroom with more than 30 pupils.  It is not good enough and it has never been good enough.  <\/p>  <p>  This is lost in the new narrative of getting back to normal that has taken root in recent months.  I refer to the narrative of reopening the schools and getting back to normal.  There is no normal in our education system.  Our classroom sizes, the highest in Europe, were not normal pre-Covid-19.  Pay differences between workers with the same qualifications and performing the same work is not normal.  This was a point made, laughably, by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, earlier this week when he was commenting on the pay rise for Ministers of State and stating that it was not normal for people doing the same job to be paid differently.  Imagine being a young teacher in a school listening to that statement from the Minister for Finance?  It would be laughable if it was not so serious and did not have such an impact on our educators.<\/p>  <p>  The poor investment in education compared with our overall gross domestic product is not normal and while our teachers may be the highest paid in Europe, the reality is that they are also the hardest working.  Primary school teachers teach an average of 905 hours each year, compared with the EU average of 754 hours, according to the OECD report, Education at a Glance 2019, and this is within the most underfunded of school environments.  That is not a platitude to teachers, who do immense amounts of work; it is the reality and that cannot be said enough.  <\/p>  <p>  Normal has meant that our schools have been forced to self-fundraise and to rely on relationships with local businesses to make crucial improvements and source necessary tools.  It is not normal that when a school wants to pay for its heating or have hot water that it is sending the purse around to parents who are also struggling.  That is not normal.  How many times during the school closures did we hear stories of schools needing digital tools and working with local businesses to meet those needs?  Schools cannot be expected to continue pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, completely unsupported by the Department of Education and Skills and instead supported and relying on families already overburdened by the cost of living.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no normal in how schools were operating pre-Covid-19.  It was the reality and they have managed because they have had to, but we cannot allow schools to go back to that perverse sense of normality.  The priority of reducing teacher-pupil ratios cannot be overstated and that is work that needs to be expedited.  We need to make an absolute commitment, as this motion calls for, to dramatically and immediately reduce classroom sizes in Ireland and abolish class sizes of over 30 pupils.  We need to facilitate teachers to do their jobs, have better learning and teaching experiences for students, particularly for those from more vulnerable backgrounds, and these smaller classroom sizes need to be maintained beyond the pandemic.  The Government finally needs to fall in line with the standard EU average.  We do not stand with our educators and students unless we meet those minimum goals.   <\/p>  <p>  I will touch on the welcome announcements made yesterday.  I accept fully that we should be positive regarding getting our schools reopened, because that is fundamentally the most important thing.  We should not, however, be blinded by the realities of the challenges left to face our school leaders, given the short run-in to the reopening.  The Minister has provided funding for 1,000 post-primary school teachers, but we have 750 post-secondary schools in this country.  If there is a second wave of Covid-19 and if teachers have, for one reason or another, to remove themselves from the classroom, that is not going to be enough.  <\/p>  <p>  I was also talking to some of my friends in education today and asking them how they are going to manage with these overflow classrooms that they apparently have.  That question was met with some sense of ridicule and rightly so.  I state that because I have been in many schools in recent years, and I have not seen too many overflow classrooms, such as those contained in the plan.  The idea of turning physical education, PE, halls into classrooms is one we should oppose.  Physical education is not only a leaving certificate subject, it is essential to student well-being.  The only chance for many students to get exercise in many situations is actually coming into schools and taking part in PE, being part of team sports and having some fun.  That is essential and we should not be removing that opportunity from our schools.  <\/p>  <p>  The idea of going back to normality is one we should oppose.  There is now an opportunity with the pandemic having accelerated many different factors in Irish life.  One of those factors is that we need a vision for how education can be better.  What was the normality was not good enough.  There is a real chance to stand up and demonstrate leadership on this issue.  The package announced yesterday is certainly welcome, and what we really need now is leadership.  <\/p>  <p>  I will touch very briefly on SNAs, and I intend to bring this up again on Thursday.  Our SNAs are vital to the functioning of our schools and to give students with special educational needs the opportunity to be on a par with other students.  We need to start valuing our SNAs.  That will include ensuring the professionalisation of the role of SNAs, that conditions of employment for SNAs are standardised across the education sphere and that we pay SNAs appropriately.  If we can get one thing right in the next couple of months, let us do justice to our SNAs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800088#RRRR00100","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1595971500,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Gannon.

I had an exchange with the Taoiseach earlier today.  I asked him about changes being planned regarding the leaving certificate in 2021 to take account of these students having lost quite a lot of face-to-face time with their teachers in recent months.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach said that there are changes afoot and students will be given more choice in leaving certificate examinations next year to take account of the fact that students will be unable to complete the curriculum.  I think the students listening to that reply from the Taoiseach would welcome the fact that changes are being made but would like a bit more information before making up their minds on the matter.  The devil will be in the detail.  How broad and sweeping will those changes be?  What degree of choice will students be given?  When will students know precisely what the changes are?  That is an important issue.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach also said that there will be constant engagement with the cohort of leaving certificate students to ease any concerns or anxieties they may have.  What exactly does that mean?  If the proposed changes and increased level of choice for students are put out there and a majority of students are unhappy with the proposals because they do not think the changes are deep enough or the choices wide enough, does that mean the ball comes back over the net into the court of the Minister and the Department?  Will the students be listened to and more changes made?  If it does not mean that, is the engagement with students meaningless?  I welcome the fact that there will be engagement with leaving certificate students to ease their concerns and anxieties but we need to see what that will look like if the students are not happy with the proposed changes.  We will keep a close eye on that.<\/p> <p> The result of the leaving certificate examinations for students who have just finished secondary school will only be made known on 7 September, as opposed to mid-August as is usually the case.  They will be getting their results three weeks late and that will cause stress and anxiety.  It means that students moving to third level will not have induction courses in many cases and will be starting courses in college significantly later than would otherwise have been the case.  Students who must organise accommodation for themselves will be put in a particularly difficult situation.  It is one thing if students know for sure what college they are going to but if they receive their results on 7 September and the first round of offers through the Central Applications Office are made on 11 September, some students will only then know which college they will be attending.  Such students will be under real pressure to sort out accommodation in time for the start of their courses.  Why is it that despite schools meeting their deadlines for getting grades and percentages into the Department of Education and Skills there will be a three-week delay in the distribution of examination results?  That does not add up and I would like to hear an explanation for it.<\/p> <p> I wish to also make some points about class sizes.  It is a straightforward issue.  The average class size in Ireland is 26 students while the European average is 20.  That is a damning indictment of the Governments of recent years but also indicates the size of the opportunity to recruit teachers on a large scale in order to reduce the size of classes and make schools safer during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I do not think the steps that have been taken are anywhere near enough.  <\/p> <p> I want to focus on the question of the circular and what it says about special educational needs teachers.  The idea is that they will be used to cover classes as substitute teachers when a teacher is not there.  They may not be the substitutes of first resort because they will come from the supply panels but other speakers in this debate have made the point that the supply panels are not nearly big enough to cover the demand for substitute teachers that will exist.  That means, therefore, that special educational needs teachers will be taken away from their special educational duties and used as substitutes in our schools next year.  That is not good news for children with autism spectrum disorder or who do not have English as their first language and are attended by special educational teachers.  If I were a parent of such a child, I would be very concerned with the contents of the circular.  We need to hire many more teachers on the supply panels and in the special educational needs category to work in our schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800088#RRRR00500","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595972100,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I was about to congratulate the Minister on her appointment but, as she has left the Chamber, I will do so another time.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, might pass on my congratulations.<\/p>  <p>  I think there are issues related to this motion that have always been there but are now accepted because of Covid-19.  If returning to school were a wound, the issue would be regarded as septic and would need a great deal of care not to end up fatal.  The issues that we face are now recognised as many in number but similar in vein.  The Government must decide on a formula to get the schools reopened as they have now been closed for in excess of 130 days, although I appreciate that it is no easy task.  The types of issues vary but space is by far the biggest problem.  I am a past pupil of Ramsgrange community school.  I would have considered it a school that had few issues but that is not the case.  The numbers in the school have grown from 320 to just over 500 in seven years.  Representatives of the school have been requesting an extension for some five years and received news last year that extension funding was granted but, most unfortunately, they will fall at the first planning hurdle because of Irish Water.  That is another hindrance to any progress trying to be made across the country, whether for schools or otherwise, due to the fact that there is no funding structure and Irish Water has no current funds.  This is the reason for a halted expansion to a new water treatment plant for the area that serves the environs of Ramsgrange community school.  That project is expected to be on the long finger for at least a year.<\/p>  <p>  Another wonderful school in my constituency is Kilrane national school in Rosslare.  Some 330 pupils will start back to school in late August or early September.  This school has a wonderful new three-room autism unit which is great to see.  Kilrane was one of the few facilities that ran a summer provision course in full this year.  The school was more than willing to provide its autism rooms to outside groups of parents who were desperate to use the facilities for their children who have received no services during the pandemic but was prevented from doing so because of insurance issues.  That is a real shame and a missed opportunity for those most in need and the only obstacle was the unavailability of insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Kilrane national school will face a particular problem because it has no communal area or physical education hall.  In order to comply with social distancing guidelines, all they can rely on is the new autism unit.  I hope that is a situation the Department can remedy in real time for the benefit of the 330 children currently in the school and for the children who will attend Kilrane in the future.  I expect that Rosslare will grow exponentially post Brexit for various reasons.<\/p> <p>There is every reason we should prepare our school for that growth.  Now is the time to do so.<br\/><br\/> There are similar issues in New Ross CBS.  The school has no PE hall or community area, despite having just short of 400 pupils.  The numbers are rising year-on-year and pupils deserve the same facilities as other schools in the town.  Just under half of the pupils in Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de in Carnew come from the greater Gorey area of north County Wexford.  When I visited it before the pandemic, it was based in a very old building with classrooms that are no longer fit for purpose.  Its classrooms are overcrowded, which is the norm in other schools.  What is not the norm is the size of the classrooms in the school.  One class will now most likely be divided into three.  The school does not have the room or teachers to do this.  I regret to say that none of the schools I have mentioned will be able to reopen in September without increased supports and assistance.<br\/><br\/>The schools I have mentioned are only a sample.  I am optimistic about the roadmap for schools and there has been praise for the Department from all of those to whom I have spoken today and over recent times.  They welcome the supports, but that is tongue-in-cheek because they are overdue.  I think that is what is called an Irish thank you.  There has also been some criticism.  People have said that some of the information could have been delivered sooner to allow schools to be able to access tradespeople to reconfigure their schools.  They are not in plentiful supply due to the amount of reconfiguration taking place in all sectors.  I would expect that the procurement process has been alleviated for school principals as that is an important factor in being able to get work carried out.<br\/><br\/>I fully appreciate that the Minister has made a decision and, right or wrong, she will always face criticism.  I hope that the problems will be few and far between and that everyone's agenda is to get children, who have not attended school for 130 days, back to school, along with ensuring teachers and all staff working in schools are in as safe an environment as possible.<br\/><br\/>School transport is an issue.  Many of my constituents have complained that they have yet to receive refunds for school transport.  I would appreciate if credit notes were issued to those parents who are now being asked to pay in full for school transport by 31 July.  I thank the Department officials who contacted me today to say that the deadline has been extended to 4 August.  I ask the Minister, in these unprecedented times, to make sure that refunds are provided by that date.<br\/><br\/>I will not patronise the Minister because she is a teacher and will of course be only too aware of all of the problems I have mentioned.  I wish to highlight that after reopening, those issues will still exist.  I will take this opportunity to thank the staff in her Department.  I have no doubt that they have all been under serious pressure, given the leaving certificate, colleges and everything else that comes within their remit, no more than students, teachers and the public they serve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800089#SSSS00200","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595972700,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta &Oacute; Laoghaire as an r&uacute;n seo a chur os &aacute;r gcomhair anocht.

The motion addresses what impedes and impacts negatively on children who are already disadvantaged.  A disadvantaged child or a child with special educational needs in a super-sized class of 30 will not be able to make the same progress as a child who is disadvantaged or has special needs and is in a class of 20 or 22.  That is a fact.<\/p>  <p>  I taught before I went into politics.  We were trained in college to differentiate content to suit children's needs, strengths and interests.  Teachers cannot do that in classes of 30 or more.  Children are not getting the enriched and personalised curriculum they should be.  They are not getting the opportunities we should be giving them, which would allow them to flourish and reach their potential.  I had an issue with that during my 12 years in the education system.<\/p>  <p>  The motion calls for the Government to begin immediately the process of drastically reducing class sizes, with the objective of achieving a pupil-teacher ratio in line with the EU average of 20:1.  I completely support that.  It is something that needs to be done.  Thanks to this crisis, we can no longer avoid this plain fact.  Our schoolgoing children have been on the receiving end of systematic and structurally embedded inequalities for decades.<\/p>  <p>  I also wonder why it is the case that we can marshal the political will to bring on board an extra 1,000 substitute teachers because of a crisis.  It should not have taken a crisis for that to happen.  Prior to this, Governments seemed to be prepared to leave schools scrambling desperately to hold on to vitally needed and valuable teachers each and every September.  It is something I fight for every year.  It is guaranteed that I will be submitting appeals for schools which are desperately trying to hold on to valued staff members.<\/p>  <p>  This is an opportunity to be radical and truly republican in the best meaning of the term.  We have an opportunity to cherish all of the children of the nation equally, as outlined in the vision of the 1916 Proclamation.  We should use this opportunity to bring about permanent change for the educational good of all of our children.

I know many principals very well but one, in particular, who has been in contact with me every week during the lockdown is Mr. Kevin Langton of Comeragh College, Carrick-on-Suir.  They have been trying to deal with the fallout.  Mental health was only one of the areas.  There were many others, including physical health, you name it.

We must think outside the box.  We need to reduce class sizes.  We need all those issues resolved.  However, my worry now is with Covid-19 and all the money we are spending on class sizes.  Teachers have been lobbying as have Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n N&iacute; Mhaoldhomhnaigh and many principals to get supports.  There are huge stresses on the schools' boards of management, parents' councils, teaching staff and parents.  We need those supports but we need to cut out the bureaucracy as well.<\/p> <p> I referred to class sizes and the facilities.  Some of the buildings are appalling.  We were hoping to get rid of the prefabs and now it looks like nothing but prefabs will be bought with this kind of rushed situation.  Irish Water is a big issue.

She helped so many people, that was her motto.  She lived to help people with the arts and worked with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and many other areas.  She wrote five books, one of which went to print only last week on Friday.  She died on Saturday.  She and the Hanafin family gave a tremendous service.  She was inspirational in teaching.  We have had many visionaries in schools and in the educational realm in the past, including many sisters and clergy who do not get the recognition they deserve, but Peg was, as I said, an institution in her own right and gave support to less well-off people.  When people could not get to second or third levels - not even second level at the time - she set this up for them.  She set it up so that they could get back into education, do their leaving certificate and get on in life.  She maintained friendship with all those people over the decades.

The fact the motion was put down tonight meant the plan was brought forward.  The Minister was supposed to announce this plan after we had all gone home next week, after the D&aacute;il had risen for the summer.  At least the plan has been announced and we can scrutinise it and talk about it in the House because it is vitally important.  While the Sinn F&eacute;in motion may not be directly related to it, it is related in the long term, because what we have now is an opportunity to tackle the problems in our schools, such as class sizes and pupil-teacher ratios, once and for all.  We can do it now if we embrace this properly.<\/p>  <p>  The plan shows some costings on the number of teachers and commitments regarding teachers but those commitments may not be enough.  I want to be sure every school can meet the requirements and get the teachers they need to meet the reduced the size numbers in the conditions that will be put in place and, also, when this Covid-19 emergency dies down, that those teachers will be maintained in that school and will actually serve to reduce the pupil-teacher ratios.  That is vitally important.<\/p>  <p>  One thing in the plan that needs to be stressed in these discussions, and one of the most important things that must happen in the schools, is that Covid-19 must be explained to all children at all levels to make sure there is no sense of emergency.  They should be talked to and treated properly because that is vitally important.<\/p>  <p>  The plan needs to be mentioned because several issues need to be highlighted.  We need to make sure there are enough teachers.  Much has been said tonight about the difficulty in recruiting teachers and the difficulty of where they will come from.  The Minister said she is looking at that but we need to make sure they are there.  That will take time in some schools but the plan and the cost needs to be there.  It should not, and I hope it will not, be a cost issue that will not stop the delivery of teachers for schools because that would be a real blow.  It will defeat anything the Minister is trying to do, and that we are all trying to do in terms of getting our schools back open.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising that school transport is going to be an integral part of the overall working of schools is going to be vitally important.  We cannot have a situation where school transport is left as an afterthought and the providers are left behind.  We must make sure they are part of it and integral to it.<\/p>  <p>  A special education teacher emailed me this evening to raise this issue in the house.  I hope one of the Ministers will answer it directly in summing up.  Special education teachers have been told they will be expected to provide substitution in their schools.  This means the special education classes will be left without a teacher and the special education teachers will be used in substitution.  I do not see that in the plan but, perhaps, some schools are sending out that message to their teachers.  We need to send the message clearly to them tonight that will not be the case and that special education teachers and children with special education needs will be vitally important through the process and current numbers will have to be maintained.  I would appreciate if the Minister would confirm that because it is vitally important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800091#UUUU00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1595973300,"counter":585,"content":"<p>First, I ask that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, pass on my best wishes to the new Minister, Deputy Foley.  I think everyone agrees the opening of our schools is, perhaps, the most important issue facing this country in next few months.  It is important that we get it right, not just that children go back to school but that we can get keep the schools open.  Education matters for everybody but most of all for our most vulnerable children and for those who, in some way or another, have got detached from the system over the past 130 days.  It is a huge challenge but just because something is a challenge, it does not mean that we will not do our best.  Teachers, boards of management and staff are determined to try to make this work.  The timeframe is extremely tight and different schools will have different circumstances and situations.  Regardless, huge requirements are being placed on the shoulders of principals, boards of management, teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, other staff, parents, etc.  The amount of work and the attention to public health requirements, etc., is daunting.  I was listening to the Minister when she was speaking.<\/p> <p>She spoke about logistics; curriculum; teaching; administration; well-being; enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures; control measures; keeping up-to-date with public health advice and ensuring the advice is passed on to staff, students, parents and others; induction training; redesigning classrooms and making necessary changes to school layout; updating health and safety risk assessment, including systems such as water ventilation and rubbish collection services; and actions to prevent introduction and spread of Covid-19 in schools.  That is just some of the list.  All of that must be put in place in four weeks.  It is an enormous task and anyone who does not recognise that is not being honest.<\/p> <p> I read through the plan quickly and I looked at the various appendices, including the various risk assessments, checklists, tracing logs, etc., that will be required.  Appendices 6, 7, 8 and 9 contained 131 different actions.  It is highly detailed.  Most of the public will not be aware of the enormous requirements this will place on schools.<\/p> <p> It is great to see the plan.  There is a significant contribution of resources.  However, do we know if the resources provided are sufficient?  How will these resources be distributed?  Where will the extra teachers needed come from?  Have any of them been recruited?  Is it possible to go through the process of recruiting teachers in that short space of time alongside all the preparatory work that needs to be done over the next four weeks?<\/p> <p> One of the most important points made in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion is the absolute need to reduce class sizes in line with the EU average of 20:1.  Class sizes matter enormously and greatly impact on children's learning.  Individual attention makes such a difference.  Ireland is way behind the curve, with one in five children in classes of 30 or more.  When it comes to being above the national average Sligo and Leitrim do not often find themselves in the upper echelons especially when it comes to being above the national average in investment, resources, etc.  However, when it comes to class size, we are well up there, with Sligo at 22.1% and Leitrim at 21.4% of children in classes of 30 or more.  Many schools in Sligo and Leitrim with such large class sizes will want to know if they will have the resources they need to open their schools safely.  Will they be able to employ extra teachers?  Schools that already have high pupil-teacher ratios will be under even greater pressure to reopen and stay open safely.<\/p> <p> Like my colleague, Deputy Pringle, I emphasise the need for proper provision of school transport.  Will parents spend all of August under ferocious pressure trying to ensure their children get to school?  I know of people - I am sure the Minister of State also does - whom buses have passed by in recent times standing at bus stops.  I would like to know, and I am sure we would all like to know, that will not happen to any of our children as they stand at bus stops waiting for school transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800091#UUUU00300","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595973900,"counter":587,"content":"<p>In her opening remarks, my colleague the Minister, Deputy Foley, set out in detail the approach the Government is taking to reopening our schools.  We have listened very carefully to the contributions in the House tonight.  It is useful for me, as a Minister of State, and my colleagues in government to hear from Deputies of the concerns they are hearing in their communities.  While the school system is a national one, it is rooted in local communities.  I know the truth in the statement that one size does not fit all.  We have large schools, small schools, urban schools, rural schools, special schools, schools in older buildings and schools in newer ones.  The roadmap announced yesterday and the associated documents which have been made available to schools recognise that flexibility is needed in how the roadmap will operate for an individual school.<\/p>  <p>  I accept there is a challenge to get preparations finalised in time for schools reopening, but considerable resilience and initiative have been shown across society since March.  By working together, we can get the work done that is needed to reopen our schools.  School leaders, staff and management representatives have been working closely with the Department in recent weeks to prepare the roadmap.  That engagement was open and intense, and it was aimed at being very practical in ensuring it would deliver the appropriate supports.  The commitment of over &euro;375 million is a significant commitment from Government, but in practical terms it means delivering additional teachers, changing how we operate in our schools and addressing the funding for capitation grants.  Most importantly it brings clarity to students, parents, teachers, principals and all school staff.<\/p>  <p>  The reopening of our schools has been described as a major logistical undertaking and challenge, and this is fully recognised.  I know some have expressed concerns over whether there is enough time to prepare, whether the additional staff are available and what might happen if there are outbreaks of the virus.  We will all work together through any challenges that emerge.  My Department is available to schools to support them in any challenge that may emerge.  The interests of students and families as well as the safety of the staff in the sector have been the paramount considerations throughout as the challenges before us have been worked through.  I know how important education is for our young people.  Everything that I, the Minister, Deputy Foley, the Department and the education partners do is always motivated by the best interests of our students.<\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises the particular challenges that special schools and special classes will face in dealing with children with complex medical and care needs who are at a higher risk of the serious consequences of Covid-19.  Additional NEPS psychologists will be appointed to provide enhanced services to support the well-being of our school communities at this time, to include the well-being of our special school communities.  This is something for which I have personally advocated as Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, further targeted resources will be provided.  Special schools will receive funding equivalent to ten days' support for the purposes of employing an aide to assist with the logistics of preparing for reopening.  To support this work, a once-off enhanced minor works grant will be paid to all schools by mid-August.  Providing funding in this way, schools will have the flexibility needed to implement necessary physical measures in their schools quickly in compliance with the public health advice and this roadmap.<\/p>  <p>  An enhanced rate is being provided to special schools and to special classes.  These special schools and classes where there is a teaching principal will also receive one release day per week.  These schools with an administrative deputy principal will be provided with 16 release days.  The Department is also supporting the replacement of all absences of SNAs in school settings.  We have at the moment approximately 17,000 SNAs and it is critical that every child with special needs would receive the support he or she needs to get back to school in an appropriate and safe way.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced Covid-19 rates are payable in respect of students attending special schools and special classes attached to mainstream schools to assist with the extra costs associated with the cleaning of classrooms with a small number of students operating specialist provision.<\/p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>A special sum of &euro;3.8 million will be provided towards the cleaning of special schools.  Additional financial support will be provided to special schools and classes to provide hand sanitiser and personal protective equipment, PPE, which is likely to be required to a greater degree in these settings.  Aprons and gloves are particularly necessary for intimate care.  It is almost impossible for children in special schools and classes to maintain social distance.  We have to be realistic about that and PPE will therefore be absolutely necessary.<\/p> <p> One of the key elements in ensuring that schools can remain open once they reopen is preventing the Covid-19 virus from getting into a school in the first instance.  This means students, families and staff all playing their roles in keeping the virus out of the school by ensuring that those who have symptoms or who suspect they have the virus stay out of schools.  This is particularly the case for children with special needs.  The parents and guardians of these children will have to be particularly aware.  They should not be sent to school if they are not well.  Best practice must also be maintained with regard to hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette in school while social contacts must be minimised and physical distancing practices must be respected.  Individual responsibility will be critical to schools reopening properly.<\/p> <p> Our schools and their students, families and staff are at the centre of our communities.  We look forward to our schools reopening in the coming weeks.  I thank Deputies for their contributions this evening.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, and I will take them very seriously and we will follow up on all the Deputies' individual queries.  Deputies can talk to the Minister or myself about these queries at any time.  The reopening of schools will give a much-needed signal of certainty and hope to Irish families.  We will continue to work with all concerned to the benefit of our students across the country.  There has been a positive collective response from the Irish people because we all want to work within the new normal.  The education of our children is critical for this country and for future generations and their mental health.  It is important that parents see their children returning to social settings and getting the knowledge and learning they will need in the future.  I thank everybody for their assistance in achieving that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800092#VVVV00200","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595974500,"counter":589,"content":"<p>In her speech, the Minister spoke about a significant commitment to schools from Government.  I remind the Minister that it is Irish taxpayers who are paying for this package rather than the Government parties.  From day one of this pandemic the Government has been all over the place and has lacked direction in its response to the issues facing the education sector.  Since March, I have been asking questions of two Ministers for Education and Skills and trying to get answers as to how schools would be able to reopen, when they might do so, and when principals and school boards would be told the details.  None of my questions was adequately answered.  I was told time and again that the Government was working on a plan and that the schools would be told how they were to reopen in plenty of time.<\/p>  <p>  The last time I spoke on education in the D&aacute;il was on a Topical Issue debate.  It was also at 12 midnight.  The issue related to Firhouse Educate Together secondary school.  Some 40% of this school's pupils have special needs and they are being forced to move to Citywest, which is a good distance away from the school's current location.  I understand the challenges schools are facing but this school will be facing massive challenges.  Again, we are waiting on answers from the Minister and her Department as to how the school will operate.<\/p>  <p>  With four weeks to go, schools are still in the dark.  An earlier speaker said that we have to be positive.  I want to be positive.  It is great that the schools are reopening but under what conditions and to what end are they doing so?  Only today, both the TUI and the ASTI poured cold water on the Minister's claims that all schools will be able to reopen by the end of August.  There are significant challenges facing schools.  The TUI has said that we need to recruit more than 1,000 teachers if we are to have a hope of being ready.  How does the Minister propose to do this within the couple of weeks that are left?  Is that another burden that will be put on school boards?<\/p>  <p>  A parent made contact with me today.  She has three children.  One is seriously ill and the school has said it cannot take the child back.  Another has Down's syndrome and another, who is six years old, is desperate to go back to school.  Again, there is no place for these children.  What does that parent do?  What is the Minister's answer in that regard?  Schools are telling me they are looking for answers but that they have not got them so far.  The burden is therefore back on school boards and school principals.  The Minister has laid out her roadmap but it is not good enough for many parents and schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800093#WWWW00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1595974500,"counter":590,"content":"<p>Sometimes drastic measures are needed in drastic times.  This Private Members' motion could possibly be a catalyst to reform the education system when that reform is really needed.  It calls for the development of a dedicated strategy to prioritise those who have lost out most.  Many speakers have mentioned children with special needs and so on.  School transport is, as we say in Cork, a box of frogs at the moment.  People are stressed to breaking point because they do not know what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  One individual whom I know, a seven year old named Zach, needs an autism-appropriate school to attend but no place has been found for him in the whole of east Cork.  He does not even know if he will be in school if the schools open.  His parents are facing a 50 km round trip to Cork city.  <\/p>  <p>  There are many issues that need to be addressed.  I spoke to many primary and secondary school principals and they do not feel the confidence I hear about from the Government.  They do not recognise the Government's assertion that there have been constant negotiations and talks.  Many of the principals to whom I have spoken in recent weeks are very nervous.  I hope there will be clarity for them.<\/p>  <p>  I have been hearing about the issue of school class sizes.  This is the most vital issue.  I urge the Government to withdraw its proposed amendment because it will lead to people being left behind.  It should stick to the motion as proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.

Unfortunately, that issue was not addressed in either speech.  I appreciate that there are other issues to be addressed, I addressed some myself, but this is a fundamental point.  We were put in this situation, and schools have been closed longer than they otherwise would have been, because it was so difficult to establish how to reopen schools safely.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed at that but I ask the Minister to reconsider the Government's position on this motion and on its amendment.  There is an opportunity here.  I emphasised that to the senior Minister, who was here earlier, and I now emphasise it to the Minister of State.  As a result of demographic trends, there will be an opportunity to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio dramatically on a cost-neutral basis.  All that is required is for the Ministers in the Department to insist that the number of teachers at primary level not be reduced and that these teachers stay there to provide a better standard of education at a more appropriate ratio for a developed state because our high pupil-teacher ratio has had a significant impact on our ability to return to school and also on the quality of education received.<\/p> <p>We talk in this House about the progression to university and how that varies from area to area and demographic to demographic but the fact is, inequality is baked in to the Irish education system from an early age and that is because of issues such as this.<\/p> <p> I will briefly address some of the other issues that arose.  School transport is an issue I am concerned about.  I welcome that there is additional funding but it seems to be for reconfiguration.  It does not appear that there has been extensive discussion with the transport companies or Bus &Eacute;ireann for that matter.  If there was, the outcomes have not been published.  If discussions are happening and the outcomes are to be published, I would welcome that, but I am concerned about the children who rely on school transport schemes.  Approximately 120,000 children rely on the school transport scheme, between buses and the taxi scheme, and if they are not included in the public transport scheme, we cannot be guaranteed that they have another way of getting to school.  That is an issue that needs to be resolved.<\/p> <p> I want to return to special educational needs.  There is much concern in that regard.  Deputy Pringle has left the Chamber now but he raised a point a few moments ago that was not addressed.  I ask the Minister of State to address it.  If she cannot address it now, perhaps she would respond to me tomorrow.  The concern fits with my reading of the circular which relates to the sequence for covering all teacher absences.  The first is the supply panel if a school is part of a supply panel cluster arrangement.  The second is where the school is on a panel for regular substitutes.  The third is the national substitute service.  The fourth is that if no substitute is available from the above options then a school may, for teachers in mainstream schools, use non-mainstream teachers to cover the absence.  As far as I am concerned, that means special education teachers can be used to cover absences.  Not only that, but it is clear that in other parts of the document they are also being asked to be, effectively, the people who are delivering education for those who are not able to attend because they are in a high-risk categories, although the high-risk categories have yet to be defined.  There will be children who will not be in a position to attend.  Special education teachers could be covering absences and breaks and they could be directing the teaching of those who are not able to attend.  When are they supposed to deliver the special education that is needed?  The Minister will be more aware of this than anyone.  Those children have lost out more than most, obviously in terms of education but also in terms of socialisation and isolation.  They have fallen back the most and they need the most attention.  I think this is wrong and it needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> There is also an issue concerning special needs assistants, SNAs.  The Minister of State said she will cover the absence of SNAs.  There are no SNA substitute panels.  That needs to be examined and rectified.  The Minister of State can take that as a constructive proposal.  We have substitute panels for primary schools and secondary schools and there is a need for panels for SNAs as well.  It is important to note that, throughout this process, staff other than teachers, and in some instances even teachers, have not received the respect they deserve.  I include SNAs in that but I also include school secretaries, who are not mentioned.  There is no discussion of what would happen in their absence either.<\/p> <p> I mentioned children who are immunocompromised.  There is not enough detail in that regard.  There is not a specific resource.  It seems to be leaving it to the special education teacher to decide how they will continue to be taught.  Their condition is not going away and neither is the pandemic.  We must ensure that they are not totally isolated and that they continue to get some form of education.<\/p> <p> I will finish on this point.  The key point is that we were put in this situation because of underfunding and understaffing.  We have an opportunity to get out of it and that process should start now.  I urge the Minister of State to back the motion and to begin the process of delivering an education system that is fair, equal and in proper accommodation that is fit for this jurisdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800093#WWWW00400","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595975100,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I am going to put amendment No. 1 in the name of the Minister for Education and Skills.

The Minister of State is probably aware that there will be a protest here tomorrow at 12. 30 p.m. organised by the Enough is Enough group.  It is extremely passionate about this issue and it really is unfair that people with a disability are being overlooked as far as the reopening of their very valuable day services are concerned.  Will additional funding be made available to reopen these services?  We have just had a discussion on schools and like all workplaces there will now be a need for extra staff, extra cleaning staff and a need for very practical changes like perspex screens and other changes to facilitate social distancing.  Some of the buildings in question are very old and will probably need upgrades.<\/p><p>Will additional funding be made available and if so can the Minister of State comment on when this will be?  What is the plan for the reopening of all services?  Some places are running reduced services of perhaps only a couple of hours where previously some service users would have had 30 hours a week.  This is obviously a massive drop and it is going to have a knock-on effect on carers where respite is concerned.  It will also affect carers who are working as well and may be juggling other responsibilities.

It is imperative at this stage.  People with intellectual disabilities and their carers are at their wits' end and feel they have been forgotten.  The totality of care for adults with intellectual disabilities has been left with parents, who are often aged.  They have received little or no support for more than four months now.  I have heard reports of adult children suffering from depression and loneliness and some have regressed quite significantly.  Some are actually violent and it is totally born out of frustration and lack of routine.<\/p>  <p>  Carers are suffering too and I have huge concerns about their mental health.  It is something we are going to have to look at in the future.  We are talking about parents having to dress, wash, change and feed adults in many cases.  They have received nothing extra despite the additional costs, such as extra food, heating or incontinence wear.  They have had to provide and pay for everything in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  Carers save the State billions of euro every year and at the moment they are very much feeling undervalued and worthless.  They are receiving no respite and are often working perhaps 18 to 20 hours per day.<\/p>  <p>  Many parents are wondering what has happened to the budget that is allocated for the care of their loved ones because it is not being spent on them at the moment.  It has been allocated for their needs and yet they are unsure how or where it is being spent.  As such a plan and a roadmap is needed for the reopening of day care centres as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800095#YYYY02600","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1595975700,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Funchion for raising this important issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline the position on the resumption of services for adults with disabilities.  I confirmed with Deputy Funchion's office earlier that the question relates to day services for adults specifically.<\/p>  <p>  Since disability day services closed in March, as per public health advice, it has been especially challenging for those vulnerable members of our society.  The HSE has been planning for the resumption of adult disability day services since the middle of May.  A group representative of families, service providers and other relevant stakeholders was convened and tasked with the development of a resumption plan, that is, the roadmap Deputy Tully mentioned.  Guidance to support the resumption of services, that is, the roadmap, was published on 8 July and sent to all the service providers. Adult day services will gradually resume during the month of August.  Service providers are working to get day services ready to reopen safely and in line with public health guidance.<\/p>  <p>  It is up to each of the 966 individual service providers to pinpoint their reopening date.  Most service providers should already have been in touch with families at this point.  It is expected that services will reopen during August and neither the Department nor the HSE has been informed of any services reopening later than this.  Uncertainty is not acceptable for service users or their families.  It only adds to the mounting stress they are already under.  To make the reopening process more transparent for service users I have asked the HSE to create a web portal that will clearly outline when each service will reopen, the number of users able to avail of the service each day, and what alternate care plans will be put in place.  Services have been asked to inform the HSE of this information later on today, seeing as we are here after 12 midnight.<\/p> <p>The information from all 966 disability day services will then be collated and posted on <i>hse.ie\/newdirections<\/i>from 4 August.  While a full reopening of services would be ideal, Covid-19 has not gone away and we cannot put lives at risk as services reopen.  Safety is paramount.  We must protect our most vulnerable and this means all Covid safety guidelines must be followed.  Unfortunately, this means capacity in day services will be reduced.<br\/><br\/>For the foreseeable future, supports provided from service user homes and remote supports will become a key feature of day service provision.  However, the HSE is committed to maximising the support that can be provided within Covid-19 restrictions, and providers are exploring options such as the use of other community facilities to increase capacity.<br\/><br\/>The safety and well-being of people with disabilities is my utmost priority during the resumption of services.  Where families experience significant challenges, and there are many, or where there is an emergency, the HSE and providers will work together to assist and support those families to the greatest possible extent.  I genuinely acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this very difficult time.  Adult day services are a very important support for the 19,000 people with a disability who attend them on a regular basis, and their families.  They will now have certainty that services will be reopening and reassurance that they will be guided by public health advice.  I encourage individuals and families to keep in touch with their service providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800095#YYYY02700","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595976300,"counter":675,"content":"<p>The Deputies have one minute each in reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800096#ZZZZ00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1595976300,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Many parents have told me they see this as an essential service and that there should have been plans much earlier for reopening it.  We are speaking about opening our schools, which is very important.  They are all being rolled out together and there will be as full a reopening as possible.

My understanding is the Department will write to the Covid committee because it could not reference any services that fell into that category.  Clarity has been sought on this as has a correction of the record of the Covid committee.<\/p>  <p>  Since being appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, I have visited several disability services and only today I was at St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville.  I have seen first-hand the massive positive initiatives developed over recent months to continue to provide services to people with disabilities.  I must emphasise that there is an increased risk of infection for some people with disabilities and we are speaking about adult services.  They and their families must have confidence that the services will be safe for themselves and the staff to return.  We now have the robust guidance needed to reopen these essential services and reassure people of this.<\/p>  <p>  The need for engagement with service users and their families has been reinforced yet again, which is why I am able to say this evening that when the portal is launched on 4 August it will bring clarity.  Within the portal, parents and service users will see when their service will open and what capacity will open.  We see where capacity will not reach 40%, 50% or 60% and it will clearly be identified.  All service providers will have written to the Department to communicate the shortfall in funding required to achieve 50%, 60% or 100%.  This will be collated by the Department in the coming days and I will then be able to provide the Deputies with a figure on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800096#ZZZZ00500","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigrant Investor Programme","time":1595976300,"counter":679,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800096#ZZZZ00550"},{"type":"speech","time":1595976300,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I do not need to go over the ground already covered by me and others on the devastating impact of accelerated decarbonisation in the midlands region, particularly in my constituency of Laois-Offaly.  Neither do I need to go over ground already covered by me and others relating to the subsequent specific needs of the region, which will be accommodated, we would expect, by just transition funds, climate action funds and the EU coal and peat regions in transition fund.  I continue, as I did last week, to insist the main criteria associated with such targeted funding should, above all else, assist those areas that have suffered the most job losses.  All of these programmes, of course, will seek to stimulate investment, create jobs and improve local social and economic well-being, and in doing so retain and attract people to live and work in the region.<\/p>  <p>  As a public representative and Teachta D&aacute;la I continually, in so far as I can, try to assert my influence in attracting inward investment from the private sector.  Over the past 12 to 18 months, I have worked with investors led by a Hong Kong national and an investment company to identify a site to progress a planning application for a meat processing plant at Banagher, County Offaly.  From a planning perspective, the location at the site of Banagher Chilling, which was previously used as an abattoir, in addition to strict assessment by the planning department of Offaly County Council, which expects to make a decision in the coming days, has involved great cost and expense.  The project offers a unique and welcome opportunity to create jobs in Offaly and provide direct access and routes to markets in Asia and increased competition in the beef industry, raising the potential to improve prices for producers, thus helping to boost incomes for farm families.  All told, the project is an example of the alternative job prospects needed in Offaly and the midlands region in response to ongoing employment losses in Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the investors involved in the project subsequently made applications under the immigrant investor programme, which is open to applicants who invest more than &euro;1 million.  This programme is described by the Government in its official records as an incentive for foreign investment into Ireland.  It also states the benefit to the investor is an option of residency while the benefit to Ireland is investment in Ireland and further possible economic activity if resident in Ireland.  However, to my utter dismay and disbelief an evaluation committee, made up it seems of senior officials from relevant Departments and some State agencies, has refused the first such application.  The committee concluded, it would appear, that the proposed project is not an appropriate project for approval.  The committee concluded the project does not align with Government policy on the beef processing industry, having regard to the fact it is not currently policy to pursue the development of additional plants where there is no established deficit in capacity.<\/p>  <p>  I might have been the Minister for agriculture for only 17 days but one would hardly need a green certificate to recognise this conclusion in no way reflects the Irish farming sector's understanding of Government policy which has, for example, over the past ten years sought to open Asian markets, which this plant and project would exclusively supply.  Beef and suckler farmers crave new markets and greater competition in the processing sector.  Most of all, they crave opportunities, initiatives, programmes and Government policy that maintain and improve incomes for farm families.  How then can a &euro;40 million project, which has the approval of the State's planning authority, the co-operation of Offaly County Council, the support of the community in the region, the backing of beef farmers, the support of Bord Bia and the support of the Chinese Embassy, be subject to disapproval by an evaluation committee that oversees this scheme?<\/p> <p>This project, it says, does not align with Government policy.  Who is on this evaluation committee?  Who supplied the reports that it sought and what was contained in them?  Can they be made public by the committee so we can investigate further?  Would it enlighten us as to where it is stated in Government policy there is no deficit in capacity?  We need these answers and we need them fast if we are to secure and proceed with the realisation of 250 jobs in construction and 150 jobs in the plant's operation.<\/p> <p> This investment is priceless and I am seeking resolution and approval of applications.  It appears it is now a fact that an evaluation committee and its recommendations have the power to jeopardise multimillion investment in rural Ireland and in an area that is crying out for investment, stimulation and jobs to respond to the devastating impact of job losses in Bord na M&oacute;na.  Can the Minister advise me what options are open for such new applications, or pending applications in this case, to ensure that every opportunity is given for this project to proceed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800096#ZZZZ00600","speaker":"1591","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595976900,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  He has raised a specific case with certain details on which, perhaps, I cannot respond directly to him now.  However, it is important to outline what the process is in the immigrant investor programme, the type of investments and the role of the specific committee he referenced.<\/p>  <p>  The immigrant investment programme, IIP, was introduced by the Government in 2012 to encourage inward investment from outside the EEA to avail of opportunities of investing and locating business interests in Ireland and acquiring a secure residency status for the investors and certain categories of family members in the State.  Key to the programme is that the investments are beneficial to the State in pursuit of key strategic development objectives, that they generate or sustain employment and that they can demonstrate a clear public benefit.<\/p>  <p>  The programme currently allows four different types of investment to be made by applicants, each with a minimum investment threshold: enterprise investments with a minimum threshold of &euro;1 million; fund investments with a minimum threshold of &euro;1 million; real estate investment trusts with a minimum investment threshold of &euro;2 million; and endowments with a minimum threshold of &euro;500,000.  The immigration process that every applicant must go through is managed by the immigration service delivery function in my Department.  The IIP team is multidisciplinary and includes experienced immigration officials and officials with a background in finance, which is extremely important in this area.<\/p>  <p>  The applicant identifies the enterprise, fund or project that he or she wishes to invest in or to endow and submits an application to me as Minister for Justice and Equality for permission under the programme, without committing to any investment funding at that stage.  The applicant is subject, when one is dealing with such sums of money, to rigorous screening by my Department as to the applicant's suitability for permission to enter into and reside in the State, to ensure only reputable individuals are eligible for permission.  The enterprise, fund or project in which the applicant wishes to invest is subject to a detailed examination by an independent evaluation committee.  The committee is chaired by the assistant secretary of the immigration service delivery function and comprises key officials from State agencies that have appropriate corporate experience in evaluating the nominated enterprise, fund or project.  The agencies and bodies currently include Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Finance and my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The evaluation committee convenes at least four times a year to assess the projects submitted for determination as suitable for IIP investment.  Where necessary, and this is relevant to some of the Deputy's points, the evaluation committee will request policy input from the lead Department if that Department is not already represented on the committee.  For example, there would be input from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on social projects.  More recently the IIP unit in the Department has also engaged proactively with other Departments such as the Department of Health, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to gain a full understanding of the projects in the wider context.  Observations received from these Departments have aided the committee in its decision making.  In addition, the evaluation committee has benefitted from briefing from Irish embassies in the key geographical areas.<\/p>  <p>  If the committee deems the project suitable for funding under the programme a submission is made to me for final approval.  If approved, the applicant makes the investment in accordance with his or her approved application and provides evidence of same.  The applicant will then be issued with the IIP permission letter.  The evaluation committee met in April and June this year by virtual meetings.  While I cannot comment on this particular case, I can say there is a comprehensive system and structure in place.  It has been established to ensure a proper appraisal and evaluation can be made in each case.  That is why it has expanded out from my Department to seek the expertise and knowledge of the relevant Departments connected with the type of case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800097#AAAAA00200","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1595976900,"counter":683,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.

I ask the Minister to make available to me, if possible, the various reports that were sought by the committee, what it sought, what was received and what was contained in what it received.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen documentation pertaining to this case from officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and from the Chinese embassy and Bord Bia.  Bord Bia says, for example, that this proposal is particularly opportune given that Ireland became the first European country to gain access to China earlier in 2018.  Since then six Irish beef plants have been approved to export there by the Chinese veterinary authorities and Bord Bia says it is hoped that additional factories will become listed in the near future.  This application, which I expect and hope will receive planning permission in the coming days, is exclusively dedicated and committed to serve the Asian market and others, which Bord Bia acknowledges it totally supports.  Such a massive investment in my constituency, to the tune of &euro;40 million, will provide 250 construction jobs and 150 jobs in its operation.  I welcome the fact that Amazon created 1,000 jobs here recently, but this is the equivalent of that in a constituency or region that has been subject to huge job losses in recent times.  I earnestly ask the Minister to make available the relevant documents pertaining to this application, in private if necessary, so we can scrutinise and analyse whether there was fair and due process in this case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800097#AAAAA00300","speaker":"1591"},{"type":"speech","time":1595976900,"counter":684,"content":"<p>Again, I refer to the fact that it is only when the committee deems a project suitable for funding that the submission is made to me for final approval.  What my Department must seek, and what I can benefit from, is the expertise that is available beyond my Department.  That is why the structure is set up as it is.  Obviously, the applicant is also subject to rigorous screening within my Department to examine the person's suitability for permission to enter and reside in the State.  There is also an undertaking within my Department looking at detailed due diligence, politically exposed persons and sanctions, checks in respect of prospective applicants and accessing reputable international databases as and when required to ensure that only reputable individuals are eligible for permission.  There is a vast amount of experience and knowledge coming from other Departments and from within my Department.  It is only when all of that has been assessed that the final decision is brought to me, and I must base that decision on the expertise and knowledge that have been used in coming to that decision.<\/p>  <p>  The investment should also be aligned with overarching Government policy.  That is not to say, without knowing the details of this case, whether it is in line.  However, at present, investment in social infrastructure, especially social housing and nursing homes, is a key priority as set out in Project Ireland 2040, but there are agricultural projects included in it as well.  Applications are also assessed on the basis of the profile of the applicant, the commercial viability of the project, employment outcomes associated with the proposed investment and the overall benefit to the Irish State.<\/p> <p>I can only assume that all this was taken into account when assessing this particular project.<\/p> <p> As for the Deputy's questioning of the process, arising from an internal audit report completed in 2018, a recommendation was made that a strategic review of the IIP be undertaken.  It was decided that this would happen in two phases.  Following a public procurement process, EY was awarded the contract to undertake the review.  The first phase was to consider and review the overall policy, the current objectives and future options.  Following the outcome of phase 1, phase 2, which is currently under way, will consider governance and oversight arrangements for the process, the associated resource options and the risks, including financial and reputational, associated with the operation of the programmes.  Again, this is under way, so if concerns are raised at that stage about the overall process, we hope to address them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800097#AAAAA00400","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595977500,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800098#BBBBB00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","time":1595977500,"counter":687,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800098#BBBBB00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1595977500,"counter":688,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, outline the steps that have been taken to address the current oversight for driver licences that have expired but fall outside the four-month extension period from March to 30 June?  Will she consider an extension for the cases of those whose licence expired in July but who cannot renew online or obtain a timely appointment at a National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, centre?  Will she make a statement on the matter?<\/p>  <p>  The issue that has arisen is that someone whose licence was due to be renewed on 30 June could get a four-month extension, whereas for people whose licence was due to be renewed on 1 July, their licences are out of date from 1 July.  That is a major anomaly.  I note that on 26 June an extension was given where learner permits were due to expire on 30 June, that is, where the expiry date falls from 1 July to 31 October.  They have been given a further four-month extension.  I am asking that the same be granted to people whose licences expired post 1 July.  I have had such cases come to me in Limerick.  People over 70 cannot apply online.  They have to apply for an appointment online with the NDLS centre.  One gentleman I heard from applied on 3 July looking to get an appointment at the Parkway Shopping Centre, in Limerick.  His driving licence was due to expire on the same date.  He has not been given an appointment until 25 August, so he is not able to drive legally in a car because he has no driving licence.  That has to be amended.  Even at that, he is required to go to Nenagh, which is some distance away.  Furthermore, some people cannot apply online; I have made reference to those who are 70 years of age or older.  The Minister of State could look to amend that.<\/p>  <p>  What I am asking, and the desired outcome, is that the Minister of State extend the validity of licences expiring from 1 July onwards for a further three or four months.  This would ensure that drivers could continue to use their vehicles while awaiting their appointments.  Alternatively, the Minister of State should issue an instruction that proof of an appointment at a National Driver Licence Service centre is to be recognised as valid for driving by garda&iacute; on discretionary grounds.  I also ask that the Minister of State consider extending the online service to vulnerable people, such as people who are over 70, so they can avoid attending NDLS centres as a long-term measure to protect them from Covid-19.  There is a need for a practical solution here.  The key point is that the Minister of State should extend that period for a further four months in order that we do not have an anomaly whereby someone whose licence is up for renewal on 30 June gets a four-month extension and someone whose licence is up on 1 July does not.  The person whose licence is up for renewal on 30 June can continue to drive, but a person whose licence is up for renewal the following day could be waiting up to eight weeks to get an appointment with the National Driver Licence Service while being unable to drive.  There is a major anomaly.  I hope to get news from the Minister of State that this will be changed tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800098#BBBBB00400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1595977500,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter.  The National Driver Licence Service is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority and is provided under contract.  The NDLS processes applications for learner permits and driver licences.  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the provision of services, as the Deputy has outlined.  As a result, a number of services ceased, including the national car testing service and driver testing, theory tests, and driver licence applications and renewals.  The NDLS offices closed at the end of March 2020 due to the pandemic.  Emergency regulations were brought in to provide for an extension of four months to the validity of driver licences and learner permits that expired between 1 March and 30 June 2020.  This meant that a driver licence that expired on 20 March would not need to be renewed until 20 July.  Similarly, a licence that expired on 15 July would not need to be renewed until 15 November.<\/p>  <p>  In order to deal with the difficulties that arose due to the Covid-19 pandemic and to ensure consistency across EU member states, the European Commission eventually introduced a regulation in July 2020 to provide for an extension of seven months to the validity of driving licences that expired or would expire from 1 February to 31 August 2020.  Member states could opt out of the regulation if they had already provided nationally for an extension.  Ireland opted out under this provision as an extension of four months had already been granted in April up to the end of June and the RSA wanted to resume services as soon as possible.  Learner permits, however, were further extended for an additional four months to the end of October.  The reason for this extension was to ease the pressure on the NDLS to allow the prioritising of issuing of driver licences.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that learner permits are provided under national law while driver licences come under EU law.  There was no oversight in not extending driver licences at that time.  The possibility of a further extension to the validity of driver licences along with that of learner permits was discussed with the RSA, but the authority believed, on the basis of its expectations at that point in time, that this would not be necessary.  It is only fair to the authority to acknowledge that the Covid-19 crisis is an unprecedented and fluid set of circumstances in which it is difficult to be certain about future developments.  While the reopened NDLS offices and the future expansion of online licence renewal options will eventually enable the RSA to clear the backlog, it is now clear that this will not happen quickly enough to facilitate the urgent needs of all applicants.  The NDLS resumed services on a phased basis on Monday, 8 June 2020.  All centres have reopened nationwide with the exception of part-time NDLS offices in Belmullet and Clifden, which are expected to reopen shortly.  However, the NDLS is now operating at about 60% of its pre-Covid capacity.  All appointments must be booked in advance and walk-in appointments are no longer available to ensure social distancing and compliance with occupational and public health requirements.  It will naturally take some time for services to return to normal and, unfortunately, there are delays in acquiring appointments.<\/p>  <p>  Since July the RSA has been working with its service providers to see how it can increase capacity while adhering to the return-to-work protocol.  Options include extended opening hours, increasing the number of cases dealt with monthly, overtime and protective segregation barriers between booths.  Having monitored the situation closely, it is now clear that the backlog cannot be dealt with in a timely manner while operating at 60% capacity and with an extended online system not yet in operation.  Having considered the matter, I believe a further extension of driver licences in now appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  An extension to driver licences is not possible without consent from the European Commission, in order to be compliant with EU law.  My officials have now applied to the European Commission to seek agreement to a further extension for driver licences to ease the pressure on services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800098#BBBBB00500","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1595977500,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that.

I would like to draw her attention to the need for investment in Rosslare Europort, which is Ireland's most strategic port in relation to accessing the European mainland once the UK leaves the EU, and currently.  The landbridge will become defunct for the hauliers and their drivers, who wish to comply with driving regulation times and serve their customers' best interests post Brexit.  I have spent 30 years as a haulier, working in logistics, and it is a fact that if a daily direct ferry service to the EU is not established prior to Brexit, confidence will not be with the exporters or importers, markets will not be reached and jobs will be lost.  Hauliers and logistics managers cannot assure customers they will be saved from the chaos of the landbridge and HGV drivers are already anticipating chaos and will not do the job post Brexit if it involves unnecessary time delays which will lead to extra time away from their families.  This can be avoided with preparation.<\/p>  <p>  Rosslare has potential like no other port in Ireland.  It is the first accessible port on the east coast, making it more attractive to any UK provider post Brexit.  We must prepare Rosslare and maximise its potential for the benefit of the country and take rightful advantage of the ill wind that Brexit is for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State confirm she will invest in Rosslare Europort and make the necessary request to the EU to safeguard the national interest post Brexit by applying to the EU for tier 1 status for the port and make Rosslare a free zone?<\/p>  <p>  My other point on Rosslare is that Carbon Trust said in a recent study that Rosslare is the most suitable site for the required wind energy base to construct turbines for the offshore wind farms planned to service Ireland and UK markets.  There is a significant amount of preparation required in the port to accommodate the base.  That is costly but ultimately an investment and, as such, is beneficial and value for money for the Exchequer on a national project basis.  Many boxes can be ticked with one lump sum.  Not only does it develop the port for freight and passenger services for the future, but the real value is that Ireland's future energy and fuel source must be carbon free.  The Minister of State, as a previous Chair of the climate action committee, will appreciate that.  We need wind energy if we are to be carbon free and my research points towards hydrogen as the fossil fuel replacement.  Rosslare has the space for a hydrogen plant for the future.<\/p>  <p>  Rosslare is about investing in Ireland's future.  The investment is about joining the dots on all levels and giving the taxpayer value for money.  Can the Minister of State unlock the potential for Ireland and be the first one to commit to developing Rosslare for the good of the country and its future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800099#CCCCC00300","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1595978100,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Rosslare Europort continues to work closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and other Government Departments and offices in preparing for the border controls and other impacts that will arise from Brexit.  The port's border inspection post, on a 16 acre site 1 km from the port, is ready for operation and additional staff have been deployed at Rosslare Europort since April 2020.  Future Brexit configuration has been incorporated into the overall master plan for the port.\u00a0 Rosslare Europort is actively seeking opportunities arising from Brexit to expand shipping services to continental EU ports, and I am aware that the Deputy, together with other representatives from the Irish Road Haulage Association, as well as representatives from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and from Rosslare Europort, visited northern France in November 2019 to try to develop shipping links from Rosslare.  I thank the Deputy for her work on developing such links.  Since that time, Brittany Ferries has launched a new service to\u00a0Roscoff and to Bilbao from Rosslare.<\/p>  <p>  Rosslare is unique among the State's commercial ports as it operates outside of the Harbours Acts 1996 to 2009.\u00a0 The port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbour Company which owes its origins to the Fishguard Bay Railway and Pier Act 1893.  The constituent ports of the company are nowadays the operational and financial responsibility of larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Stena Line Ports Limited, respectively.  On account of this historic arrangement, Rosslare Europort is operated as a division of larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  Rosslare is the fourth largest port in the State in terms of overall tonnage handled, and the State's second\u00a0largest passenger port.  The port generates revenue of more than &euro;10 million per annum, with surpluses of approximately &euro;2.5 million.  Rosslare is targeting growth and new business opportunities and has received the approval of the larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann board for a strategic plan to grow the port's business.\u00a0 This includes plans for investment of about &euro;30 million in customer facilities, port infrastructure, assets and new\u00a0technology.  Earlier this year, Brittany Ferries began operating between Rosslare and Roscoff and Bilbao.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Rosslare has a significant proportion of Irish roll-on roll-off traffic at approximately 16%.  Due to this, in preparation for Brexit, Rosslare has now been designated as an approved EU border control post and the Office of Public Works, OPW, is\u00a0working with the various State agencies to put in place the necessary port facilities and infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  On offshore wind, in recent weeks the Dutch logistics company, XELLZ, has selected the port of Rosslare as its offshore wind supply base and has acquired private land around the port.  It is early days but the company aims to tap into upcoming Irish offshore wind opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Rosslare Europort is on the Trans-European Transport Network, TEN-T, comprehensive network but it does not meet the EU criteria for TEN-T core\u00a0port status.  However, Rosslare Europort continues to be eligible for EU co-funding under the Connecting Europe Facility.  This co-funding is available to projects on both the comprehensive and the core parts of the TEN-T network, subject to such projects satisfying the eligibility criteria of a given call for\u00a0proposals, and being selected in the evaluation process.<\/p> <p> The programme for Government commits the Government to continue to work closely with Rosslare Europort to ensure it is ready for all Brexit scenarios.  The Government has underlined the importance of the UK land bridge with the European Commission negotiating team and we will continue to engage with our partners in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany to ensure the land bridge remains a viable and efficient route to market.  This is important for Rosslare.  The programme for Government incudes a commitment to ensuring that systems at Rosslare Europort are Brexit ready and adapted to take account of Covid-19 at the end of the transition period.  We will ensure this is the case and that Rosslare Europort can continue to play its full role as a critical part of Ireland's economic and social infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072800099#CCCCC00400","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595978700,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  To be clear, there was a requirement for a daily service to mainland Europe pre-Brexit, not just after Brexit has happened, which will circumvent the land bridge and the need for many customs operations.  Although those systems are in place and will be ready, the process has done nothing for investment in the port itself.  The figure of &euro;30 million the Minister of State mentioned relates to an investment by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in a reconfiguration of the port.  It will involve an expenditure of approximately &euro;1 million on a number plate recognition system for the port.  That is the extent of the port's electronic upgrade.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to TEN-T funding, as the Minister of State mentioned, tier 1 facilities can access a fund that is worth &euro;400 billion.  This is the fund Rosslare needs to access and it requires tier 1 status to do so.  Although previous Ministers have said the tier designation is based on volumes, Shannon Foynes Port was made a tier 1 port even though it did not have the volumes at the time.  The tier designation was applied for by the Government and the then Minister for Finance was from the county in which Shannon Foynes Port is located.  From a national perspective, tier 1 status should be applied for in respect of Rosslare Europort.  As things stand, the only funds it can access from the EU, based on its tier 2 status, is the fund of &euro;30 million to which I referred.  That funding has not been drawn by the port but represents a re-investment by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, which has taken more than &euro;2.5 million out of the port for the past ten years without re-investment.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to address the position in regard to a free zone.  XELLS is not guaranteeing that Rosslare will be its chosen wind base.  There is a very real possibility that the wind base will go to Belfast, which would be an absolute travesty for the country when we can prepare and make Rosslare a centre point not just for wind energy but for the future replacement of fossil fuel through hydro energy.

The port has been engaging with Wexford County Council on this matter.  Among the business opportunities the port wishes to pursue in the context of a free zone is the creation of a facility to service the growing offshore wind industry.  Free zones are secured customs areas within the European Union where non-Union goods can be introduced free of import duties and charges and commercial policy measures.  These goods may, following time in the free zone, be released to the domestic market subject to payment of import duties and other charges.  Rosslare Europort envisages that companies which locate in the port's business park free zone would have the ability to operate and install offshore wind farms in a cost-effective and competitive manner.<\/p>  <p>  My understanding is that the proposal for a free zone at Rosslare is at a very early concept stage and a full business proposal would need to be developed and examined by the Departments concerned, including the Department of Finance, the new Department with responsibility for enterprise and the new Department with responsibility for transport, and compliance with EU state aid rules would be required.  In the meantime, Rosslare Europort is to undergo a major transformation as part of its master plan, which will see more than &euro;30 million invested in customer facilities, port infrastructure, assets and new technology by the port over the course of the next five years.
