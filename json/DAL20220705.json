Yesterday, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputies Donohoe, and Michael McGrath, respectively, announced to great fanfare that budget 2023 will be brought forward to 27 September.  This does not mean very much to workers and families who are at breaking point today, 5 July.  A week is a long time for households when every euro counts.  It is a very long time when one cannot afford to pay extortionate energy bills or put fuel in the car or food on the table.  It beggars belief that people who will struggle to make it to the end of this week are being asked to wait another 13 weeks for help from the Government.<\/p>  <p>  This lack of urgency is especially stressful for parents who face the most expensive back-to-school period for a generation.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, children go back to school in late August, not at the end of September.  Schoolbook lists have already arrived, Bus &Eacute;ireann has sent out the reminder emails for the fees for school transport, the letters requesting voluntary contributions are on their way and school uniforms, sport and PE gear will have to be bought in the next few weeks.  Parents will fork out a small fortune.  Many will be forced into debt simply to get their children back to school.  These are the households pressed to the brink.  My office is inundated with calls from families that are at breaking point.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste has received similar calls.  These are calls from families who never thought that they would need support from the State or from charities, much less from food banks, in order to make it to the end of the week.  They have no idea where they will find the money to get their children back to school in September.  The budget on 27 September will be far too late for these families.  They do not have the luxury of waiting another 13 weeks for the Government to show up.  They need action now.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; teaghlaigh i ndeireadh na feide le costais scoile ag ard&uacute; as cuimse.  Caithfidh an Rialtas dul i ngleic leis seo l&aacute;ithreach.

The motion includes proposals that would ease the financial burden of back-to-school costs and give families a real break in the here and now.  As part of these measures, we are asking the Government to act immediately to improve the back-to-school allowance in two ways.  First, we are asking it to extend the allowance to middle-income households.  These are the households that currently receive no State support but who are at the pin of their collar trying to make ends meet.  Middle-income households must get the back-to-school allowance and the help it offers.<\/p> <p>Second, for low-income families and for those on fixed incomes, we want the Government to increase the back-to-school allowance by 50% to help meet the soaring costs of getting children back to school.<br\/><br\/>These are very reasonable, sensible and necessary asks.  There is an urgency now in all of this.  If action is take in respect of these matters, it make a massive difference at what is a very tough time for so many families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657026300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that we are experiencing a cost-of-living crisis.  We are seeing inflation at a level that has not been seen for almost 40 years.  While this is driven by international factors in the main, it is very much being felt in every home across the State.  Everyone is feeling the squeeze and, of course, those on lowest incomes are feeling it most acutely.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's response has been dynamic and we have been responsive to the needs of people during this period of high inflation.  That response started in January, when the budget measures kicked in.  There was an increase in the minimum wage, reductions in income tax, increases in pensions and welfare payments and a number of targeted supports, particularly in respect of the fuel allowance.  That was worth approximately &euro;1 billion.  Since then, another &euro;1.4 billion has been given back to people in the form of: a reduction in excise on petrol and diesel; a 9% VAT rate on electricity and gas - the lowest such rate ever on both; a deduction of &euro;200 from people's energy bills; cheaper public transport; cheaper school transport; and a targeted fuel allowance payment to thee poorest families in the State.<\/p>  <p>  Over the summer, people will see increases take effect as well.  In the budget, there was a small increase in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance based on inflation projections at the time.  Families will be receiving that payment starting next week.  More than 120,000 families in the State will receive the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance next week in respect of over 200,000 children.  Because going back to college is, like going back to school, expensive, people will see the changes that were announced in the budget taking effect.  There is an increase in the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant and there will be more people qualifying for that grant, together with an improvement in the adjacency payments.  A package is in place to help with the cost of going back to school and to college.  That is an increase on last year and it will kick in before budget day at the end of September.<\/p>  <p>  We will have the budget in September.  There will be two sets of measures.  These are measures that are one-off and can take effect within weeks of the budget being announced.  The latter means that people will have more money in their pockets come the autumn.  Then there are the regular actions that will take effect on 1 January.<\/p>  <p>  As the House can see, the Government is responding to this crisis as it unfolds.  There has been action in January and since then and there will be action over the summer, in September and again next January.  That is the right approach to take because this is an unfolding situation.  It is completely appropriate that the Government should help people with the cost of living, given that our economy is strong and we have the financial firepower to do so.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that no budget on its own is going to enable us to tame inflation.  A comprehensive anti-inflation strategy is required which involves: action at an international level, working towards peace in Ukraine; action on monetary policy by international central banks; action at European level by the European Central Bank involving changes to the European fiscal and state aid rules and other things; and, of course, action at home, particularly to bring down some of the high structural costs that exist in this country and that are out of line the level of such costs in other northern European countries.  One example I can give in respect of the latter is the cost of childcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500004#B00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1657026300,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his reply.

It has lacked urgency but we can agree to disagree on that.  What I would like us to agree on is that families preparing to get children back to school in late August need help and assistance now.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste again that it is crucial that middle-income families have access to a back-to-school payment.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste pointed out that there was some improvement in the budget.  That is now grossly insufficient.<\/p> <p>We calculate that as many as 500,000 households need to be given this payment in middle-income brackets.  Furthermore, those on lower incomes and fixed incomes need a substantial hike in the level of the payment made to them.  Will the Government move on this urgent matter now?  The children will go back to school in August and as I described, the bills and the pressure for payment is happening now and we need action now on these precise measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500004#B00300","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657026900,"counter":11,"content":"<p>If there is one thing we absolutely agree on it is that back-to-school is really expensive for families, and so is back-to-college.

It is why there is an increased SUSI grant for those going to third level and is why we changed the rules only in the last few weeks to allow students to earn more over the summer without affecting their grant.  These are changes that are taking effect over the course of the summer.  However, I acknowledge, particularly in respect of back-to-school, that when we made those changes on budget day, we anticipated inflation being much lower than it is now.  For that reason, the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath, Humphreys and Foley, have been in discussions today and yesterday to see if we can do anything to enhance the back-to-school package, acknowledging that September will come too late for back-to-school.

On Friday Electric Ireland hiked its prices for the second time in just three months, adding a further &euro;350 to the cost of gas and &euro;164 to the cost of electricity.  Other providers will undoubtedly follow suit.  Families who are already struggling to pay their bills and put food on the table must also cope with the huge cost of back-to-school, which costs up to &euro;1,500 per child.  Where does the T&aacute;naiste think those families will get the money for back-to-school, because it is not coming from the State?<\/p>  <p>  The back-to-school allowance was actually more in 2007, 15 years ago, than it is now, which is really pathetic.  Is it any wonder that last year almost one in four families went into debt to pay back-to-school costs?  This year the figure is likely to be significantly higher than that because the Government is refusing to help.  The T&aacute;naiste and his Cabinet colleagues have acknowledged that ordinary workers and families are under immense pressure at the moment.  They have also said that exceptional measures in addition to the budgetary measures would have to be taken to assist them.  However, when he announced the summer economic statement yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, said that once-off exceptional measures would not be announced until the September budget, which is three months away.  That delay will guarantee one thing: more and more people who are barely scraping by at the moment will fall into poverty and debt.<\/p>  <p>  Why is the Government waiting?  Is it because it has run out of ideas or is it because of division within the Government?  We know that there is disagreement in Government about whether it should introduce another universal electricity credit.  Is it refusing to act now because of wrangling behind the scenes about the nature of the measures to be introduced?  We heard much about listening to the experts during the Covid pandemic, but the budgetary advice the Government is getting now appears to have fallen on deaf ears over recent weeks.  The Government is not listening to the experts such as the ESRI which has said that the Government has the capacity to introduce targeted measures now and critically they must be targeted at those families most in need.<\/p>  <p>  It is truly unforgivable that the Government is about to swan off on its holidays when the D&aacute;il goes into recess for two months in the knowledge that so many people are in dire need of assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500005#C00300","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1657026900,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We are not swanning off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500005#C00400","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1657026900,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Therefore, will the Government reconsider and to do the right thing?

We have also made changes to make more people eligible for that grant and to allow students to earn more over the summer without it affecting their grant next year.<\/p> <p> As I mentioned earlier, Government accepts that when we announced the increase in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance in January, we did not anticipate that inflation would be as high as it is now.  Our projections were for inflation of maybe only 2% or 3%.  It is now closer to 10%.

The T&aacute;naiste talks about looking at this again.  An enormous catch up is required in order to bring the back-to-school allowance anywhere close to what is required.

The former Minister for Education, Deputy Joe McHugh, introduced the grant to encourage school books rental schemes and extended that to all DEIS schools so we understand very well that the cost of going back to school is very high for families.  This is nothing new but has been the case for years.  We were working on it then and under this Government, we are working on it now.

In particular, capital spending is a black hole.  We see the money going in - some &euro;87 billion this year, &euro;12 billion of which is on capital projects with &euro;165 billion heading out the door by 2030.  We see bits and pieces of the outcomes - often just the stuff that gets attention, the calamities or the patronage.  How can this House provide parliamentary oversight of public spending when appropriate standardised spending data is not provided by Departments?  Budget 2023 is being framed at the moment and this D&aacute;il knows virtually nothing of the choices and plans.  Parliamentary questions on spending are answered glibly if they are answered at all.  Ministers usually pivot away from the questions asked.  The Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General only provide look-backs to identify failures in process.  Our national economic dialogue bizarrely operates with virtually no standardised data.  This House offers benedictions rather than debate over Voted expenditure.  The capital tracker, which is a welcome gesture towards better data, has withered becoming more opaque with every subsequent version.<\/p> <p>It is simply impossible to see where public money goes.  Vast parts of Ireland feel now that they are frozen out of a fair share of capital spending, such as in the midlands, the north east, the west and my home region in the southeast.  It is these regions that have turned their backs on the traditional parties of Government.<\/p> <p> My personal analysis suggests that the bulk of discretionary spending is being funnelled into Dublin and Cork, which are homes to almost all of our Ministers.  Do not tell me that I am wrong, or name check for me some projects that are happening in my neck of the woods.  Show me where the totality of money is going.  Publish proper, granular spatial data on public spending, particularly on capital projects.  If not live or future-looking data, the least we should be able to see is historical data on completed projects.  With &euro;12 billion of capital expenditure this year, the southeast should be getting &euro;1 billion.  Waterford should be getting &euro;330 million.  With the data available to me, I estimate that the whole south east is just getting &euro;330 million, which is a third of its due.  Please do not tell me that I am wrong or that I am incapable of understanding economic data.  Show me the regional breakdown of the &euro;12 billion in capital spending.  Without the data, we just look continuously to the think rule of outputs in our hospitals, higher education, our public transport, our roads, our airports and our urban infrastructure.

I agree that we should have better data on how money is spent and on where it is spent.  That is something that we are very much aligned on.  I also agree that Governments do not have any money.  The only money that Governments have is the money that we take from people and business in the form of taxation.  It is not our money.  It is the people's money.  That is why we have to spend it responsibly.  That is why we have to account for it properly.<\/p>  <p>  We do have strong accountability mechanisms.  We publish accounts every year.  Every Government agency does so.  Every Government Department has an annual report.  We have a Committee on Public Accounts, which is chaired by the Opposition and which has considerable powers.  We have a constitutional office in the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is responsible for auditing Government spending.  Therefore, we have strong accountability mechanisms in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Capital spending happens all over the country.  Sometimes when people do regional analysis as to how it is spent, they only focus on the big projects.  I have seen some of the reports that Deputy Shanahan has mentioned.  Often, they only count projects of over &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million.  That is a misleading analysis.  Of course, big cities will have the bigger, expensive projects.  In more rural areas, there will be many smaller projects.  Any analysis that only counts investments above a certain threshold is only and can only ever be a partial analysis.<\/p>  <p>  One of the biggest investments that is under way at the moment, probably the biggest single investment that is under way at the moment in the State, is the national broadband plan.  That is heavily skewed towards regional areas.  It includes all regions but particularly regions outside of Dublin and areas that are most rural.  The more rural you go, the more that project costs.  The last mile is the most expensive aspect of that project.  That project is doing something that almost no other country in the world has done.  It is bringing fibre broadband to pretty much every home, farm and business in the country.  It is really important, in my mind, in future proofing and digital proofing our country.  The targets for its implementation have been revised after Covid-19.  However, they are now being met.  We now know that the cost of that project will be less than had originally been budgeted for.  It will come in at under &euro;3 billion.  That is significant.  That is the biggest single capital project happening in Ireland at the moment.  Metro when it happens will be bigger, but at the moment this is the biggest one and it is very much focused on regional development and on rural areas.  Yet, it gets left out of many of these analyses.

This is the highest rate of inflation since 1983.  Ireland's real economy is in a very dire place today.  The Government is good at cherry-picking certain economic variables and spinning those to make matters look better but the sad reality is that this country is now more unequal than at any point in our history.<\/p><p>A recent nationwide survey of 2,300 people by <i>The Mirror<\/i>highlighted that 64% of Irish people feel they are living in relative poverty.  Eight out of ten Irish people are struggling to pay their bills and more than half are under pressure with their mortgage repayments.  A figure of 64% are eating less healthy to save money, 58% spend less money on their children, 88% are staying at home and are stopping social activities and 39% have asked family and friends for financial help.  The findings of this survey tally with what the people in my constituency of Cork South-West tell me.<\/p><p>The cruel and heartless decision by the Government not to introduce an emergency budget illustrates that it is out of touch and cares little about the struggles of these people.  Instead, the Government is behaving like a British landlord in Ireland during Famine times and looking the other way.  It is a shameful and despicable treatment of the Irish people.<\/p><p>The current cost-of-living crisis is financially crippling to all lower-income earners, including pensioners, struggling mortgage holders and the unemployed.  It is also having a disproportionate impact on all rural residents.  Farmers face a 300% increase in the cost of fertiliser combined with the huge impacts of fuel and feed costs.  Fuel costs are leading to fishermen's boats staying tied up at piers across the country.  The skimpy packaging measures announced by the Government to date are grossly insufficient.  It feels like a wet sticking plaster on a wound given the depth and impact of this crisis.  That is why a robust emergency budget, for which the Rural Independent Group tabled a motion back in February and which the Government blocked, is now long overdue.<\/p><p>The Government has been idle, allowing costs to soar while simultaneously benefiting from record VAT excise duties and carbon taxes from fuel, home heating, electricity, household goods, building materials, fertiliser and animal feed.  The only meaningful way tackle current inflation and protect consumers is through taxation reliefs.  Unfortunately, swift Government action on this or any public crisis is rare or reserved only for the large corporate vested interests such as banks that were bailed out by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  Standing by and paying lip service it is emergency is no longer a tenable position to hold, however.  Measures introduced in a budget that will be brought forward by two weeks in the autumn will be too late and pushes the response out into 2023 for many.<\/p><p>We need action now from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Will the T&aacute;naiste immediately introduce an emergency budget?  Will he immediately drop the carbon tax on fuel, which will help struggling families, or will he brazenly sit on his hands leaving the Irish people to lose their homes, fishing boats, businesses, lorries and livelihoods?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500008#F00500","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1657029000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I am not interested in cherry-picking data or statistics.  I am a medical doctor by training.  I take science and data seriously and I always like to see and know the numbers.  When I seek the data, I seek them from reputable independent bodies such as the Central Statistics Office, CSO, or the Central Bank, which act independently and produce robust data that we can stand over.  I tend to be a little more sceptical when it comes to surveys that are done by lobbyist groups, interest groups or NGOs because very often those data are non-scientific.<\/p>  <p>  The facts are that the employment level is at the highest it has ever been in the State at 2.5 million and median incomes are rising, notwithstanding the impact of inflation.  We would not see income tax receipts being as strong as they are if that were not the case.  There are more people at work in the country than ever before, with employment growth in every region of the State.  The highest employment growth last year was in the Deputy's region of the south west, followed closely by the south east.<\/p>  <p>  The CSO compiles data on income distribution.  It is contained in the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, which is published once a year.  It is the only robust scientific data on income inequality.  It measures something called the Gini coefficient.  In Ireland, we have seen income inequality narrow and reduce in the last five to ten years.  It is trending downwards, unlike in most developed countries.  The number of people experiencing consistent poverty and of people at risk of poverty and deprivation can go up and down year by year, but it has been trending downward significantly over the past five or six years.  Those are the facts.  People are absolutely entitled to their opinions and ideologies but they are not entitled to their facts.  Those are the facts for anybody who is interested in them.<\/p>  <p>  However, I acknowledge that there are real risks, particularly with inflation being so high at 9% or 10%.  It is the highest we have seen in 40 years.  People are really feeling the pinch and there is a real risk this year that for the first time in a long time we will go backwards, with real incomes falling, increasing poverty levels and possibly increasing inequality.  That is something I and the Government do not want to happen.  That is why we are doing what we are doing - the measures we have introduced already, which I have outlined previously in the D&aacute;il, measures that will take effect over the summer with regard to back to school and back to college and measures that will take place after budget day in September, immediately putting money in people's pockets, while more will be implemented in January.  This is a dynamic response to a cost-of-living crisis which, unfortunately, is going to continue for some time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500009#G00100","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1657029000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his reply.  The Government is simply going to stand idly by and let many businesses go to the wall over the next few months.  I hope that during the summer recess the T&aacute;naiste will speak to the owners of those businesses, as I have done in places such as Castletownbere, Clonakilty, Bandon and even at the Dunmanway Agricultural Show last weekend.  The public are rightly furious and angered by the Government's inaction, hiding behind Putin's war and hiding behind taking urgent measures to reduce VAT on fuel because of Europe. The price of a litre of diesel in Malta this weekend was &euro;1.21.  Malta is in Europe.  The price of a litre of diesel in Ireland, also in Europe, is heading to &euro;2.30, with the Government taking almost 50% in tax.  It is the Government's green buddies who have destroyed this country, aided and abetted by dreaming Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies.  Will the T&aacute;naiste commit to eliminating the excise duty, carbon tax and VAT on both fuels, including agricultural diesel, from now until at least 31 December?  Waiting for September or October and then for 1 January 2023 is not a sustainable position to cling to.

The purpose of this Bill is to tackle the costs relating to uniforms.  We are in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.  We are seeing the lists come through the door for books, uniforms and voluntary contributions for many other costs.  Sinn F&eacute;in has brought forward a package of proposals to tackle these costs, which we will discuss later.  I welcome the fact that there seems to be some suggestion that the Government is considering this but it is vital that we ensure that middle-income families get support as well and that we tackle the fundamental reasons back-to-school costs have become so significant.  Along with books, transport and voluntary contributions, one of those costs is the cost of uniforms.  While many schools go to great lengths to ensure that school uniforms are as affordable as possible, others require multiple items that often can only be bought from one retailer, require particular crested uniforms or require multiples of them.  If you have multiple children across different schools, it can cost hundreds of euro.  <\/p><p>We are proposing to put in place legislation that is similar to what exists in other jurisdictions to ensure that while it is the prerogative of schools to have a uniform, such uniforms are as affordable as possible.  This legislation would place an obligation on the Minister to require that schools have regard to developing affordable uniform policies, that such policies would be available publicly and easily understood, would state clearly whether each item on the uniform list is optional or required, would ensure that parents can source all elements of the uniform from a number of retailers, would have regard to school crests or badges that are iron-on and sew-on rather than ones that are integral to the uniform thus making it more expensive, would keep required usage of branded items to a minimum and consult with parents and a variety of other requirements to which schools must have regard.  We believe this is but one of a suite of measures that are needed.  We need to help parents in the here and now, particularly those on low incomes, but we also need some support for those on middle incomes.  We also need to tackle the root causes of why going back to school is so expensive, including uniforms.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500016#S00400","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1657032900,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I am delighted to introduce this Bill along with my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  As we know, the cost of children returning to school is multifaceted.  The most significant cost is the cost of school uniforms.  Year in and year out, one consistent theme from parents across my constituency is that a white T-shirt is a white T-shirt regardless of what crest is put on the front of it.  There are practical steps that can be taken to reduce this financial burden on families and they need to be taken as a matter of urgency.  The cost of simply clothing your children to go to school is unaffordable and unnecessary.  We need a new approach, we need to see all families benefit from that approach and we need to take a much more practical view of school uniforms and those additional uniforms that can be requested by some schools relating to extracurricular activities.  They also need to be addressed.  One significant step that can be taken is the introduction of those sewn-on school badges or iron-on school crests, which can reduce the cost significantly and open up a world of options to parents to purchase the school uniform from a variety of different sellers.  At the moment, there is a significant restriction on where parents can buy school uniforms, crested school items in particular, and this needs to come to an end.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to see schools reducing the frequency with which they change school uniforms to ensure that clothing that is still of good quality can be passed down between siblings and perhaps passed on to other families for future use.  The cost of children returning to school this year has been to the forefront of many people's minds but this issue has been ongoing for a number of years.

participation in United Nations missions in 2020 and 2021 and to present to the House a motion proposing Ireland's participation in four permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, projects.  This debate comes at a time when we are experiencing war on our Continent, something we hoped we would never have to see again.  The outrageous and illegal war being perpetrated on Ukraine by Russia has, quite rightly, shone a light on this country&rsquo;s attitude to this form of illegal aggression.<\/p> <p> This Government has been clear that while we remain militarily neutral, we are not neutral in our steadfast support for the people of Ukraine.  Last week, we had the opportunity to discuss these motions in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  I would like to use this opportunity, therefore, to address some of the issues that arose in that discussion and, in particular, to correct some misunderstandings or misinterpretations about PESCO and the reasons why I am proposing that Ireland should enhance its engagement.<\/p> <p> Indeed, there are links between what I am proposing with regard to PESCO and the contribution that the Defence Forces continue to make on international peacekeeping duty.  The primary benefit of participation in PESCO projects is the enhancement of the Defence Forces capabilities and our interoperability with EU member states.  In every UN or Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, mission in which we participate, we work alongside the armed forces of other countries, whether that is with the Poles, Hungarians and Maltese in United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, or with the Germans in United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, MINUSMA.<\/p> <p> Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to peacekeeping around the world reflects a commitment to work with others to overcome emerging challenges.  Together, we can provide support for fragile states and prevent conflicts from escalating further.  The presentation of the two UN reports gives this House the opportunity to express our appreciation for the role which the Defence Forces continue to play throughout the world in the preservation of peace.  At a time when a part of our Continent is at war, it is difficult to think of something more laudable than keeping peace and helping innocent and vulnerable people to survive conflict.<\/p> <p> The reports on Defence Forces participation in United Nations missions in 2020 and 2021 were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 21 June 2021 and 30 March 2022, respectively.  These reports document the participation of Defence Forces personnel in UN-led or UN-authorised missions, which include CSDP missions, such as the EU training mission in Mali, EUTM Mali, the EU-led mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, or Operation Althea, and the NATO-led international security presence in Kosovo, KFOR.<\/p> <p> I want to address an issue that arose in the committee last week, during which reference was made to the absence of D&aacute;il approval for the deployment of the Defence Forces personnel to the EU training mission in Mali, thus effectively questioning the legitimacy of the deployment.  It is the case that in all circumstances in which the Defence Forces personnel are deployed overseas, they are so deployed in strict coherence with the law.  The conditions under which the Defence Forces may participate on overseas peace support operations are set out in the Defence Acts.  Where personnel are deployed as part of an International United Nations force, the conditions known as the triple lock must be satisfied.  That requires that the operation must be authorised or mandated by the United Nations; it must be approved by the Government and, where the size of a Defence Forces contribution is more than 12 personnel, it must be approved by way of a resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  In accordance with the provisions of sections 3(1)(b) and 3(1)(d) of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is not required where members of the Defence Forces are deployed in a training role.  EUTM Mali is a training mission and so, in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann was not required.<\/p> <p> There is a range of activities provided for in law when it is not necessary for Defence Forces personnel who are travelling outside the State to have the approval of the D&aacute;il.  These include the conducting of or participation in training; undertaking monitoring, observation or advisory duties; undertaking humanitarian tasks in support of an actual or potential disaster or emergency, such as we did very effectively in the Mediterranean; or participating in sporting events, as one would expect.<\/p> <p> The EUTM Mali was launched with the objective of training and mentoring the Malian armed forces so as to improve their military capacity and their effectiveness in guaranteeing the country&rsquo;s territorial integrity.  Following serious allegations of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, EU member states decided in April to suspend operational training activities for the Malian armed forces, the national guard and the national gendarmerie of Mali.  Several of the troop-contributing nations are adjusting their commitments to the mission, including a number of which are withdrawing entirely.  The EU, however, remains committed to the mission, not least because of concerns about the vacuum which a full withdrawal would create.  In line with a reduction in the levels of training, my Department and the Defence Forces are also considering what level of support is appropriate, given the changing nature of this mission.<\/p> <p> The issue of mandatory selection was also raised last week, and rightly so.  It is a practice used sparingly and only when there is an insufficient number of volunteers to fill overseas appointments.  While I am not in a position to detail the number of occasions on which mandatory selection has been necessary, personnel selected for mandatory overseas deployment may appeal their selection.  The Defence Forces personnel management system is being upgraded to capture information relating to such appeals and the upgraded system is expected to go live in the first quarter of next year.<\/p> <p> The possible deployment overseas of members of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, was also raised during the committee meeting.  Deputies will be aware that, following the enactment of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2021, that the RDF may support the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, on a voluntary basis both on-island and overseas, where it is in the best interests of the PDF.  The practical arrangements to implement the amendment, including all the elements associated with the voluntary service by Reserve Defence Force members overseas are being progressed by departmental officials and the military authorities.  Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, the representative association for the RDF, will also be consulted on these matters.  I have also engaged with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, on the issue of employment protection for RDF members who might be engaged in such voluntary military service in support of the PDF.  That is an issue that a number of Deputies have asked me to pursue.  We are pursuing it to ensure that if people choose to serve either at home or overseas in the Reserve Defence Force, that their jobs are safe.<\/p> <p> Engagement at official level with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is continuing to consider the matter and identify the appropriate next steps.  My Department is arranging, with the assistance of Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, a preliminary and informal meeting with employer bodies and associations.  A letter on the matter has issued to Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, and Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and it is hoped that this meeting will take place very shortly.  The outcome of these deliberations and the advice of the Chief of Staff will inform consideration of these matters.<\/p> <p> I referred at the outset to the importance of interoperability, particularly in the context of Defence Forces personnel serving side-by-side with colleagues from many different countries.  The Defence Forces place a heavy emphasis on ensuring the interoperability of their personnel and rightly so.  The tools available include our participation in Partnership for Peace, PfP, our voluntary participation in NATO&rsquo;s Operational Capabilities Concept, OCC, and our participation in the EU&rsquo;s permanent structured co-operation, PESCO.  Ireland has been a member of PfP since 1999 and our participation is fundamental to Ireland being able to meet its obligations in providing professional peacekeepers for international crisis management and peacekeeping operations mandated by the UN and in enhancing the Defence Forces interoperability with other professional military forces.<\/p> <p> The Operational Capabilities Concept, OCC, is a voluntary evaluation process, which Ireland joined in 2016.  It provides for external evaluation by trained evaluators of declared military capabilities in accordance with NATO standards.  The main benefit of participating in the OCC is that Defence Forces training is benchmarked to an international standard, thereby ensuring that the protection of Irish Defence Forces on operations is enhanced.  The Defence Forces are participating at level 1, which focuses on interoperability.  In other words, if we are going to be serving overseas with other countries, we need to make sure that we are competent in using the same equipment, the same standard of training and the same benchmarks that are being set in the countries with which we will be operating in the field.  We have to ensure that we have consistency with here which is exactly what we are doing.<\/p> <p> Participation in PESCO is another tool that can enhance the Defence Forces&rsquo; military capabilities for participation in UN-mandated peace support operations, enhance interoperability and ensure that our troops are provided with the latest and best equipment and training.  Having been at the centre of the EU&rsquo;s CSDP since its inception and having played a key role in the EU&rsquo;s overseas operations, joining PESCO was a natural progression from an Irish perspective.  It provides a structure within which we can work with other member states to develop capabilities needed for peacekeeping and crisis management operations, and to maintain a central influence on the development of CSDP.  It is unfortunate that there are those who either misunderstand or choose to misrepresent the purpose of PESCO.  It is not, as some would suggest, a Trojan horse for a European army, nor does it compromise our policy of military neutrality.  It does not involve a commitment to the development of any form of common military force.<\/p> <p> Having pointed out these facts, today&rsquo;s debate should focus, therefore, on the motion before the House.  What the Government is proposing is a very modest level of participation in PESCO by increasing the number of projects in which we are participants from one to five of the 60 projects that are currently under way.  Ireland is currently the lowest-level participant of the 25 member states that participate in PESCO.  The proposal before the D&aacute;il will bring our rate of participation to a level similar to that of Finland.  It will still be below those of other militarily neutral countries like Austria and Cyprus.<\/p> <p> We should focus today on the specific projects in which it is proposed to participate, whether that is with regard to cyberthreats, military disaster relief capability, special operations forces medical training or semi-autonomous technologies and capabilities for maritime mine counter measures, which are all highly relevant at the moment given some of the challenges we face on our continent and beyond.  In each of these cases, Ireland has had the benefit of having been an observer for a number of years.  Therefore, we know what these projects entail before we become a full participant.<\/p> <p> Following an assessment of all of the nine projects on which we have been observers, the Defence Forces have concluded that there is value in progressing to full participant status.  While observer status enables a member state to secure information on the project and map its evolution and alignment with national capability development requirements, full participation allows the member states to contribute to and influence the project.  In other words, the national needs from a defence capabilities perspective can be taken on board and included in the objectives of the overall project.<\/p> <p> The motion before the D&aacute;il reflects the military advice provided to me, which will further enhance the Defence Forces&rsquo; capability to undertake the roles assigned to them by the Government, both at home and overseas.  In view of the thorough assessment that informed that advice, there is no reason to delay progressing to full participant status, as was suggested last week.<\/p> <p> Without prejudice to the Government&rsquo;s decision on the Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, I point out that the commission recommended that the opportunities offered by PESCO to \"develop Ireland&rsquo;s defence capabilities should be more fully explored and exploited than at present.\"  This is exactly what we are doing.  In that respect, the advice given to me to progress to full participation is fully consistent with the recommendations of the commission's report.<\/p> <p> I have taken some time this afternoon to elaborate on and address some of the issues raised at last week&rsquo;s committee meeting.  There is a significant amount of misunderstanding and misrepresentation about what PESCO is, and, perhaps more importantly, what it is not. This debate needs to be honest and informed.  My contribution this afternoon is aimed at contributing to such a debate.  I commend the motions to the House and look forward to responding to any queries Deputies may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500016#S03100","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657034100,"counter":145,"content":"<p>We have two fundamental issues to discuss today, namely, the service of the Irish Defence Forces with the UN for 2020 and 2021 and approval of Ireland's participation in four projects involving PESCO.  On the face of it, these are two separate issues.  In reality, however, participation in one will impact on Ireland's participation in the other.  This may colour the future perspective adopted by the smaller military non-aligned nations that invested their support and confidence in Ireland as a military neutral country by voting Ireland on to the UN Security Council.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a proud history of uninterrupted service in the UN dating back to 1958.  Since then, the blue beret and tricolour shoulder flash have offered succour, safety and assistance to beleaguered people in conflict zones across the globe, including in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.  In pursuit of the noble cause of peace, many Irish troops have made the ultimate sacrifice.  I want to remember that sacrifice here today.  The Irish Defence Forces serving within the UN possess an identity that is synonymous with dignity, integrity and, above all, impartiality.  It is this hard-won identity of an impartial military force acting as an advocate for peace and justice that I fear participation in PESCO threatens to erode.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister wishes to present PESCO in some benign manner.  This is to allow Ireland to develop the capacity to participate in humanitarian missions alongside other EU nations.  That is the Minister's view.  Notwithstanding the current rate of turnover within the Defence Forces, a critical number of experienced troops who were trained at this time would in all likelihood have rotated out of the Defence Forces before they could be called upon to exercise the benefits of the training they received.  The Minister's view appears to be at odds, to say the least, with the views of key EU representatives both past and present.  Indeed, Ms Federica Mogherini, the former High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, claimed with regard to PESCO that we are building an EU defence union.  It is not a plan or a dream anymore; it is reality coming true.  Mr. Josep Borrell, her successor, stated categorically that the EU needs to develop a military force to give it military strength.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever claims the Minister makes to the contrary, and however much he seeks to project the image of PESCO as an enlightenment attempt by the EU to act as a humanitarian force for good, he is fundamentally wrong.  PESCO is not an altruistic attempt by the EU to develop a humanitarian force for the global good.  The mandate of PESCO, as outlined in the Lisbon treaty, includes the requirement for participating states to make members of their Defence Forces available to be deployed as part of PESCO missions.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to put on the record Sinn F&eacute;in's commitment to resourcing the Defence Forces.  We are committed to a policy of Irish military neutrality.  That is not policy of isolationism; it involves embedding our military neutrality within a larger strategic policy of active neutrality on the international stage.  The record of our NGOs in delivering humanitarian aid projects, the extensive global range of our diplomatic service and the sterling record of our Defence Forces on peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations can combine to achieve a significant level of soft power for an island of our size.<\/p>  <p>  Irish neutrality should be enshrined in the Irish Constitution because Sinn F&eacute;in believes that our Defence Forces - the men and women charged with protecting the security of this State - need to be properly resourced to carry out their role.  Arguably, at this moment, the biggest threat to our security does not come from an external factor but from the internal erosion of the strength of our Defence Forces through the loss of key personnel.<\/p> <p>The Minister is on record as stating that the establishment figure for the Defence Forces needs to be expanded by 2,000 personnel in order for them to carry out their functions, which means that the Defence Forces are operating at over 3,000 personnel below the establishment figure.  While we have NATO overseeing artillery exercises in Cork, we have situations where our Defence Forces lack sufficient numbers of qualified trainers to oversee basic live firing exercises.  The number one security priority has to be to address the staffing problems in the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p> The representative associations were recently granted the right to associate membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, an issue the Minister and I have battled over on many occasions in this House.  Despite the Minister's concerns about the issue, he conceded to it and the sky has not fallen in.  There are other outstanding issues that continue to plague recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces, including the working time directive and issues with pay and allowances.  Addressing the issues of morale, culture and conditions in the Defence Forces has to be a priority, not the erosion of our neutrality in pursuit of the illusion that we are going to be some type of international military player in a European army of the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500018#U00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657034700,"counter":147,"content":"<p>As Deputy Brady said, Ireland has a long and proud tradition of neutrality.  It has been at the heart of our foreign policy since the foundation of the State.  One of the main reasons that we are held in high regard all over the world is our lack of a colonial past.  Our reputation for impartiality is rooted in our military non-alignment.<\/p>  <p>  Our neutrality has been continuously undermined by successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led and Fine Gael-led Governments.  Those same Governments neglected our Defence Forces, which have suffered greatly because of years of underinvestment.  We have historically low levels of personnel, and the Defence Forces Reserve is suffering from the indifference of the Government.  Morale is on the floor.  It cannot go any lower.  There has been no attempt to address this or to improve pay and conditions.  It is about time the Defence Forces received the investment they deserve.<\/p>  <p>  The investment should not be at the expense of our neutrality.  We have the resurgence of discussions on neutrality in the wake of a war in Ukraine.  We have seen the attitude, in true Churchillian style, to never let a good crisis go to waste.  We must have a referendum on neutrality and there must be a reasonable debate to ensure that our citizens have the chance to hear the arguments for and against before making an informed choice.  That debate has to include details of Ireland's involvement in Mali.  The Defence Forces are being tainted by involvement in a country where atrocities have taken place and where the involvement of the Russian mercenary Wagner Group continues.  This is the same group that entered Ukraine to attempt to assassinate President Zelenskyy and members of his Government.<\/p>  <p>  It is a cynical move to include PESCO in this debate along with the reports on United Nations activities.  The Government is attempting to obscure the erosion of Ireland's neutrality by attempting to present participation in PESCO as representing training opportunities for the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to mention the deployment of the Defence Forces to Dublin Airport to support security staff.  If this is necessary, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, must repay the full cost to the State.  Defence Forces personnel must receive their fair share from this debacle, which is entirely of the DAA's own making.  This must be a last resort, and it must be a short-term measure.

It is permanent security co-operation, a permanent mechanism within the European Union to develop military capabilities and interoperabilities and to make our military equipment and personnel compatible and our training mutual and common.

There is also the deployable military disaster relief capability package, special operations forces medical training and maritime semi-autonomous systems for mine countermeasures.  All of those, in themselves, appear to be benign and unobjectionable.<\/p><p>I disagree with the Minister.  It has been repeatedly stated that this is not a Trojan horse, that it is not a process and that we are not moving towards anything.  I vividly remember the debate on the Lisbon treaty, which was originally defeated in this country.  We gave assurances in respect of our involvement in any military alliances, including common defence alliances within the European Union.  I acknowledge that everything has changed since the illegal and appalling invasion of Ukraine by Putin's forces.  That has led to monumental change across Europe, with Sweden and Finland moving away from the neutrality they had guarded dearly for decades.  In Germany, Labour's sister party, which is in government, has moved from its previous position to committing to &euro;100 billion in additional defence spending.<\/p><p>What I am saying to the Minister is that it should not be the case that he comes to the House and says that these things are not what they seem to be, that we are just opting into things that suit us and that this is part of training and so forth.  What is absolutely required, and this is something the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have said, is a proper debate on where Ireland stands in all of this.  The Labour Party would welcome that debate, because we want to set out our vision of neutrality, which is an opt-in neutrality in terms of opting into peacebuilding and peace maintenance and support for the International Court of Justice-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500019#V00300","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1657034700,"counter":149,"content":"<p>We can have that debate, but this is not it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500019#V00400","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1657034700,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Let us have that debate-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500019#V00500","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1657034700,"counter":151,"content":"<p>This is not it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500019#V00600","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1657034700,"counter":152,"content":"<p>-----and what our military posture should be.  However, let us not try, regardless of how the Minister says it, to move along a path by stealth, in my judgment, to a situation that the Irish people will be surprised to find themselves in one day.  Let us have this debate in an open clear way, an informed debate on the future of Irish neutrality, what it means to us and how we are going to vindicate it into the future, not chip away at what most people believe to be the stance of the Irish nation in terms of its military capacity.<\/p>  <p>  We were supposed to have the Minister's response to the debate on funding by the end of last month.  Will we see the Government's response to the paper?  Is that going to happen before the recess?  That would inform this debate too.

The most pressing, which is directly related yet unaddressed, is the absolutely abysmal timing and the disregard for more urgent issues relating to the Defence Forces at this time.<\/p> <p>It would be significantly more appropriate and beneficial to debate the Government's proposals on the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  That report needs, as a matter of urgency, to come back from Cabinet with a definitive and clear commitment from the Government in respect of it before any commitment to other projects is sought from this House.  That report is gathering dust while two Ministers are reportedly bickering over funding.<\/p> <p> This debate on PESCO involvement is taking place at a time when there is disregard for the Defence Forces being under strength and overtasked.  That anyone would presume to expand overseas involvement, at a time when members of our Defence Forces are undertaking free work and are exhausted as they conduct their duties on land, at sea and in the air from a position that is far off that phantom establishment of 9,500 members, is simply not good enough.  They are underpaid and denied basic employment rights.  The figures speak for themselves: we are losing members hand over fist.  The Minister has acknowledged the recruitment and retention problems in all areas of the Defence Forces but the priority seems to be discussing this motion.  That is not where our focus needs to be.  The priority for any Minister with responsibility for defence should be to ensure the Defence Forces are fit for purpose, that its members receive appropriate remuneration, that they are equipped to a high standard and that being a member of the Defence Forces is an attractive career for men and women.  We all know, unfortunately, that is not the case because of the inability of successive Governments to adequately resource or plan effectively.  If the Minister continues to run before he walks, the Defence Forces will remain in that state.  That is a desperately sad indictment, not only of this Government but of those which preceded it, and it is a failure to appreciate those who protect this State.<\/p> <p>The Minister cherry-picked the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces when he referenced a single line regarding the potential to fully explore other issues in the context of PESCO.  He has managed to get one sentence to the floor of the House.  Will he please confirm when the Government's response to the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces will actually be discussed?  When will we see that?  The Defence Forces want to see it.  There is a commitment in the membership and among veterans to ensure our Defence Forces can and will be better, and will develop into something that is fit for this era of military activity.  As I informed the Minister at last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, he has categorically put the cart before the horse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500019#V00800","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657035300,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I apologise to Deputy Richmond.

While I agree with and support the three motions before us, I am slightly disappointed that we are only now moving from participating in one PESCO project out of a total of 60 to five projects.  That is grossly unambitious.  If we are serious about the security of our State and the European Union and if we believe in the true essence of European solidarity, we need to have a real assessment of our role within Europe.  That is why I welcome our commitment to participate from the outset on the discussion when it comes to the European strategic compass strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Unlike Deputy Howlin, I do not believe we are chipping away at our neutrality.  I very much wish we were, because our military neutrality is an absolute sham.  It does not serve us well as a nation or as a people.  I fundamentally believe that the responsibility of our Minister for Defence is to ensure the defence and security of this State in co-operation with all our allies.  We have allies.  We are not non-aligned.  It is quite clear we are signed-up members of the European Union, with key partners around the globe that share our vision when it comes to democracy, the rule of law, freedom and human rights.  That is clearly embodied by the brutal and vicious attacks on Ukraine and its people by the dictator that is Vladimir Putin.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak specifically to the third motion relating to the four PESCO projects it is proposed that the Defence Forces will participate in.  That is the essence of this debate, rather than jumping on other debates or discussing other matters.  The four projects deserve individual assessment and individual criticism, where needed, but also discussion by this House.  This is quite obvious in respect of the first project, which is about participation in strengthening cybersecurity.  We only have to look at the vicious hack on the HSE last year to see the impact of that.  We only have to look at the important Government response, which was to work with EU and British allies and the tech sector to identify and solve the problems that hack created.  We all know where that cyberattack came from and where the safe harbour for those criminal gangs that participate in such cyberattacks comes from.  This goes to the essence of why it is so important we work consistently with our European colleagues to strengthen our security and defence abilities.  Warfare has changed.  It is not about boots on the ground; it is hybrid warfare.  We only have to look at the Belarusian border with Poland to see what the dictator involved is prepared to do.  We only need to look at the cyberattacks in Lithuania in the past number of weeks and the cyberattacks that took the Estonian welfare system offline for three whole weeks in 2007 to know what the threats are to our economy.  Geography will not protect us.<\/p>  <p>  The second project relates to training for disaster relief.  We will see across continental Europe again this year the impact of forest fires, mudslides and all the various natural disasters that are sadly the consequence of the climate emergency we are living with.  We need our Defence Forces to be in a position to co-operate with European partners to address mass flooding, not only on this island but across the Continent.  It makes eminent sense that we co-operate with 26 other member states, many of which have far greater resources, experience and skill sets, to protect our people, not necessarily from a military enemy but a natural enemy.<\/p>  <p>  The third area is that of emergency medical training.  We need to see our Defence Forces participating in this PESCO project.  We need to see our medics, be they in the Army, Air Corps or Naval Service, working at the same level with the same methodologies as partners across the European Union.  We have seen them benefit from this co-operation in the past.  We know it will stand to us in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The fourth project relates to the protection of shipping harbours and offshore infrastructure.  Let us not forget the area of our maritime jurisdiction is three times the size of Germany.  We all remember the fuss and concern when the Russian navy proposed entering our economic zone off the south-west coast.  We know about the response, whether it was glib or serious, of certain Irish fishers to ensure that they could protect that area.  How can we, as a small island nation, expect not to co-operate fully with our partners closest to us in developing security and protection for shipping harbours and offshore infrastructure, when we rely on them and will increasingly rely on them in the years to come?  That is very obvious when we talk about offshore infrastructure, energy development and energy security, in light of the vicious war in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  People often think these debates, especially when it comes to defence policy, are removed from everyday life and are somehow academic.  I am well up for that academic debate.  I have been trying to contribute to it during my entire involvement in politics, but this is about the practicalities.  It is about people in Ireland being able to access medical appointments online, having that sense of assurance that their records are being protected in the health system, and that the Government is working with European partners to protect those records.  It is about people in Ireland knowing the best possible resources will be put in place, God forbid, if a major flood or natural disaster were to happen on this island, in co-operation with European partners.  It is about the people of Ireland knowing that if Irish soldiers, sailors or pilots get seriously injured, they will have medics on hand who are trained to the best possible capabilities and who are working with European partners to save their lives.  It is about the mum or dad who knows that their son or daughter is deployed somewhere overseas, in harm's way and putting himself or herself in danger, but also knows the best possible training has been provided.  It is about our fishers, people who rely on energy and everyone in the maritime area knowing the best level of co-operation and security is there.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a concerted campaign to misrepresent what PESCO is about.  There have been glib references to a European army.  I have repeatedly seen the ability of people to take speeches made by individual European representatives, use them out of context and make statements about PESCO that are completely inaccurate.  If we spend any time contributing to debates at European level, following our Ministers at Council meetings or our Members of the European Parliament or looking at the discussion that is happening across Europe, we cannot continue to believe we live in blissful isolation when it comes to protecting our people and the people to whom we have a responsibility in the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  We have before us three very basic motions.  Two of them relate to our participation in the United Nations, which I know will continue.<\/p> <p>That service goes far beyond the work of our peacekeepers in the Defences Forces, and also includes the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Cyprus and many other areas of co-operation.  The motion on our participation in four additional PESCO projects is a crucial one.  Looking at the other 55 PESCO projects that Ireland is not participating in, some of which we are an observer in and some of which we have no involvement in at all, there is massive potential.  Points have been made about the retention and recruitment of staff into the Defence Forces.  One aspect that is often overlooked is the purpose of staff.  What are we training our soldiers, sailors, pilots and aircraft technicians to do?  We must ensure they are trained to perform to the best of their ability so they can not only earn a living and get the terms and conditions they need, but also that they can also strengthen their skills, develop their careers and be the best that they can be in defending this State.  I speak with current and former members of the Defence Forces on a regular basis, whether they are constituents or people who have contacted me who have an interest in the area.  Many of them want to see further opportunities to use their skills to work with partners around the EU to ensure they can be the best that they can be and that their career in our Defence Forces is a lot longer than five, six or seven years in length and can be a lifelong career.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I support the three motions before the House.  If others want to use this forum to make wider contributions about our defence security and neutrality, I welcome that, but we are having this debate now.  We must be prepared to make it an honest debate.  We must set out exactly what our responsibilities are to the people of Ireland, the people of the EU and all of our natural allies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500020#W00300","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657035900,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I intend to discuss Ireland's participation with the UN, but first I will address a few issues that have been raised in this debate, in particular, by the previous speaker.  I acknowledge the fact warfare has changed in many ways.  However, throughout the world and with the invasion of Ukraine, it is still working class men and women who are being sent to the front lines and killed because of the vanity of tyrants.  We have spoken about having a debate on the issue of Ireland's neutrality.  While it may be described by others as being academic, the outcome of that debate, from the desires of others, will still see working class men and women being sent to the front line to die.  That will not be academic.  It will be a reality, as it has been for generations.  It is why Ireland's neutrality has been hard-fought for.  It should be protected.  When we see what has rightly been described as a creeping militarisation, we should be willing and open to debating the issue.  It should not be the case that five minutes of the D&aacute;il schedule is dedicated to discussing it.  It should be much more than that.  It is why we should protect this Chamber as a source of debate.  Our neutrality was long-fought for and should be protected.<\/p>  <p>  On Ireland's participation with the UN, since 1955 Ireland has embraced the collective security mechanisms of the UN.  Then, as now, it was understood that Ireland is part of a global community, and that a security threat anywhere in the world can affect Ireland.  Since the late 1950s, Ireland has committed its diplomats, members of the Defences Forces and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in some instances to remote and far-reaching places to undertake crisis management for natural disasters and tackle the effects of interstate and intrastate conflicts and, indeed, poverty.  Through peacekeeping, peacebuilding, peace enforcement and crisis prevention, Ireland's personnel have continuously put their lives on the line to bring stability to conflict regions, to ensure the restoration of human rights, to allow local communities to go safely to work, to freely vote, and for children to get an education in conflict zones.  We are able to do that because of our reputation as those who put ourselves on the line in the name of peace.  Ireland is proud to be the only nation to have an unbroken record of service to the Blue Helmet peacekeeping since 1958.  Since then, Irish peacekeepers have served in more than 40 peacekeeping operations around the world, including in Afghanistan, the Balkans, East Timor, Rwanda, the Mediterranean and Lebanon to name just a few.  Irish Defence Forces personnel have completed more than 70,000 individual tours of duty overseas since 1958.  This service has not been without cost.  To date, 86 members of the Defence Forces have given their lives to the service of peace.  <\/p>  <p>  With the evolution of the EU's Common Security and Defence policy, Ireland has committed itself to the understanding that Ireland is part of a community whose borders stretch from the mid-Atlantic to eastern Europe, and from the Arctic Circle to north Africa and the Middle East.  The geographical scale of the EU, along with its global interests, have stretched Ireland's defence and security parameters even further, and still we are asked to do more.  Transnational terrorism and climate change are threats that are multiplied by hybrid warfare and the tide of geopolitics, demonstrating a new complex relationship between all three strategic paradigms.  Conflicts in Afghanistan, the Middle East, the Sahel region of central and north-eastern Africa, and the quasi wars' intentions in eastern Europe have created displaced peoples, breeding grounds for criminality in some instances, transnational terrorism, human trafficking, collapses in governance and human rights breaches.  In collective response, Ireland has supplied personnel to Afghanistan, Chad, Georgia, the Mediterranean and Syria, to name but a few.  Recently, we completed extraction missions in Libya and Afghanistan.  Rather than praising and showering our armed forces personnel with the admiration they deserve, they have continued to suffer with poor working conditions, discrepancies in pay, reduced ranks and inadequate resources and equipment.  How many times has the State forgotten to book flights home for overseas units?  Just in the last week, our proud Defence Forces personnel were told that they will be sent to Dublin Airport to cover for the fact that the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has mismanaged its own systems.  Our Defence Forces personnel have a proud and distinguished history of placing themselves in harm's way in the service of peace.  We are having a debate here today that is not the most important one in relation to how we protect not only our long sought-after peace and neutrality, but how we enhance and respect those who place themselves in harm's way.  Setting aside five minutes to debate the UN or participation in PESCO projects is not enough.  We need much more time than that.  The only debate we should be having today is how to enhance the role of our peacekeepers, how to pay them better and how to ensure that they are not living in poverty.  We should debate the issue of Ireland's neutrality, but in the meantime we should have a conversation about how we look after our peacekeepers and soldiers.  Currently, people are leaving the Defence Forces because of a lack of morale.  In the past week we have learned of the plans to send Defence Forces personnel to the airport to cover for DAA's mismanagement, which further erodes that morale.  There are conversations about greater expansion of the Defence Forces in terms of the erosion of our neutrality and further engagements beyond what we are already being asked to do.  How can we do that when we are already losing soldiers and peacekeepers because of the lack of respect being shown to them by this State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500021#X00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1657035900,"counter":159,"content":"<p>This is a most important debate, on which I am glad to have the opportunity to make a contribution.  I should say that many times over the years I have expressed that we should be open about the desire to defend ourselves and each other as full members of the EU.  We talk about our traditional position on neutrality.  We never had a traditional position on neutrality.  We did not have a position on neutrality until 1939.  As it happens, former Taoiseach de Valera took the right decision at the time, because we could not trust the other guys to keep their agreement, as we now know.  The fact of the matter is that Irish soldiers fought on every battlefield, for the guts of 200 years, all over Europe.  They fought in the battles of Landen and Fontenoy and on every battlefield.  If that was not enough, we went to the US and became involved on both sides.  I do not know how we could claim to be neutral, because we were certainly eager to have a scrap.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be able to defend ourselves to some extent.  We are not going to have a big army that can see off aggressors like the Russians.  However, there is no harm in having in a defence mechanism that has to be reckoned with, so that when the crunch comes for colleagues across Europe, at least we know how to act and we have the necessary equipment and training, and the ability to get involved and, more importantly, to give a good account of ourselves.  Reference has already been made to the long shorelines that we have in this country.  It is the fact that we have a long shoreline.  We must patrol our shores.  That will become more important as time goes on.  It is all very fine to say that we are neutral and nobody can attack us.  That is not true.  We know what happened to neutral countries in the Second World War.  Suddenly, it was all over and done with for them.  Our friends in Finland had their own experience of having an aggressor next door.  Finland had no option but to take them on.  Indeed, Finland gave a good account of itself.  The moral of the story has to be that we must be prepared to join with others of like minds to defend ourselves and, if necessary, to defend them.  I will cite the example of the western Balkans.<\/p> <p>It had quite a good reputation but the UN failed to defend the safe havens there.  The reason it failed to defend them was that it did not have the firepower to do so.  There is no sense in trying to explain it away or in saying if it had the firepower it would have managed to succeed.  It did not have the firepower and Milo&scaron;evi\u0107 knew it did not have it, just the same as the Russian President knows that nobody could attack them or intervene because of his strength and what he has done.  We need to be alert to what is going on around us and we need to remember that the world is changing.<\/p> <p> Whatever happens from here on in, we should have a growing ability to interoperate with our colleagues.  We have to be speaking in similar tones, although not necessarily in the same language, to our European colleagues, so that they know what we are doing and we know what they are doing.  There is no other way to do it.  We should do this during peacetime and we cannot say we will do it during peacetime now because there is a war on in Europe.  Several Members will make the opposite point but the fact of the matter is that there is nothing glorious at all about dying when you cannot defend yourself.  People might say they made the ultimate sacrifice but it means nothing and it is a useless exercise.  We need to become part of this, albeit on a limited level and maybe in the future we will develop more strong ties with our European colleagues.  The fact of the matter is we are dealing with aggressors who will seek out any weakness at all in the defence mechanism in Europe.  They will seek it out at every opportunity, they will try to see the weakness and they will exercise their maximum strength to undermine those weaknesses.  I am totally supportive of the Bill that proposes to upgrade our Defence Forces.  We should be proud of them and when we are proud of our Defence Forces we need to be able to stand behind them and ensure they are properly funded and have sufficient resources to do the job they will be asked to do.  We must ensure they do not feel they have to go into any situation in a vulnerable position.  It is as simple as that.<\/p> <p> On the other hand, I will go back to the point on neutrality.  I cannot get over the fact that we claim to be traditionally neutral; we were never neutral for God's sake.  We can look at any example.  There was the Irish Brigade in France, the Irish Brigade in Spain and the Irish Brigade in the United States.  I know there are those who will say those were mercenaries but they were soldiers who went to war.  They were funded and trained and they showed that when they were trained they were able to give a good account of themselves.<\/p> <p> Some people see any movement towards defence and security as one of aggression but there is a big difference.  We should not forget that when the Russian ships were off the south-west coast they were not there for their own good or for holidays.  They were testing the ground and the water and they will be back again; there is no doubt about that at all.  If they should come back I hope we will be sufficiently capable of ensuring that, while we may not be able to repel them, at least we can delay them.  There is nothing to be gained by saying we cannot do it.  We can do it, we did it many times in the past and we will do it again but we can only do it if we have sufficient pride in and resources and support for our Defence Forces, which I hope are coming in the course of these Bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500021#X00300","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657036500,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The position of my party and I on neutrality is completely clear.

The recent Commission on the Defence Forces mentions: \"Opportunities offered by the EU&rsquo;s Permanent Structured Cooperation to develop Ireland&rsquo;s defence capabilities\".  It goes on to state that \"it is necessary for the Defence Forces to be trained and equipped to NATO standards\" and laments the fact that our \"current battalions do not align to NATO standards\".  We have seen the accounts in the media detailing how NATO was in Cork in recent weeks supervising a military exercise.  If you look at the review it is astonishing that it references NATO 48 times.  It goes on to list three separate options for the future funding of our Defence Forces.  The first, which is considered the benign option, would cost more than &euro;1 billion per year.  Option 2 is said to allow us to serve in a higher intensity conflict areas and to deal with greater crisis management overseas and that would cost around &euro;1.5 billion per year.  Option 3 is the big one, which proposes to develop a full spectrum of military capabilities, which would cost around &euro;3 billion per year.  I look at things from a monetary point of view and &euro;3 billion per year is a colossal sum of money.

We should equip them to secure their safety but that does not mean we should get involved with the European militarisation project or with NATO.<\/p>  <p>  As an aside, if we go along with the dramatic increase of expenditure that is being proposed by NATO and the European militarists we can forget about dealing with climate change.<\/p> <p>It makes a nonsense of it because the biggest producers of CO2 emissions in the world are militaries.  That flies directly in the face of any concern for climate change.<\/p> <p> I heard the Taoiseach and probably the Minister rightly condemn Vladimir Putin as an imperialist.  His attack on Ukraine is an imperialist attack, absolutely.  Are there any other imperialists in the world?  Who might they be?  If Putin's invasions of Ukraine is imperialist - and it is - was the United States's invasion of Iraq imperialist?  The answer is \"Yes\".  Was its invasion of Afghanistan imperialist?  The answer is \"Yes\".  Is its arming of the Saudi dictatorship to conduct a bloody war in Yemen imperialist?  The answer is \"Yes\".  Is the European Union's and the United States's support for an Israeli apartheid state involved in crimes against humanity against the Palestinian people part of a western imperialist project to have an ally in the Middle East to help keep that region under its thumb?  The answer is \"Yes\".  The Minister knows it.  The double standards of the European Union in terms of foreign policy are despicable.  While the Minister rightly calls out the imperialism of Putin and says we should be concerned about it, he does not mention US, British or French imperialism, even though they have been as guilty of brutal, murderous, unjustified wars and of backing rotten and criminal regimes.  A proud tradition goes back to the independence of this State and to James Connolly and the leaders of 1916 of opposing imperialism.  That is why we must defend neutrality and oppose the Minister's attempts to shatter it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500022#Y00500","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657037100,"counter":166,"content":"<p>On 24 June, a couple of dozen people at least were victims of state murder when refugees were crushed to death against fences at the border between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla.

I welcome even more the opportunity to listen to the debate.  I have listened to all sides, particularly those who may have different views from me.  There are two, pretty much, motions before us.  One is about Defence Forces overseas and the other is about the PESCO projects.  I will deal with the first one first.  I echo many comments, particularly those of Deputy Gannon, in praise of our troops overseas, particularly those in the Middle East.  We have more than 500 troops there at the moment keeping a lid on potential conflicts.  Recent events in Ukraine are catastrophic and devastating for that country and we see the direct effects of the conflict in this country in relation to refugees, cost of living, cost of fuel and so on.  It casts a different shade on our peacekeeping troops overseas.  They are working for the global good, but also in Ireland's self-interest to make sure the stability of the world continues.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the PESCO projects, I am very much in favour of the four projects selected and will tell Deputies why.  I am proud to say that in 1926 my great-granduncle was part of the first Irish military mission to the USA.  They spent 15 months in the US, six of them in total, then came back and established a military college in the Curragh Camp in my constituency.  We have been benefitting from that ever since.  From my experience of international training courses I have benefitted enormously.  I spent three months in the UK on a live fire course, came back and the standard of live fire training and expertise in our Defence Forces increased considerably as a result.  That is why our troops are so good overseas and so heavily sought after.  They are composed and comfortable in a live fire scenario.  Their weapons handling is excellent and their weapons discipline is excellent, unlike other countries which are more trigger-happy and jumpy.  <\/p>  <p>  I spent a lot of time in the jungle in Belize, which made me a better peacekeeper in Liberia and C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire.  I spent a month there and spent months all over Europe working with like-minded countries to improve our hostage rescue capability and bring it back to Ireland.  I spent much time in the UK doing medical training which we ploughed back into our Defence Forces.  PESCO is not about Europe, but Ireland.  It is about improving our standards.  We do not have the expertise on this island and have to go abroad to get it and plough it back.  From a military perspective, it is in Ireland's interest.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with all four projects selected.  First is cyber.  There are two seats in the National Cyber Security Centre for military cyber experts.  We do not have the expertise in Ireland so have to go abroad and get the expertise to prevent attacks and deal with one if it happens.  We saw the devastating effects of the HSE attack last year. <\/p>  <p>  From a disaster management point of view, I do not want to make a false equivalence but will give a classic example.  I was involved in the vaccination programme and everybody in this Chamber knows it was sluggish for the first two or three months because we had not done it before and had not trained together.  If there is a tsunami, earthquake, volcano or severe weather event abroad, there will be an international response and if we have not trained together or co-operated in the past, we will find it difficult to have a cohesive response.  <\/p>  <p>  I have mentioned at the committee that I am concerned about medical training in the Defence Forces.  Any opportunity we get to improve our expertise, tools and talent we should seize, bring it back to our Defence Forces and plough it into our training.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the last one on mines, the Naval Service does not have the expertise in dealing with mines.  Sea mines from the Second World War float ashore occasionally.  Mines are becoming extremely topical in the Black Sea.  If the international community decides it needs to go in and secure Odesa to bring the grain out of the silos, there will be a requirement to deal with the sea mine threat.  We do not have the expertise.  We have to get the expertise to bring it back in.  <\/p>  <p>  My view is purely from a training perspective.  Any interaction we have had with the European Union, from a national perspective, has been, on balance, positive.  Students use the Erasmus programme and engage with the European Union.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na uses Europol and Ministers use the Council of Ministers.  PESCO is how militaries engage and co-operate with each other, exchange skills through workshops and bring them back to their national defence forces to improve their standards.  PESCO does not compromise our peacekeeping standards.  International training does not compromise those standards; it created them in the first place and enhances them.  <\/p>  <p>  I am in favour of the four projects.  I hear the diversity of views in the Chamber and respect them but, in Ireland's self-interest and that of our Armed Forces, these four projects will make us better peacekeepers, soldiers, sailors and flight crew.  We will be able to protect our country to a higher standard and contribute, should we wish on a voluntary basis, to international operations overseas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500023#Z00300","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1657037100,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I support the motion.  I agree with everything Deputy Berry said and acknowledge his deep expertise in this area.<\/p> <p>The participation by Ireland in these European initiatives is a natural extension of Ireland's integration into Europe and its deeper collaboration with European partners on a whole range of different fronts.  I do not see why defence needs to be different.  Defence is about our own strategic self-interest.  Our strategic self-interest is at the heart of Europe.  It is about seriously equipping ourselves for the challenges we know are ahead.  As Deputy Berry has said, the opportunity of participating in the four additional PESCO programmes is about enhancing our own expertise, intelligence and access to intelligence.  It is about enhancing our contribution to the security that I sometimes worry we take for granted or could take for granted.  It is also about reducing risk to Ireland and to Irish people by putting in the work to deepen integration and to develop better skills within our Defence Forces.  Our Defence Forces are deeply professional.  They need better financial support from Government.  I am glad that the Minister has published the work of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  I strongly support the work of that commission in identifying the key strategic challenges for defence and the investment that is needed.  I might come back to that.  <\/p> <p> Ireland is a small open country.  The necessity for us to participate collaboratively with partners is not in any way unique to defence.  We do the same thing in respect of medical and scientific development.  We must continue to learn from our colleagues and to get the best we possibly can.  It is in our rational self-interest to do so.  <\/p> <p> I strongly urge the Minister to take the opportunity to go as far as he possibly can with regard to additional spending on defence at this time.  While the commission's report was published in advance of the invasion of Ukraine, I am hearing a deep concern among my constituents that Ireland is simply not equipped to deal with the challenges that might face it at any time.  Ireland was not capable of preventing the cyberattack that occurred, which was as disruptive to the health system as the challenge of Covid, if not more so.  We face such risks at all times.  The risks facing Ireland set out in the report are very real.  There are the implications of Brexit, the implications for trade and the question of managing our territory in that regard.  There is also the question of how Ireland is situated geographically and strategically in the context of changes in geopolitical power dynamics, which may result in risks to Ireland - which I again stress is by no means possible - or to the EU more generally, in which Ireland is a participant.  As I have already said, there are challenges with regard to infrastructure and IT.  These can be hit at any point.  Ireland is uniquely vulnerable to such hits being, as we are, an island economy.  There is also a challenge with regard to instability on the borders of Europe and on the Continent of Europe more broadly.  There is also a challenge with regard to organised crime and terrorism along with challenges relating to energy security and raw materials security.  If anything, the invasion of Ukraine has given us a window into the possible future and shown us how at risk we always have been and still remain.  We are participating in more demanding peacekeeping duties and want to do so.<\/p> <p> I have a question.  If the Government does not take the opportunity to participate in these PESCO projects, or to invest in our Defence Forces - and many Deputies have called for such investment in salaries and better resources - to equip our Defences Forces as well as possible and to give every professional opportunity to every member of the Defence Forces to become the very best they can possibly be within our structure and something then goes wrong, which Deputies are prepared to go back to their constituencies and say that we were not prepared to support that participation and investment?  Which Deputies are happy to say that they were not happy to give the additional funding to the Defence Forces that they knew was needed?  <\/p> <p> Now is our opportunity to take stock of what we have seen across Europe.  Now is our opportunity to recognise that we were always at risk and to reflect on the fact that we may have collectively been a little naive in our perceptions of our own security.  Even in the last 12 months, we have been shown again and again that we are not immune to international challenges and geopolitical risks.  We have seen the threat of Russian ships entering our maritime area.  We are aware of how exposed that maritime area is and how large it is relative to those of our European partners.  We are aware of our limitations, which have been clearly pointed out to us by the Commission on Defence Forces.  These limitations have great spending implications.  It is easy to put such reports on a shelf and to fail to act.  It is easy to let a convenient narrative prevail that we are safe, have always been safe, have always been a certain way and always need to stay that way, but it is just not true.  It is not even accurate based on the evidence to date, never mind the risks we can reasonably foresee for the future or those that we cannot foresee.  I again ask, if something happens and if, despite knowing the risks, we have not invested or taken the steps towards better and deeper integration with our European partners and professional defence forces around the Continent from which we can learn and to which we can contribute our expertise, what will the Irish public say to us?  Are Deputies ready to go back and have those conversations honestly?  They are reasonable questions.<\/p> <p> On behalf of the Parliament, I recently had the opportunity to visit Finland.  The Ceann Comhairle pointed me towards the Helsinki Policy Forum Women Parliamentarians Network, which meets in Helsinki twice a year.  I took the opportunity to meet different Members of Parliament to discuss their recent experience of joining NATO and to ask how it had gone from a public opinion perspective and political perspective and what they had experienced over the previous six months.  Finland had been a neutral country for a very long time.  As another European entity on the other side of northern Europe, we have not experienced or understood the risks that Finland always has.  Finland had made itself more than ready for NATO.  It had taken the steps needed to be ready to join, if it ever chose to do so.  It made joining an option 20 years previously and made practical changes such as signal changes and so on.  What was really important was the public opinion experience in Finland over time as they saw the realisation of the risks they faced, albeit in a different part of the Continent, how quickly public opinion changed and how quickly Members of its Parliament signed up.  Some 98% or 99% of the Members of the Finnish Parliament voted for it.  A couple of Members who identify themselves as on the far left voted against and a couple abstained.  There was a great shift in public opinion over a short period from having not wanted to be involved with NATO to absolutely wanting to do so.  Again, this was entirely based on rational self-interest.  <\/p> <p> We do not face the same direct threat that Finland faces but we are similar in many other respects.  We have to have a conversation about how far we are ready to equip ourselves, act in our rational self-interest and give our Defence Forces the opportunity to be the best and most professional organisation it can be on a small island.  Participation in these PESCO projects is the absolute minimum required but I call on the Minister to take the opportunity to do as my constituents are calling for and to provide significantly enhanced funding to every stream of the Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500023#Z00400","speaker":"1480","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657037700,"counter":170,"content":"<p>One of the core elements of supporting Ireland's policy of neutrality should be the wish for Ireland to be a peacemaker, a neutral mediator seeking international justice and a fair contributor to the humanitarian cause, as we always have been.

What do we hope to achieve by having them there?  Is it to soften us up before we slide into participation with NATO?  We are supposed to be neutral and we should be neutral.

The small size of the Defence Forces and the economic circumstances of the Irish State are factors that must be considered with regard to our defence capability and deployment.  Ireland is not in a position to participate in self-funded operations.  It has a limited number of personnel available for overseas operations, as the Minister well knows.  Similar to other states, Ireland retains a national command of Defence Forces personnel when on UN operations.  However, Irish participation has always been based on the premise that full operational command in the field must reside with the force commander or head of mission, as appropriate.  Participation in the NATO-led, albeit UN-mandated, operations covered in part by this motion, placed Irish troops under the de facto command of NATO for the first time.  There are significant legal and constitutional difficulties involved in the command and-or control of Irish forces by non-Defence Forces personnel.  Successive Governments to date, including the Minister himself, have quietly ignored these issues.  I would be very grateful if the Minister could clarify the Government's position on such profound matters.  I once again thank our Defence Forces for their excellent and unwavering sense of duty, particularly the people who leave their homes, go abroad and put themselves in harm's way as part of peacekeeping operations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500025#BB00300","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1657038300,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I am very concerned about its proposal to significantly increase Ireland's participation in permanent structured co-operation projects.  This motion is seeking approval from the House to increase Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO projects from one project to a further four military projects.  I oppose this completely.  PESCO is seen by many, including myself, as a precursor to an EU army.  I take this opportunity to voice my absolute opposition to the establishment of any type of EU army.<\/p><p>When PESCO was formed, the joint notification on permanent structured co-operation from PESCO member states stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tPESCO is a crucial step towards strengthening the common defence policy.  It could be an element of a possible development towards a common defence [that is, a common European army] should the Council by unanimous vote decide so (as provided for in article 42.2 TEU).  A long term vision of PESCO could be to arrive at a coherent full spectrum force package - in complementarity with NATO, which will continue to be the cornerstone of collective defence for its members.  <\/blockquote>  <p>Another statement on PESCO claims:<\/p> <blockquote> \tPESCO is both a permanent framework for closer cooperation and a structured process to gradually deepen defence cooperation within the Union framework.  It will be a driver for integration in the field of defence.  <\/blockquote>  <p>That is what PESCO is ultimately about.<\/p><p>I believe we are going down a very dangerous path.  We must do all we can to protect our long-standing policy of neutrality.  Despite reassurances by the Government, it seems our neutrality is under serious threat at the moment.  Recent Government behaviour only proves this.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s presence at an EU-NATO meeting in Madrid last week was a very public attempt to erode Ireland&rsquo;s military neutrality.  This motion for increased participation in military operations is a clear indicator of this Government&rsquo;s plans to abandon neutrality altogether.<\/p><p>Josep Borrell, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs has said the building of PESCO will be a big task and a big opportunity for the European defence industry.  He said the strategy for the medium term is to expand the existing capabilities of EU countries and eliminate the gap between member countries in terms of both quality and quantity of defence systems.  He referred specifically to air defence systems, drones, air refuelling capabilities, tanks, armoured vehicles, coastal protection and cyber capabilities.  That shows what the intentions of the EU are for PESCO co-operation.  While these individual items of PESCO might be minimal, it is about the overall Government policy and strategy.  We are getting to the stage where we will wake up one morning and discover we are participating in everything.  Then, people will wonder how we got here.<\/p><p>This, following the increased focus on an EU army across the Continent, suggests we are slowly being dragged into war.  One day we are going to look back and wonder where it all began.  It begins with these small steps, these seemingly insignificant motions.  These are the moments future historians will look back on and study if we are not careful.  We are a small, neutral nation.  Our strengths have always been in peacekeeping and speaking out against injustice, not in military participation.  This is something we should be incredibly proud of and something that is clearly reflected in the reports brought forward by the Minister for Defence via this motion.  The 2021 report states that Ireland currently participates in six of the 12 peacekeeping missions operated by the UN and, according to the UN data, we are the sixth largest per capita troop-contributing country in the world, and the largest in Europe.  This is where our focus and our resources should remain.  This is where they are important and where they will make the most significant impact.<\/p><p>I welcome that the adoption of UNSCR 2594, spearheaded by Ireland, was the first UN Security Council resolution devoted to the transition from peacekeeping to peacebuilding.  The resolution focuses on the transition from UN peace missions to a UN civilian presence that supports peacebuilding in post-conflict environments, ensuring civilians stay protected throughout this process.  Ireland has a unique insight into post-conflict environments, given our recent history.  I am glad our knowledge and experience is being utilised at the highest level.  Again, this is where our strengths lie and this is where our focus should be.  PESCO is not about that.<\/p><p>Even more cynically, PESCO is being dressed up as a business opportunity.  A report produced by the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces on thee Common Security and Defence Policy stated, &quot;there is dual opportunity arising whereby Defence can incorporate agile innovation into its capability development processes, whilst also supporting Irish research institutes and enterprise in accessing the new funding streams to deliver these capabilities&quot;.  Another report advocates the establishment of a security and defence enterprise group, stating it would<\/p> <blockquote> \t[bring] together enterprise, industry, [academic] research and practitioners in the field of security and defence to identify areas of common endeavour and collaboration <br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>to support Irish-based enterprise in their engagement with the EDA ... <\/blockquote>  <p>It is okay if Irish business makes money out of the weapons and so on in the future.

We do not have many natural enemies, at least in a conventional way, from a security and military perspective.  We face threats, as we have seen with cybersecurity issues and so on.  This is not a debate about neutrality.  It is a debate about the resourcing of our Defence Forces and how we can enhance that with opportunities to operate with other countries that have also voluntarily opted in to these projects in order that we can work together to make sure our troops are safer when they are abroad and we have a better skill set for responding to what is asked of them.  To refer to neutrality in a way that suggests we should not work with other friendly countries which we are working with on all sorts of other matters to enhance our capacity and skill set is, to my mind, extraordinary.<\/p>  <p>  Incidentally, I still do not know whether Sinn F&eacute;in is supporting these PESCO projects.  If Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Defence Forces, then it should consider that they want these projects.  They feel safer on the back of doing them  There is an idea that we should not be involved in a project that is about cyberthreats and incident response information, with a sharing platform with three or four other countries, and training and working with other countries to ensure we are better prepared for disaster relief.  If, God forbid, there was a natural disaster in North Africa today that killed thousands of people, Deputies would all be calling on me to respond, just like people responded positively when we sent a ship to the Mediterranean to respond to the plight of migrants there.  We can train with other countries to make sure that we have the capacity to do that and we choose to do it ourselves.<\/p>  <p>  On the special operations forces medical training centre, Army Ranger Wing personnel are in Mali as we speak on a complex, difficult mission.  The idea that we would not offer them the opportunity to improve medical training capacity is extraordinary.  Tying that up in an ideological debate on neutrality is just not where this should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500026#CC00500","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1657038900,"counter":184,"content":"<p>The Minister missed the fundamental point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500026#CC00600","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1657038900,"counter":185,"content":"<p>The same applies to mine countermeasures.

This Bill relates to serious matters of policy with regard to the scope of data retention and access measures that are permitted for the purposes of an effective response by State agencies to issues of national security, crime and the life and safety of persons.  The Bill aims to amend the current Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011.  This provides for the general and indiscriminate retention of certain categories of communications data held by communications service providers, but not the content of such communications.  Disclosure of such data is permitted for the purposes responding to serious criminal offences, safeguarding national security or the saving of human life.<\/p>  <p>  Various safeguards are built into the Act, including access to a complaints mechanism if a person&rsquo;s data are disclosed, a reporting requirement for State agencies on their use of the Act and an oversight role for a designated judge of the High Court.  Deputies will be aware that there has been a civil law challenge to the 2011 Act, arising from a high-profile criminal case.  While it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specifics of any case that is before the courts or may be before the courts at a later date, it is necessary to refer to some aspects of that litigation.<\/p>  <p>  Following a High Court decision in early 2019 which declared invalid the section of the 2011 Act permitting disclosure of retained data for law enforcement purposes, the State appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court referred certain legal questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union.  On 5 April this year, the Court of Justice delivered its ruling.  In essence, the court confirmed that while general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data for national security purposes can be justified in certain circumstances, it is not permitted for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of a serious criminal offence.  The court added that access provisions for traffic and location data must incorporate prior judicial scrutiny other than in certain urgent circumstances and in such circumstances, there must be a post review.<\/p> <p>The State's appeal proceedings are expected to conclude shortly.<\/p> <p> I am advised that there is an urgent need to address the immediate impacts of the Court of Justice ruling by way of a number of targeted amendments to the 2011 Act.  The current legal frailties within the 2011 Act have now been made definitive following the issue of the Court of Justice.  In addition, service providers in the communications sector have expressed to me doubt as to the validity of continued general and indiscriminate retention of data currently held and the need for legal certainty as to what their data retention obligations now are.<\/p> <p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant agencies require legal certainty as to the scope of their powers to seek disclosure of retained data for the prevention, detection, investigation, and prosecution of criminal offences, for national security and other lawful purposes.  Accordingly, I am proposing a series of urgent amendments to the 2011 Act that balance a number of factors.  First, I must adhere to the conditions placed on the general and indiscriminate retention of data for law enforcement and national security purposes.  Within these constraints, I am seeking to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other related agencies have the most effective legal provisions that are possible to support their vital role.  Second, I must have due regard to the right to privacy of individuals and to the need for strong oversight of any data retention measures that are imposed.  Third, I must have regard to the needs of victims or potential victims of crime.  There is a right to life and a right to personal safety of persons and these rights must also be given sufficient priority.<\/p> <p> I will refer briefly to the main provisions of the Bill.  It provides for amendments to the current rules on general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data, referred to as &ldquo;Schedule 2&rdquo; data.  Such retention can only be permitted for national security purposes and where there is the approval of a High Court judge.  It will no longer be permitted for law enforcement purposes.  Disclosure of the retained data will only be permitted where approved by an authorised judge of the District Court.  While I do not object to the concept of judicial approval of disclosure, confining general retention to national security purposes is a requirement of the Court of Justice rulings and would not be my preferred policy choice.  I will, however, continue to advocate at EU level for an EU-wide legal instrument that will support strong general data retention measures that deal with both national security and law enforcement concerns.<\/p> <p> Provision is made for new access provisions including two new types of orders which will strengthen the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to secure and access specified categories of Schedule 2 data for the purpose of specific criminal investigations or proceedings or for national security.  Preservation orders will require the preservation of specified Schedule 2 data in connection with specific persons, locations or other indicators, for example mobile phone numbers.  A preservation order will not in itself require the granting of access to data.  Production orders will require the submission of specified data to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and may include data that may already be the subject of a preservation order.  The possibility of deploying such measures is to ensure the expedited retention of specific data in individual cases and has been acknowledged by the Court of Justice in its rulings.  Provision is also made for the approval, in urgent cases, of temporary orders by an appropriate senior official in each organisation.  These must be notified to an authorised judge for affirmation within 72 hours.<\/p> <p> I am also providing, as required by the Court of Justice rulings, for separate rules and procedures for retention and disclosure of user data, which refers to issues such as the mobile number used, the equipment identifier number for any specific device, the Internet protocol, IP, number of a communication, and the date and time of initial activation of a communications service of a user.  This more general type of information does not specify details relating to the number, traffic or location details of users of communications services.  Court of Justice rulings do not require a change to the existing rules linked to the retention of user data, which is deemed to have less of an impact on privacy rights.  The retention of and disclosure of such data can be permitted for both national security and general criminal offences in general.<\/p> <p> As it is permitted by the Court of Justice, I am also making provision for the retention and disclosure, subject to judicial approval, of Internet source data.  This refers to the data necessary to trace and identify the source of a communication by Internet access, Internet email or Internet telephony.  This will typically be the IP address that will have accessed Internet content.  The 2011 Act already provides for the retention of similar categories of data.  Such data is deemed to be particularly important in the detection of offences committed online, such as child sexual abuse offences.  Provision is also made in urgent cases of the disclosure of this data by an appropriate senior official in each organisation, which must be notified to an authorised judge for affirmation within 72 hours.<\/p> <p> The Bill also makes provision for a transitional provision that allows for a time-limited period where there can be disclosure, on national security grounds only, of Schedule 2 data already retained under the existing 2011 Act until the earlier of the following events: expiry of a period of six months; or the making of a first order by the High Court permitting the future retention of Schedule 2 data.  This provision will run for a period depending on when the relevant data was first processed but it will naturally expire and such disclosure will only, in line with the Court of Justice rulings, be for national security purposes.<\/p> <p> The Bill makes provision for the authority of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to seek urgent access to cell site location data that indicate the last location of a person&rsquo;s communications, where necessary for the saving of a life or dealing with missing persons.  The Bill also makes provision for notification, in certain circumstances, of the data subject where Schedule 2 data has been disclosed for law enforcement purposes.<\/p> <p> There are a number of important differences between the data retention and disclosure regime in this Bill and the 2011 Act.  General retention of Schedule 2 data is only permitted for national security purposes and only where approved on necessity and proportionality grounds by a designated High Court judge.  In the 2011 Act, it is for both national security and law enforcement.  There is no prior judicial approval.  A single 12-month period of retention is provided for all forms of Schedule 2 data.  It is currently 24 months for telephony data and 12 months for Internet data in the 2011 Act.  Disclosure of Schedule 2 data is subject to approval by an authorised District Court judge and only where necessity or proportionality can be shown.  There is no prior judicial approval process for disclosure in the 2011 Act.  The preservation order regime is less intrusive on privacy rights as it does not require immediate production of data.  This is not in the 2011 Act.  The provision on notification of a data subject in certain circumstances is also not in the 2011 Act.<\/p> <p> I am conscious that I am asking the House to approve these amendments on an urgent basis.  I believe, however, that recent litigation and the urgent need to provide for clarity for service providers, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other State agencies justify making immediate legal changes now pending further reforms later this year.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies cannot, in my view, have one hand tied behind their back in seeking to safeguard national security, prosecute offences and ensure the personal safety of individuals.  I am also happy to confirm that later in 2022 I intend to bring forward a set of wider reforms to clarify and consolidate the law on data retention.  I intend to publish an updated general scheme of a Bill, which will build on a previous general scheme that was published in 2017 and completed scrutiny in early 2018.  This general scheme will also have regard to the evolving case law of the Court of Justice in the intervening period and will be proposed for discussion and further consultation, as required, before the Joint Committee on Justice.  I am pleased to commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500026#CC01700","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657039500,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire.  I will first address the manner in which this Bill has been introduced.  It has long been known that this area needs to be addressed.  Yet again, the Government has been found wanting.  A proper approach to law reform does not involve sticking one's head in the sand and hoping that things will work out.  There is no doubt that great complexities exist around data retention but they are not resolved by being ignored.  Now, in a sense of heightened urgency the Government is seeking to address these issues while acknowledging that it is unlikely the Bill will be the lasting solution.  It has engendered a sense of panic.  The Joint Committee on Justice was asked to waive pre-legislative scrutiny, refused and was then asked to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny at very short notice.  This is far from ideal and has produced, in the view of Sinn F&eacute;in, a poor solution to the challenges at hand.<\/p>  <p>  It must be noted that EU law in the area does need to be examined, as my colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, pointed out in April when the Advocate General of the Court of Justice gave his view on the Dwyer case.  Any data retention regime must, naturally, comply with EU law.  There is little doubt that the strict adherence to the notion that only threats to national security merit the retention of data can lead to serious criminals evading justice.  I note that the submission from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na mentioned the challenges that all EU countries face, not just Ireland.  The Minister must seek to address this at European Union level, solely in respect of serious crime.<\/p> <p>There is a balance to be struck in EU and domestic law between civil liberties and the need for justice, as well as for a stable regime where there is certainty for operators, prosecutors, the courts, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ordinary citizens.  The Data Protection Commission was only given a copy of the general scheme of the Bill two weeks ago and was invited to partake in the rushed pre-legislative scrutiny session to which I refer at 24-hours-notice.  The commission has concerns arising from the proposed data protection audits referred to in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the operators, there is little in the Bill which sets out the when, how and where of data retention.  Improvising in respect of these areas is not something that should be done.  The consequences of getting it wrong are very worrying.  According to Ronan Lupton, the chair of their representative group, it could take between 12 and 24 months to build the systems necessary required under the provisions of the Bill.  Presumably, the Minister will have introduced fresh legislation within this period so this timeline will then need to be reset.  Consultation with the operators over what is and is not feasible must be done.<br\/><br\/>For prosecutors, the uncertainty is of no great help.  Obviously, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, is unlikely to refuse any additional tool it can gain.  If, however, it is uncertain about how legally sound the existing arrangements are, then a situation where a Bill at which a large number of valid critiques have been levelled will be enacted in order to cover a limited period will be of no great comfort to it.<br\/><br\/>The courts are in a similar boat.  I fear they will be making decisions that can be resolved by policy.  The latter is an undesirable situation, in light of the separation of powers, but a seemingly likely one because the Bill lacks detail and provisions relating to real-world application.<br\/><br\/>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as already mentioned, has flagged that the issue of data retention is a challenge for many countries.  Yet its job will be among the most difficult under this regime.  It is worth quoting the remarks of its representative at the Joint Committee on Justice last week: <\/p><blockquote>\tUnder the scheme of the Bill, whilst AGS will be able to utilise Preservation and Production Orders to secure evidence, this process will be forward-looking and not retrospective.  This will cause significant difficulties in criminal investigations, which usually commence post incident.  However, this restriction does not arise in relation to matters relating to National Security matters. <\/blockquote> <p>The rights of ordinary citizens need to be recognised within this process. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, has outlined a number of its concerns. It is clear that, if passed, the Bill will lead to further legal uncertainty and legal challenges of the type brought by Graham Dwyer.  Victims deserve better than that.  At the same time, indiscriminate data retention with little legal certainty or process poses a great threat to privacy.  Proper supervision of access arrangements are important but of course the best protection is always to not collate data in the first place, followed by collating it for specified reasons with a clear legal basis.<br\/><br\/>The Bill allows for a one-year retention period that can be renewed.  This could see data being retained indefinitely, which is not a desirable outcome.  The functions of a judge who grants access to this data must be expanded.  There is a recognition of the need for supervision in the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill.  That Bill has enjoyed a far longer and more detailed scrutiny process, which is no doubt required here also.<br\/><br\/>Despite the Government's foot-dragging in this area, there is a clear need to address the challenges the ruling presents.  Sinn F&eacute;in is holding its own engagements with stakeholders.  Any new Bill needs to respect these stakeholders and be the subject of a proper timeframe to facilitate their input.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500027#DD00200","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657040100,"counter":199,"content":"<p>This Bill will significantly amend the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011.  This is in response to a ruling in April by the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which held that the \"general and indiscriminate\" retention of electronic communications data for the purpose of combating serious crime is precluded by EU law.  The court's ruling followed a referral by the Irish Supreme Court in February 2020, which was hearing a leapfrog appeal from the State against a High Court ruling in December 2018 which agreed that the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 was incompatible with EU law.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides that general and indiscriminate retention of communications traffic and location data can only be permitted on national security grounds where approved by a designated judge.  It also provides for a system of preservation and production orders to facilitate preservation of and access to specific communications data held by service providers for both national security and for the investigation of serious crimes where permitted by an authorising judge.<\/p>  <p>  A preservation order will act as a quick freeze that will require service providers to retain any specified data they hold at a particular point for a period.  A production order will allow access to specified data held by a service provider for commercial or other reasons where such access is necessary for national security or law enforcement purposes.  The effect of a production order will be that a service provider must immediately take steps to produce and hand over to the relevant State agency the data described in the order made by an authorised judge.  Both traffic and location data retained for national security purposes and subscriber data, retained for national security or law enforcement purposes, will be retained for 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  The Government previously indicated that the general scheme was consistent with EU court rulings in this area.  We must ensure that there are safeguards and protections when it comes to accessing data, but we must balance this with the need to keep people safe and fight serious crime.  There is an urgency in addressing this issue in light of the need for legal certainty for communications service providers and State agencies on what obligations apply to the retention of communications data, which is vital for law enforcement and national security.<\/p>  <p>  The Government intends to bring forward a more comprehensive proposal later in the year to address wider reforms and a more consolidated legal framework in this area.  The Minister needs to share the details of that proposal in order that we can judge the Bill before us in that context.  We are potentially dealing with significant erosion of civil liberties, and must have all the information before making an informed decision.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Justice recently warned that the rushing through of this legislation would make it vulnerable to legal challenges.  It further warned that the Bill will have serious consequences for future court cases.  A senior garda told the committee that while the Bill's provisions are in line with European court rulings, typical investigations into serious crime will suffer under those provisions.  The committee also strongly criticised the Government for announcing approval of the Bill on 31 May despite repeated indications over the past eight years that the legislation was problematic.  Furthermore, the committee stated that the draft Bill was only sent to it two weeks before the D&aacute;il's summer recess.  This is not the way to do business.  The committee has expressed its concern that the rushed process and lack of mandatory consultation will lead to legislation that is vulnerable to legal challenge and that this will have serious consequences for future cases.  The committee also called for a sunset clause and wants much wider consultation to take place when more comprehensive legislation on accessing people's communication data is published later in the year.<\/p>  <p>  Certain categories of citizens should be given separate rights, such as, for example, journalists, in order to ensure that sources are adequately protected.  We also need to see a code of conduct for telecom service providers in order to provide clarity.<\/p>  <p>  Yet again, we have legislation that is being rushed through by the Government.  This will have consequences.  If you act in haste, Minister, you will repent at leisure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500028#EE00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1657040100,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I appreciate the difficulties in the shadow of which the Minister for Justice is operating.  This is a very tricky situation.  We assumed in 2011 that the law enacted then provided a reasonable balance between what all of us would expect, which is that there can be no mass surveillance of our population and that we are all entitled to what are set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as our personal freedoms in the context of not having our movements monitored and details of them collated and reported to any authority.<\/p> <p>It needs to strike that balance between the right of the State to protect its citizens, to prosecute serious crime and to ensure that the perpetrators of serious crime are brought to justice, using whatever technologies we have.<br\/><br\/>Having said that and while I fully appreciate and understand the pressures the Minister is under, it is fundamentally unacceptable that in the second last week of a D&aacute;il sitting we would be presented with legislation like this so fundamentally important to the rights and well-being of citizens and the prosecution of serious criminal cases.  Let us consider the basics of it.  The Data Protection Commission's deputy commissioner had sight of the heads of this Bill eight days before he was asked to make his presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and give his observations.  He only had sight of the draft Bill 24 hours before being asked to make that submission.  Members of the committee got a draft of the bill courtesy of the Minister the night before our session.  Many of the people we had invited to make submissions to the committee were not in a position to make submissions, so tight was the notification.<br\/><br\/>The Minister asked that we do away with pre-legislative scrutiny and all of us on a cross-party basis thought that was fundamentally wrong.  The whole idea of pre-legislative scrutiny is to go into the details and hear from the stakeholders before we get into the minutiae of enacting legislation.  This is one of the fundamental reforms brought in in 2011.  The current Taoiseach was among the champions of demanding pre-legislative scrutiny as a permanent feature of the way we do business.  I accept there will be occasions when emergencies arise but too often, particularly from the Department of Justice when it has had ample time to prepare legislation and certainly do the groundwork with committees of the House, it presents us with a <i>fait accompli<\/i>basically regarding the institutions of democracy, Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann, as rubber stamps, really affording no time for the general public, affected individuals or organisations, including commercial entities in this case, to give a reasoned consideration and present their position to us because the Department of Justice knows all the answers to all the questions and could present a completed Bill that basically is unamendable.<br\/><br\/>To compound all of this I understand we are to have 45 minutes tomorrow for Committee and Remaining Stages.  In essence it is probable that only the first amendment will actually be reached and debated tomorrow.  That is just not good enough and not acceptable.  It is not the way I expected the current Minister for Justice to deal with the House.  The rhetoric is great, but this is the reality.  There is no time for pre-legislative scrutiny, no time for the really affected organisations to prepare their presentation on this fundamental and tricky balancing between the right of citizens to personal privacy and the right of the State to prosecute serious crimes.<br\/><br\/>We are talking about crimes like online child abuse, murder and people trafficking, where it is really important that we give as much capacity to the prosecuting authorities and the investigating authorities to investigate and hold those responsible to account while at the same time ensuring that we do not turn ourselves into a mass surveillance state.  The European Court of Justice is particularly exercised about individual rights and freedoms so that someone is able to have a life online as they would have a life in their own village and protecting their privacy in going about this.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister rightly said, the decision of the European Court of Justice had a profound impact on the 2011 Act.  It found that section 6(1)(a) was inconsistent with the European eprivacy directive.  Equally there have been views expressed about its compatibility with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and also the European Convention on Human Rights itself.<br\/><br\/>Critical to determining these matters surely is the view of the Data Protection Commissioner.  Surely it is not good enough that final Bill would be presented to him 24 hours before a hearing of the justice committee on pre-legislative scrutiny which, if the Minister had her way, would not happen at all meaning that all we would have is this short debate tonight and 45 minutes of detailed scrutiny, which is what Committee Stage is supposed to be about.  That will not take place in the Select Committee on Justice, but 45 minutes here tomorrow where we are likely to debate only one amendment.  Thankfully the first amendment is mine, but that is likely as far as we will get.  That is about putting in a sunset clause which I think is the best we can do in the circumstances and at least timeline this.<br\/><br\/>I want to go through the Minister's presentation of the Bill in some detail but before doing so, I wish to say one final thing about the general structure of the Minister's proposal.  The Bill is complicated to read because like all amending legislation it cross-references the 2011 Act.  The Minister has promised to bring in a comprehensive consolidation Act before the end of this year.

The Garda should be crystal clear on its rights when accessing and using data for criminal investigation purposes.  That is really important.<\/p>  <p>  Equally important is the point already made - a question I asked the representative of the data platform providers in the course of the truncated pre-legislative scrutiny last Thursday.  I asked how long he thought it would take for the platforms to implement this particular set of proposals.  He said it would take up to 24 months.  He could not give me a cost but said it would be a very considerable cost, which obviously would have to be passed on to users.  That is not escapable inasmuch as we are required to implement the European Court of Justice findings but we need to be practical about its implementation.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said the Bill provides for amendments to the current rules on general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data, the so-called \"Schedule 2\" data.  That is really important because it provides data on where each of us is.  As we now learn from court cases we follow, phones are like having tracking devices on our persons.  The companies that provide us with the service know where each of us is at any given moment in time.  Most of us are not comfortable with that.  For most of us it would be very boring to find out where we are at any given time.  We would like our lives to be more exciting but still we do not want everybody to know always where we are at any given time.  That is why privacy on these matters is so important.  However, there are occasions when it will be important to know where suspects are or have been.  We really did not have a chance to tease out with representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whether this is the best fist we could have made of the European Court judgment.  I am intrigued by the Minister's comment in her presentation to us that she wants to raise this matter with colleagues in the justice committee I presume at the European Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500029#FF00500","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1657040700,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I have done so multiple times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500029#FF00600","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1657040700,"counter":207,"content":"<p>She has done so.  Presumably then there will be a collective view that maybe the issue should be readdressed recognising the fundamental importance of not only matters that go to protection of the integrity of the State but also matters that go to prosecuting serious crimes that are by nature ones that threaten the viability of the State anyway if we cannot prosecute murderers or if child abuse or human trafficking become more difficult to prosecute.<\/p> <p>I am intrigued by the Minister's belief that this is happening anyway.  I do not know whether she is telling us that there may be the prospect in the foreseeable future of an amended directive.  Is that what is envisaged?  In the interim, we must implement the law as it has been stated by the Court of Justice of the European Union and we have to make the best fist of it.  I would have liked more time to tease this out with representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because I am not sure it has fully thought through how useful the particular piece of legislation will be for it.  <\/p> <p> In terms of the so-called Schedule 2 data, such retention can only be permitted for national security purposes and where there is the approval of a High Court judge.  The location data can only be retained for national security purposes, not for the prosecution or investigation of serious crimes regardless of how serious the crime is if it is not a matter of national security.  Presumably this is as far as we are permitted to go and be consistent with the Court of Justice of the European Union's judgment, which would cause concern for many of us, including the Minister.  The preservation orders will require the preservation of such data in connection with specific persons, locations or other indicators.  A preservation order will not in itself require the granting of access to the data.  Production orders will require the submission of specified data to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and may include data that is already the subject of a preservation order.  Again, I would like more time to tease out the transition period.  We will not have time for it tomorrow either.  There will be a number of crimes, probably very serious crimes, that are well-advanced in investigative terms.  I do not know whether it is possible for the Minister to indicate how many of these cases are under way.  Has she been briefed because she should be if this has implications for these cases?  These cases may well be affected by the legislation we are putting through.  <\/p> <p> The most serious issue is whether investigations and prosecutions come to a shuddering halt because of further action in the Court of Justice of the European Union.  That would be a very worrying issue.  I also want to make reference to the actual basis of this Bill.  A number of real concerns have been expressed.  One concerns the legal requirement on the Minister and the Department to produce a written data protection impact assessment.  At a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice last week, I asked Department officials whether this was a legal requirement because that is the legal advice I was given.  An official said he would check that so the Minister might be able to indicate to us whether there is an actual legal requirement on her to produce a data protection impact assessment.  I think we want to be very clear that we are not producing legislation that will be subject to challenge immediately and because of the way it has been handled here, be referred for scrutiny to the Supreme Court.  <\/p> <p> I have a question for the Minister that I put to her officials last Thursday.  Is she satisfied that it is adequate and appropriate to give this type of notice on such fundamental legislation, which will have implications for the industry, every citizen in the country with mobile data and prosecuting authorities?  Is is appropriate that such little time and notice was given to the Data Protection Commissioner?  There was no regard to the Data Protection Commissioner's views on the final draft of the Bill because the Bill was published before the commissioner had a chance to scrutinise the detail of it and there was no opportunity for the commissioner to come back to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice.  Unfortunately, the committee divided along Government and Opposition lines, which has never happened in any pre-legislative scrutiny in which I have been involved, because we were not finished.  We did not get a chance to hear all the views we wanted to hear.  We did not get a chance to hear or even receive a submission from some organisations that would have liked to have had an oral and a written submission.  This is not good enough with regard to matters of this level of importance.<\/p> <p> We have a very truncated debate tonight.  We will have no detailed scrutiny because we will have 45 minutes tomorrow to go through every element of the Bill.  We will not be able to amend any of the substance of the Bill tomorrow.  The Minister is working on consolidated legislation and said she will have the general scheme before the end of this year and the Bill presented to the D&aacute;il within the next 12 months.  Will she agree to put a sunset clause into the Bill tomorrow?  As flawed as the process has been, I understand the pressure she is under in terms of cases that are before the courts that we will not reference and wants this legislation enacted with great expedition to give some assurance and clarity to the prosecuting authorities.  Will she agree to accept the amendment tomorrow or draft her own amendment to provide for a sunset clause so that we will tell everybody concerned, including the platforms, which will have to prepare for this, that this is a temporary measure until the overarching consolidation Bill comes before these Houses in the next 12 months and we have the real time to go through it in detail, hear the views of everybody and get the balance, which is a tricky and difficult one, right to ensure we do not tie the hands of prosecuting authorities behind their backs regarding the prosecution and investigation of serious crime and that we afford the highest protections to all our citizens, who have an entitlement under the European e-privacy directive to go about their business without being subject to mass surveillance because that would cause great anxiety and disquiet among our people?  It would go some way towards addressing some of our concerns if at least a sunset clause element was accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500029#FF00700","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657041300,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I have also tabled an amendment seeking a sunset clause.  I think there are probably several of them.  If the general scheme is to supersede this legislation and other legislation, I would have thought it would be self-evident that a sunset clause would be a safeguard, which would be the minimum we would expect.  It needs to be stated very clearly that if this Bill passes, we will be making mistakes.  Many mistakes with this legislation can be foreseen and I will come back to those issues later but there will inevitably be mistakes in this Bill we will not see coming.<\/p> <p>Yet, the shorter duration there is for this Bill, the less likely it is to manifest itself on a constant basis.<\/p> <p> I will reiterate the point on scrutiny.  This is not the way to do legislation.  There has been no oversight of this Bill.  That is not the fault of justice committee.  It is not the fault of the Data Protection Commission, DPC, which did its level best within the time allowed.  Truthfully, it has been shouting into the wind.  The way the Department of Justice has handled the introduction of this legislation makes a mockery of the concept of oversight.  There is no oversight.<\/p> <p> Following the 2016 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, it was clear that the way we were retaining data in Ireland was a complete breach of European law.  In 2017, the Murray report found that the original 2011 Act amounted to the illegal mass surveillance of virtually the entire population of Ireland.  A vast amount of private communications information is retained without the knowledge or consent of the people on whom it is being retained.  The data shows who we speak to, where we are going and what we are interested in.<\/p> <p> The Murray report also made a number of clear recommendations on how we should bring ourselves into line with the law.  Those recommendations are not reflected in this Bill.  In 2017, the justice committee conducted pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the 2017 draft Bill.  It made a number of recommendations on how to bring the legislation in line with the law.  Those recommendations are not reflected in this Bill.<\/p> <p> After five years of successive Ministers for Justice essentially sitting on their hands, we are now in a position where emergency legislation is required.  This Bill has been fast tracked through both Houses on the basis that it is an emergency.  However, it is an emergency of both this Government's and the last Government's making.  <\/p> <p> This time around the Minister requested a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny, attempting to circumvent the scrutiny of legislation that will affect the rights of every person in this State.  That was not granted.  Yet, from the Department&rsquo;s point of view, it may as well have never happened, because nothing that was said at the meeting was reflected in the legislation.  It was never going to be.  The Bill was published last Friday, a day after the pre-legislative scrutiny.  Committee and Report Stages are scheduled for tomorrow.  There is clearly no intention to take on board the serious concerns raised by Members of this House.  <\/p> <p> It is concerning to see the disregard for the Data Protection Commissioner's role in being mandatorily consulted by the Minister for Justice under section 84(12) of the Data Protection Act 2018 - that is my reading of it - on any proposal for a legislative matter that relates to the processing of personal data.  The Minister might confirm that. <\/p> <p> The deputy Commissioner for Data Protection, Dale Sunderland, told the justice committee last Thursday that the DPC had received the general scheme of the Bill only eight days earlier.  It had not yet submitted its observation to the Department, because the Department had advised that there were significant updates to be made.  The DPC received an updated copy less than 24 hours before appearing before the justice committee and less than 48 hours before the Bill was published.  The DPC had to brief the committee on its feedback on the general scheme which, at that point, was already outdated.  It did not have enough time to prepare a response to the updated Bill.  This is ridiculous stuff.  This is the kind of thing that happens.  We can pick the dates every year on which we are going to see this kind of thing.  It tends to be two or three weeks before the summer recess, or just before the Christmas recess.  It is almost like a management tool to get Bills that are unpopular or dangerous through at breakneck speed.<\/p> <p> There was no meaningful consultation with the DPC at all.  Sending it the Bill in advance is not consultation.  This is a dangerous lack of oversight on this Bill relating to the State&rsquo;s continued operation of the clearly illegal power for years after it was made known.  It is damaging the rule of law.  It is undermining prosecutions that can be thrown out on appeal because of the manner in which State has retained the information.<\/p> <p> The Government has admitted that this Bill is not adequate.  Another Bill will follow later this year.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the processes surrounding that Bill are sound, that stakeholders will be consulted and that recommendations from the Murray report and the justice committee are taken into account.  We need to get an assurance from the Minister that that is how this will be handled when the general scheme comes before the committee and this House.<\/p> <p> For this reason, I have submitted an amendment, as have others, in relation to the sunset clause.  This is to ensure that the revision of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 is done in a timely manner.  This Bill does not scratch the surface of what needs to be done in order to bring the data retention systems in line with EU law.  It does not provide an explicit exemption for journalists, clear oversight mechanisms or compensation to persons whose rights have been violated.  Critically, it does not ensure that prosecutions against criminal groups through the use of this data will not be thrown out on appeal.  I say this because data that has been collected under this Bill will still be improperly collected.<\/p> <p> Under the new section 3(a), one-year data retention orders are given out in all cases.  This is completely against the ruling by CJEU that the duration of each data retention measure cannot be systemic in nature and that it must be limited in time to what is strictly necessary.  Data retention orders need to be assessed individually.  This system of blanket one-year retention orders that can be renewed indefinitely is completely out of line with EU law.<\/p> <p> When it comes to the need to retain data for national security reasons, this Bill leaves out one fundamental detail, which is the definition of &ldquo;national security&rdquo;.  By including a broad and undefined term, such as &ldquo;national security&rdquo;, the Bill again falls short of the court&rsquo;s requirement of proportionality.  It is clear under the European law that the legislation we adopt on data retention must have clear and precise rules governing the scope and the application of the data retention measures.  It must be limited to what is strictly necessary.  By not defining which events or acts constitute a threat to national security, we are granting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na an almost unlimited degree of discretion to determine what is threat to national security and whether that threat is serious enough to justify secret surveillance of individuals or groups.  That situation is rife to abuse.<\/p> <p> The Murray review was originally commissioned on the back of a discovery that Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, had obtained the phone records of two journalists without their knowledge or consent as part of a criminal inquiry into a third party.  It is, therefore, hard to comprehend why this Bill, five years on, fails to provide for the protection of journalists&rsquo; sources.  It is a requirement under the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, that surveillance that is aimed at identifying journalistic sources must go through a heightened screening process, including prior independent judicial approval, before any information that could identify a source is handed over, regardless of how urgent a situation is deemed to be.<\/p> <p> The oversight mechanisms in this Bill are simply not up to scratch.  The ECHR requires that all surveillance measures must operate under objective supervisory bodies that are completely independent of the authorities carrying out the surveillance and that they must have sufficient powers and competence to exercise effective and continuous control.  Instead, we have a proposal for a designated judge who has no technical or legal expertise in the area of data protection, who has no administrative support, who has no power to suspend illegal surveillance, and who will only carry out this function on a part-time basis, once a year. <\/p> <p> The Murray review found that there should be an appropriate judicial remedy for breaches of rights under a data retention system.<\/p> <p>This is not included in the Bill.  I have overall concerns that this Bill attempts to retrospectively validate the illegal retention of data contrary to EU law.  Section 9 requires providers to continue to retain data that it is acknowledged is currently being held illegally.  By doing so, it is retrospectively validating the illegal retention of data.<\/p> <p> I understand there are a number of cases still come in relation to the retention of data under the 2011 Act, including one by Digital Rights Ireland, which also made a complaint to the Data Protection Commission, DPC, seeking it to take enforcement action against providers requiring them to delete data that has been retained illegally.  Has the Attorney General given advice as to how this will not come into conflict with the Sinn F&eacute;in funds principle, which found that the State cannot legislate to determine something that is currently before the courts?  It would also undermine the independence of the DPC by interfering with the power to act in relation to the pending complaint, contrary to Article 52 of general data protection regulation, GDPR.<\/p> <p> The DPC has raised significant concerns with this legislation.  It is simply not acceptable for the Department to have completely bypassed the DPC in the drafting of this Bill.  In light of what it deems to be high risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects under this Bill, the DPC stated very clearly that the Department should have conducted, and should still conduct, a data protection impact assessment with regard to the processing and provisions proposed.  It is absolutely fundamental that this happens prior to the drafting of new legislation later this year, especially if the Government intends to retain the processes outlined in this Bill.  The Minister might respond on her intention in that regard.<\/p> <p> My final concern with regard to this Bill are the offences contained for service providers that do not comply with the legislation.  It creates both a 72-hour and 90-day obligation on service providers, which are subject to a threat of sanction or offence if not complied with.  The list of offences includes fines of up to &euro;500,000 and five years' imprisonment.  All of this was not communicated to service providers prior to the publication of the general scheme.  They should have been consulted in advance to determine whether it was possible for the telecommunication companies to comply with the legislation within that tight timeframe.  From Three's submission to the Joint Committee on Justice, it is quite clear that it cannot.  Given that the Bill contains additional specified categories of data that need to be preserved, Three estimated it would take it between 12 to 18 months to set up the necessary IT projects.  Presumably, the new legislation will be in place within that timeframe, which could very well contradict this Bill.  Service providers need assurance that they will not face the threat of criminal sanction for non-compliance when there is simply no way they could comply at all.  They also need assurances that they will not be spending money on new IT infrastructure, which they will have to scrap within a year when it is determined that this legislation does not actually conform to EU law.<\/p> <p> There are serious concerns with the way the State collects data.  It is illegal and infringes the rights of every single person in the State.  I do not see any way in which this Bill remedies that situation.  However, I see several where it actually makes matters worse.  I have absolutely no doubt that we will be in this Chamber in a number of months correcting the mistakes in this legislation and it will have been an absolute waste of everyone's time and effort.  I ask the Minister to introduce this sunset clause.  That is the very minimum we should expect.  Very often, there is a presumption that domestic law trumps EU law in all situations and that is not the case.  Our Data Protection Commissioner has a particularly important role given where we are positioned in terms of how the office of the Data Protection Commission relates to other jurisdictions across Europe.  I really think we are treating that office which a great deal of disrespect.  It is not just disrespect but contempt in terms of not including it in the process by merely sending it a copy of the Bill and that being taken as consultation.  It is just not good enough.  There is no doubt that mistakes will be made, of which we will see the result before the new Bill appears before us.  Hopefully, that will come sooner rather than later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500030#GG00200","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657042500,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I will jump ahead because no speakers from any of the ensuing slots are present in the Chamber.

I am genuinely perplexed because I do not know whether it is right or wrong - there is good and bad in every situation.  In early June, the Government approved the drafting of the Bill, which is aimed at addressing the impact of recent judgments from the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, which I have often commended and complimented.  I said people had to go to Europe to get justice on many issues when they could not get justice in this country.<\/p>  <p>  This is a rather troubling case, however.  In the case taken by convicted murderer, Mr. Graham Dwyer, the CJEU ruled that EU law precluded the general and indiscriminate retention of electronic, traffic and location data to combat serious crime.  That kind of worries me because serious crime is just that and murder is the most serious of all.  Everyone is entitled to a fair trial and a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The indiscriminate use of data for other issues is a completely different area, however.  That is happening.  All kinds of information is being kept on individuals and ordinary peace-abiding people.<\/p>  <p>  The Communications (Retention of Data) (Amendment) Bill 2022 will allow the general and indiscriminate retention of communication, traffic and location data only on national security grounds and where approved by a designated judge.  Far be it from me to criticise any judge but it is kind of troubling.  The Bill also sets up a system of preservation orders and production orders.  These will facilitate the preservation of and access to specified data held by service providers for both national security and the investigation of serious crime where permitted by an authorising judge.  The preservation order will access the quick freeze, requiring service providers to retain specified data they hold at a particular point in time for a period.  A production order will allow access to specified data held by a service provider for commercial or other reasons where such access is necessary for national security and law enforcement.  Therein lie the grey areas as far as I am concerned.<\/p>  <p>  I have worries about this being challenged.  Again, this is rushed legislation.  In my opinion, any rushed legislation, although not all of it, can obviously lead to flaws.  As we would with any legislation, I would like to see an impact assessment after a finite period to see how it has it bedded in and whether it has been functional, practical and, above all else, fair.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice said the urgency of the Bill was unavoidable given the need for legal certainty for communications companies and State agencies.  Certainly, I agree with that.  In addition to this urgent Bill, the Minister intends to bring forward a more comprehensive proposal later in the year to address wider reforms and a more transparent legal framework in this area.  The Department of Justice said the proposed changes were without prejudice to the State's current appeal to the Supreme Court of a High Court ruling on the Act.  It is a kind of like the saying, live horse and you will get grass.<\/p> <p>I know it is urgent and I know the reasons, but why is it so urgent in the second last week of a term?  Why is the Minister going to bring forward more robust legislation?  She tells us she will, and this is not a personal criticism but a criticism of the system.  Will we have a different legislative measure, will it be more robust and will it weed out the chaff from the oats as regards retention of data?  They are being retained and are being used, and misused in many cases.  I agree that where there is serious crime we must try to get a balance whereby we would retain data for that area.  However, as I said, I often encourage people to go to Europe to get justice when they do not get it here.  In this case, the Court of Justice of the European Union made a ruling and confirmed that EU law precludes the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data relating to electronic communications to combat serious crime.<\/p> <p> We passed the introduction of electronic tagging, for which I advocated for years as it would cut down on an enormous amount of Garda time.  I do not know if it is being used at all.  We are very slow here to embrace and engage with things that are done in other jurisdictions.  We say we will and we have great aspirations, but the aspirations do not normally deliver, although it is great to believe in them.<\/p> <p> I have concerns about this Bill.  I have concerns about any rushed legislation and more about this.  I have a very open mind on this but the real criticism is that, as we pointed out today on the Order of Business, five legislative measures are being rushed through without proper scrutiny and debate.  It does not augur well for a democratic parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500032#JJ00300","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657043100,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I will not take much time.  We read that EU law precludes national legislative measures which provide, as a preventative measure, for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data relating to electronic communications to combat serious crime.  What we are really talking about here is the Graham Dwyer case.  He was convicted in this country with all the means, and I believe rightfully, that the Garda used.  We must ensure that the Garda will be able to do its job into the future to convict murderers, drug lords and serious villains, and ensure that we assist the Garda in every way we can as legislators.<\/p>  <p>  There is the problem, however, of seeking to retain data from innocent people.  I have a serious problem with one matter.  People come to me every day who are seeking to renew their driver licence.  They are asked for their public services card number.  Many elderly people do not have that number.  When they go to renew their licence after ten years they might have to travel long distances to Tralee to do so.  Then they are asked for their public services card number.  I do not see the need for that when the service already has a personal public service, PPS, number and a date of birth and the people were already licensed.  I do not know why anyone needs those data.  We were told in the D&aacute;il that this was actually illegal, and we had some type of agreement or understanding passed in the House that the card was not necessary for such things.  The people who operate this service are in a private company that won a tender from the State.  They are operating this service and we do not know what they are doing with those data or why they should have them.  They already have a PPS number, the date of birth and the old licence number, so I cannot understand what that is about.<\/p>  <p>  What I want to get across here is that we must do everything we can to ensure that whatever avenues are available to the Garda are utilised to the utmost to ensure the conviction of somebody like Graham Dwyer.  We applaud the Garda for bringing him to justice for what he did to a lady who was doing no harm to anybody.  At the same time, we must have a distinct difference.  I cannot understand why we need to retain data in many other instances involving innocent people.  This Bill is being rushed and we need more discussion.  I am amazed that many of the Government speaking slots were not taken up in this debate.  We appreciate that the Minister is here, but there were other speakers from the Government parties and they have not shown up at all.  We need to have a full debate on the totality of this.  It is very serious and necessary on one point to deal with the likes of Graham Dwyer, but it must be fair and avoid the unnecessary retention of data concerning innocent people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500033#KK00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1657043100,"counter":216,"content":"<p>The amending of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 to ensure compliance with the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the area of general and indiscriminate retention of communications data for national security and law enforcement purposes is very important.

It is not just that it is a mobile telephone, but the fact that it is a computer.  The Minister knows this because it has been raised with her on numerous occasions.  When a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is respectfully going about his or her duty and wishes to pull in somebody for questioning, as he or she is perfectly entitled to do, how many times does it happen that the person the garda is questioning takes the telephone out and records the garda?  Two seconds later that can be up on YouTube.  The Minister knows how non-factual that can be.  A garda can be asking the questions in a very respectful and proper way, but the angle of the telephone, the interpretation of what the garda is doing, the garda's gestures and the way the garda is standing near the person can be misconstrued when it is put up on YouTube.  The garda can be ridiculed and made to look bad when the garda is doing nothing other than his or her job.  It is very important for us as legislators to think about things like that and to think about protecting the garda&iacute; when they are going about their jobs.<\/p> <p>For instance, the use and putting up of things like that has to be looked at.  We are not trying to silence people or do anything wrong.  We are trying to make sure wrong is not done to the very people who are trying to do things right in trying to keep law and order, which can sometimes be difficult and onerous.  We are going in the right direction as regards this Bill.  We have to take note of what happened in the landmark Graham Dwyer case, its ramifications and its potential ramifications for future cases.  However, I ask the Minister to look at the bigger picture and all the other aspects of the type of issues I have raised.  One is the fact that members of the Garda will tell you that the whole idea of everyone going around with a computer in their pockets has posed difficulties for them in carrying out their work in an effective and fair way.  I would like the Minister to look at that matter.<\/p> <p> I wish An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na well in solving many of the undetected crimes.  The Minister is well aware of this new technology - I believe it will be used in the Sophie Toscan du Plantier case - of the deep reclaiming of DNA.  Whereas previously DNA was swiped from a surface, there is now technology that can go deep into the pores of any surface and pull out DNA that might have been hidden and missed in initial investigations.  It is hoped that will be used to good effect in the west Cork case.  I hope it will.  It might give us a lot of answers we have not got for a number of decades now.  That is just that case which is, of course, very important.  That technology has been perfected and is being used to solve many cases in America over the past year and a half, in particular.  It has solved cases that had people perplexed.  I hope that it will be used in some of our cases that have been there for a long time now, going back more than 30 years, including unsolved murders and disappearances such as, for example, the Philip Cairns case and many others.  Families were left without answers because their loved relatives, children, wives, husbands, sons and daughters, disappeared or were murdered and found.  These families were left with nothing but questions afterwards.  I hope that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will start using that technology here and will use it to good effect.  Every case that can be closed will bring a conclusion for those families.  There are people who are working on cold cases, and going back over these cases for many years, who would dearly wish to bring them to a successful conclusion.  I hope that technology is something the Minister will pursue during her term to make sure it will be used to good effect here. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500033#KK00300","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657043700,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Connolly.  I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Joint Committee on Justice, of which I am a member, conducted pre-legislative scrutiny on this legislation last Thursday.  Unfortunately, due to the ridiculously short timeline we were forced to work to, this scrutiny had no influence whatsoever on the legislation and the whole exercise was sadly and, quite frankly, pointless, even to the extent that during pre-legislative scrutiny the deadline was due to pass for the tabling of amendments to the Bill.  We had to adjourn the meeting to get that deadline waived in order that the meeting could continue, even though, apparently, the Bill cannot be published until the pre-legislative scrutiny is placed before the Minister, despite her not having to take any account of it.   That was the kind of fiasco of a process we went through last week.  It is sad because this is a Bill that could have done with a lot of pre-legislative scrutiny and a lot of taking on board of matters regarding it.  I will deal with that later in my contribution.<\/p>  <p>  I will point out that concerns regarding the rushed process of progressing this legislation came up time and time again during the committee meeting.  Members and witnesses present agreed that the rushed process and lack of mandatory consultation will lead to a Bill that is vulnerable to legal challenges.  When I raised concerns in the House last week about the consequences of rushing through legislation, I was wrongfully interrupted by the Chair at the time.  However, let me make clear that I am not the only one who has spoken out against the ridiculous rushing through of legislation.  The Bill Digest produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service states that due to the timeframe between publication of recent Bills and the Second Stage debate, it is not possible for it to consider all relevant issues.  We have countless stakeholders telling us the exact same thing, yet we are supposed to give this Bill proper consideration and come to the House to rubber-stamp it for the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties published a graph showing the number of Bills enacted per month.  It showed how the number of Bills passed by the Oireachtas increased shockingly before the recess, with this year being the worst yet.  Some 19 Bills will be passed this month.  The average for every month other than this is approximately two Bills.  That shows what the Government's attitude is to the recess, and to proper legislative oversight and consideration.  It may be that officials in the Department use the summer recess as a false deadline and think they have to get Bills finished by the recess, and rushed through and so on, but that is wrong.   It means we do not get proper scrutiny of legislation, which can be seen today.  A perfect example will be seen in the House tomorrow, when we will rush five Bills through Committee Stage in one day.  Ramming through legislation like this means that oversight suffers and unexamined legislation is allowed to pass without proper scrutiny.  Yet, we are told in the Chamber that we are not allowed to hold the Government to account over this.<\/p>  <p>  On this particular Bill, I strongly believe a sunset clause should have been included, given this legislation is supposed to be a temporary measure.  I am disappointed to see it has not been included, despite multiple calls to do so.  I tabled an amendment on a sunset clause, along with many other Members, which is vitally important in the context of being constantly told during pre-legislative scrutiny that this Bill will be superseded by the reviewed Bill that will come later on in the year.  However, there is no sunset clause or anything like it in the Bill.  It makes you wonder whether this Bill will be superseded at all.<\/p>  <p>  I will again voice my concerns regarding the fact there is no definition for the \"security of the State\" included in this legislation either, despite the fact the proposed new section 3A provides that the Minister may apply to a designated High Court judge for an order to retain data, where satisfied that \"a serious and genuine, present or foreseeable threat to the security of the State\" exists.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Digital Rights Ireland have also highlighted this.  It was said during pre-legislative scrutiny that this is not a requirement of law, but the European Court of Justice stated that legislation \"must indicate in what circumstances and under which conditions a measure providing for the processing of such data may be adopted, thereby ensuring that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary\".  The European Court of Human Rights, in a case involving Russia that is also relevant to Ireland, stated that where there is no definition of \"security of the State\", the authorities are left \"an almost unlimited [degree of] discretion in determining which events or acts constitute such a threat and whether the threat was serious enough to justify secret surveillance. ... [thereby creating] possibilities for abuse.\"  It was said before the committee last week that the Department would decide what \"security of the State\" is.  Therein lies the crux of the problem.  If it is down to the Department or Minister to decide what constitutes security of the State, that is a very arbitrary thing that will be at the whim of a Minister.  We should not have that in legislation that is so important.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed new section 3B goes on to provide that service providers must retain Internet source data for one year, or as prescribed by the Minister, from the date of first processing, where the Minister considers it necessary and proportionate for the purposes of safeguarding the security of the State.  It is very important to understand who determines what is a threat to the security of the State.  This cannot be left to interpretation and, despite continuously raising this, I am very disappointed to see that it has not been included in the final legislation.<\/p> <p>On top of this, it seems that this legislation could actually breach current data protection law, which requires a data protection impact assessment to be carried out where \"a type of processing, and in particular a type of processing using new technology, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals\".  According to a statement from the Data Protection Commission submitted to the committee during pre-legislative scrutiny, \"In light of the high risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects inherent in the processing envisaged in the General Scheme, the DPC is of the view that the Department should have and should conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment in relation to the processing and provisions proposed\".  It is clear that there has not been adequate time for consultation and proper impact assessments to be conducted, which has led to this incredibly weak legislation.<\/p> <p> Section 5 of the Bill provides certain members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, the Revenue Commissioners and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission with the powers to access to user data retained by service providers without any judicial or independent oversight or review.  This seriously needs to be addressed going forward.  Without sufficient safeguards, there is potential for possible abuse.  We cannot allow that to happen.  The issue was raised by representatives of  Digital Rights Ireland at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, demonstrating why committee discussions are so important and should be given proper and full consideration when finalising legislation.  It is clearly the Government's view that scrutiny slows the legislative process but really, it is what creates strong legislation. We should prioritise passing legislation that is strong and fit for purpose, not legislation such as the Bill that is before us.  I absolutely oppose the legislation in its current form.  It is messy, incomplete and legally questionable.  It is important to note that Government approval for the drafting of the Bill was only given a month ago, despite previous indications that legislation in the area was problematic.  Regardless of this, the legislation was then shockingly dumped on the committee only a fortnight before recess.  <\/p> <p> The Bill in no way achieves what it aims to do.  The rushed progression of the legislation means that citizens' rights are not being properly considered.  I strongly urge the Government to delay this legislation until after the recess in order to let us consider it properly.   The legislation is far too important to be rushed through within days.  I also urge the Government to ensure that the same mistake is not made with the proposed revision of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 later this year.  Legislation should include wider and more thorough engagement with stakeholders than was allowed for this legislation.  We must ensure that finalised legislation is robust and can withstand legal challenges.  In doing so, we can provide a good service to all the citizens of Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500034#LL00200","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657044300,"counter":220,"content":"<p>T&aacute; fadhbanna l&aacute;idre agam maidir leis an mBille seo.

N&iacute;l an c&uacute;lra tugtha ag an Aire, go h&aacute;irid &oacute; thaobh na tuarasc&aacute;la &oacute;n iar-bhreitheamh, Mr. Justice John L. Murray, a foils&iacute;odh in 2017.

That is so far removed from the truth that I must put it on the record.  It is appalling spin.  We are faced with legislation that is extremely difficult for anyone considering it.  I have been given a sample of the papers that Deputies are expected to go through for one item of legislation.  I cannot recall how many papers we were given for this Bill.  Perhaps Deputy Pringle can tell me.  We may have been given 15 papers on it this week.  I am not sure what the figure is.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for her speech and the copy provided to us.  I appreciate that the Minister is being put in a difficult position once again.  I am not a member of the justice committee, so I am reliant on the documents that I get after each meeting.  The Minister's speech today and the brief provided by the Department to the Oireachtas committee utterly failed to mention the background to this legislation.  I will not mention the name of the man who is currently in prison and is waiting on the outcome of his appeal and the civil action.  To me, it is not relevant.  What is relevant here is that the 2011 Act is not valid because it is based on a directive that is not valid.  The Government and the EU have known that for a long time.  The directive was brought in back in 2006.  We took another few years to introduce implementing legislation in 2011.  In 2014, the directive was ruled by a court to be invalid in a case taken by Digital Rights Ireland.  We have a legislation that is currently in force and which is based on a directive that has been found to be invalid.  We have known that since 2014.  In April 2017, Mr. Justice John L. Murray produced a very detailed report entitled the Review of the Law on the Retention of and Access to Communications Data.  There are almost 200 pages in the overview.  The review also contains a summary of the main recommendations and a postscript.  Mr. Justice Murray was asked to examine the statutory framework of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011.  According to the review, the statutory framework of the 2011 Act &quot;establishes a form of mass surveillance of virtually the entire population of the State&quot;.  The 2011 framework, under which the Government is still operating and to which it is making patchy amendments this week, allows for the establishment of &quot;a form of mass surveillance of virtually the entire population of the State involving the retention and storage of historic data, other than actual content&quot;.  In the review, Mr. Justice Murray notes that the data retained under the legislative framework provide not just a snapshot of information in time, but a whole historical picture.  He states: &quot;The private information thus retained by Service Providers is not a snapshot of information concerning a particular communication or recent communications but constitutes an historical record of all communication over a lengthy period.&quot;  Mr. Justice Murray also refers to the &quot;anodyne&quot; term &quot;data&quot;, which means a lot more that what it seems to mean.  In the review, points are made about a lack of sufficient safeguards and oversight.  I do not have the time to go into all the detail.  It is all set out in the review, which was published in April 2017.  Significantly, nobody from the Department of Justice has even referenced the report or pointed out its findings and recommendations.  In the postscript of the review, Mr. Justice Murray goes so far as stating:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAs has been demonstrated in the course of reviewing the provisions of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011, the Review has felt bound to conclude that many of the features of the data retention scheme established by the Act are precluded by EU law.  Accordingly, it is recommended that consideration be given to the extent that, if at all, statutory bodies should, as a matter of policy, continue to access retained communications data [and so on]. <\/blockquote>  <p>I counted 43 paragraphs in the summary and main recommendations of the review.  Most of them are recommendations highlighting what should be done.  No reference has been made to them by the Department.  <\/p><p>The EU judgment, the European Court of Human Rights and the UN have also highlighted serious issues with the mass retention of documents and the mass surveillance of people.  The question must be asked as to why we are acting now in this rushed manner, as a result of the appeal that is pending.  We know what the outcome of that will be, really.  Why was action not taken before this?  The Library and Research Service was to publish the Bill digest today but stated that it did not have enough time to do so.  We utterly depend on the Bill digest if we are not members of the Oireachtas committee.  We are also dependent on the committee to do its work.  I have not seen a single Government backbencher, whether a member of the committee or not, come to the House to take the opportunity to discuss this very serious Bill.  That is significant.  I note that the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice wrote to the Minister on 30 June, setting out the serious concerns of the committee on the matter.  The committee recommended that the legislation should include a sunset clause and that there be better consultation with stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>It also recommended that a certain category of citizens, such as journalists, should be given separate rights under the Bill.  That is serious because that Murray report arose from GSOC taking information from journalists under the 2011 Act.<\/p> <p> I have another case on my desk in respect of which the Court of Appeal finally saw sense regarding what had happened in the District Court and the High Court in the context of a warrant to take a journalist's phone.  Right up to today, we have garda&iacute; going into court seeking warrants to take phones without even outlining that the matters involved relate to journalists and their sources.  Why am I saying that?  I am saying it because we have good garda&iacute; who we cannot do without but we have seen over and over that any system, including the Garda, which is an institution - just like the Houses of the Oireachtas is - needs oversight and built-in protection.  That has been said repeatedly in different spheres and it has been said repeatedly by the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Human Rights and the UN bodies.<\/p> <p> We are bringing in a Bill that is piecemeal and inadequate.  The Data Protection Commission is highlighting its concerns, the most basic of which is that a data protective impact assessment be carried out.  Has it been carried out?  Nobody seems to know.  As a result, we are making a presumption that it has not been.  I do not have a copy of it.  I do not know where it is and I am being asked to comment on it and vote in favour of this Bill.  Then we have the ICCL under extreme pressure and highlighting its concerns, which are set out in a number of pages.  Its main concerns, which it has kindly summarised for us, include that the Bill will permit rolling one-year renewable data retention, which in effect is indefinite retention.  I realise that the Government amendments are improving the situation in that there was a two-year retention period.  The Government is improving the position with just one year, but that is a rolling retention depending on the circumstances.  The Bill fails to provide any definition of \"national security\".  Complete discretion is provided to any Government to do what it wants under the heading of national security.  The Bill fails to provide for the protection of journalist's sources, which is particularly significant given the background to the Murray report, as I mentioned, and the recent case that ended up in the Court of Appeal.  The Bill fails to provide an adequate oversight mechanism and there is no judicial remedy for a breach of the powers in the Bill.  The Bill attempts to retrospectively validate illegal data retention, which is contrary to EU law.  The Bill also attempts to interfere with the independence of the court in data protection.<\/p> <p> I could say much more but what I really want to get out are my concerns at the way this is being forced through the D&aacute;il.  The blame is being laid at the Opposition's door as opposed to the Government putting its hands up and admitting that it has known for a long time that the directive was invalidated way back in 2014.  The Government also knows from Mr. Justice Murray's report about the serious issues that should have been looked at then and it knows from the case law, including: the Digital Rights Ireland case; the Tele2 Sverige case, which superseded that one; and the other cases that have been mentioned.<\/p> <p> The Minister is here with an inherited situation.  When you inherit a situation, however, at some point you have to say \"Stop\".  We have to do this differently.  We have had mass surveillance with no oversight or protection on the books since 2011 and we have had no safeguards on how that was retained, which country it was retained in and whether it has been retained in Ireland, England or non-EU countries.  What about the destruction of the data?  What happened when the two-year period was up?  Nothing happened except one piece of oversight by a judge once per year, which was retrospective.  Nothing else was built in and in this Bill we are building in some protection on a very limited basis.  We are also bringing in extraordinary penalties for service providers.  I would normally be critical of service providers, but in this situation they are being presented with a difficult transition period with no concept of what they are facing.  I thank the Acting Chairman for indulging me.  I went over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500035#MM00200","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657044900,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I thank colleagues for contributing to the debate.  There is nobody to blame here.  I am not trying to lay the blame on anyone, certainly not on the Joint Committee on Justice.  We are introducing emergency legislation.  I appreciate that there is concern and annoyance at the timeframe in which this has been brought forward, but emergency legislation often has to be brought forward quickly.  Anyone who knows about the work I have done in the Department in setting out my justice plans for 2021 and 2022 knows that I have clear timelines and targets.  Introducing emergency legislation means that teams have to be taken off legislation that is in the current plan in order to ensure that this can be done on time and to be able to respond, in most instances, to judicial rulings.  This is not ideal for anybody and it is not the way I like to bring forward legislation, but this is emergency legislation responding to a Court of Justice ruling.<\/p>  <p>  Some may say that this is something we could have predicted.  If people look at the timelines, however, they will see that we had the general scheme of a Bill done in the period 2017 to 2019 and that this was put on hold because of the significant case to which we have all referred .  This was before my time.  When I came into the Department, I upheld the decision to wait until those rulings passed through.  There have since been a number of judgments that have involved changes, the most recent of which was in October 2020.  We had the ruling of the Court of Justice on 5 April.  Subsequently, on 25 May, through a case management hearing, we received legal advice to say that the Supreme Court would most likely row in behind this and not change the ruling.  Within a week, I had presented an outline of the Bill to the Cabinet.  I have brought it through as quickly as possible.  While Members may say that we could have responded to this quicker, it was important, because we had a number of different judgments involving changes, that we got this right.  We have colleagues in France, Belgium, Denmark and other places where they have introduced legislation in recent years that has to be changed now.  We have tried to do this right.<\/p>  <p>  On the timing, I cannot dictate when the European courts and the Supreme Court will meet.  We have to respond to the timelines we have and it is unfortunate that these timeframes are coming into sharp focus with the end of the D&aacute;il session.  It is important, for many reasons, that we introduce this legislation, not least that if we hold off until September we will potentially have two months where we have a certain section of the 2011 Act that will fall, while other parts of it will be extremely fragile.  What we have been asked for, not just by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also by the service providers, which many colleagues have mentioned, is certainty.  I was written to by IBEC and we were engaged by many providers to say that they need certainty in order that they know the data that they have on hold is being held legally and in compliance with legislation.  Otherwise, there is a risk that they would just get rid of all of that data, which may have implications for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in fighting crime and in security matters.  There is a significant overlap there.  As a result, we are doing this to make sure there is certainty, not just for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also for our colleagues, including those commercial entities, platforms and operators.  We are not asking them to retain data that they do not already retain.  We have made a point of using existing terms in the Act to try to make sure there is limited disruption in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  A number of speakers referred to me engaging with my colleagues at EU level  At our last meeting in Luxembourg, during a discussion at lunch, which was a separate but similar discussion, I raised this directly with Commissioner Didier Reynders and was supported by a number of colleagues who all feel that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the relevant police services should not have their hands tied behind their backs in fighting crime, and that we need to do more.  However, the problem does not relate to measures being enacted at EU level; it is European court rulings that are having the impact here, as well as how the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is being interpreted, which is the biggest challenge.  We will continue to have those discussions at EU level and I will continue to engage with colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  On the Data Protection Commission, it is an obligation in respect of data protection impact assessments that the data controller would carry out the data impact assessment prior to introducing new data processing activities, which is provided for under section 84 of the Data Protection Act 2018.  In this instance, the Minister for Justice is not the data controller under the Bill.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any other bodies that will be accessing data are data controllers and so they will carry out the necessary data protection impact assessments prior to the commencement of processing under the new provisions.<\/p> <p>The law can be enacted but they will have to ensure they provide the data protection impact assessment before this is used or any system is put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Separate to that, there is an obligation on my Department to consult the Data Protection Commission under section 84(12).  We are doing that, the process is ongoing and we will continue to engage with the commission.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the timing is not perfect for anybody but this is emergency legislation and we tried to make sure it was introduced in the best way possible.  I confirm and commit that when the general scheme of the broader Bill is published later this year, there will be full engagement with the justice committee and colleagues.  There will be full scrutiny and we will progress in a way that is perhaps not as fast as we have done in this instance.<\/p> <p> \"Security of the State\" is not defined and we do not define it.  It is not defined in the Offences against the State Acts.  We leave it to the courts to decide.  This has always been the case and that is why it is the case here.<\/p> <p> On journalists, that will be covered in guidance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before this is commenced.  There is a body of work to be done following on from the legislation and that will be put in place.<\/p> <p> On the sunset clause, we have been asked for certainty and by introducing such a clause we are not providing that certainty, particularly for service providers or platforms and for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I respectfully propose that tomorrow we do not have a sunset clause amendment on the basis that it does the opposite, does not provide certainty and it is less likely those who need to invest in their systems will do so if there is a possibility that it might change.<\/p> <p> I appreciate how quickly this has come through the House.  It is not the way I like to work.  Anytime we have brought legislation in this manner, it has been emergency legislation and generally because of a ruling from our courts.  We have had that a number of times in recent weeks.  It disrupts all our business and planned business but is important and necessary, particularly in terms of garda&iacute; and their work on national security, making sure the measures are in place for them, insofar as it is possible following the ruling, to be able to apply this when fighting crime or dealing with particular cases.<\/p> <p> This amendment allows for less data retention with greater oversight and oversight structures than we currently have in the 2011 Bill.  The report Deputy Connolly mentioned from Judge Murray made a number of recommendations and we are implementing two significant ones in this, one on judicial authorisation and the other on notification of data subject.  We are responding to that and to a number of other elements which have been proposed in recent years.  I look forward to further debate with colleagues tomorrow and thank all colleagues for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500036#NN00200","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657045500,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Back to School Costs: Motion [Private Members]","time":1657045500,"counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500037#OO00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1657045500,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:  \trecognises that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; the costs of returning to school each year cause enormous financial stress and pressure on parents, a fact likely to be exacerbated by the rising cost-of-living crisis;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; according to a survey undertaken by the Irish League of Credit Unions in 2021, 63 per cent of parents found covering back-to-school costs a significant financial burden, with 24 per cent of families getting into debt, and 21 per cent of families having debts of over &euro;500;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; according to the same survey, the average cost of sending a child to primary school is now &euro;1,186, and &euro;1,491 for a secondary school child; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a Barnardos survey in 2021 found that 50 per cent of parents said they were concerned about the cost of returning to school, and that 20 per cent of parents take out some form of loan to pay for school costs; <\/blockquote>notes that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; primary and post primary education in this State is intended to be &quot;free&quot; under the Constitution and in legislation, but that the reality is profoundly different;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the cost-of-living crisis continues to mount, with almost two thirds of parents saying they and their children had to go without essentials over the past six months due to cost of living increases, and 28 per cent having cut back or gone without heating;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; despite the fact that back-to-school costs have continued to increase in recent years, the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BTSCFA) is lower now than it was in 2007;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; primary and secondary schools remain profoundly underfunded, leading schools to request &quot;voluntary contributions&quot; and to fundraise simply to pay basic and essential bills, and that this situation is likely to be worse this year due to increased energy costs;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; this State is 75 years behind the North in introducing free school books, where it was introduced in 1947; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash;  the complete failure of the Minister for Education, Norma Foley, and the Minister of State, Josepha Madigan, to take any concrete action to tackle these costs within their Department; and <\/blockquote>therefore, calls on the Government to: <blockquote> \t&mdash; give the BTSCFA to middle income families by extending it to 500,000 additional children;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; increase the BTSCFA by 50 per cent for those who already qualify;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; work towards abolishing voluntary contributions, by implementing the Education (Voluntary Contributions) Bill 2021, proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in, and by increasing capitation funding to schools;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; deliver a fully free school book scheme for all children, through increases in funding, to rapidly expand the availability of book rental schemes over a number of budgets;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; enact, without delay, the Education (Affordable School Uniforms) Bill introduced by Sinn F&eacute;in, to ensure all schools have a uniform policy that reduces costs for families; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; eliminate fees on the school transport scheme, beginning with a 20 per cent reduction next year, and provide seats for an additional 10,000 children. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>As the Minister knows, back-to-school costs are an enormous pressure on families in any year and one often hears organisations such as Barnardos, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Irish League of Credit Unions, as well as community welfare officers, talk about the enormously increased rate of calls they get from families who are really struggling.  That has been true the last few years but is doubly true this year.  We have a cost-of-living crisis that sees rents spiralling out of control, childcare costs like a second mortgage and food, fuel and electricity costs increasing.  On top of that, this year schools which are themselves under financial pressure will pass on some of those costs to families.  This week, last week and the week before the booklists, uniform lists and letters for voluntary contributions started coming in.  The scale of this can be considerable.  Many schools do their best to minimise the costs but if you have a child in primary school and two children in secondary schools, you could well be paying &euro;1,500.  I spoke to one mother in Cork last week, referred to by Deputy Doherty in Leaders' Questions last week, who faces costs of &euro;1,600, about &euro;500 or &euro;600 of which was in voluntary contributions.  That is enough to put any family under severe pressure and leave them questions about how they will pay the next bill and if they will go to the moneylender or credit union.  These are hard decisions.  Summer is supposed to be a time of respite and a break, particularly after the past two years, but can be a time of immense hardship.  I received an email from a woman in Dublin recently:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThis time of year is so so stressful and worse than I've ever felt.  I have an empty fridge, no heat, no car tax because I can&rsquo;t afford the arrears which just keep mounting up. I have been onto SVP a few times for help... My eldest is going into transition year.  The school asked for an additional &euro;100 to the standard registration fee for 4th year.  I have no idea how I am going to afford anything this year when I can barely make ends meet.  Every 2 weeks my mortgage is paid when my social welfare goes in leaving me with &euro;50 for the week. <\/blockquote>  <p>That is the reality for many families and not just at the lowest incomes but right into middle-income families and cutting across the State.  That is the reality we are contending with.  It has been Sinn F&eacute;in's position in recent days and weeks in launching our proposals that this could not wait until September.  These costs will have come and gone.  The Government's position until about two hours ago was this had to wait until the budget.  I am sure it is not by coincidence or quirk of calendar that the Minister has announced a set of proposals today.  I am glad the Government has started to listen and realised that it would not be fair or equitable to ask parents to wait until September for assistance when these costs are arising this week, next week and over the coming weeks.  It will force people to make very difficult decisions.<\/p><p>I welcome that the Government has taken on several of Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals.  We have been keen to ensure those on the lowest incomes get additional help.  The problem is there are many people who will not benefit from this.  The other part of Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals was ensuring that those who do not get any assistance would get some.  Under the Minister's proposal, if you have one child in school and a weekly income of &euro;621 you will not qualify for back-to-school allowance.  That is not a big income.  That is lower than the average industrial wage.  For all those families that are really struggling now and do not qualify, I am afraid the proposals do not address that, particularly if they do not avail of school transport.<\/p><p>The Government has started to listen at last and is not saying September any longer.  That was a ludicrous and unfair position in any event, and equally so outside of this debate.  The Minister needs to start listening to families who do not qualify.  They are under severe pressure and will be making decisions about bills, moneylenders, credit unions and all the rest of it.  I urge the Minister to implement what she has brought forward today.  I welcome it and it will help.  Those families looking on, watching the news and saying it might help them will find out in a week or two that they are not getting anything.  The Minister needs to do something about them.<\/p><p>Between now and September, I urge the Minister to go back to those talks with the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Humphreys, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and whoever and find a way to offer assistance to those families on &euro;621 per week who do not get anything.  They could be facing bills of over &euro;1,000.  That is not good enough.  We need more help for them.  I welcome what the Minister has taken on board from the Sinn F&eacute;in proposals and ask her to look at the remainder and give some assistance to those who are really struggling and do not qualify.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500037#OO00400","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1657046100,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Molaim an Teachta &Oacute; Laoghaire as an r&uacute;n seo a thabhairt chun tosaigh ar son Sinn F&eacute;in agus as an obair at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige chun an c&aacute;s seo a chur chun tosaigh le tamall fada anois.

There was a scramble of Ministers meeting with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to come up with a measure to counter what Sinn F&eacute;in is asking for.  We welcome any money going to families who are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis but let us be clear that this is not enough.

Sinn F&eacute;in proposes to put in place a significant package of &euro;161 million in cash payments.  I welcome the measures introduced today but they do not go far enough and will not deal with the situation facing a great many families.  We need to do simple things.  We need to give a back to school allowance to middle-income families with a household income of less than &euro;80,000, increase the back to school clothing and footwear allowance by 50% and work towards abolishing voluntary contributions.  Last year, I challenged a school that would not allow an application form for children to be processed unless a &euro;100 deposit was paid, which would be returned later.  That is wrong.  It puts pressure on parents at a very early stage.  As a parent of four children who have gone through school - three have also gone through college while the youngest looks forward to going in October - I know what it is like for the many parents who are trying to deal with the costs of children going to school.  Those back to school costs are an enormous issue every year as parents have to pay hundreds and often thousands on books, uniforms, the so-called voluntary contributions I have mentioned and many other things.  It is not just an issue for September and October but continues until the following summer.  That needs to be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste cast doubts on NGOs' data on the cost of children's return to school.  I would like him to withdraw that slur on the professionalism of these groups.  I am sure he will not be found wanting when it comes to cutting a ribbon or taking part in a photo opportunity with these groups.  It is important that he retracts the statement he made today.  In a 2021 survey, one of those groups, Barnardos, found that 50% of parents said they were concerned about the cost of the return to school and that 20% of parents take out some form of loan to pay school costs.  It is absolutely outrageous that a parent unable to pay these costs would have to take out a loan.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government has moved and that is very welcome.  Many people will be happy with that movement but there is a group of people, working families, who will get absolutely nothing and who will also struggle.  These are the ones going to the credit union or bank to try to get money to send their children to school or college.  That needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500038#PP00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1657046100,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I am glad the Minister has listened to my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, on this issue.  It is very clear.  Even the T&aacute;naiste said this morning that the last few days have been spent on this.  I welcome what it has bought.  It is an example of effective opposition.  I only wish the Government would listen more to what we and the Opposition more generally have to say with regard to alleviating the pressures on families.<\/p>  <p>  Families in Mayo are finding meeting back to school costs a struggle.  It is a struggle every year but, this year, these costs are pushing many over the edge.  Already coming through the door are book lists, uniform lists and letters regarding voluntary contributions.  Can the Minister imagine what it is like for the child in the classroom who cannot afford to go on the school tour to be asked for a voluntary contribution when the money is just not there?  Even though the family may be turning the heating off and reducing the amount of food they are eating, the money being demanded from them is just not there.  I want the Minister to understand and realise the damage that is done to children when they are forced into that situation.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome what the Minister has done today.  She did it under duress and pressure but families are under immense duress and pressure in trying to get an education for their children.  We have to remember that, under the Constitution, we are supposed to provide free education.  We have to get back to that.  This motion is an opportunity to give the back to school allowance to middle-income families, targeting those with household incomes of &euro;80,000 or less, because a great many families are locked out and cannot benefit from the back to school allowance.  It does not reflect the financial reality of people's households.  That is why we are proposing this motion, which would result in 500,000 additional children qualifying for the allowance.  It is crucially importantly that those families qualify and are given a break.  They are the families who work tirelessly and really hard to educate their children.  The proposal would also see a 50% increase for those already receiving the payment.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the announcement made with regard to school transport but it needs to apply for more than just this year.  It is scandalous that we charge families &euro;650 for their children to get on a school bus and that we deny many children across the State a seat on those buses because we label their places as concessionary.

After weeks and months of hearing that no action would be taken until the budget, it is welcome that some action has been taken.  It is clear that the Government listened to the proposals put forward by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, but the problem is that it did not listen to them fully and that a whole section of people are left behind.  Our proposals would mean 500,000 extra children being included.  That would mean that 75% of schoolgoing children would get that support.  That is the kind of action that is needed from Government and the kind of support that Galway families need now.

The facts speak for themselves.  We have record high inflation rate of over 9% which is racing towards breaking the 10% barrier.  Heavy food prices are also heading our way.  A local bakery in Wexford which supplies the region has increased its prices three times in the last 18 months.  It is now &euro;3.19 for a white sliced pan from the local bakery.<\/p> <p>This is a basic food item.  Flour has doubled in price while vegetable oil has tripled and yeast has increased by 30%.  There have also been huge increases in the cost of milk, eggs and buttermilk.  Twelve months ago, pasteurised egg cost &euro;1.20 per kg.  Today it costs &euro;2.40 per kg.  Butter is trading at &euro;7,500 per tonne.  Twelve months ago, it was &euro;3,380 per tonne.<\/p> <p> I raise these issues because they affect every single family in Ireland and are subsequently related to every family's school budget.  Something must be done now to help families, particularly with the back-to-school costs.  The basics must be covered.  Families on middle incomes, including those on incomes up to &euro;80,000, must be included in the back-to-school allowance.  Everyone in this House, including Government and Opposition Deputies, must take action now.  Working families are facing colossal energy bills this winter.  Electricity and gas bills have increased by 193% and 93%, respectively.  Unfortunately, there are more increases to come.  This motion is important because it would give an additional 500,000 children and their parents financial help at a time when critical intervention is most needed.  It would help hold back the tide and keep working families above the water line.  We are asking the Government to increase the back-to-school allowance by 50% for those who already qualify for it.  We are also asking it to enact Sinn F&eacute;in's Education (Affordable School Uniforms) Bill 2022.<\/p> <p> This realisation must sink in.  Immediate action must be forthcoming before the winter arrives.  The increase in the back-to-school allowance can and will make a difference to more than two thirds of children returning to school, as well as those enrolling for the first time this year.  It should be increased from &euro;160 to &euro;240 for children between four and 11 and from &euro;285 to &euro;427.50 for children over 12 years of age.  This package will make a huge difference and will help many families, including an additional 500,000 children and their families, with their back-to-school costs when they need it most.  I ask all Deputies to see the economic and social benefits this motion will bring to our young people and their parents and give help when it is needed.  I hope all Deputies will support this motion.

I commend my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on his work in bringing it forward.  Families across the State, and I have spoken with many in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, find back-to-school costs a huge burden every year.  However, this year it is more severe, with a cost-of-living crisis and continually spiralling fuel and food costs, as well as high rents and childcare costs to contend with.  Letters about the purchase of books and uniforms, as well as voluntary contributions, have started to arrive through doors already.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the initiatives the Government has already announced, including an increase in the back-to-school allowance, but I agree with my colleagues that the scheme must be extended to squeezed middle-income families, targeting those on a household income of &euro;80,000 or less.  This measure would ensure an additional 500,000 children would qualify for this support and would greatly ease the enormous pressure on their parents.  This is the squeezed middle, who do not qualify for anything.  They are just above the threshold for the medical card, housing supports and the back-to-school allowance.  This year, they really need a break.<\/p>  <p>  Something must also be done about the cost of schoolbooks.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government would work towards an entirely free schoolbook scheme for children.  While some schools have book rental arrangements in place, which reduce costs considerably, we need to go further and ensure children have access to free schoolbooks.  As a former teacher, I also believe something needs to be done about schoolbook publishers excessively revising their textbooks, forcing families to purchase books every few years.  This is entirely unnecessary.<\/p>  <p>  On school transport, I welcome the fact that fees have been dismissed for this year but we should go further.  We need to eliminate fees in the school transport system on a phased basis and provide seats for an additional 10,000 children.  Other countries offer free school transport.  Why can we not do it?<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in in government would also enact Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Education (Affordable School Uniforms) Bill 2022 straight away, alongside our Bill to abolish voluntary contributions, which can put families under pressure to fork out hundreds of euro every year.  Schools must be properly resourced so they are not relying on these voluntary contributions.

They need assistance immediately. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500039#QQ00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1657046700,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and his colleagues for tabling this motion.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to the House this evening on the important matter of back-to-school costs.  I appreciate that the cost of returning to school every autumn is a significant element and, indeed, burden, in every family&rsquo;s budget.  I am acutely aware of the matters raised in the motion concerning back-to-school costs, especially in the context of rising cost-of-living expenses generally.<\/p>  <p>  Equality of access and opportunity in education has always been a core principle for Fianna F&aacute;il and this Government and we recognise that reducing costs is an intrinsic part of this ambition.  Earlier today, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Social Protection and I announced a package worth &euro;67 million to support parents and students in their return to school.  This package cuts across an array of services and needs, including the elimination of all fees on the school transport scheme, a &euro;100 increase in the back-to-school allowance, and the expansion of the school meals programme to almost 60,000 more students.<\/p>  <p>  The school transport scheme and back-to-school allowance initiatives will put nearly &euro;9 a week back into parents&rsquo; pockets.  The back-to-school allowance scheme was introduced more than 30 years ago.  I am pleased to confirm to the House that this payment will be increased by &euro;100 for this coming academic year.  This will benefit more than 262,000 children in 151,000 families right across the State.  This payment will go some way to helping parents and families meet the cost of school attendance.<\/p>  <p>  Schoolbook funding has been increased every year over the past number of years, with increased funding available for book rental schemes, and a new free book scheme having been introduced in more than 100 Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, primary schools since 2020.  It is my intention to continue to expand the provision of free books to all school children as resources allow.<\/p>  <p>  Every year, the school transport scheme provides a vital service to families across the families.  In the last academic year, more than 121,000 students used the school transport scheme, including 15,000 students with special educational needs.  I am delighted to confirm that for this coming academic year, parents will not have to pay a fee in order to access this vital service, with all fees being waived for those in receipt of a ticket.  This will result in immediate savings of up to &euro;500 for a family and will benefit more than 120,000 children.  Where a parent has already made a payment in respect of their child&rsquo;s ticket, this will be fully refunded.  Further information will issue to all applicants in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,506 schools and organisations benefiting 230,000 children.  As the Deputies present will be aware, earlier this year I announced the single most significant expansion of the DEIS programme, at a cost of &euro;32 million and benefiting 347 additional schools.  This will benefit 60,000 children, bringing the total number of students in the DEIS scheme to 240,000.  The DEIS programme provides a wide range of supports to schools, including enhanced capitation payments, lower pupil-teacher ratios, and additional planning supports.  I am pleased to confirm that the Government today extended the school meals programme to schools that have recently entered the DEIS programme, which will benefit 310 newly designated DEIS schools and almost 60,000 students.  All of us know the value of a healthy meal for students.  This is a very welcome measure from the Government and the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned earlier, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance payments will be paid to more than 150,000 families in respect of approximately 262,000 children for the coming school year.  Today, the Government announced an increase of &euro;100 in the back-to-school allowance for the coming academic year.  Consequently, the amount being paid for each qualified child aged between four and 11 years will be &euro;260 and the rate payable for each eligible child aged 12 and over will be &euro;385.  It is estimated that some 151,000 families will benefit from this measure in respect of over 262,000 children.  This is a one-off measure for 2022 to assist families with back-to-school costs in the current school year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department already provides a book grant of more than &euro;17 million annually to all recognised primary and post-primary schools within the free education scheme in order to provide assistance for books, including book rental schemes.  All schools are encouraged to operate book rental schemes to help alleviate costs to parents.  At primary level, 96% of schools operate a book rental scheme for parents.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to \"Commence a free schoolbooks scheme pilot in September 2020 and, pending a successful review of the pilot, expand the scheme to schools nationwide, as resources allow.\"<\/p> <p>Following a commitment in budget 2020 to introduce an extra support to reduce costs for families and school communities, &euro;1 million of funding for a pilot book grant scheme in primary schools was provided.  More than 15,000 pupils across 102 primary schools have benefited from this increased investment.  This scheme will continue this year, and I intend to seek funding to expand this programme in future budgets.<\/p> <p> The Department has also issued a circular to all schools, asking schools to adopt numerous measures in order to minimise costs for parents and families. This includes the provision of a book rental scheme and the phasing out of the use of non-reusable workbooks.  Schools are also asked to create a uniform policy which ensures that all items are available from a variety of shops to allow parents and guardians to shop around, and that these uniform items only have iron-on crests.<\/p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, students have recently concluded their leaving certificate and junior cycle examinations.  This year, in recognition of the financial pressures faced by parents, all examination fees have been waived for every examination student.<\/p> <p> In addition to meeting salary costs and providing for building construction and maintenance, the Department provides capitation grant funding directly to schools to cater for day-to-day school running costs such as heating, lighting, insurance and general upkeep.  For example, a voluntary secondary school with 500 pupils will receive capitation and ancillary funding of &euro;316,575.  A primary school with 150 pupils will receive capitation and ancillary funding of &euro;53,400.  This funding notwithstanding, the Department fully understands and accepts the need for improved capitation funding, and therefore the Government has provided for a combined 7.5% increase in standard capitation funding for all recognised primary and post-primary schools over the last number of budgets.  It is my intention to seek funding for further capitation increases in future budgets.<\/p> <p> Primary and post-primary schools in the free education system are not permitted to charge any form of mandatory fee.  No charge may be made in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum, or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.  Where voluntary contributions are sought from parents, it must be made clear to all families that the contributions are voluntary in nature and that payment or non-payment of these fees will have no bearing on their child's place in a school.<\/p> <p> These are some of the measures that the Government and Department of Education have taken to reduce the burden of back-to-school costs on parents, guardians and families.  The Government is committed to continue to build on the good progress made in this area and we are also conscious of the impact that the cost-of-living pressures are having across all of our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500039#QQ00300","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657047300,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, an Teachta Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire, for all his work in this area.

These are real worries and as September comes, people start to worry more.  An Teachta &Oacute; Laoghaire has done more than just listen.  He has learned from those parents what they desperately need and put it into a comprehensive package, which we are laying before the House tonight on behalf of those parents, who are struggling.  I welcome the U-turn by the Government.  As we know, the Government said it would not be doing anything but would wait for October, but now the budget is in September and there are some additional measures.  If this was a school report, we would say \"could try harder\", or \"could listen a little better\".<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency, Dublin Fingal, we pay some of the highest rents in Europe.  Back-to-school costs are not a nuisance for my constituents; it is a matter of being able to get to the end of the week or not.  Most people cannot afford the rents that we have to pay unless they have a second income, where both parents are working, paying some of the highest childcare rates and rents in Europe.  The cost of everything is going up.  We welcome the measures but it has already been outlined to the Minister that 500,000 kids will miss out.  We ask that she listen to what we and the parents are saying.  She should listen to their lived reality and their experience of the cost of living crisis.  She should take all of that into account and revise the proposals in order that they make a meaningful difference to the lives of low and middle-income earners, who are struggling.<\/p>  <p>  I draw attention to what the Minister said in her contribution about when voluntary contributions are sought for parents, it must be made clear to all families that the contributions are voluntary in nature.  Does she have any idea what sort of pressure is put on parents to pay that voluntary contribution?  Would she like to be the only child in the class who was not paying that?  The Minister knows and kids know that these contributions are far from voluntary.  It mortifies teachers and principals to have to ask for it, but they are making up a shortfall left by the Government.  I ask the Minister to live in the real world.  These contributions are in no way voluntary.  They put pressure on parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500040#RR00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1657047300,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I am pleased to speak on this Private Members' business, given the back-to-school pressure on my constituents in north Kildare.

What we are discussing is essential.  Hardworking mothers are coming to me and saying that they feel sick to the pit of their stomachs.  They are trying to manage the grocery shopping bills and see the school uniforms back in shops already.  They are going to the counter with the schoolbook lists, hoping they will be able to make a start on them and will not have to leave it to the end of the August.<\/p>  <p>  The plans regarding the so-called voluntary contribution will bring peace of mind to hardworking families.  I ask the Minister to look at that.  They are not really voluntary contributions.  Families driving their children home from school receive a letter reminding them that their children will be excluded from school activities, in a country that prides itself on free education.<\/p>  <p>  Low to middle-income families are drowning in the cost of living crisis.  What we propose in the Private Members' motion would throw them a lifeline and give them a hand.  Life is hard behind many people's doors, including some cases where you would not even have imagined it.  Our carefully-costed plan would immediately put money in people's pockets and take away the mortification when that dreaded letter about the voluntary contribution comes, as well as giving breathing space to families suffering financial distress and worry.  We would extend the back-to-school allowance at current rates to an additional 500,000 children in middle-income families.  We propose to increase the payment by &euro;80 from &euro;160 to &euro;240 for a child aged four to 11, and from &euro;285 to &euro;427.50, an increase of &euro;142, for children aged 12 and over, while the Government is providing a flat &euro;100.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes we should target the increases at families who really need it.  We all know the back-to-school costs are much higher for children going back to secondary school rather than primary school, including uniforms, books and so on.  Our move to a free book scheme would be like manna from heaven for many parents, as would the extra 10,000 places on the busanna scoile.  We need far more places on the busanna scoile if we are to show that we are really taking climate change seriously.  I am surprised the Green Party did not seem to have any input into the eleventh hour action today.

For many parents, particularly in this economic climate, the thought of finding the means to pay the escalating costs of preparing a child or a number of children for a new school year can be a daunting prospect.<\/p> <p>Most parents who are preparing a child for the new school year will have a must-buy list of items.  This could include uniforms, school shoes and books for the new academic year.  There will also be an expectation of being obliged to make voluntary contributions to the school to provide for the cost of various school activities in the new academic year.  Many schools will insist that parents buy branded uniforms such as blazers, school shirts and ties from a specific supplier, which can be very costly.  Those in economically disadvantaged communities or parents on low incomes often face stark choices when preparing their child or children to return to school.  It can impact on the family's health and welfare, on their ability to pay bills, to pay rent, to pay mortgages, to pay for transport and to pay for childcare.<\/p> <p> The average cost is &euro;1,200 for a primary school student and &euro;1,500 for a secondary school student.  Most families struggle to find the extra money to cover such back-to-school costs.  With the cost of living spiralling out of control, these costs are an additional burden on struggling families.  Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing to help struggling families by extending the back-to-school allowance to middle-income families with a household income of under &euro;80,000.  This will bring an additional 500,000 children into the back-to-school allowance scheme.  For those who already qualify for the allowance, it is essential that they receive an increase in the allowance by 50% to allow for the escalating rising costs across the board of sending a child back to school.<\/p> <p> We need to catch up with our neighbours in the North and introduce a free school books scheme.  Sending a child to school should not impose a financial burden on parents.  Whatever happened to the idea of free education?  It is something we should be striving for.  The Government needs to take urgent action to ensure that sending a child to school will not break the bank or cause hardship for the parents or the child.  While some of the measures the Minister has announced are welcome, it has taken a long time and it is this Private Members' motion that has pushed the Government into this position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500040#RR00400","speaker":"1470","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657047900,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this motion today.  It is an unusually important motion.  I also believe that the ramifications of the motion and the Opposition pressure have led to the announcement today, which I welcome.  The announcement today will bring great relief to families who are struggling.  I lament the fact that it took so long to get to this point but, regardless, it will be a huge relief to those families.<\/p><p>I have one criticism.  I have been asked if it goes far enough and the answer must be &quot;No, it does not.&quot;  As for the reasons it does not go far enough, a report published by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul some months ago sticks very strongly in my mind.  The report, entitled, The Cost of Surviving?<i>, <\/i>captured data showing that one-parent families are continually the most vulnerable cohort of people in the State and are consistently living on the poverty line.  To them, every single additional measure or every single letter that comes through their door is a fear.  They are fearful of their child coming home to say that he or she has torn football boots or saying that the school needs a capitation or a voluntary contribution or that they need a new book.  Every single cost incurred for that cohort of people is a huge fear.  As for what would be enough, were funding of &euro;236 million to be announced in the next budget, that would go a huge amount of the way towards making primary and secondary education in this country truly free.  Only that would be enough, such is the cost-of-living crisis.<\/p><p>In Ireland we are very good at using certain words when we mean something else.  In this Chamber we talk continually about the cost-of living crisis.  This actually means people living in poverty.  By its very nature, poverty is corrosive to the human spirit.  I remember talking to a person in a one-parent family about one year ago, which was  before the various different increases that we have seen recently.  She was talking to me about how poverty attacks every single one of her senses.  Poverty means being able to smell the food that you must reserve and not eat.  Poverty means the noise that comes from the next room when you are living in a hotel room with your children and the fear of who might be coming up and down the corridors.  Poverty induces huge levels of fear.  When parents are thinking about incurring the costs of the return to school, that fear is genuinely tangible.  These are parents who are, in some instances, already skipping a meal.  This is not hyperbole on my part.  This information is captured by the Cost of Surviving? report from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  It is also in every single one of our email inboxes.  I cannot be the only Deputy in this Chamber who, when out meeting people or engaging with them through our office, is hearing people in genuine fear of not being able to afford three square meals a day.  There is a fear of a child coming home with a torn jacket because the parent will not be able to afford to replace it.  They now never contemplate having a meal out with friends or a night out because inevitably, the budget would not stretch that far.<\/p><p>I welcome today's announcement.  I lament that it has taken so long but I believe it does not go far enough.  We are after the &euro;236 million funding for a fully free education.  That should be the gold standard.  We should not be willing to compromise on anything less than that.  I am very conscious that up until today, the back-to-education allowance was significantly higher than it was since 2007.  Today's announcement, however, has actually gone beyond that, which is welcome.  It should not have had to take that long.  The Government must be a lot more reactive when listening to the real lived experience of the people who are telling us they are choosing between heating their homes or having three square meals a day so their children do not go without.  These are the real lived experiences of families who are suffering and cannot wait for an October, now a September, budget.  These are the real lived experiences of people who are saying that this cost-of-living crisis is genuinely a cost-of-survival situation in their homes.  I welcome Sinn F&eacute;in's motion today.  I commend that it has been brought to the House.  It needs to be discussed at this point and I welcome the response from the Government this evening but it does not go far enough.  Let us make education truly free in this country: free primary school education and free secondary school education.  It should never be the case any more that in this Republic, parents would fear having to buy an additional book because it means they may have to sacrifice a meal.  That is the genuine lived experience as relayed to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500041#SS00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1657047900,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this very important motion.  I attended an event last week organised by the Children's Rights Alliance to discuss the issue of child poverty, including the issue of the cost of education.  It is striking that Ireland is the fifth richest country in the world on a GDP <i>per capita<\/i>basis, but one in nine children in the State live in constant poverty.  This is 134,000 children.  These are the children who are going to go hungry this summer because school is out and they cannot access the school meals, which a minority of students are able to access.  This is an absolute scandal.  It is a scandal that is not discussed enough in this House or generally in the media.  It is an absolute scandal because it is completely unnecessary.  Ireland could target and could achieve the complete elimination of child poverty.  It is a question of resources, including resources to make education truly free.<\/p><p>In Ireland we have a supposedly free education system.  We even have, supposedly, free third level education, but we will not even go there for now.  Yet, in this system of free education, in the coming months parents will be asked to pay for lots of books, for uniforms, for transport and for the so-called voluntary contributions.  In any year, the costs will add up immensely for parents but particularly in this year, given the cost-of-living crisis, which is hitting people so hard, it simply will be unaffordable for many people.<\/p><p>I believe it was an Irish League of Credit Unions survey that looked at the costs for parents to send kids to school.  It is truly shocking.  It costs more than &euro;1,000 to send a child to primary school and nearly &euro;1,500 to send a child to secondary school.  A very good survey was also done a couple of years ago by Barnardos that broke down some of these costs.<\/p> <p>For example, 76% of parents with a child in primary school and 96% of parents with a child in secondary school report having to purchase a crested uniform.  Some 42%, or less than half of secondary school pupils, have a book rental scheme available in their school.  Parents of primary school pupils pay, on average, &euro;50 towards a school book rental scheme, while parents of secondary school students are paying &euro;115.  The vast majority of parents are being asked to pay a so-called voluntary contribution.<\/p> <p> The bottom line is that in an education system in which education is supposedly free, all of these things should be provided.  Parents should not have to pay for anything to enable their children to go to school.  School meals should be provided for every child in the State and that should be extended to the summertime for all those who want to avail of it.  The State should provide all children in school with nutritious, quality and hot meals.  That is a basic requirement and could be done for about &euro;300 million.  The same amount could be raised through a 50% windfall tax on the energy companies and the war profiteering currently taking place.<\/p> <p> Similarly, there is no reason we have to be shackled to the profiteering of the book companies, which bring out their new books every year or every couple of years and say people must buy them.  We should have free book schemes, as many European countries have, where the books are provided as part of the education system.<\/p> <p> We should not have a system in which schools are underfunded and then seek voluntary contributions, placing unacceptable pressure on parents who simply cannot afford to pay them.  This also puts children into a very difficult situation.  We should simply resource our schools properly.  The whole voluntary contribution system embeds inequality in our education system because the amount a school serving an area with many higher income earners gets is much different from the amount a school gets in a deprived working class area.  Educational inequality is embedded through that.<\/p> <p> I will briefly raise with the Minister a point about a school in my constituency, St. Aidan&rsquo;s Community School in Brookfield, because it is related to educational quality.  The school has a serious need for the repair and maintenance of the roof, external walls and windows, which are leaking.  It has also received a report showing approximately &euro;100,000 would have to be spent to make the school fire-safe.  Remedial work on this and that will be done to patch up the school when this large site could be used as a facility for the community.  There is space on the site for a community centre, for example.  The matter needs to be investigated because, fundamentally, it appears that we need to build a new, quality school building for the school.  I will be in touch with the Minister directly on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500041#SS00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657048500,"counter":243,"content":"<p>On the Government&rsquo;s back-to-school package announced this evening, I believe the Government would have closed up shop for the summer after the recess without any package whatsoever had it not been for the pressure it was put under by the Opposition in this House and, in particular and most importantly, by ordinary people the length and breadth of this country who have made their views known on these issues.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the increase on the back-to-school allowance, as will many hard-pressed households but its still does not go far enough.  For starters, a family with an income of &euro;621 per week will not benefit from the change to the back-to-school allowance.  That income is not a great deal of money.  It is less than the average industrial wage.  These families, and a significant number of others who do not benefit from this scheme, need to be included in it.  If it costs &euro;1,200 to send a child to primary school and &euro;1,500 to send a child to secondary school, a 10% increase in costs this summer will amount to more than &euro;100 per child and families will still be worse off, even with the increase in the allowance.<\/p>  <p>  According to press reports tonight, &euro;47 million is being spent on this package.  It would take five times that amount to make schoolbooks 100% free and eliminate the need for any voluntary contributions.  That is what should be done.  It is far from impossible.  In Belgium, schoolbooks and materials are 100% free for primary and secondary school students alike.  In France, schoolbooks are 100% free for both.  In neither country were these changes given to the people free gratis and for nothing by a kind establishment.  In both countries, it was working class people who fought for and campaigned for the implementation of those changes.  What we are saying is that we have to step up the pressure from below for change in this country.  People have forced some positive change from the Government on education costs tonight.  Now we need to step up the pressure on energy costs, food prices and the entire cost-of-living crisis in this country.  It is the squeaky door that gets the grease.  The Government is under pressure as has been shown this evening.

This will be worth &euro;160 per child for primary school children between the ages of four and 11 years and &euro;285 for those who attend secondary school.  I also welcome the extra &euro;100 payment to families before the end of August and the decision of the Department of Education to waive the school transport fees.  As the Minister said, this measure will help 120,000 children.  This is all good news, as are the 60,000 additional school meals that will be made available.  This is a very good job and badly needed, so well done to the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  We need to extend the back-to-school allowance scheme to middle-income families and increase the rate payable to people on lower incomes.  It is hard to believe that the back-to-school allowance was much higher 15 years ago than it is today and that 25% of people go into debt to pay the cost of children going back to school.  I just heard that today.  As the Minister knows, this is a very expensive time for families with school-going children when one considers the costs of uniforms, shoes, books, travel and school contributions.  <\/p>  <p>  I looked today at who qualifies for the back-to-school allowance.  It is people on social welfare payments, including the working family payments, back-to-work family dividends and HSE payments, people on approved employment schemes or back-to-work schemes, those taking part in recognised education and training courses or in receipt of a daily expenses allowance either for a child&rsquo;s education or personally from the age of 20 taking part in a scheme while attending a further education and training course.  Many people in receipt of social welfare payments are not included in that list, including those in receipt of the children's allowance, rent supplement, guardian payments or blind benefits. <\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the changes, middle-income working families still have a problem.  They are struggling from week to week, trying to keep their spirits up at home with their family with everything else.  If they have two or three children, they have to pay all of this money.  They are struggling to put food on the table, pay their mortgages and heating bills and put petrol in their cars to travel to work and take their children to school.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the &euro;2.4 billion the Government provided for cost-of-living measures last week.<\/p>  <p>  I am not ashamed to raise again a case I raised in the House last week.  A man came into my constituency office crying.  He said he could no longer afford to look after his family.  He travels up to Dublin five days a week from Dundalk.  His petrol and fuel costs have doubled and he feels under enormous pressure.  Everything seems to be going wrong for him.  He has to vacate the house he is renting.<\/p> <p>He found one house that cost &euro;1,800 a month in rent.  He just cannot afford to pay it.  It is impossible.  This is very concerning and it is not just him, but others coming to my constituency office.<\/p> <p> Many people are now considering going on to social welfare because by doing so they get the housing assistance payment, HAP, at maybe &euro;1,150.  They also get medical cards and are entitled to other benefits.  This is a typical family of four.  The cost of living for a typical family of four is over &euro;3,000, excluding rent.  When rent is added it is &euro;4,500 a month, which is &euro;54,000 per year.  It does not pay middle-income people or people on low income to work.  We need to take a serious look at the situation at the moment.<\/p> <p> I welcome that the Government is trying its best, but only a certain number of people will get this.  This is one family and other families are coming to me.  We are trying to get people working and trying to get the country on its feet again.  Looking at the corporation tax take, the top ten companies in Ireland contribute one eighth of the total cost of keeping the country going.  We need people out there working, but the country is encouraging people to stay on social welfare to get these benefits.  The Minister might not think so.  I will praise the Government again.  Giving the extra &euro;100 for the back-to-school allowance is very good, but it is only helping a small number of people.  I plead with the Government to help the people who need the help now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500042#TT00300","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657049100,"counter":246,"content":"<p>The cost of living is squeezing families throughout the country.  There is a feeling of the 1980s in towns and villages the length and breadth of the country at the moment.  Families simply cannot pay bills.  They cannot buy the necessities such as food and clothing for their children.  Food banks and Society of St. Vincent de Paul groups throughout the country are out the door at the moment.  The Capuchin Day Centre in Dublin and other food-support networks are inundated.  There is a real crisis washing through the whole of the country at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  Even before this cost-of-living crisis, 661,000 people were living in poverty in the State.  Shockingly nearly 250,000 children were living in poverty.  These figures have obviously increased in the past two years.  Some 133,000 people are currently defined as working poor, people doing 40 hours work a week but still living in poverty.  These people cannot understand the lack of urgency coming from the Government at the moment.  It is incredible.  We will be listening to a debate on the budget for the next two months and what the Government will or will not bring to the table to help these families.<\/p>  <p>  Today many of these families will fill their cars full of fuel and it may cost &euro;120 to do that but they know that &euro;50 of that is going straight to the Government in the form of taxes.  They know the Government is harvesting more in fuel taxes today than it did before the cost-of-living crisis happened and they cannot figure out why the Government will not help them with this.<\/p>  <p>  This year the back-to-school costs will be extremely high for some families.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has done good analysis on this.  It has pointed out that sending a child to primary school will cost a family &euro;1,186 per child.  The costs for a secondary school are even worse at &euro;1,491 per child.  These economic stresses are putting pressure on families.  Some 63% of families say that back-to-school costs will add a financial burden to their family.  Two thirds, a majority of families, see that as a time of enormous pressure on their families.  Even worse, a quarter of parents say that back-to-school costs will put them in debt of up to &euro;336.  One third of families are putting the debt on to their credit cards.  In the most extreme cases, one in 20 are turning to moneylenders who are charging extortionate interest rates just so that they can pay for the typical issues going back to school.  We have a rip-off Ireland pushing parents into debt just to get their children an education.  These statistics come from last year and they have obviously got worse given the current cost-of-living crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Arguably, the situation for third level students is even more grim.  I have seen a two-bedroom apartment in Galway being advertised for &euro;1,750 a month.  At this stage I know of students who are commuting from places like Athlone to Galway and from Virginia to Dublin every day to access third level education.  Some students are using hostels and those hostels are charging up to &euro;50 a night for those young people to be able to access college.  Whether it is the increasing cost of accommodation, uniforms, books, transport or extracurricular activities, what we are seeing now is not just a cost-of-living crisis but certain sections of our society being locked out of third level education.  Young adults from lower- and middle-income families are being locked out.  The divides in society are being increased.  A ceiling is being put on the potential of some young people at the moment.  It is actually sapping the nation of its future prospects.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to hear about the increase in the back-to-school allowance.  I also welcome that the Government is considering extending the school meal scheme in the budget.  For some time, we in Aont&uacute; have been pushing the Minister on this.  We are looking for oversight on the amount spent.  The amount the Government is spending is increasing, but the number of school meals being provided is reducing at the moment.  We need to ensure that both the investment and the number of school meals increase.<\/p>  <p>  It is incredible that this is happening at a time when there is so much wealth and so much profiteering in society.  The Oxfam report, Profiting from Pain, estimates that billionaires in the food and energy sectors are now increasing their fortunes by $1 billion every two days.  Even in this State, there has been an increase of &euro;50 billion since the start of the Covid pandemic.  We need to ensure we live in a more equal society and that means funding those low- and middle-income earners but also it means tackling those who are making gross profits at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500043#UU00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1657049100,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing this important motion before us.  It is very timely in light of the fact that the D&aacute;il will be rising in a week's time and we will not be back before the children go back to school in September.  We appreciate that the Government has made some announcements in recent hours, but we have to drive home to the Minister that parents face a summer of dread as they struggle to deal with primary and secondary school charges of up to &euro;1,500 to send their little ones back to school.<\/p>  <p>  Radical reform of the current back-to-school allowance is needed to deal with these costs.  The &euro;58 million back-to-school allowance scheme needs to be seriously expanded to cover additional charges placed on parents to ensure more people qualify.  Payments should also issue much more rapidly.  With the phenomenal rise in the cost of living and the rise in the use of food banks, a similar expansion of the schools meal programme to proactively deal with food poverty is also needed.  I know from the feedback I get from secondary schools that many children are coming to school hungry.  We need to recognise that fact because there has been a lot of talk about food security but surely at the present time, we have enough food for everyone.  This problem needs to get recognition and needs to be addressed.  We all know that the cost of schoolbooks, tablets, school uniforms, tracksuits and school shoes pose crippling expenses for families.<\/p> <p>Some schools require very expensive uniforms.  In these times of financial strain for families, this kind of set-up should be stopped.  An ordinary jumper and pants should be acceptable rather than a school placing parents under this massive cost burden.  Books that were acceptable for the same class last year should be acceptable this year and it should be possible to hand them down.  <\/p> <p> Children may love finishing school every June but many parents dread it because it is at this time of the year that they must start paying for their return in September.  I will mention some of the costs parents face.  Schoolbooks cost an average of &euro;210 per child.  I have been asking about this.  Extracurricular activities cost &euro;178.  Gym and sports equipment costs &euro;77 and can go up to &euro;120 at secondary school level.

It looks like the Government is trying to jump all over the place this evening about the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward a motion on children's school costs.  This morning I read out statistics from <i>The Mirror<\/i>to the T&aacute;naiste.  He was not too impressed about where they came from.  Hopefully, when the Minister hears what the president of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is saying, it might be taken more seriously.  Rose McGowan, the society's national president, said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBut the inflation forecast is rising, rising, rising.  The gap between income and expenditure for people on the lowest incomes will grow.  The fact of life in Ireland today is that there is a weekly gap of &euro;49 between core social welfare rates and the cost of the minimum essential standard of living. <\/blockquote>  <p>She spoke about families already worrying about next year's back to school costs, about a woman who recently asked the charity to borrow two coats for her children and about people in rural Ireland being unable to leave their homes as they cannot afford the petrol or diesel to do so.  Ms McGowan explained that not being able to pay bills or eat properly can also have a knock-on effect on people's well-being and mental health.  Children should have happy memories.  Separate research compiled by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul detailed further experiences of people living below the minimum standard of living.  One parent told the society about not being able to give &euro;5 to their children for school trips while another described feeling crushed because they could not afford to have a birthday party for their eight-year-old daughter.<\/p><p>Last night, I was contacted by a family who are trying to come up with &euro;350 to pay for the school bus ticket.  That might have changed by this evening - I would certainly welcome that news, but I hope the devil is not in the detail.  We need further clarity on the real roll-out of what the Minister has announced this evening.  The parents who contacted me were worried about the school bus ticket for their only child.  Both parents have minimum wage jobs and both need cars.  They are living on the breadline.  They cannot afford a ticket and cannot understand why the 20% discount has not been passed on to them, but then again it is rural Ireland and we expect no better.  We are the ones who are paying for your buses and trains up here in Dublin.  Parents of secondary school children estimate that they spend &euro;1,340 on average per school year.  Parents estimate that it costs &euro;1,040 per annum, which is up &euro;372 compared to 2020, to keep their child in primary school education.  The Government's refusal to introduce an emergency budget even as households are pushed to the brink of disaster by soaring living costs is cruel and heartless and will impact families preparing to send children back to school in September.<\/p><p>Regarding the transport scheme announced by the Minister this evening, a lot of people have contacted me who had not contacted me previously.  They had been worrying that they would not be able to pay for their child to travel to school but I would like to know the detail of the new scheme.  Is every child who sits on a bus going to get a free transport service to school, or are we going to be very confused in the next few weeks and find out it is different from that?  I would appreciate if the Minister would clarify that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500044#VV00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1657049700,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I fully support tonight's motion.  The motion is timely and certainly needs to be heard and debated at this time because parents and families are really struggling, particularly those on low and middle incomes.  While I welcome the increase of &euro;100 in the back to school allowance and the announcement that school transport will be free, I hope this will include pupils on concessionary tickets because they need to get to school as well and should not be punished in any way because they have a concessionary ticket.  I hope they are included.<\/p>  <p>  It is a deep crisis for so many people.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has reported that it is receiving record numbers of calls this year.  It is getting worse by the day.  Everything that can be done should be done to help parents.  We know that many parents in desperation turn to moneylenders every year and that was the case before the inflation or crisis we have today.  I fear that this will become worse if the supports are not there.  <\/p>  <p>  I call on the Minister to make sure schools are supported in terms of increased capitation so that we do not have voluntary contributions.  I remember bringing forward a Bill a few years ago on voluntary contributions.  They need to be scrapped.  Schools should not have to ask families on low and middle incomes to make up the shortfall in money to keep the lights or heat on in school.  Capitation needs to increase and schools need to be helped in every way possible so that it does not fall back on families.<\/p>  <p>  It is a very difficult time for people and everything that needs to be done should be done.  I ask for DEIS status to be extended to more schools because there are many disadvantaged communities where people are really struggling and yet the schools in those areas are not designated as DEIS.  There has been a problem with this model for years.  In a time of crisis and hardship like this, DEIS status should be extended to many schools.  There are schools in disadvantaged communities in my constituency of Laois-Offaly and it is frustrating for those teachers and principals to see their school has not been included.  Again, this will help families.  If we bring in as many measures as we can, look at it across the board and help our schools, it will not fall back on the families, particularly at a time when they can least afford it.<\/p>  <p>  I also hope that we will see some sort of support in terms of schoolbooks and that many schools will be assisted so that they will be able to roll out rental schemes.  If schools are getting support, they can do more for families.  Many of them already do.  They bend over backwards through their own fundraising but they need help.  Low- and middle-income families need urgent help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500044#VV00300","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1657049700,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Acting Chairman's indulgence.  The reason for my tardiness was because the Oireachtas football team was playing a game in Mountjoy Prison.  It was an event we felt strongly about that included a representative from all political groupings here.  We saw the power of education.  By pure coincidence, there was a deputation at the Oireachtas committee today to speak about the power of education in the prison system.  A total of 70% of prisoners are early school leavers.  I remember reading an article a couple of years ago about the fact that in the US, they can predict the number of prison cells they will need in 15 years judging by the literacy rates of ten-year-olds.<\/p>  <p>  I raise my experience and that of colleagues across the House playing a football match in Mountjoy Prison today in the context of the issues of literacy and the most disadvantaged because they are connected to the issue of school costs.  Far too many of our conversations in our school communities are not about education, children, child development, literacy or numeracy.  They are about money.  I feel like I have made this speech about 14 times.  I am quite sure Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, who I thank for putting forward this motion, is sick of hearing me making the same speech over and over again but it is true that we have replaced the conversation in schools about children and education with a constant conversation about money.  I was that teacher; I was that principal.  You interact with the parent body on the basis of the money your school does not have to run itself so you chase the book money.  Your parents' association effectively acts like a fundraising body.  There are so many conversations about money.  <\/p> <p>Principals and teachers do not want to be dealing with the administration of money.  They do not want to chase parents&rsquo; associations to raise money.  It should be considered completely pathetic that a school has to fundraise for basic provisions.  We know what will happen in X well-heeled community versus in Y not-so-well-heeled community when it comes to fundraising.  Some will have the money, and some will not.  <\/p> <p> Schoolbooks in Northern Ireland are free.  There is no reason schoolbooks should not be free in the Republic of Ireland.  It would cost the Government &euro;20 million at primary level and &euro;20 million at secondary level.  Voluntary contributions, as has been mentioned, are not voluntary.  People feel as if they cannot fully engage in school life unless they come up with a voluntary contribution.  How humiliating must it be for a parent who does not have the voluntary contribution to engage in school life when they feel that they are getting constant reminders about this voluntary contribution, which can be linked to the availability of a certain resource within the school, a locker, etc?  Surely, we need to ban that and just provide the &euro;45 million that the Catholic Primary School Management Association suggests will be needed to replace that voluntary contribution funding.  Let us do it.  That is &euro;40 million plus &euro;45 million, which gives a total of &euro;85 million.  Making the back to school clothing and footwear allowance available to all families and making universal payments will cost approximately &euro;125 million.  In totting up of those numbers, I have not even come halfway to the figure of &euro;500 million, which the Government gave away in tax cuts last year.  These are the arguments that we will make and that the Government will make over the next couple of months.  The Government will talk to the country and to the squeezed middle about the tax burden.  It will focus its attention on that &euro;1 billion that it wants to throw away on tax cuts, rather than helping every citizen with their constitutional right to a free education.  <\/p> <p> The Department does not want a free books scheme because its officials wants to have an arm&rsquo;s length relationship with the school system.  They thinks that it is a matter for patron bodies and for boards of management to run schools and that it is not for the Department to get involved.  That is their attitude.  It feels to me that they have the Minister and Minister of State that it wants.  They are driving the bus and the Minister and Minister of State are sitting on it.  Whatever they say goes.  There is no radical view to unburden parents of this money conversation and to let loose a conversation about children.<\/p> <p> Can you imagine, a Chathaoirleach, how liberated a parent would be if they were able to go to a school gate and not be worried about being asked about money?  Could you imagine how liberating it would be for a parent to go to a parent-teacher meeting and not to be worried about money?  Could you imagine how liberating it would be for a parent to not worry about the child coming home from school with a reminder about money?  I have not even spoken about the children yet.  Could you imagine how liberating it would be for a child to be in a class and not to be reminded in various different subtle ways about money, such as book money, voluntary contribution, the fundraiser that is coming up, etc? <\/p> <p> While it is about the money, it is not just about the money; it is also about all those conversations that are being lost.  This is about parents who may have had a difficult engagement with the education system.  Maybe they were early school leavers or their experience in school was not the best and they would like to engage a little more.  Sometimes fathers in education find it difficult to re-engage with the school.  They find it daunting and intimidating.  Would they be less or more likely to engage with school life or with a school community if it they thought that they were going to be asked about money?  I would say that the answer is less.  <\/p> <p> The Government has flitted away &euro;500 million on tax cuts for some people this year.  It is determined to do cut twice that amount next year.  Yet, it could lift the entire country and make people proud to be in an education system that provides books for free, does not ask for voluntary contributions and has the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for everybody and replaces that really humiliating, debilitating feeling that people cannot engage in school life because they keep being asked for money.  <\/p> <p> I will sum up what I am saying.  I have said it many times and I know that the Minister has heard it many times.  I appreciate the opportunity afforded to me by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and the Acting Chairman for sandwiching me into the debate this evening.  Education is so precious.  You only know how precious education is when you meet those who did not have the opportunity to fulfil their potential within it.  I met loads of them today.  <\/p> <p> Some 70% of prisoners are early school leavers while 17.9% of the adult population is functionally illiterate.  One third of children who leave a primary DEIS school have basic reading difficulties.  We have problems and, therefore, the issues we need to discuss regarding schools are education, literacy, diet, oral language, family literacy, school community engagement, sport, health, parenting and so on.  Yet, the tragedy of the education system is that we spend so much time talking about money.  The parents&rsquo; association is effectively a fundraising body, as are we as politicians.  Let us be honest here.  We all get the requests to take out advertisements from the local primary school or secondary school when it is running a fundraiser.  Is that not pathetic?  Can we all recast our brains for a second?  Is it not pathetic that a politician would be asked to take out an advertisement by a primary school, which has to run a fundraiser to keep the lights on?  Is that not pathetic?  Can we all step back from this for a second and ask why we are not just funding the schools so they can keep the lights on and not constantly have to chase people for money or voluntary contributions?<\/p> <p>  Here are the maths.  There must be &euro;20 million for a primary school free book scheme, whereby nobody has to bother with a school book list anymore and the school just provides them.  We would not have to worry about that anymore.  There must be &euro;20 million for second level.  That amounts to &euro;40 million.  There must be &euro;45 million to fund schools centrally and properly so they do not need to have voluntary contributions.  There must be &euro;125 million for a universal back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme, notwithstanding the announcement that the Minister made earlier, which, I am quite sure, was on the foot of the motion had been tabled.  That is how the Government reacts.  It wants to have some way of counteracting Opposition motions because it does not do the governing itself.  I have not even come up to half the amount that, as I said, the Government flitted away in tax cuts last year.  Please do something for families who want to talk about education and not about money, take this issue seriously and deliver on the right to free education, which has been a myth since it was enshrined in the Constitution so many years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500044#VV00400","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657050300,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for tabling the motion, which is timely.  It was part of the pressure that we have seen in the response from the Government in the past hour.<\/p>  <p>  A good quality free education should be a basic essential in a modern society.  It is the norm in most advanced countries.  However, free primary and secondary education in this country is a myth, as has been said.  It is a theoretical concept that does not exist in reality.  Adding to the stress of the current cost-of-living crisis for so many families is the concern of finding the money to cover the cost of sending their children back to school this September.<\/p>  <p>  The motion notes a survey by the ILCU, which listed the average cost of sending a child to primary school at &euro;1,186, and at &euro;1,491 for a secondary school child.  Many parents are forced to take out loans to cover these costs, as the Minister will be aware.  There is a simple reason parents are faced with this problem.  As with our public health service and with our other public services, our education system is grossly underfunded, especially at primary level.  The capitation rate per pupil per day in a primary school is &euro;1.  It is just double that in a secondary school.  In primary school, this amounts to &euro;183 per pupil per annum.  The capitation grant was cut from &euro;200 in the austerity programme of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government to &euro;170.  The current grant per pupil, if we take a school with 100 pupils and four classrooms, amounts to &euro;18,300 for a year.  This supposed to cover heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance and general upkeep.  In theory, a proportion the grant is supposed to be set aside for teaching materials such as books and primers.  In fact, schools are relying on parents and on local communities to the tune of &euro;46 million per year, not for enhanced learning, but to cover the basics, such as heating and insurance.<\/p> <p>When we compare the funding of primary education here with other countries, we are placed in the bottom 50% of the OECD countries.  Our primary education spend is 11% below the EU average.  As a start, the capitation grant needs to be restored immediately to the 2010 rate in a serious commitment to providing genuinely free education at primary and secondary school level.<\/p> <p> Before the Minister's announcement a couple of hours ago, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance was lower than it was in 2007.  It did not cover the cost of books or other learning materials.  Again, I support the call in the motion for its eligibility to be extended to up to 500,000 children and families that earn under &euro;80,000.  It is important as that demand is still there.  I truly welcome the &euro;100 increase in the back-to-school allowance the Minister announced this evening.  Even at that, it will be hard to meet the costs families will face but it is definitely welcome.  I am sure families will welcome it.<\/p> <p> While on the subject, I refer to the issue of hot school meals.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is extending that to the 310 DEIS schools with 60,000 pupils coming into the system.  We are still way behind the norm that exists across the EU.  With the launch of the pilot scheme for hot school meals in 2019, approximately 10% of children in primary schools availed of the service.  It does not cater for secondary school pupils.  We all remember the campaign by the football player, Marcus Rashford, for school meals for children during the school holidays, which forced Mr. Boris Johnson's Government to concede.  We have to ask what Marcus Rashford would think of the situation here.  We are so far behind that he would not know where to start.  There was a commitment from the Minister to extend the scheme, which she has done this evening.<\/p> <p> I will repeat what I said at the very beginning of my contribution.  We need good quality, free education, which should be a basic essential in a modern society.  Steps have been taken this evening to take the edge off the anxiety of parents and families, which is welcome, but much more still needs to be done with regard to free education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500045#WW00300","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657050900,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this very timely and important motion.  This reflects the real concerns of many families, certainly those who are in contact with me and from what I hear from my colleagues in the House in this debate.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the country right now, many families are worrying about back-to-school costs and have been for many months.  Families are trying to set a few bob aside week by week to buy books, or it might be a pair of trainers for PE, a new uniform jumper or a school tracksuit.  There is a very long list of back-to-school requirements.  Parents are counting how many weeks it is until the end of August so they can have enough money set aside in order that their child can go back to school, the same as all the other children.  It is a major worry for families and they are under real pressure.  None of us want to disappoint our children.  It is vital that children are not seen as different from their friends and classmates and that they do not stand out because they do not have the school tracksuit or are outgrowing their uniform.  It might seem like a little thing to some of us but for children to be able to blend in and have what others have is so important.  Parents know this and they will do whatever they can to ensure their children have what they need to start the school year.  Moneylenders know parents will pay the sky-high interest rates in order that their daughters and sons can hold their heads high, wear the same uniform and carry the same books and equipment.<\/p>  <p>  Following its survey last year, the Irish League of Credit Unions showed that one quarter of parents are getting into debt.  Approximately 21% of them have an average debt of &euro;500 just to send their children back to school.  It estimated that the cost of sending a child to primary school is just over &euro;1,100, and it is &euro;1,500 for secondary school.  That is a very significant sum of money for any family per child but it is a huge sum for a family on low, fixed or middle incomes.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the Minister and heard the announcements that were made earlier today.  She spoke about the &euro;67 million, which is valuable, important and most welcome.  Many parents, especially those who were worrying about paying for school transport, will be greatly relieved they will not have to pay and those who have paid will be anxiously awaiting their rebate.  The increase in the back-to-school allowance is substantial.  Mind you, it needs to be because, of course, it is less now than it was back in 2007.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues I have, however, is the income qualifying limits for families to qualify for this allowance.  For a family with three children, the income level is under &euro;38,000.  Let us say one parent works 40 hours per week on the minimum wage of &euro;12.50 per hour and the other parent is on disability allowance.  That family with three children will be well above the qualifying limit.  The Minister needs to look at that.  The Sinn F&eacute;in proposal to include more than 500,000 extra families in qualifying for the back-to-school allowance is something the Minister should definitely look at and take seriously when it comes to the budget.  As I said, I welcome that increase.  The Minister also said she increased funding for a free book rental scheme.  That is good but we need a commitment from the Minister and the Government that in the lifetime of this Government, all schoolbooks will be free.  If the Minister could give us that commitment, people could believe Fianna F&aacute;il is as invested in education as she tells us it is.<\/p>  <p>  I mention the issue of voluntary contributions,  If ever there was a misnomer, it is calling those contributions voluntary.  In theory they are, but in practice they are not.  Parents are expected to pay.  They are under real pressure to cover the costs the capitation grant does not.  We all know the cost of fuel, heating and lighting has escalated in recent months.  What will schools do in September, October, November, December, January, February and right up to April next year as they try to keep the lights on and heat their school buildings?  That means greater pressure on this so-called voluntary contribution.  We will not hear it today but I ask that, in the budget, there will perhaps be an increase in the capitation grants.  The rise in inflation this year and last year was 9%.  Therefore, even if the Minister increased it by 10%, that would just be standing still.  I ask the Minister to consider that in the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500046#XX00200","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1657050900,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Deputy Flaherty is sharing time with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500046#XX00300","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1657050900,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for giving me some time.

Today's announcement is not an end result but it is very important step.

We need to continue to push for change in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Today's announcement is a very progressive move in the direction of change, however.

Almost 120,000 families will receive this payment automatically in respect of each qualifying child, with the remaining 30,000 receiving their payment over the coming weeks.  This scheme is extremely important in supporting families to deal with what is a very expensive time of year.  Today&rsquo;s announcement brings the payment this year to &euro;260 for children aged four to 11 years and to &euro;385 for children aged 12 to 22 years.  Overall, I expect this will benefit some 150,000 families this year, in respect of over 262,000 children.  The eligibility for lone parents has been widened by increasing the income limits for single-parent families to match those of two-parent families.<\/p>  <p>  I have also mentioned improvements already made, and being made, in the area of school transport.  This allowance will also be paid to families who are availing of the temporary protection directive for Ukraine, and they will receive it on the same eligibility criteria as for Irish parents.  It was also announced earlier that the 310 newly designated DEIS schools can avail of the school meals programme this year, benefitting almost 60,000 additional children.  This includes over 270 additional primary schools that may provide hot school meals to their pupils in the next school year.  We have introduced these measures to reduce back-to-school costs and to help families who are struggling.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding transport, the Government announced that to help struggling families with back-to-school costs, anyone who has applied for and receives a school transport ticket for the academic year 2022-23 will not be charged a fee for the school bus ticket this year.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to review the school transport scheme and, in line with this commitment, my Department commenced a major review of the scheme in February 2021.  This review, which encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs, is still under way.<\/p>  <p>  In more general funding, the Department provided approximately &euro;300 million in capitation-related funding to primary schools and approximately &euro;264 million to post-primary schools in 2021.  This funding is provided to meet the day-to-day running costs of schools, including heating, lighting and insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Primary and post-primary schools in the free education system are not permitted to charge any form of mandatory fee.  Voluntary contributions may be sought from parents provided it is made clear to them that there is no compulsion to pay, and that a child&rsquo;s place in the school, or continued enrolment there, is not dependent on a willingness to make a contribution.  The manner in which voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management, but their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.  No charge may be made in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation or other activities in which all pupils are expected to take part.  Where voluntary contributions are sought from parents, it must be made clear to all families that the contributions are voluntary in nature and that their payment or non-payment of these fees will have no bearing on their child&rsquo;s place within the school.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Foley, the Department and I are well aware of the matters raised in the motion concerning back-to-school costs, and especially in the context of rising cost-of-living expenses generally and rising energy costs, in particular.  I have outlined some of the many measures that the Government and, in particular, the Department of Education and the Department of Social Protection have taken and are taking to lessen the burden placed on families by these costs and expenses.  I thank the Deputies once more for their contributions to today&rsquo;s important debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500047#YY00100","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1657051500,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for bringing forward this extremely important motion.  Back-to-school costs each year shamefully expose the deep divide that exists in our society between rich and poor.  What sickens me to the stomach at this time of the year is thinking of children who are all too aware of what their parents are facing and what they have to struggle with, and they can do little about it aside from suffer anxiety, fear and, in many cases, even embarrassment.<\/p>  <p>  The measures proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in in the motion - increasing the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, extending the allowance to middle income earners, rolling out a fully free books scheme, allowing universal affordable school uniforms and reducing school transport fees - are desperately needed.  I am glad that the Government has woken up to the reality of what going back to school actually costs.  By all means, I welcome some of the proposals.  They might not have gone far enough, but I urge the Minister to implement them as soon as possible.  I am glad the Government has responded to the pressure from this side of the House.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened to a number of debates on this issue.  The one that hits me very hard, and I even have an email with me about it, is the voluntary contributions.  The Minister said in her opening statement that, \"No charge may be made...\".  The word \"may\" is very weak.  It should be no charge \"will\" be made.  It causes a lot of hassle.  I say that because it is probably the most cruel charge on parents and children.  They cannot hide from it at any time.  We have all heard the stories about children not getting lockers because money has been held back.  I suspect that is going to happen unless we strengthen it.<\/p>  <p>  I make an appeal to everybody in the education sector to be extra sensitive in this year of all years.  People, families and children are struggling.  It hits everybody.  The big worry I have is the impact on vulnerable children and their families.  They could be psychologically scarred.  Many times we do not get on very well on either side of the House, but we can come to agreement on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on the motion and the amount of work that went into it.  These are not ideas; they are solutions.  It is to be hoped this country will have one of the best education systems in a number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500047#YY00200","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1657051500,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire not only on this motion but on forcing the Government to a point where, despite its protestations, it was unable to hide from the fact that measures had to be introduced to support families with the costs of sending their children back to school.  I welcome the measures that were announced today.  I particularly welcome the announcement of free school transport, and I hope it will become a permanent measure.  I also hope the school transport scheme will be expanded so we can get rid of the ludicrous situation where school buses in my constituency are passing children who have to get into the family car to get to school because they do not qualify under the arbitrary criteria that are in place.<\/p><p>With regard to the financial packages that have been announced, I wish to put on the record extracts from a letter I received this morning.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am a 30-year-old full-time working mother of three and have worked from when I was 16.  I got married at 24 and have never been on benefits.  In 2020 we bought our home and in December 2021 I had my third child.  I had to return to work in March of this year, three months after having that baby, as the &euro;250 a week payment was not enough to keep food in my children's mouths and a roof over their head.  My husband also works full-time but due to the increase in costs it was just not possible for me to stay at home any longer.  The government have added an extra two weeks for parental leave, which is wonderful, but what about the mothers who cannot even take the six months maternity leave off because of affordability issues?  In September I will have two children attending school and recently I went to apply for the back to school allowance.  I didn't even get past the first stage because the question was &quot;Which of the following payments are you receiving?&quot;.  As I said previously, none, so therefore I am not entitled.  I cannot afford the &euro;1,000 on school supplies.  I also have child care to pay and again I am not entitled to any subsidies.  This is an unfair situation. <\/blockquote>  <p>I have no option but to write back to that mother and tell her that nothing has been provided by the Government today for her situation because it has not extended the eligibility criteria for the back-to-school allowance.  According to Minister after Minister, no other measures will be in place until the end of September, a month after her children go back to school.  I again appeal to the Government to introduce an emergency budget that will provide supports for families such as the family of this mother.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500047#YY00300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1657052100,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le gach Teachta a ghlac p&aacute;irt sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo agus le gach duine a thacaigh leis an r&uacute;n seo.

I urge the Government to also support it because it contains the potential to build on what the Government has brought forward.  I very much concur with what Deputy Barry said.  This Government would have shut up shop and gone to the recess without any proposals to assist with back-to-school costs, but for the fact pressure was coming from the Sinn F&eacute;in motions and proposals-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500048#ZZ00100","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1657052100,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500048#ZZ00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1657052100,"counter":263,"content":"<p>-----and from other organisations as well.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken.  They will undoubtedly help those on the lowest incomes, but there are many people who will not benefit.  As I said, people will watch the news tonight who will say these measures are good and will wonder what they will get out of them.  These people could be struggling on quite low incomes, but they will not benefit.  A family with a combined household income of more than &euro;620 per week, with one child in school, will not qualify.  That is about &euro;32,000 a year, which is not a big income.  It is very far from a big income.  These are exactly the kind of people who are trying to decide whether they can afford to go ahead with their holidays, whether they can afford the electricity bills that are coming down the line, and whether they will have to go to the credit union or a moneylender.  These are all decisions families will have to make.  It is not the case, unfortunately, that those people who hope to benefit from these measures will do so.<\/p>  <p>  It does not require legislation to extend payments such as these.  I welcome what has been brought forward today and I urge the Minister to implement it as soon as possible.  I also acknowledge the area of free school meals, which we included in our pre-budget submissions.  We want to eventually get to a place where every child gets a hot meal in school.  That will take time.  We need to start with Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools students, which we have advocated for a number of years.  We looked for assistance for low- and middle-income earners, broadly.  It is not about benefiting those on the very highest incomes who are in a certain position, but those who have a combined household income of &euro;80,000 or less who would be in a position to benefit, and get some assistance, because many of them are under very severe pressure.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the Minister to go from here and implement what she has put forward today.  We disagree with none of that, but she should build upon it.  We do not need to pass legislation.  The Minister can, over the course of the next week or two, sit down with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and whoever else, to agree a formula to extend the back to education allowance to those who do not qualify for it.  They need assistance.  Just because they fall above the threshold does not mean they will not ring St. Vincent de Paul or organisations like it.  That does not mean that at all.<\/p>  <p>  We have outlined a particular proposal.  Even if the Minister does not go as far as we have outlined, I ask her to do something for those people.  I ask her to please invest some time to build on what has happened today and ensure that people who have missed out can stand to benefit by some amount.  Otherwise, they will be under severe pressure.  We will still be talking about this over the course of the summer months unless those people get some assistance.  I am not just talking about Sinn F&eacute;in but society as a whole.  Those families will ring the Minister's constituency office, and those of the Minister of State, mine, and Deputies Carthy and Buckley.  All of us will still get phone calls unless something is done to assist those people.  That door is not closed.  It should not be closed.  I urge the Minister to first support our motion calling for these proposals, consider what we have brought forward and please implement something that goes some way to assist those people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500048#ZZ00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657052100,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna ar Sonra\u00edodh Uain D\u00f3ibh - Priority Questions","time":1657052100,"counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500048#ZZ00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","time":1657052100,"counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500048#ZZ00550"},{"type":"question","time":1657052100,"counter":267,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[35896\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500048#ZZ00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on the planned reforms to GSOC, including whether she envisages an increase in funding for any new body to replace it; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1488","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1657052100,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I ask for the Minister's views on the planned reforms to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.

As he will be aware, the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which has completed its pre-legislative scrutiny, will provide for a reformed and strengthened Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in line with the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which is obviously a significant body of work conducted over the past number of years.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals in the Bill are comprehensive.<\/p> <p>They address the structures, independence, remit, and processes and procedures of GSOC.<\/p> <p> The body will have greater financial independence through its own Vote for the first time.  It will have a new CEO, who will assume the responsibility of the Accounting Officer and allow the ombudsman and deputy ombudsman to focus on directing investigations and oversight work.  Its remit will also be expanded to include allegations that come to light other than by way of a complaint from a member of the public.  It will, for the first time, be responsible for the investigation of all complaints, other than minor service level complaints, which will be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for resolution.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will no longer investigate complaints on behalf of the new body.<\/p> <p> The processes and procedures, described by the commission itself as cumbersome and inefficient, will be streamlined to support the timely, transparent and effective resolution of complaints and investigations.  The rights of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na personnel to fair procedure and natural justice will be fully respected within the new procedures.  The oversight and accountability of the body will also be strengthened in a number of ways.  For example, complainants will have a right to seek a review of certain decisions.  The scope of the judicial inquiry that may be undertaken into the conduct of a designated officer at present will be extended to include all officers of the ombudsman, the ombudsman and deputy ombudsman, and the policies and procedures of the office.  Many of these reforms have been sought by GSOC itself and have been the subject of extensive consultation with GSOC and the Garda Commissioner.  As the Deputy will be aware, they have also been the subject of detailed consideration by the Joint Committee on Justice during the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I received the committee&rsquo;s report recently.  We are going through that in great detail and my officials are examining its recommendations to identify what further refinements might be required to the Bill in the course of drafting to ensure this major overhaul of policing delivers a system that enhances transparency and efficiency and, above all, has the confidence of complainants, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the wider public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500048#ZZ00800","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657052700,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.

I ask the Minister for her initial thoughts on the proposed reforms.  The sustained increase in the caseload has also been highlighted as an issue.

Currently, there is a twin-track process in place.  First, it has to be decided whether the investigation will be civil or criminal.  A complainant has to go through an entire process.  At the end of it, if it is neither one or the other, they must go back to the beginning and start again.  A new mechanism will be put in place to identify, at the outset, whether it is a potential criminal or civil investigation, thereby reducing the length of the process and the impact it can have on the person who has made the complaint or the individual against whom the complaint has been made to enable them to move on or to continue in their work.<\/p>  <p>  One of the biggest issues that has been raised is the time it is taking for the complaints process to conclude.

FLAC plays a key role in the provision of legal information, advice and advocacy work through its telephone information referral line, for which my Department has provided grant funding over a number of years.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has received FLAC's annual report.  I highlight that, according to the report, last year, the highest number of calls were made to the referral line since 2015, with more than 13,000 calls being made.  Obviously, that may have been as a result of the Covid pandemic, as people were not meeting face-to-face and were communicating more online and over the phone.  Nevertheless, there was quite a significant increase in the number of calls made to the referral line.

That enabled us to support the invaluable work it does and the services it provides to the most vulnerable by strengthening its telephone information and referral line and increasing the numbers of legal advice clinics it provides throughout the country.  In budget 2022, I maintained the increased funding allocation to FLAC.  We will be responding to and engaging with the organisation and other stakeholders to look at what is possible for this year for the next budget in September.  More broadly, FLAC regularly engages with my Department on access to justice matters.  In its recent annual report, FLAC called for and welcomed the review of the civil legal aid scheme that I announced and is under way.<\/p> <p>This is the first time in its more than 40-year history that we have had a review of this kind.  I am pleased to say that the work of the group has commenced.  It is being chaired by retired Chief Justice Frank Clarke, with membership drawn from across different sectors.  We are trying to make sure that we do not just have legal expertise but that we also have representatives from the various different organisations and representative community groups, including marginalised groups; legal practitioners; academics; Department officials; and representatives from the Legal Aid Board, which administers the current scheme.  FLAC is an important member of the review group.  Insights from working to promote equal access to justice for all will be invaluable to the group as its work progresses.<\/p> <p> The review will allow for an assessment of how well access to justice is facilitated by our civil legal aid scheme, particularly for those on low incomes.  The review group will make recommendations for its future, including in relation to eligibility.  As part of the review process, I intend that there will be significant consultation to ensure that the insights of a range of stakeholders regarding the operation of the scheme - and how best to support those of limited means with legal needs &ndash; will inform the work of the review group.<\/p> <p> As I noted, the review group has commenced its work, which is expected to take a period of 12 months.  It will report to me periodically on progress, before submitting its final report to me once its work is completed.  FLAC&rsquo;s annual report highlighted that in 2021 almost a third of all queries to its telephone information and referral line related to family law matters.  I am determined to overhaul the operation of the family justice system to ensure we have a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts the family at the centre of its work.  Work on drafting the family court Bill is progressing with a view to publishing the Bill as soon as possible in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500049#AAA01100","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657053300,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I am sure the Minister is aware that an awful lot of the FLAC centres around the country have more or less exclusively been dealing with family law cases.

I do not know whether the Minister noticed the following matter but I certainly did and I am sure the Acting Chairman did.  There has been a massive increase in the number of people seeking advice since the ban on evictions ended.  There have been many notices to quit, which involve landlord and tenant law and employment law.  There are much fewer people, percentage wise, who are in trade unions.  They are not getting any representation, a lot of them cannot afford the services of a specialised lawyer and they are coming to our offices.  Does the Minister have any plans to resource FLAC so it can move into advocacy on behalf of workers and tenants who are receiving notices to quit?

Of the law centres, eight of these with a family mediation offices are collocated.  It is not just the online services but a huge amount is happening in-person on the ground.  The Deputy referenced family law and about 30% of the calls related to same.  To break it down further, of that 30% some 44% related to divorce, a number that has unfortunately increased in the previous year.  Some 29% of the calls were concerning custody, access and guardianship, which again represents a rise of almost 18%.  Some 17% of the calls related to maintenance, which is a rise of just under 10%.  Finally, 12% of the calls were domestic violence queries so this is connected with the work we are doing in the development of the family law court, the family hubs and the family justice oversight group, acknowledging that this is an area we need to specialise more in.

There are currently 105 YDPs across the State and the youth justice strategy commits to expanding the network to provide cover to every child and young person who needs to access their services.

The Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, announced on 22 June that more than 50 youth diversion projects will benefit from this additional funding.  This funding has been provided to do the following: extend the boundaries of some of the YDPs to increase geographical coverage, as provided for in the youth justice strategy; increase funding to engage with the cohort of referrals who are harder to reach; provide additional early intervention supports; provide family supports to the relatives of those young people engaged with the YDPs; and further develop the Solas Project in Dublin.  <\/p>  <p>  It will be of interest to the Deputy that, of this &euro;6.7 million, &euro;780,000 has been set aside to establish a limited number of YDPs this year to cover geographical areas which cannot be covered sufficiently through the expansion of existing YDPs.  The projects are funded through my Department but, as the Deputy will appreciate, the funding needs of individual YDPs differ based on a range of criteria such as the geographical area in which the project operates, the number of referrals to the YDP and the number of referrals who are in the hard-to-reach cohort, among other things.  My Department offers funding appropriate to the needs of each YDP as determined by standard budgetary process.

This level of funding is enabling sustained ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  As a result, the number of garda&iacute; is now 14,347 and we have more than 3,100 Garda staff nationwide.  The Deputy may be aware that there was a very strong interest in the recent Garda recruitment campaign, which only closed recently.   Over 11,000 people applied to become a member.

The first is the desire among serving garda&iacute; to get out into communities and practise on-the-beat policing.  That is not just the case in suburban stations such as Stepaside but in city centres such as Dublin, Cork, Galway or elsewhere.  The second is the proposal to use civilian staff more efficiently in order that garda&iacute; can spend more time on the street, in communities, liaising with schools, parents and everything else.  We should allow the administrative burden to be taken on by those civilian staff.  I appreciate that some of that is down to the deployment and action by the Commissioner.

Most important, it will entail a merging of Garda members working in the back office, in the various finance and HR functions, allowing for more front-line garda&iacute;.  There are four key areas of finance, HR, crime and community engagement.  Merging finance across two districts will allow for more garda&iacute; to be out on the beat on the ground.  In my county, Meath and Westmeath are merging, so finance will be based in one area.  Every area will see that benefit and increase, with a focus on crime and on community engagement.  Covid-19 has stopped progress being made as quickly as we would like but that background merging has still been happening.  Cork is the only county that has introduced all four new models.  It is happening bit by bit.

An element of that will go towards pay and other areas of current spending.  It is important that we invest not just in the physical infrastructure of cars and equipment but in other areas like body-worn cameras.  Deputy Richmond has been pushing for and supports the introduction of legislation in that regard.  We gave a commitment as part of the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence strategy, announced last week, that &euro;12 million would be allocated for the roll-out of body-worn cameras.  That is to help garda&iacute; in their work fighting crime but also to make sure they are protected and kept safe.  There will be a particular focus on capital spend, which is a once-off spend.  There will be a specific budget for that this year and into next year but we will also be looking at ways to spend that on an annual basis and building on that.

Under the IGA, justice ministers from the two jurisdictions meet regularly to discuss criminal justice matters of mutual interest or concern and to develop plans to achieve more effective co-operation and co-ordination on criminal justice matters.  The last IGA ministerial meeting was held virtually in February, at which Ms Long and I agreed a new plan of work to run until the end of 2023.  The next ministerial meeting under the IGA is being planned for the autumn.  Unfortunately, due to the timing of the most recent number of meetings and with Covid figures, they have all been online so we have not had a chance to meet in person through that format.

There are various different streams, such as funding for staff of sporting organisations on an ongoing basis.  We have asked about new, innovative, once-off projects that do not require yearly funding.  We have also asked about projects that can be replicated across the country.  I was with a community organisation in my own area, which identified that when younger children left the facility the organisation provides and moved on, it had trouble because the children came back at weekends, climbed on the roof and, while they did not cause trouble, they were a danger to themselves and potentially others.<\/p> <p>The intention was that they would put forward a project that would involve those children in developing the space themselves so they would be part of it and it would bring them into the fold instead of them being outside of it.  It is those types of projects where it is innovative, different and new.  It is once-off funding.  It creates safety in a way that might not be thought about in the normal sense.  This is how we are scoring in making sure all of those types of marks are met.  Again, it will be in the autumn.  I do not have a specific date, but obviously I will let the Deputy know as soon as I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500054#FFF01000","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657056300,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reply.

The fewer of the &euro;150,000 type projects there are, the more we can spread it across.  This is just the first year and it is my intention it will expand.  I brought the Criminal Assets Bureau 2021 report to the Cabinet just recently.

However, the substantially high number of applications currently being received will, no doubt, present a significant challenge in achieving this.

Ireland is no different in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is taking all possible steps to ensure we can process applications as quickly as possible.

There are probably a number of factors which have resulted in the significant increase.  Yes, it is true to say that one of those factors is possibly the policies which have been implemented within the UK and it is possible that the change and the sentiment following Brexit has also had an implication.  Post Covid-19 we have seen more people on the move, having not being able to move in the past number of years.  There have also been other militating factors.  The war in Ukraine has obviously displaced people further but there are also other significant natural events happening across the world with increased famine and climate change again creating a movement of people, in particular coming from Africa.  There are a number of different factors and I do not think we could pinpoint just one.  We have a number of different countries represented in the higher numbers of people who are coming.  A number of people are also coming, potentially, for economic reasons and are seeking asylum so we have to take a number of different factors into account.<\/p>  <p>  The most important part from my side is that we can process applications as quickly as possible.

This is a follow-on and builds on the great amount of work that was done in the previous two strategies by our former colleague and Minister, Frances Fitzgerald, in particular.  We have worked very closely not just with all Government Departments but also with our State agencies and, in particular, with the community and voluntary sector and our service providers in developing this strategy.  It was co-designed with Safe Ireland and with the National Women's Council of Ireland, which obviously represents so many organisations across the country.  It is a very ambitious plan.  This five-year programme of reform essentially seeks to achieve a society where there is zero tolerance for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  We have 144 actions.  My intention from the outset was to develop a strategy but also to ensure we have a very clear implementation plan setting out the number of actions; who is needed to carry out those actions; where there is crossover between agencies, Departments and service providers; when those actions are due to be delivered; and the funding that is required for them.  We have quite a specific and detailed plan.  The first implementation plan is set out for the next 18 months and the subsequent plans will be set out over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  Many people have asked what we mean by zero tolerance.  It means a number of things and I have described it in a number of ways.  To me, essentially we are collectively saying as a society that just because abuse happens behind closed doors in a personal relationship or in a family setting, we should not tolerate it in the way that we have.  We have done so as a society up until now.  Regardless of whether it is physical, sexual, financial or emotional abuse, we need to call it out and ensure those who need help know that it is there and that when they come forward, the services are there to support them.  Many of the actions in the plan focus specifically on the need to improve our services, improve engagement, improve access to the information that victims need and put them at the very centre.<\/p>  <p>  The second aspect is how we can each respond in our own general behaviour to domestic or sexual violence but also how we respond to inappropriate comments, touching or types of behaviour that can often lead to much more extreme types of behaviour.  It is particularly important to do that at a young age to ensure that our young children, in an open and age-appropriate way, are taught what a healthy relationship is; how to engage with each other as boys and girls, men and women; what a healthy sexual relationship is; how to engage on difficult issues like pornography, which has become more violent; and how to navigate many other areas also.  It is about everything from putting the structures in place, strengthening our laws, improving our policies and working collectively to ensuring that each and every one of us in society understands that we have a role to play if we are going to change the way we view, respond to and think about domestic and sexual violence.<\/p>  <p>  Most importantly, as the first implementation plan will develop, the establishment of a statutory agency with sole responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence to help to implement the strategy will ensure that we develop our number of refuge and accommodation centres.  We have given a commitment to double their number from 141 to 282 in the lifetime of the strategy.  We intend to develop the agency even further beyond that to ensure it has a role in raising awareness and developing campaigns to reach out to all of us, but to victims in particular.  It will also gather data.  We have given a commitment to have a Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland report every five years.  The last one was done 20 years ago.  I think we will all agree that our country has changed and that we need to ensure we are up to date in the types of experiences people have.  This is about getting the voice of the victim and ensuring it is at the very heart of what we do.  I acknowledge our colleague, Deputy Stanton, who did a great amount of work in this space in his role as Minister of State with responsibility for equality in the Department of Justice.<\/p>  <p>  I say again that this is building on a significant amount of work that has been done.  I believe it is ambitious.  I hope that if it is enacted and implemented and everybody does what they should do, we will see a significant change in our society in general. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500056#HHH00800","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1657056900,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her very comprehensive response.

I have a later question on this issue which will not be reached.  I would be interested in making people aware of what it is so that people can be rescued out of it.

Many governments in other jurisdictions have tried to address the issue and failed given that it is so easily accessible and available.  However, we have committed to work specifically with experts in this area, online providers and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to try to find ways to at least alert young people.  This is where the education comes into play to show that this is not healthy, not natural and not what healthy sexual relationships should look like, particularly where there is violent pornography.  Unfortunately, this is starting to creep in and we are starting to see these behaviours.

It is important that they have the structures in place to support children going through a difficult situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500057#JJJ00300","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657057500,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 15 to 23, inclusive, replied to with Written Answers.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","time":1657057500,"counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500057#JJJ00500"},{"type":"question","time":1657057500,"counter":372,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[35751\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500057#JJJ00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide an update on her work to legislate against hate crimes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1657057500,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to update the House on her work to legislate against hate crimes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500057#JJJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speech","time":1657057500,"counter":374,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has become a more diverse and welcoming country in recent decades.  I strongly condemn, as I know he does, the actions of the small minority of people who subject others to abuse or attack resulting from their own prejudice.  On 16 April 2021, I published the general scheme of the criminal justice (incitement to hatred and hate crime) Bill 2021 following extensive public consultation.  The general scheme was then referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.  This took place in November 2021 and the report was published in April 2022.  I am committed to advancing work on the Bill this year.  It is my intention that it will be enacted by the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic.  The aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty, compared with the ordinary offence, and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime, something that does not exist and is not recorded at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  Following receipt of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice in April, my officials have been examining the recommendations made.  Some of these recommendations have required further legal advice and consultation with key stakeholders.  Last week during Pride week, I was very glad to meet representatives of LGBTI+ non-governmental organisations to discuss a range of concerns, including their wish to see this Bill enacted as soon as possible.  Drafting of the Bill is under way with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and I expect it will be published in the early autumn.<\/p>  <p>  We have all been appalled by some of the recent crimes that have been committed, in particular the murder of two young men and the more recent attacks even during last week's Pride.  People have been indiscriminately targeted simply because of who they are and that should not be tolerated.  In the engagement prior to the publication of the heads of Bill, it became pretty clear that even though we are a modern and welcoming society, some people living in this country are still afraid to go about their daily lives simply because of who they are and for fear that they will be targeted.  This legislation is important and necessary, which is why I want it enacted before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500057#JJJ00800","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1657057500,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister on her work on this.  This is very reforming legislation.  It is something that is needed, unfortunately, perhaps even more in 2022 than ever.  It was needed in the past and it is great that finally about to become reality.  Most of us will never know what it is like to be a victim of hate crime, but the appalling incidents we have seen in recent times remind us all that this is necessary.  This cannot ever be tolerated in a civilised society.  Within our community, unfortunately the victims of hate crime are our family, friends, work colleagues and neighbours.  It is really appalling.  The Bill is vital in terms of its practicalities but also in terms of its symbolism in showing that the State will ensure that these people are given the protection they need in statute.  I look forward to the progression of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500057#JJJ00900","speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speech","time":1657057500,"counter":376,"content":"<p>As the Deputy said, it is really important that we send a strong signal to those who wish to commit these crimes that they will not be tolerated.  It is not just focused on crimes but also on incitement to hate.  This is where a person, be it verbally, online, in print or in any other type of media actively seeks to incite hatred against another individual or group of people simply because of who they are, because of their race, religion, colour of skin, sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic.<\/p>  <p>  We have a law that has been in place since 1989.  Unfortunately, it does not really work.  It has not resulted in many convictions and the Garda has pointed out it is cumbersome and difficult to implement. We are essentially retracting that legislation, building on it and improving it particularly when it comes to speech and incitement to hate.  We are now adding this additional avenue of hate crime.  While the Judiciary have previously taken that into account, it was never recorded and was never on the Statute Book.  It is very important that we are doing that now. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500057#JJJ01000","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657057500,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Is f&eacute;idir teacht ar Cheisteanna Scr&iacute;ofa ar www.oireachtas.ie.<br \/><br \/>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teachtaireacht \u00f3n Seanad - Message from Seanad","time":1657057500,"counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500057#JJJ01200"},{"type":"speech","time":1657057500,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill 2022 without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500057#JJJ01300","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657057500,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar athl&oacute; ar 10.40 p.m. go dt&iacute; 9.12 a.m., D&eacute; C&eacute;adaoin, an 6 I&uacute;il 2022.<br \/><br \/>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.40 p.m. until 9.12 a.m. on Wednesday, 6 July 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
