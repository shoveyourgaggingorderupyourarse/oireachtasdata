I appreciate and respect the fact that he does not represent the Department of Education but I certainly hope that he has some positive messages for us.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue today and it is certainly not for the first time.  I have raised this issue a number of times in this House and, indeed, during my time in the D&aacute;il.  The key issue is that it is imperative that we have a more co-ordinated approach in allocating secondary school places, particularly in Newbridge and Kildare town.<\/p> <p>Towns such as Newbridge and Kildare and other smaller villages in south Kildare - and I have no doubt throughout the country - are continuing to grow and prosper.  We are seeing people moving into our towns.  We see record numbers of homes being constructed and that is all bringing a very welcome boost to accommodation and to our local economies.  However, I have been raising a red flag within the Oireachtas for the past seven years.  The rate of growth is far outpacing our infrastructural advances.  We are seeing the resources of our towns being maxed out.  They continue to grow.  The infrastructural deficits are becoming more burdensome for residents, be they issues with traffic and congestion, school places, accessing GPs and road infrastructure.  We need issues such as these addressed in building sustainable communities that have adequate resources.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In this particular instance, I am talking about schools and secondary schools.  I am pleased that the Department of Education and the Minister have listened to my calls.  They are responding to the perennial school place shortages in Newbridge and Kildare town.  I have spoken to the Minister a number of times to communicate the hurt, the fear, the anger and the stress that has been experienced by students and parents on the ground who were not successful in securing a second-level place in their own communities.  I have done my best to represent the people of my community on this really important issue.<\/p><p>It is welcome that after years of waiting and fighting for a new site, a site has been procured at the new Curragh post-primary school at Magee Barracks.  I also want to thank the principal, Ms Patricia O'Brien, and the whole school community at St. Conleth&rsquo;s Community College in Newbridge, for agreeing to take in an additional 30 students next September.  However, I understand that when local principals met in late February of this year, it was indicated that at least 80 places were needed for students who need to access places in the area.  At a meeting that was held online with principals in the area a number of months ago, the Minister committed that the Department of Education would engage in a process to assess the needs for next September and the following September, in the short term.  She committed that everything would be done to ensure that every student who will be leaving sixth class and in primary school this year would have a place in September.<\/p><p>I want to acknowledge the work that has been done to date, as well as the positive engagements.  However, I want to know now from the Minister of State, what the process is.  Can we expect that every child who is seeking a secondary school place in south Kildare will receive an offer?  When will they receive that offer?  At this point, and even as late as yesterday, parents have contacted me who do not have a place for their child.  It is a really important issue.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#A00500","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>As the Leas-Chathaoirleach correctly said, I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  She sends her apologies for her inability to attend this morning.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter, which provides me with an opportunity to clarify the current position in relation to secondary school places in Kildare.  In order to plan for school provision and to analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department of Education divides the country into 314 school planning areas and it uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, including child benefit and school enrolment data.  This is to identify where the pressures for school places across the country will arise, as well as where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  Where data indicate that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case.  It may be provided through either one or a combination of the following: utilisation of existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; and the provision of a new school or schools. <\/p> <p>As the Senator is aware, the Department is progressing a number of building projects in south Kildare under the national development plan.  The most significant project in terms of planned additional capacity is a new 1,000-pupil school building for the Curragh post-primary school, which will also provide four classrooms for pupils with special educational needs.  Agreement in principle has been reached on a permanent site for the school.  The Department, in conjunction with the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board as school patron, is working to put modular accommodation in place on the site in 2023, which is welcome news.  This will provide for significant additional capacity in the area.  There are additional projects at Cross and Passion College, Kilcullen, Patrician Secondary School, Newbridge, and Ard Scoil Rath Iomgh&aacute;in, Rathangan.  The Department is additionally considering the accommodation needs of Holy Family Secondary School in Newbridge and St. Conleth&rsquo;s Community College in Newbridge.<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, I wish to advise the Senator that the Department of Education is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas, including in south Kildare.  However, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation, but may be driven by the following factors.  The issue of duplication of applications arises when people have applied for a place in a number of schools in the area, as often happens.  The issue of school of choice arises whereby pupils cannot get a place in a preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town or area.  Some towns or areas have single-sex schools and, while places are available in the school, they are not available to all pupils.  There is also the issue of external draw, which refers to pupils coming from outside the local area.  The Department has frequent engagement with the patrons and principals of all the schools in the area, with a view to achieving a clarity on the position in respect of post-primary schools space requirements.<\/p> <p>At the Department&rsquo;s request, and with the support of patrons, schools compared enrolments and waiting lists in order to identify duplication and local requirements.  This engagement identified a significant number of schools and waiting lists at a number of schools in the area.  However, the Department is aware of available places at St. Conleth&rsquo;s Community College.  The Department is additionally being engaged with Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board in respect to potential solutions.  Additional provision should be there for those places to be filled.  I can assure the Senator that the Department of Education will continue to work closely with the relevant patrons in respect of the post-primary school enrolment position in south Kildare.  This is focused on ensuring the start of the 2022-23 school year operates as smoothly as possible for all the school students.<\/p> <p>In conclusion, I want to thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity.  I recognise the challenges that are there consistently across the country.  The Department takes a proactive stance in trying to address these needs at a local level, in partnership with the schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#B00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to take this Commencement matter.

At the same time, there is a big concern about this September.  I have in my hand a letter that I received on 24 February from the secretary to the Minister for Education, which talks about the fact that the principals met the previous week.  It provides clarity on the number of pupils seeking places in the area.  The figure was indicated to be over 80.  We have a situation where St. Conleth&rsquo;s Community College and the education and training board have thankfully offered places for 30 children.  However, by these figures, it would seem that 50 children will not have a place in September.  That is simply not good enough.

It is great to have him here.  I am raising the issue of mandatory training for teachers of children who are dyslexic.  It is probably the most common learning difficulty that we have in our schools at the moment.  It affects one in ten children, from a mild to an extreme degree.  This equates to an amazing 100,000 children in primary and secondary school education today.  The figure is an average of three per classroom.  These children and young people have the right to receive a proper education.  They have the right to receive reasonable accommodations when it comes to this issue.  It is an issue that is very close to my heart.  We need to see movement on it.  In 2022 we have a scenario where teachers are going through training, and dyslexia as a module is not a mandatory part of the process.  I am really concerned about that.<\/p> <p>The Dyslexia Association of Ireland has done a survey regarding this over the last few years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A total of 90% of respondents indicated they had received minimal or no training relating to dyslexia when in teacher training college.  It is unbelievable that in respect of 100,000 kids, most teachers have received minimal or no specialised training.  In the case of those who had received training, they believed it was inadequate.  <\/p><p>This issue relates to how we can decode the English language.  If this was French, Italian or anything else, we would be able to teach our children how to learn it.  Because it is English, however, and because that is processed in a slightly different way by dyslexic students, children are not being taught the appropriate way to learn it.  The knock-on effect is that, unfortunately, people turn in on themselves and experience mental health issues and confidence issues throughout life.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, I must acknowledge that a cohort of teachers have done something special in this regard.  They have thought outside the box and worked with organisations such as the Dyslexia Association of Ireland to undergo their own upskilling and training.  That is a testament to how some teachers have engaged in this process.  Even so, that teacher training colleges have no mandatory module dedicated to the matter is a big issue for the cohort of society that needs the support.<\/p><p>Dyslexia is recognised as a disability and reasonable accommodations need to be made for children who have it.  This relates to a fundamental right.  Without this core skill, not only reading but engaging in other subjects will be a greater challenge and the student will be set back in society.  Article 24 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides that persons have a right to be educated irrespective of whether they have a disability.  We are again ignoring that by not giving these children the opportunity to reach their full potential.<\/p><p>We need a few things to happen.  The module in respect of dyslexia in the initial teacher training courses has to be made mandatory.  Imagine that in 2022, a student teacher in college will learn everything about how to teach a primary or secondary student, yet a module that affects 10% of any given class is not mandatory.  It is unbelievable in many ways.  Second, there needs to be in-service training for teachers who are in post.  They need to be brought up to spec in the same way that some of them have worked so hard to be in order that they will understand the decoding required by someone who is dyslexic.  Third, there needs to be a specified role for a teacher with special responsibility for dyslexic pupils in every school.<\/p><p>This affects 10% of the population, not only the schoolgoing population.  We need there to be mandatory teacher training in this context or we will continue to face this big issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#B00600","speaker":"1666","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I am also taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education.  I thank the Senator for making his points so well.  I pay tribute to all schools that are adapting and consistently implementing best practice in teaching and integrating children with additional needs in school.  Some very impressive work in that regard is going on throughout the country.<\/p> <p>This year, the Department of Education will spend in excess of &euro;2 billion, or more than 25% of its budget, on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs.  Through the initial teacher education programmes, providing inclusive education to children with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia, is a fundamental principle of the Department's education and training system.  Under section 38 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, all initial teacher education programmes must be accredited by the Teaching Council for registration purposes.  The first cycle of the review and accreditation of the programmes was completed by the council in 2015.  In preparation for the next cycle of the review and accreditation process, the council reviewed its policy on standards for programmes of initial teacher education and published updated standards in November 2020.  Inclusive education has been strengthened in the revised standards, which recognise the diverse range of needs teachers encounter in the course of their teaching, regardless of setting, and refer specifically to additional learning needs such as autism, dyslexia and dyspraxia in this context.  As part of the review and accreditation process, all programmes of initial teacher education will have to provide evidence of how the core elements are explored and examined with student teachers during their programme, which should offer some promise in respect of what the Senator raised.<\/p> <p>In the context of continuing professional development, the Department provides a range of placement options and supports for schools that have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, including pupils with a specific leaming disability, such as dyslexia, to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, he or she will have access to an appropriate education.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, a separate statutory agency, is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, for the provision of special educational needs supports to schools.  The NCSE supports schools to build their capacity to support the inclusion of all children through a suite of professional learning opportunities.  Each of the seminars and resources, designed within the council, has been aligned with Cos&aacute;n, the national framework for teacher learning.  This year, for example, the NCSE is offering the following seminars and workshops for teachers in the area of dyslexia: supporting dyslexia through the use of apps for primary teachers; teaching students with literacy difficulties, including dyslexia, for primary and post-primary teachers; assistive technology freeware for dyslexia; and literacy for students with autism.  The Professional Development Service for Teachers, through its primary language, literacy, reading recovery and Gaeilge supports for teachers, promotes inclusive pedagogies and approaches that benefit all learners, including early literacy intervention models.  The new primary language curriculum and support materials are based on best practice grounded in research for language and literacy for all learners in all contexts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#C00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>This is about ensuring not only that teachers who are going through teacher training college will be able to undertake this module but that they will be required to do so.

We need to get together the management groups of the teacher training colleges before September next and make it mandatory.  Otherwise, yet another cohort of society will be left behind.  We need to change fundamentally our approach regarding education and dyslexia.  We have forgotten about it and it has been left continually on the hind teat.

I do not really mind where housing comes from or who builds it.  I have no ideological position on whether it is the private sector, the public sector or whoever else.  I have a lot of time for synergies by the approved housing bodies, AHBs, and the local authorities.  We have all put our shoulder to the wheel to deliver homes.

We are talking about substantial lands at the Cork docklands, formerly connected to the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na, which owned or in some way had leverage on the site.  We are also talking about Limerick's Colbert Station, where CI&Eacute; again has a connection, as does the HSE on neighbouring lands.  I would like to hear about progress on the sites and to acknowledge the excitement they potentially have in terms of realising new homes for us.  It is important that we also understand the timelines for the transfer of these sites.  I am familiar with Limerick and I went to see the site recently.  I see great plans on the LDA website regarding a consultation on the housing there.<\/p> <p>I understand what the LDA wants to do.  It wants to improve the way the housing market functions.  That is welcome and it is positive.  I acknowledge that the LDA wants to work with State bodies and local authorities and their elected members to make more effective use of State lands and to provide a sustainable supply of new homes and new houses.  What is most important is that the LDA now accepts that it wants to acquire and develop lands in a selective and targeted way that boosts housing supply.  This is not to be in competition with anybody else.<\/p> <p>One of the points that we discussed at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage with the approved housing bodies and the County and City Management Association, CCMA, was that we do not want State agencies, be it the Land Development Agency, the health authorities, other State agencies, harbour companies and transport agencies all competing for the same piece of land.  The only people who will gain from that are the private property owners.  We need a much more co-ordinated management structure for State lands.  We must set out our target to get them and we must not compete with each other within the public sector and hike up the prices because ultimately that impacts on the property prices.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the amazing work of the LDA.  I put my hand up and say I was somewhat sceptical about it, but what it has done with the State land bank database is phenomenal.  At last, we are now seeing a database with a master mapping system of State lands, be it owned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, the HSE and transport and marine agencies.  That is important in order that we will get good land use.  I know the Minister of State is fiercely committed to that.  It would be most helpful if he could share some details on those three promised land transfers and projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#D00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I followed quite a bit of that session yesterday at the joint committee.  It was really interesting, including Senator Boyhan's contribution.  As he stated, there is something very strategic and big happening right across the housing sphere and we see that with the increase in the number of commencements.  In my own county, the social housing provision is up by more than 60%, which will reduce the social housing waiting list.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and officials have been incredibly proactive across the Department to try and address the housing crisis through as many measures as possible.<\/p> <p>The enactment of the Land Development Agency Act 2021, providing for the establishment of the LDA as a commercial State agency, marked an historic move to use all lands available to the State to provide for housing supply and affordability needs.  The Act provided for the establishment of a new LDA designated activity company, DAC, and the initial capitalisation of the LDA DAC by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  The LDA DAC was incorporated by the Companies Registration Office on 20 December 2021 and, following a direction issued by the Minister for Finance and the establishment of a bank account by the LDA DAC, the initial &euro;100 million of the LDA's &euro;1.25 billion ISIF capital allocation to the LDA DAC has now been transferred from ISIF by the NTMA.<\/p> <p>The LDA will work with local authorities, State agencies and the private sector to deliver housing and to identify public and private lands for development purposes.  Prior to Housing for All, the LDA already had access to an initial tranche of eight sites and it is currently developing those sites, which include Castlelands in Balbriggan and the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  It is also working collaboratively with a number of local authorities to bring forward other State lands, such as the developments at St. Teresa's Gardens and at Shanganagh.  Under Housing for All, the State committed to transferring a further tranche of 20 sites to the LDA, with the potential to deliver up to 15,000 homes, including lands at the Digital Hub in Dublin and Colbert Station in Limerick, which Senator Boyhan referred to.<\/p> <p>A list of those additional State lands is available in Housing for All and the LDA is actively progressing the transfer of those sites with the relevant State owners.  It should be noted that these site transfers are at an early stage and more work is needed to enable transfer of the sites.  Officials at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are working with the LDA to progress site transfers and any issues are being actively considered by a State lands subgroup of the overall Housing for All delivery group, on which the LDA is represented.  The LDA is already working on baseline assessments and feasibility assessments for many of these sites.  Senator Boyhan will be glad to know there will be no delay in their development.<\/p> <p>The LDA is currently developing a register of all relevant public lands owned by local authorities and other bodies listed under Schedules 1 and 2 to the LDA Act.  The focus of the register is on sites in urban population areas greater than 10,000.  An initial prototype mapping tool has already been completed by the LDA and is available on its website.  On commencement of section 50 of the LDA Act, this register will be put on a statutory footing.<\/p> <p>I note the points raised by Senator Boyhan about the number of competing interests for these land banks.  The criteria for the delivery of housing must include the sustainability of transport corridors and public transport in urban centres.  There is a very strong, cohesive approach from a housing perspective to achieve critical mass in terms of housing delivery in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#D00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the very detailed response.

I have just one question on foot of the Minister of State's response, which says it all.  I acknowledge the enormous work in terms of the tool for the mapping and the database of State lands.  That is really important work that will stand us in good stead going forward.  The Minister of State outlined that on commencement of section 50 of the LDA Act, the register will be put on a statutory basis.  I do not want a response now, but perhaps he could take my question away with him and have a chat with his officials.  Is it possible to have some sort of timeline?  I accept there is a lot more work to do, but it is important that as soon as we can we get the Minister to sign off on section 50 of the LDA Act, which concerns the register, because it was clearly identified as an issue.  Perhaps the Minister of State would bring the point back to his officials in the Department.  I thank him.

As he knows, there is a real crisis in blood stocks in our health service and there has been throughout the pandemic.  Ireland has had to import blood stocks on three separate occasions over the past 12 months from the NHS blood transfusion service in the UK.  It has been reported that blood supplies are so low that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, may have to trigger an amber alert.  This is having a negative impact on planned surgeries and hospital activity.  The Irish hospital system has enough problems at the moment dealing with reduced capacity because of the need to isolate patients due to Covid-19.  A scarcity of blood products is the last thing it needs.  As of last night, there was only a five-day supply of O negative blood in stock and last week there was only a two-day supply.  As someone whose dad was a very diligent and proud donator of blood because he had a rare blood type, I must say that news of these shortages is terrifying.  Indeed, it is terrifying for anyone who takes blood donation seriously.  It is in that context that I am asking about the policy changes that were instigated this week by the IBTS.<\/p> <p>In the first instance, I am very heartened that there has been a change in eligibility.  It is important to say that in the past, gay and bisexual men who had sex with other men were banned for life from donating.  That was changed in 2017.  At that time, a wait period of 12 months was introduced before gay or bisexual men could donate blood.  As of Monday of this week, that wait period has been reduced to four months.  Given that we have such huge shortages in blood donations, what is the Department doing to advertise this?  It is crazy that there seems to have been no active attempt to get the word out there.  There is, of course, a wider issue around encouraging young people and people of all ages up to a certain point, to donate blood.  The pandemic contributed greatly to a fall-off in the number of blood donors.  Given this fact and the recent changes to eligibility, we need to see the Department advertising more.<\/p> <p>While I very much welcome the aforementioned changes, I am concerned about the scientific basis for some of them.  While neither I nor anyone else in this House has the scientific knowledge to be able to question the specific scientific evidence that was provided by the social behaviours review group within the IBTS, it is important that its advice is published.  Concern has been expressed that some of the ideas and philosophical, scientific and health biases that were at work and which underpinned the ban on donation for many years are still at play.  The question must be asked about the basis for the four-month wait period, given that the UK has moved to a three-month wait period.  Why is it that a woman who has sex with a bisexual man is made to wait four months but that same bisexual man may be able to donate immediately if he had sex with a man more than four months ago?  I must apologise to the children and the teacher in the Public Gallery but these are important matters.  What is the basis for the type of sex as grounds for the wait period?  There have been conflicting reports around public statements made last December with regard to oral sex and so on.<\/p> <p>The fundamental issue is that there appears to be inconsistencies here.  We are happy to import blood from Britain that is subject to rules that are different to the rules in operation here.  Will the Minister for Health publish the advice of the social behaviours review group to inform us of the basis for the decisions of the IBTS?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#E00500","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Sherlock for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to speak on it on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.<\/p> <p>I agree that it is great to see school children in here today after a two year absence.  They give the House a great sense of vitality.  I am delighted to see them here today and I hope they enjoy their tour of Leinster House.<\/p> <p>The remit of the IBTS is to provide a safe, reliable and robust blood service to the Irish health system.  A major objective of the IBTS is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the recipients and the donors of blood and blood products.  As Senator Sherlock is aware, following a review of existing donor deferral policy by an independent expert group last year, called the social behaviours review group, the IBTS announced a range of changes to its existing deferral policies, including those concerning gay and bisexual men who have sex with men. The objective of these policy changes is to move towards an individual assessment process for donors, making blood donation more inclusive, and to welcome additional donors.<\/p> <p>The IBTS has committed to a phased approach to the introduction of these policy changes.  Phase one involves reducing the 12-month deferral period for gay and bisexual men who have sex with men to 4 months.  This was introduced by the IBTS last Monday 28 March.  This first phase is an interim measure for lowering barriers to donation while extensive technical system upgrades are made.  These upgrades will replace the existing paper-based health and lifestyle questionnaire with an electronic self-assessment health history questionnaire.  This will present donors with a series of questions which they will answer on a \"Yes\" or \"No\" basis, with specific responses triggering secondary questions, facilitating the process of individual assessment.  Phase two is the introduction of the individual risk assessment system similar to system introduced by the UK Blood Services in June 2021, known as FAIR, or for the assessment of individualised risk.  This individualised risk assessment will include several aspects of sexual behaviour and will apply to all blood donors.  The IBTS is working towards introducing this second phase later this year.<\/p> <p>The aim of these changes is to make blood donation more inclusive and to welcome additional donors from the LGBT+ community.  It is therefore essential that this progress is communicated clearly and concisely to the public.  In that regard, the donor eligibility criteria changes effective from last Monday, 28 March received widespread coverage across traditional and social media.  Indeed, I heard a discussion on it on the radio yesterday on my way up to Dublin.  The IBTS also issued a press release and highlighted the changes across its various social media platforms.  The IBTS advised that it has made changes to its website to reflect the new criteria and confirmed that all donor information documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.  The Minister welcomes the decision of the board of the IBTS to introduce these changes and commends it on its progress in making blood donation more inclusive while ensuring the safe supply of blood in Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frankie Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Sherlock compared the four-month waiting list with the three-month waiting list in the UK.

If there had been resolve from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to get this event to Ireland then it might have happened.  Surely the return from staging the world's highest-profile yacht race far outweighs any investment needed beforehand.

If so, why not, when much of the proposed investment in development, infrastructure and public realm enhancement were already signposted and flagged in many different Government announcements?

I wish to highlight some of the measures announced that are going to make a difference in enriching the school life of our students, empowering them as they face into the world of work or study after school and embedding well-being for them.  As we know, there was huge consensus on the latter aspect during the two years of Covid.

There is also the introduction of two new subjects, one being around the area of drama and theatre and the other centred on climate change and sustainable developmental work.

There was incredible consultation with small community groups, Kildare County Council and Bord na M&oacute;na.  Some 15 actions have been identified.  I want to highlight two more.  One is about progressing the opportunity for a new national peatlands park.  That would be the first national peatlands park in the country and the only national park in the midlands.  Well done to director Joe Boland and to Lullymore Heritage and Discovery Park.  Mr. Boland has been highlighting this for some time.  I also highlight the actions relating to the blueway and greenway and look for support and funding.<\/p><p>I raise the matter of a young girl called Kate Dempsey, who was very brave in talking about her experience of having her drink spiked in a club in my town, Newbridge.  When she was taken to hospital, she was told that five women had presented with the same issue on the same night, which is shocking.  It is important that anybody who has this experience goes to the garda&iacute; and the owners.  I am not suggesting that the nightclub had anything to do with this, but it is a crisis and we need to do more to support young women and young men to have a good, natural social life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#G01300","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I will wait until I am on the floor some day to speak more, but I made a number of proposals about leaving certificate reform and, thankfully, some of them are being used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#H00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I will raise two issues.  I support the Order of Business.  I acknowledge the Government's announcement of the circular economy Bill.

The Minister of State with responsibility for the circular economy, Deputy Ossian Smyth, represents D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where I live.  I acknowledge the work of Senator Malcolm Byrne and that of the Minister of State in addressing what needs to be done.  I had major concerns about the data issue.  The Bill contains a number of provisions, including general data protection regulation-compliant uses of technology such as CCTV for waste management.  It will be a good Bill.  I am supportive of what I have seen and read about it.<\/p> <p>It is timely that we have a debate about local government, especially accountability, transparency and, ultimately, sanctions.  Everyone who may have been involved in or watched \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" this day last week was horrified by some of the issues raised.  Much of that was not new.  It had already come through the auditing systems.  There were not many freedom of information requests to the Department about it.  There were active individual councillors who engaged in that programme.  I pay tribute to them.  It is not always easy to challenge one's own chief executive and audit committee.  RT&Eacute; did a service, as did many councillors who participated, publicly and privately, in that investigation.  What was exposed was nothing short of a disgrace.  That is not good enough.  We need to look at it again and to learn from that experience.<\/p> <p>My takeaway from \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" was that there were serious breaches of corporate governance in some of these local authorities.  People knew what happened.  I think of Mayo and what happened there.  I find it hard to believe that people did not know a road, bridge and infrastructure were in place, and that people could sign off on public funding.  Where did the pressure come from?  Was it political?  Did it come from central Government or from the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Who pressured whom to make false declarations?  That is what is being alleged.  I seek a debate on this.  It is about transparency, good governance in local authorities and accountability.  The public now want sanctions for people who breach corporate governance in local authorities.  At some stage, whenever time permits, we should have a focused debate and statements on local government, particularly with regard to governance and auditing of local government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#H00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>It is good to have the Leas-Chathaoirleach back in the Chamber.

I acknowledge both that and the historic step forward taken last night in the Seanad to finally end fur farming in Ireland.  Fur farming is a cruel practice.  Seventeen years ago, as a colleague pointed out, the Green Party tabled legislation to end fur farming.  We have finally done so.  It is a good day.  We have also put on the Statute Book a scheme that will be developed in respect of to small-scale planting of native forestry.  That also happened on the floor of the Seanad.  We have the circular economy Bill, as outlined by Senator Boyhan.  That came before the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  There was extensive pre-legislative scrutiny.  It was a good day for those who hate dumping.  There will be CCTV cameras, which many of us have sought mfor years.  There will be a host of measures to cut down on waste.

I have spoken on numerous occasions about live exports.  Libya is another destination.  It is unnecessary and does not bring in that much income.  It needs to be examined.

This cruel practice also needs to be ended.<\/p> <p>I frequently speak about greyhound racing.  We have seen reports and investigations about the greyhound industry and yet the Minister is looking to provide funding of &euro;1 million to Kilkenny for the redevelopment of the greyhound stadium.  This is not the correct use of funding.  It is time for everybody to step up to the plate when it comes to animal welfare.  All of our species are interconnected.  Showing kindness to other animals and species should set us apart as human beings.  I ask people to examine their consciences when it comes to these issues.

While I understand that there needs to be a short-term response I also believe we need to have a long-term housing strategy for the numbers of refugees that we will be taking from Ukraine.  Some figures suggest up to 200,000.  The figure is probably going to be lower than that but there needs to be a long-term strategy.  We know from history that even when people think they are going to go back within a short timeframe, that often is not the case.  In some countries there are refugees who have been living for two or three generations in what essentially are tented cities.  We need to make ensure that does not happen here.I wrote to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on this last week to ask him to outline the strategy to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I was told that it is the responsibility of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  It is not.  There needs to be a whole-of-government response because it is important that we have a long-term strategy in regard to social welfare, schools and housing.  It is very important that we start planning for that now in order that we do not see a situation in ten years&rsquo; time where children are growing up in tents or prefabs.<\/p><p>The second issue I wish to raise is the issue of the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage put a limit on local authorities of 200 housing units that they can buy where there is a tenant <i>in situ<\/i>.  It is understandable that first-time buyers are given an opportunity to purchase a place that they call home but these limits are having the consequence whereby people who are getting social housing support through the housing assistance payment, HAP, are then being evicted by smaller landlords who are leaving the housing market.  It should be that local authorities are able to purchase that house where there is a tenant <i>in situ <\/i>and house them through the local authority.  When getting HAP, you are in housing need, you are on the local authority housing list and it is unacceptable that because of these limits &ndash; and I understand the intention behind them &ndash; there is an unintended consequence of forcing people who require social housing support, into homelessness.  The Minister needs to look at flexibility around the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme.  Dublin City Council councillors have written to him on this issue and he needs to respond and allow local authorities to purchase housing where there is a tenant <i>in situ <\/i>getting social housing support. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#J00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I am very much looking forward to the debate on the Ukrainian situation in Fine Gael's Private Members' time this evening.

I thank the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland for accepting my invitation last Saturday when she visited Lisdoonvarna and Ballyvaughan in County Clare, where there is now a significant number of Ukrainian citizens living among us.  It was an extremely emotional and very powerful visit.  Everybody there was quite moved, with more than 100 children singing the Ukrainian national anthem.  The ambassador then did a town hall meeting in Ukrainian for the Ukrainian people.  Certainly it meant a lot to them and gave them reassurance.  I thank the ambassador for that.<\/p> <p>I also wish to congratulate Conal Henry on his appointment as chair of the Shannon Group board.  I wish him the very best in what is an extremely important job.  It is a pity that our former colleague in the Seanad, P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, felt it necessary to step down.  Questions need to be answered as to why Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh had to make that decision.  I believe there is a role for the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications in terms of establishing the reasons.  Was there an exit interview with Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh by the Minister for Transport to glean and understand why he made such a decision so quickly?  It does not favour confidence in what is happening in Shannon.  We should ask the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications to see if there is a role for it to get to the bottom of why Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh decided to step down.  That said, I believe it is important to reiterate our best wishes to Conal Henry because Shannon is essentially the cockpit for the entire mid-west tourism industry.  For decades, Shannon brought thousands upon thousands of passengers in, who came to visit our area.  Between Aer Lingus and other airlines there were more than 3 million passengers coming through Shannon Airport at one stage.

I agree that the tents are a short-term solution and I hope that this is a very short-term solution.  However, such a situation brings into sharp focus the lack of investment in the Defence Forces over the past 30 years.  Do we have more tents if we need them?  Will we be able to erect them?

The US visitors that we would like to see coming back to west Cork in numbers this summer season seem to have a confidence issue in the marketplace at the moment.  We need to have a very significant debate about what will be done for the next three to six months on tourism, what actual projects will be pushed, and what advertising campaigns will be run to attract the numbers required to ensure a sustainable tourism industry.<\/p><p>The VAT issue must also be spoken about.  The VAT rate as it relates to the tourism trade is proposed to increase towards the end of the summer.  We should have a debate about this with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in this Chamber about what their plans are for the rate going forward.  We need to have an holistic approach about our tourism industry.  The world has changed dramatically in the past six weeks.  Ireland could have a scenario whereby it might not have the numbers we expected.  Do we need to start talking about a vacation policy?  Do we need to start promoting our own indigenous population to stay here with us to make sure we have a viable industry for the next six or eight months?  There is a lot of things happening in this area in a short time.  A real debate with the Minister for<b><\/b>Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in this Chamber in the next two weeks would go a long way to settle the nerves of the tourism industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#L00200","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

It is in the capital building programme, along with a new station in Macroom and the children's court.  Clonmel Garda station is ready to go, just like Macroom is, but it is being held up in the process because of the children's court in Dublin.  It is hugely frustrating.<\/p> <p>We have ambitious and amazing plans for a new Garda station on the site of Kickham Barracks in Clonmel.  It is for all the garda&iacute; who work in the district, and they have been waiting for it for a long time.  I would ask anyone to come to see the conditions in which garda&iacute; are currently working in Clonmel.  It is not fit for purpose at all, whether it is for the people working there or for the public coming in.  A new Garda station would do a lot to support the area and to build morale within the force in the area.  It is incredibly frustrating that through no fault of their own it has not progressed.  The most frustrating part about it is that we as a Government are developing Kickham Barracks at the moment, opening up it to the public with a new open plaza area.  There is a further development of an educational campus with T&uacute;s and the local education and training board.  It is going to be a fantastic area right in the heart of Clonmel.<\/p> <p>There is, however, a real problem with the slow progress of the Garda station.  I hope the Minister will be able to come to County Tipperary and Clonmel, in particular, at some point soon.  We need clarity.  When I speak to garda&iacute; there, many of them genuinely believe they will be well retired before the station is ever built.

Unfortunately, the health outcomes for cancer in the west are below par and below average when compared with the rest of the country.  One in two of us will get cancer at some stage in our lives.  Cancer treatment and proper treatment is hugely important across the State, especially in the west to bring us up to the average at least, or above average, in relation to healthcare.  Unfortunately, we have had decades of underinvestment in healthcare in the west.  Galway is the centre of excellence for cancer services and there are plans for a new cancer centre with inpatient beds as part of the national development plan. Treatment is top class in the facilities there, but new and more modern facilities are required.  People must travel long distances, be it from Letterkenny or parts of Sligo, to avail of cancer services.  That is the model.  It is the world best practice model in having centres of excellence and people travelling to them.  The biggest concern the consultants have in that regard is about providing beds and ensuring there are beds for the patients when they do arrive.  The Inis Aoibhinn facility on the grounds of University Hospital Galway provides a free and very important service for patients who travel.  They do an excellent job there but they are heavily reliant on fundraising services across the country.<\/p> <p>I ask the Deputy Leader for a debate on the capital plan as it relates to health.  There is sufficient interest in projects across the State so that it would be worth having a specific health debate on the capital plan, and on concerns about delays of many of the projects, such as the one for Galway relating to the emergency department and the elective hospital, where progress is slow.  I am sure there are also other examples across the State.

He made reference in particular to the America's Cup, which I know is of particular sensitivity to representatives in the Cork area.  The Senator had particular questions around resourcing from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and I have no doubt that he has been in touch with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, on the topic.  Perhaps the subject is worth a Commencement matter, if there are specific questions on that.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin welcomed the reforms of the leaving certificate that were announced yesterday by the Minister for Education  I concur with the Senator's remarks.  It is a significant day in terms of reform of education at second level in the senior cycle.  It is my view that were it not for the past two years we probably would not be seeing the kinds of reforms that were announced yesterday and the level of support to bring those reforms through.  I wish the Minister, her Department, all the schools across the State, the teachers and the students well in bringing these reforms through over the next years.  It is of particular note that we will no longer have such a pressurised and sole focus on one final set of examinations, which benefits students who are particularly adept at rote learning as opposed to actually focusing on knowledge and education.  More focus on learning throughout the two years of senior cycle is really welcome and it will make for a more modern leaving certificate.  I welcome also the new subjects in drama and climate.  Again, it shows that we are moving with the times.<\/p> <p>The Senator also welcomed the local just transition plan in Kildare, and she also raised issues around drink spiking, which is an issue across the country.  It is happening in every small town, village and city in the State.  It is a very worrying epidemic that is taking hold.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan welcomed the publication of the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan and Senator Malcolm Byrne, or their work on this.  The Senator also requested a debate on governance at local authority level following the \"Prime Time\", RT&Eacute; Investigates report last week.<\/p> <p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly spoke about a number of issues.  She spoke about the greening of Ireland and biodiversity, and she welcomed the end to fur farming as a result of the passage of the Animal Health and Welfare and Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021 through the Seanad yesterday.  She also welcomed the scheme for small-scale planting of native tree species, which was also announced yesterday.<\/p> <p>Senator Warfield welcomed the new centre for research and remembrance that will be located at Se&aacute;n McDermott Street in Dublin city at the former site of one of the Magdalen laundries.  I concur with the his remarks.  It is a really welcome use of that building and is a fitting tribute to the survivors of that awful institution.<\/p> <p>Senator Moynihan spoke about the Ukrainian refugee crisis and, in particular, the reports we are all hearing that there would be a tented village - if we can call it that - for emergency accommodation.  We would all share her concerns that this should not be a long-term solution.  I hope we could move people out of those tents as quickly as possible and into proper accommodation.  I also take on board comments from other Senators that we must be very careful it does not become a long-term measure.

She makes the reasonable suggestion that the limit be reviewed by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Conway also spoke about the Ukrainian refugee situation.  On a number of occasions now he has spoken about the numbers coming into County Clare and he thanked the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland for her recent visit to Clare to meet the people, which he said was really important.  He also raised issues around Shannon Airport, the changeover of personnel at the Shannon Group and the role of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Malcolm Byrne welcomed the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022.  He also made the suggestion with regard to mask wearing that people who are particularly vulnerable to Covid could wear a particular type of mask to make themselves identifiable as such.  That would give others an opportunity to be more careful or cautious around them.  I had not heard that until this morning and it seems like a sensible solution, if it is a choice.  If people would like to do that, it seems reasonable that it would be facilitated.  He also very adequately addressed accusations made against Fianna F&aacute;il<i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>Palestine.  I could not have put it better myself in terms of Fianna F&aacute;il's support, over many decades, for a two-state solution there.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Craughwell spoke about a briefing by Cancer Care West attended by a number of Senators, including Senator Kyne.  Some really stark figures were presented to Oireachtas Members by Cancer Care West on the outcomes for cancer patients in the west of Ireland.  We are consistently performing below the national average in terms of survival rates and outcomes.  One example that struck me this morning is that for patients who get breast cancer in the west of Ireland, the chances of survival are 80% compared to 86% in the east of the country, which is just unacceptable.  The same carries through for lung cancer and all other cancers.  We are consistently performing below the national average in terms of survival rates.  What was called for this morning, which all Members would support regardless of whether they are from the west of Ireland or not, is the delivery of a specialist cancer centre in University Hospital Galway, which is provided for in the national development plan but has not been delivered yet.  We will all be working collectively to try to get that delivered in the short term.  Senator Craughwell also raised the issue of the tented village and other issues related to the Defence Forces and their ability to respond to the needs presenting in the country because of the Ukrainian crisis.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Currie spoke about education and special education in particular.  She pointed to the fact the one quarter of the education budget goes towards special education.  She emphasised the need to ensure that applying for special needs assistance for students is not made onerous and difficult for parents.  There should be access to special needs support without parents having to fight for it.  <br\/><br\/>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the bomb alert in Belfast at the event organised by the John &amp;amp; Pat Hume Foundation.  I concur with his remarks and utterly condemn that incident and what happened.  It must have been a very frightening experience for those present on the day.  I am sure everyone in the House will join us in condemning those actions.  He also raised the Acht Na Gaeilge and the fact that the British Government has not acted on its commitment in that regard.  The Taoiseach has also dealt with this issue and commented on it publicly in recent days.  I concur with the remarks of Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and the Taoiseach on that issue.<br\/><br\/>Senator Maria Byrne welcomed the public consultation process that went live today on the M20 Limerick to Cork road.  She said that it is not clear whether it will be a motorway or a dual carriageway but that the public consultation process on the route is open for submissions.  She encouraged people to make their views known.  She also welcomed the recent opening of 71 homes in Limerick by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.<br\/><br\/>Senator Lombard requested a debate on tourism and the current situation in the industry.  I am happy to request such a debate on his behalf.  Senator Ahearn requested a justice debate.  He referenced a particular issue with regard to Clonmel Garda station and Macroom.  I advise him to submit a request for a Commencement matter debate because the issue is quite specific.  If that is not sufficient in terms of getting a reply, I ask him to let me or the Leader know and we will seek that justice debate for him.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, Senator Kyne spoke very well about the briefing from Cancer Care West to which I referred earlier.  He also requested a debate on capital projects in the context of the health budget.  As there are many health projects across the country in which all Senators would have an interest in getting some answers on, we will make a request of the Minister of Health for a debate on same as soon as possible.  <br\/><br\/>The Leas-Chathaoirleach made some remarks at the outset about proposed changes to the leaving certificate.  I want to acknowledge that on numerous occasions, he has advocated for points or acknowledgement to be given for students' extracurricular and recreational activities.  I have no doubt he is thrilled to see the reforms that were announced yesterday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#L00700","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Chambers for her acknowledgement of my input to the leaving certificate reform debate.

I do so in place of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, who unfortunately could not attend.<\/p> <p>The proposed regulations are aimed at amending the provisions in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 concerning development that is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Under the planning Acts, each House of the Oireachtas is required to approve draft planning regulations relating to exempted development by way of positive resolution before they can be made by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  As Senators will be aware, the Planning and Development Act 2000 section 181 regulations enacted in March 2020 currently ensure any temporary facilities required to respond to the Covid-19 emergency can be developed without the need for planning consent for the temporary period of the emergency.  These facilities include hospitals, isolation units, step-down facilities and testing and vaccination centres.  The duration of the 2020 planning regulations are linked to Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 and as such will expire on 31 March 2022 when this Act ceases to have effect.  When the 2020 planning regulations expire the exemptions provided for no longer apply and any developments listed in the schedule will become subject to the normal provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000.<\/p> <p>Community testing centres and community vaccination centres have been and remain an ongoing cornerstone of the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Access to these centres for people living around Ireland is ongoing necessity and ensures people can access these fundamentally important services.  Notwithstanding the expiry of the main Covid-19 emergency response legislation, the Department of Health has confirmed the HSE is required to continue to operate testing and vaccination centres in the months beyond the end of March.<\/p> <p>The proposed Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (Number 2) Regulations 2022 will replace the existing Planning and Development Act 2000 (Section 181) Regulations.  The replacement regulations are more limited in scope and relate to vaccination and test centres only.  The draft regulations amend class 20 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the principal planning regulations to allow the HSE to temporarily use specific existing public buildings as public vaccine and public infection testing centres without having to apply for change of use planning permission.  Following consultation with the HSE, the buildings to which this applies comprise schools, colleges, universities, training centres, social centres, community centres, non-residential clubs, art galleries, museums, libraries, reading rooms, sports clubs, stadiums, gymnasiums, hotels, convention centres, conference centres, shops, Defence Forces barracks, light industrial buildings, airport operational buildings, wholesale warehouses or repositories, local authority administrative offices or any structure normally used for public worship or religious instruction.  I am advised that the HSE aims to ensure that people have access to testing centres within a 45-minute drive of their place of residence.  Currently, this is the case with more of 90% of centres.  The inclusion of a broad list of buildings in the schedule will facilitate the continuation of the HSE's Covid-19 vaccination and testing programmes without interruption.  It is important the HSE can provide access to testing centres in as many locations as possible so if needed people have access as close to home as possible.<\/p> <p>These draft regulations do not propose to provide a blanket exemption.  The following specific conditions or limitations will apply to the proposed exemption, namely, the change of use is limited to a period of up to 12 months and the exemption only applies to change of use for the purposes of preventing and alleviating the risk to public health posed by the spread of specific infectious diseases listed in the infectious disease regulations 1981, such as Covid-19, for example.  It is proposed the draft regulations will expire two years after commencement.  If further use of these buildings as testing or vaccination centres is anticipated after this two-year period, the normal planning application procedures for change of use should be followed.  In addition, any change of use will be subject to general restrictions and exemptions as set out in the Planning and Development Act or regulations.  For example, the change of use shall not be exempted if an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment is required.<\/p> <p>I commend these draft regulations to the House and look forward to hearing Senators' contributions.  Given the importance and benefits arising from the regulations, I very much hope the regulations receive the approval of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#P00300","speaker":"1586"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, who is here in place of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  These are very important regulations as continue to grapple with the pandemic, though the severity of it is less.  It is an important and prudent move by Government to ensure we can continue to provide testing and vaccination centres to the public.  As the Minister of State rightly indicated, they should not be far away from people's localities and homes.  The Covid legislation lapses at the end of the month and it is important we are able to continue to provide those facilities.<\/p> <p>I note the limited scope of the regulations and the fact that the period involved is only 12 months.  Throughout the pandemic, there were broader regulations in place that allowed the HSE to provide additional facilities, especially in acute hospital settings, to alleviate overcrowding, the constraints on outpatient departments and so on.  To be frank, I found them to be positive regulations.  When you see developments on hospital grounds they are in the main not that contentious because everybody sees the wider benefit of them to the entire public.  While I welcome these regulations, I am a little disappointed that we did not continue some of the additional provisions for the likes of the acute hospital settings, in order to allow them be able to continue facilities.  I am aware that might be a little controversial because people will say we are now through the majority of the pandemic and the proper process should be gone through to get planning approval.  However, what I have found, especially in my own county and within University Hospital Waterford is some projects that perhaps would have been taking a significant period to deliver were delivered in a shorter period.  Much of that owed to the fact things could progress faster without having to go through all the various planning process.  In that context, there is probably something in there as we look forward from this point.  I appreciate we must get these regulations in place with haste but there is probably something in the additional measures that allowed the likes of the HSE to be able to provide additional facilities over and above testing and vaccination centres with speed.  I hope that is something Government can take on board in a wider context, so we can see a quicker provision of services and do not have unnecessary planning delays.  Of course, we must build some kind of consultation into that process as well but there is a lot to be said for being able to provide facilities, especially health facilities, in a speedy fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#P00400","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome.

As I said in my opening address, this is about the fact that the regulations brought forward in March 2020 ensured that temporary facilities required to respond to Covid-19 emergency measures could be developed without the need for planning consent for the temporary period of the emergency.  Since they were linked to the emergency measures in the public interest Act 2020, all those measures will cease and expire tomorrow night.  This means that the planning that underpins our current vaccination and testing centres and the ability of the Department of Health and the HSE to respond to potential future waves of Covid-19, with the need for vaccinations and testing and the associated flexibility, would fall tomorrow night if we did not have these statutory instruments.  That is what this process is about.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Chambers for her support and comments regarding these measures.  I share her sense of how important they are.  It is very important that we do not tie the hands of our public health officials in our response.<\/p> <p>Senator Warfield made a very valid point about communication with community groups that have those facilities.  It is fair to say that in the test centres and vaccination facilities being used at present that I am familiar with, all the groups involved were very happy to play their part.  The two-year time limit on this is fair in making sure that emergency powers are not taken for an overly long period because the health authorities now have an appropriate amount of time to respond to emergencies as they may develop.  Who knows where we will be in a few months' time with this pandemic?  Hopefully, we are over the worst as regards the emergency response but we know we are under pressure there.  Health authorities will now have the time, however, if they know they will require something more permanent beyond this next two-year cycle, to apply through the normal planning process in respect of those requirements, which is very important.<\/p> <p>As I mentioned in my opening speech, public community vaccination and testing centres are the cornerstone of the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Department of Health and the HSE will continue to operate testing and vaccination centres beyond the end of March, when the regulations providing the current exemption from the planning process expire.  As the HSE will continue to require flexibility in the establishment of these centres, sometimes at short notice and in non-medical buildings, replacement regulations are required.  The Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 2) Regulations 2022 will enable the HSE to continue operating its current testing and vaccination centres in non-medical buildings and will allow it to source alternative venues in a wide range of buildings, if required.  The regulations will enable the HSE to temporarily use these buildings without having to apply for change of use planning permission.<\/p> <p>I reiterate that specific conditions or limitations will apply to the proposed exemption.  The change of use is limited to a period of up to 12 months and the exemption only applies to change of use for the purposes of preventing and alleviating the risk to public health posed by the spread of specific infectious diseases listed in the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981, for example, Covid-19.  It is proposed that the draft regulations will expire two years following commencement.  If further use of these buildings as testing or vaccination centres is anticipated after the two-year period, the normal planning application procedures for change of use should be followed.<\/p> <p>I sincerely thank the Senators for their contributions.  Given the importance of testing and vaccination centres to our Covid-19 response, I very much hope the regulations will receive the approval of this House.  If these draft regulations are approved by a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, they will come into force as soon as they are signed.  In this regard, it is the intention of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to sign the regulations into law by 31 March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#Q00400","speaker":"1586"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648632600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648632600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an Seanad ar fionra&iacute; ar 1.08 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 1.45 p.m.\r\n\r\nSitting suspended at 1.08 p.m. and resumed at 1.45 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage","time":1648632600,"counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#U00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648632600,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and thank him for coming to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#U00300","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the Regulation of Providers of Buildings Works Bill 2022 to the Seanad.<\/p> <p>Many examples of building failure as a result of non-compliance with building regulations have come to light in recent years and may continue to emerge due to the absence of regulation in the construction sector.  This contributed significantly to the large number of buildings constructed in Ireland which did not comply with statutory minimum standards of design and construction as set out in the building regulations.<\/p> <p>The main objective of the Regulation of Providers of Building Works Bill 2022 is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the building regulations in the construction sector, which will benefit consumers and the general public.  The establishment of a robust, mandatory and statutory register is critical for the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.  Mandatory statutory regulation is necessary to protect the public from the risks posed by defective buildings as it is the only way to ensure that builders can only take on work in which they are competent and registered to undertake.<\/p> <p>Stronger compliance with building standards and the broader building control reform agenda are critical to key commitments made by the Government under Construction 2020 - A Strategy for Renewal of the Construction Sector.  Under Housing for All, Construction 2020 and the Action Plan for Jobs the Government signalled its commitment to placing the construction industry register Ireland, CIRI, on a statutory footing.<\/p> <p>Statutory registration of builders, as now provided for in the proposed Regulation of Providers of Building Works Bill 2022, is seen as an essential consumer protection measure giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  It is also seen as a critical step forward in addressing shadow economic activity in the construction sector and ensuring fairer competition for compliant operators in the industry.<\/p> <p>The CIRI register was established on a voluntary basis in 2014 by the Construction Industry Federation.  Approximately 800 building and contracting entities are currently included on the register.  When the register is operating on a statutory footing it is envisaged that there may be in the order of at least 5,000 entities that will be required to register.<\/p> <p>The legislation will require providers of building services to register with CIRI.  This will apply to entities or individuals who hold themselves out for consideration as a provider of building works for both residential and non-residential buildings subject to the building regulations.  It does not include employees of such entities but does include sole traders.  This will have a significant impact on all sections of the construction industry from small contractors and craftspeople up to the larger construction companies.<\/p> <p>Housing for All sets a target of an average of 33,000 dwellings per annum.  The State plans to invest &euro;20 billion in the next five years, which is the largest investment in the history of the State.  This requires a vibrant and innovative construction sector that supports the development of its existing <\/p> <p>The legislation will complement a number of key measures which the Government has put in place to strengthen the arrangements in place for the control of building activity following the widespread building failures that have emerged in recent years, including the revised Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (S.T. No. 9 of 2014), activation of registration arrangements for construction professionals provided for in the Building Control Act 2007, the development of the nationwide online building control management system and the move to risk-based, standardised inspections by local building control authorities.  In addition to these reforms, the Department is also committed to establishing an independent building standards regulator to strengthen the oversight role of the State with the aim of further reducing the risk of building failures, and enhancing public confidence in construction-related activity.<\/p> <p>I will now turn to the main provisions of this Bill.  The Bill is comprised of 64 sections.  It is divided into eight Parts and two Schedules as follows.<\/p> <p>Part 1 sets out standard provisions relating to the Short Title, commencement, interpretation exemptions and general powers to make orders and regulations.  It defines a \"provider of building services\", which is those who are covered by the Bill.  This legislation will apply to any builder holding itself out for consideration or receiving payment for carrying out building works which are subject to the building regulations.  It also outlines exemptions from registration such as electrical works which are covered under separate legislation.  Also exempt are those who do works on their own buildings.  This exemption does not apply to any contractor or subcontractor engaged.<\/p> <p>Part 2 provides for the appointment of a registration body, the requirements for such a body, the appointment of a registrar, staff and inspectors, the functions and obligations of the body, and the transfer of functions if required.  It provides for the remuneration of the boards, registrar and staff.  It contains provision in relation to the funding for and fees that may be charged by the registration body.<\/p> <p>Part 2 provides for the specification of fees related to registration and related activities, and the publication of an annual report by the registration body in relation to the discharge of its statutory functions under the Bill.  The registration body requires the consent of the Minister to set the registration fees.  The registration body is required to publish a report annually of its activities under the Act which shall be laid before the Oireachtas.  The Minister may direct the body to provide any other information required, including any document or account prepared by them.  Part 2 provides that the accounts of the registration body shall be audited and published, as appropriate.  Finally, it contains provision to provide funding from the Exchequer and also policy in relation to the code of practice.<\/p> <p>Part 3 provides for the establishment of the admissions and registration board, committees of the board and the appeals committee.  It contains appropriate safeguards to ensure the independence and objectivity of the registration board and the appeals committee.  I can advise that I will bring forward amendments to this Part of the Bill on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>Part 4 provides for the establishment of a mandatory statutory register of providers of building works to which the building regulations apply.  The registration body will have delegated responsibility for the day-to-day maintenance of the register within the confines of the specific and limited parameters set out in the Bill, and provides for the registration of builders, including builders specialising in specific building elements and technologies.  This will be achieved by establishing different divisions and subdivisions across the different elements of building works.  The criteria to be used to determine competence required is set out in this Part, and that criteria will be used to determine the specific criteria to require to be considered competent to be registered in each division.  Eligibility for registration can be achieved through qualifications, experience or a combination of both.<\/p> <p>Part 4 provides that a competent person must fulfil the criteria for registration.  It also outlines the procedures whereby a competent person leaves an entity and must be replaced.  In addition, this Part provides that a subsidiary of an entity may fulfil the competence criteria for registration.<\/p> <p>Part 5 provides for the operation of the register and outlines prohibitions against operating as a provider of building services while not registered.  It outlines the application process and the requirements for registration and renewal of registration.  These include a requirement to complete an induction course, undertake continuous professional development and provide evidence of tax clearance.  This Part provides that the admissions and registration board may grant registration where it is satisfied that the applicant is eligible, and may refuse registration where it is not satisfied that is the case.  It also provides for appeals of any such decisions.<\/p> <p>Part 6 provides for the handling of complaints and appeals from applicants in relation to registration decisions, and from complainants in relation to the activities or conduct of registered members.  It outlines the role and powers of the inspector who may investigate the complaint and the roles of the board, the appeals committee and the High Court in the imposition of sanctions.  The board may impose major sanctions, for example, the removal or suspension from the register which are subject to an appeals process and require confirmation by the High Court.<\/p> <p>Part 7 contains some miscellaneous provisions, including provision for offences and penalties.  It provides for publication of sanctions and convictions, arrangements for restoration to the register and transitional arrangements in the event of a change in the appointment of the registration body.<\/p> <p>Part 8 contains some administrative amendments to the Building Control Act 2007 regarding the statutory register for architects, building surveyors and quantity surveyors.<\/p> <p>Schedule 1 details the provisions applicable to oral hearings held by the admissions and registrations board.  Schedule 2 contains miscellaneous matters concerning the board and appeals committee, including provisions regarding the tenure of members and the procedures to be observed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In addition to these Parts, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will bring forward amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage in respect of data processing and governance.  These will be in line with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019.  I will also bring forward amendments to allow for the sharing of information by building control authorities on enforcement and prosecutions with the registration body.  In addition, as I indicated in the D&aacute;il on Report Stage, I will bring forward amendments to sections 21,22, 24, 26, 44 and 63.<\/p><p>Following enactment of the Bill, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will appoint a registration body on a statutory basis.  The main function of the registration body will be to assess the competence of any entity that wishes  to register using criteria that will be set out in legislation for each division or subdivision of the register.  These criteria will be relevant experience or qualifications or a combination of both.  The registration body will establish committees to advise the Minister on these criteria, which will then be set out in legislation.  The committees will be voluntary in nature and will be made up of public sector and industry representatives.  Following this process, entities will join the register and must demonstrate they hold the appropriate competence to do so.  There will be a statutory admissions and registration board and appeals board.  It will operate in a similar way to statutory registration schemes for other professions.<\/p><p>I am out of time but still have several sections to deal with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#V00400","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Minister after Members come in with their contributions.

It is a significant and lengthy Bill that runs to 65 sections, as he referenced.  That is why he has not managed to get through all of his speech thus far.  The Bill and its provisions are contained in the Housing for All policy document produced by the Government.  It is an important measure to put the register on a statutory footing.<\/p> <p>Pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill was carried out by the previous joint committee back in 2017.  I was not a member of the committee at the time but I know Senator Boyhan and possibly other Members were on it and there was significant engagement and wide consultation.  Many of the details have been incorporated in the Bill.<\/p> <p>The main objective of the Bill is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the building regulations in the construction sector, which will benefit consumers and the public.  The building control regulations 2015 to 2017 required the owner of a proposed building to sign a statutory form assigning a competent builder to undertake works.  In general, building regulations require owners, builders and registered construction professionals to demonstrate that the works in question have been designed and constructed in compliance with building regulations.  However, the regulations do not require that the builder so assigned be registered with the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI.  That is what we are trying to resolve here by putting it on a statutory footing.  This is critical for developing a culture and competency within the construction sector.  It has been in place on a voluntary basis since 2014 and administered by the Construction Industry Federation, CIF.  As the Minister of State noted, there are approximately 800 building and contracting entities on the register.  As it is expected that number will increase considerably, to up to approximately 5,000 entities, it is appropriate to have a lead-in period because it will take considerable time, notwithstanding the urgency of getting it in place on a statutory footing.<\/p> <p>I welcome that the legislation provides that the register is open to all builders, whether sole traders, partnerships or registered companies.  They must demonstrate competence in construction at the appropriate level, commit to continuing professional development and knowledge of building practice, building regulations and regulatory obligations, and confirm tax compliance.  As part of that, there is a declaration that any convictions under health and safety or building control legislation, or both, are provided for.  They must have the appropriate public liability insurance and must undertake to adhere to the code of conduct, as well as completing the CIRI induction module online.  Those are all important provisions within the Bill. <\/p> <p>An important provision of the Bill is that which allows for complaints against registered builders to be made on several grounds.  In particular, a complaint may be made against an entity providing a building service in a category for which it is not registered.  There have been incidents in the past where people and contractors have been engaged in building and construction without the appropriate qualifications and competencies being in place, with disastrous effect.  It is welcome that there is a measure to allow complaints to be made.  Obviously, those complaints will be adjudicated by the registration and appeals board.  <\/p> <p>In summation, I welcome the Bill.  It is an important and welcome step to put this register on a statutory footing.  That lead-in time is appropriate.  All present would like it in place more quickly but there is a significant body of work to be done to get all that in place within 2023, given the anticipated increase from 800 to more than 5,000 entities.  I wish the Minister of State well as we take the Bill through the various Stages and I look forward to engaging on Committee and Report Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#W00300","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is important and timely legislation.  It has been a long time coming.  At the outset, I acknowledge the enormous work of a former colleague of the Minister of State, and former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, Maria Bailey.  I am looking at her name on the report and the seven key recommendations dated December 2017.  She did an enormous amount of work.  She was exceptionally focused in this area.  She had a huge interest in construction and building and, of course, had significant experience as a councillor on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  It was only in recent days when I was preparing my contribution on the Bill that I realised how important a role she played, how she led and her enormous experience.  I acknowledge that and I know other Members will join me in acknowledging her work.<\/p> <p>Senator Casey, who was formerly a Deputy, was Vice Chairman of that committee and did a significant amount of work.  He brought a common-sense approach to the construction sector and had significant experience on Wicklow County Council.<\/p> <p>I also wish to acknowledge the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  Many people do not give it enough credit.  I always tell any good Minister to consult the Oireachtas Library and Research Service or get his or her colleagues to do so.  The service tells me it does not provide departmental advice but, rather, prepares information for Oireachtas Members.  Any good and clever Minister, however, would take sight of this Bill digest document because it teases out all of the seven recommendations, not all of which have been included completely in the legislation.<\/p> <p>One has to ask why not all of the seven recommendations have been completely included.  There may be good and valid reasons for that.  We have moved on from 2017 and learned a lot since then.  That is important.  I will certainly be tabling amendments based on the Bill digest prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service to the Bill as it is before us today..  I advise the officials, if they have time - I know they do - to take a look at the Bill digest.  The first line that jumps out at me in the summary is, \"It is anticipated that the responsibility for operation of the statutory CIRI will remain with the CIF.\"  That may not be what happens.  It may not be appropriate or the right thing to do.  I am highlighting that as a challenge.  Some people may refer to the independence of the CIF.  It is an able and professional organisation but it may be the case that some people will be uncomfortable with it having that responsibility.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That must be challenged and we must look at other models and international practice.  It is something we should consider.  It is great when we have fine granular detail from the Bill digest carried out for us by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service team.  I acknowledge that and it is important.<\/p><p>There are seven key recommendations and I was on the committee that dealt with those aspects.  We dealt with the independence of the register and board membership and the clarification regarding the regulatory impact analysis, RIA.  This digest document suggests there is currently no RIA element attached to the Bill.  That is something we will be looking for and that we should be seeing.  It makes absolute sense to have it.  The sooner the RIA is conducted for this legislation, the better.  We also looked at the registration categories for prescribed bodies, the definition of competences and consumer protection and financial redress and insurance.  These are key aspects.  There is also the question of accountability and transparency, which is important in every walk of life, as well as the complaints procedure.<\/p><p>I wanted to raise those few points but I fully recognise the need for and support this Bill.  I may seek to table one or two amendments to it later.  I acknowledge that the main objective of the proposed legislation is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with building regulations within the building community and the construction sector, and that is important.  It is about establishing a robust mandatory and statutory register for builders and specialist contractors, which is essential in protecting customers.  That is really important.<\/p><p>As others said, under the Government's housing strategy, Housing for All, which was published on 2 September 2021, key housing policy objective No. 25 looks to \"drive compliance and standards through regulatory reform\" and \"embed compliance in the construction sector through building regulations and building control regulations,\" and assessment of building control structures, \"including establishing registers of competent builders by placing the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) on a statutory footing\".  That commitment has been made and the Government is honouring it, which I acknowledge.  I support all of that.<\/p><p>I will turn to section 22 of the Bill, which deals with the registration body and would establish an independent 11-person admissions and registration board.  It is key that this is independent.  The board will consist of the chairperson and ten ordinary members, which is important.  We must have full regard to gender concerns and a mix of skill sets, which is also important.  I acknowledge that the chairperson could, according to the Bill, be a former judge of the Circuit Court, the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court.  That may not be the case but it is what the Government is proposing.  Of the ordinary members, five shall be nominated by the Minister and five shall be nominated for appointment by the registration boards.  It is important to get broad consensus on how the members are appointed.<\/p><p>In essence, I support this process but we should give credit and support to an Oireachtas joint committee established by these Houses that has done much work and drawn on many people with expertise in the area.  Let us take from them and the key recommendations that formed the background to this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#W00400","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I am delighted to welcome my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, to the House today.  We all know he is no stranger to the House and is here on a regular basis.  It can be hard to get anybody else from the Department here and he might look for a bit of a dig out.<\/p> <p>It would be remiss of me not to mention Dr. Dermot Fitzpatrick today.  Senator Mary Fitzpatrick has done much work on this, as we are aware, and she would be speaking to the Bill today except her father, a former Member both of this House and the D&aacute;il, was buried on Monday.  It is fitting that I mention this today.  The light of heaven to him.<\/p> <p>This is a wide-ranging and comprehensive Bill.  I have been on to the Minister of State's office on a couple of occasions about different parts of it, and it goes from regulation to registered bodies to formation of a new board, as Senator Boyhan just mentioned.  The Minister of State certainly has the full support of this side of the House and most of the House is probably quite happy with the Bill's general thrust.<\/p> <p>I have experience of heavy regulation being introduced in the auctioneering fraternity.  There were many bumps on the road and we did not properly envisage some of the unintended consequences at the time.  This is being tied to the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, as a sort of regulatory body but much of the sector is quite well regulated in terms of training and cards required to go on sites.  There is quite a bit of regulation for anybody working day to day in the industry.<\/p> <p>I know the Bill has a different aspect, in that it probably seeks to have building companies and whatever else registered, but I want to tease this out.  There may be a building company that has been trading for a long time and it may be reputable but nobody working there might have certified qualifications.  In the auctioneering sector, there was a \"grandfathering\" element, meaning people who demonstrated experience working in the industry over a long period, or those who could demonstrate they were involved and insured over a certain period, could get a formal auctioneering licence.  Where is the bar going to be set in getting accreditation in this area?  I know anybody can join an organisation or a body like CIF, as they may now, and it is not a big ordeal.  That organisation inquires about particular qualifications and what qualifications each member of staff in a company might have.<\/p> <p>From the tenor of this Bill, it is implied that there will be more regulation in that regard so I am just curious how that process will fit in, especially when we are in the middle of a housing crisis.  The last thing we want to see is people with the knowledge and experience gained over a long number of years saying to themselves at this point in their lives that they need to get into more regulation, red tape and whatever else.  The last thing we want to do is lose anybody from the sector.  I could be as far out as a lighthouse in that and the Minister of State may tell me something different but I am curious to hear about it.  How we deal with such people will be very important.  There is no doubt we want people with the relevant skills and knowledge to be involved and regulated.  We are certainly heavily behind such a process.  I just do not want to see anybody falling through the cracks, as happened to a point with the introduction of a certain bar of qualification or knowledge in the auctioneering sector.  I am curious to know how the Department will deal with it.  This Bill deals with many trades and the people involved may not be as well co-ordinated in terms of college and mainstream education as the auctioneering sector.  I am curious to know how the matter will be teased out.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill.  Much work has been put into it and it is very technical.  There are even elements relating to defective building materials and there is a plethora of matters to be teased out.  I wish the Minister of State well with it.

We know building regulation has not been prioritised and the consequences continue to blight the lives of people in the State.  That is why the Bill is welcome.<\/p> <p>There is greater regulation supporting consumers going to the local shops than for citizens who are buying a home.  That is of particular concern as a home is probably the biggest investment people will make.  We have a voluntary system of regulation and it is proposed that this will be put on a statutory footing with the Construction Industry Federation.  I have concerns about the CIF managing and maintaining the register because of the potential conflict of interest.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Understanding that it is a trade union, or a form of a trade union, I still believe it is a concern that this will be the body maintaining this.<\/p><p>There are other aspects of the Bill that worry me.  It appears that no obligation will be placed on the developer to use the services of a registered builder.  It will be up to the developer to decide whether to do that.  This may have implications for the developer in time, but there does not appear to be any requirement or obligation set down in the legislation for anybody to use those registered builders.  That is particularly problematic when it comes to local authorities, for example.  The Minister of State says that he wants compliance and to drive better standards, but it seems that elements of the legislation are toothless.  There is a risk of big developers using builders who are not registered and who may not have the required compliance and qualifications.  Significantly, if developers do not engage registered builders but continue to use the services of those who may not be on the register, that has implications for competition.  We have seen time and again that a minority of bad builders and poor operators in the sector are not compliant even with things such as the sectoral employment order system set down for the construction sector to guarantee basic legal minimum standards of pay, terms and conditions.  That allows them to low ball when they are making tenders and organise the lowest tenders for significant construction projects, undercutting the good operators in the system.<\/p><p>I also believe that strong consumer protection legislation would allow consumers to go after the developer where there are deficiencies in that regard.  Where a developer fails to engage providers of building works who are on the register, there should be implications for that developer afterwards.  The complaints procedure created in the Bill will allow a person to make a complaint to the registrar that the building provider is carrying out works while not registered or has not complied with the conditions of the registration.  The registrar will then generally refer the complaint to the board of investigation unless it falls into a variety of exceptions.  I refer to the question of privilege.  All complaints made to the board, investigations and reports are absolutely privileged.  That is fine.  However, if a series of complaints is made against somebody and the person is a serial offender, that should not be subject to absolute privilege, particularly if the stated objective of the legislation is to protect consumers and to regulate the industry.  We need to know, and should be able to know, who the rogue builders are and what sanctions have been applied to them.  There have been too many problems with people who have been involved with defective buildings then going on to other projects and operating as if none of that ever happened because of the planning Act.  The default position has to be that if there is information on serial offenders, it is provided to the public so they know and are fully briefed on who the rogue operators are.<\/p><p>Finally, there should be a statutory entitlement for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, which has been so involved in campaigns relating to housing, to be represented on the board.  The trade union movement has significant expertise in identifying issues in the sector that it represents.  It is not just the CIF that has the experience and background in the building industry.  ICTU and the trade unions involved from a workers' perspective should also be represented on the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#X00300","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>This legislation is long overdue.  The Law Reform Commission proposed such legislation back in 1977, and it was again proposed by Mr. Phil Hogan in 2014.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the legislation, as it did in the D&aacute;il.  While the construction industry register has existed voluntarily since 2014, we have to ensure that it is truly independent in nature.  Sinn F&eacute;in has expressed the view that a construction industry register should be truly independent.  That means independent of the industry and not located within the industry, that is, the Construction Industry Federation.  The Government never advanced the idea of a statutory register as initially proposed by the Law Reform Commission and to this day is insisting that it be located within the industry.  Its home will be in, among other things, a lobbying organisation.  It is our firm view that such a register should be located within the National Building Control Office, NBCO.  Indeed, we proposed an amendment to this effect on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  There is a chance for this Bill to be an extremely effective protection when it comes to rogue builders.  That is why the NBCO is the appropriate home for the register.<\/p> <p>The register will be established over the next two years.  I note that registration is required from 2024.  Is such a long lead-in time really necessary?  The register has been in place voluntarily since 2014 so why do we need another two years up to 2024?<\/p> <p>I will conclude with that.

I thank him for coming to the Seanad.  I welcome this Bill.  Its main purpose is to raise standards in the construction industry, which is badly needed.  There has been a legacy from cowboys, as Father Ted would say, with lots of people having got away with low standards.  This is an important Bill to undo that.  Having a proper register is welcomed by all the builders and building suppliers I know.  They are the ones doing a good job.  They have often been left to deal with the mess that has been left behind by cowboys.  Plain and simple, this is an important Bill.<\/p> <p>The complaints mechanism is very good.  I will not even begin to talk about the pyrite and mica situation because we have discussed it at length.  I have been in contact with the Minister again about the Clare houses being included in the scheme.  Clare County Council and departmental officials have met and are working on getting more proof for the Department that the Clare houses are defective and will be included in the scheme as soon as possible, to put people's minds at rest.<\/p> <p>It is important that the register remains independent.  I trust that this will be of paramount importance and a priority for the Department when establishing it.  In the programme for Government, under planning and reform, we said we would examine the creation of an independent building standards regulator to oversee building controls nationwide and to act as custodian of the building control management system.  That is what the Minister of State is doing today.  He is delivering on a promise made in the programme for Government.  It is important for people to know that this coalition Government is doing well on all the promises we made.  They were not empty promises based on false economics.  These are things that we are manifesting and we are going to make this a better country.<\/p> <p>Many people I know have been affected by bad building and bad building materials.  The good builders and the good building suppliers who have always sought to do things well have been tarnished with the same brush, so it is good that this legislation will separate the men from the cowboys.  The industry is struggling and we need builders more than we ever have previously because of the housing crisis and the opportunities with retrofitting, so it is important that we do all we can to support the good builders and the good tradesmen.<\/p> <p>To that end, I wish to refer to an issue that will arise, although it has already been flagged.  Many building contractors had put in quotes for building projects for the State and others and, unfortunately, those costs have gone up exponentially.  I am aware that some recompensation was done retrospectively last year, but it does not appear to be enough in many cases.  Some builders might have to get out of the industry altogether.  We will have to examine that.  The State cannot bail out everybody all the time for whatever reason, but that will be a serious issue.  Builders will have to be paid more because the cost of materials has increased so much.  I do not know if the State can afford to bail them out completely or how it can do it, but we have to take the issue seriously because we have to build 33,000 houses.  There are thousands of houses to retrofit and it is hoped that with the new derelict buildings legislation we will be able to get many more unused buildings back into use.  However, we need tradesmen and builders for that.  They are probably the most important workforce in Ireland at present so we need to hold onto as many of them as possible and to encourage many more people to get involved as well.  This Bill is welcome because it will support the people who have been doing it well and who will continue to do it well.<\/p> <p>There is another matter that I would like the Minister of State to refer back to the Department.  I have been raising it since my first week in the Seanad.  The Safe Pass programme is still not available online.  Builders still regularly ring me to say that their lads cannot go off to Roscommon at the last minute on a Tuesday to do it.  There is a backlog of people who need a Safe Pass.  This has been done online in England for years.  I have been in contact with SOLAS several times but I have had no luck.  This is not a complicated thing.  The Safe Pass should be available online and done quickly.  We have a housing crisis and a building crisis.  We need to recruit as many young people as possible.  Where people have to update their Safe Pass or need a new Safe Pass, it should not be a barrier.  I ask the Minister of State to refer that back to the Department and perhaps contact the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, or the Minister of State at the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Niall Collins.  I do not know who the person is, but I have been asking anybody and everybody.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The safe pass needs to go online.

In the first instance, I acknowledge that we will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to provide that certain members of the board shall be recruited through the Public Appointments Service, a point that was raised during the D&aacute;il Committee Stage.  It is a very important point that we are happy to comply with.  We shall also ensure that the following shall nominate members: the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage; the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science; the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and the registration body.  As I said, we will bring forward amendments in that regard.  I want to underscore that an unregistered builder may not provide building works to anyone, whether it is the State, a developer or an individual.  The safe pass is the responsibility of the Health and Safety Authority and is something that we can refer to it, on foot of the comments of Senator Garvey.  In response to Senator Davitt, there is a lead-in time for registration, to which I will attend shortly.<\/p> <p>Once this legislation is enacted, all builders will be required to register with the construction industry register Ireland, CIRI.  Section 33 provides that an unregistered builder may not provide building works for anyone, whether it is for a State contract, a developer or an individual, as I just referenced.  This is a register of competence.  It is an essential consumer protection measure giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  It will also be a critical step forward in addressing shadow economic activity in the construction sector and ensuring fairer competition for compliant and competent operators in the industry.  This obligation will apply to entities or individuals who hold themselves out for consideration as a provider of building works that are subject to the building regulations.  It does not include employees of such entities but includes sole traders.  Applicants from other member states will be assessed on the same basis as Irish applicants.<\/p> <p>I would like to reassure Members that entry on the register is open to all builders, whether sole traders, partnerships or registered companies, who demonstrate competence in construction at the appropriate level of registration.  Competence can be demonstrated through qualifications, experience or a combination of both.  While formal qualifications are an important component of any statutory registration process, it is recognised that many excellent builders do not hold such qualifications but can demonstrate extensive experience and expertise.  Continuous professional development obligations will ensure that builders will continue to upskill throughout their careers.<\/p> <p>The construction industry will require time to adapt to these new requirements so the requirement to register will be introduced on a phased basis.  The register will be divided into categories of building works.  Builders can begin registering in 2023 and statutory registration will commence in early 2024 for these first categories.  It is proposed that the first categories that will be required to register will be home builders and builders of non-residential buildings, followed by the various trades.<\/p> <p>In advance of registration, committees of experts established by the board will consult with the various categories of the industry and other stakeholders.  Very specific criteria will be established for each category of providers of building services and these will be set out in secondary legislation.  This will ensure that the criteria required for registration will be clear and transparent.  Some applicants may find that they need to gain additional experience or a qualification to achieve these criteria.  It would not be fair or constitutional to remove a person&rsquo;s right to earn a livelihood without giving them the opportunity to gain this additional competence.<\/p> <p>It is preferable that a body with experience and expertise in the construction industry performs this function, similar to how the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, operate statutory registers for architects and surveyors.  It is envisaged that the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, will be appointed as the registration body.  There are a number of safeguards in place to ensure and maintain the independence of the registration body.  The registration body will have delegated responsibility for the day-to-day maintenance of the register within the confines of the specific and limited parameters set out in the Bill.  The board of the registration body will be completely independent of the body.  The independence of the registration body will be maintained through the following measures: all powers of the registration body will be prescribed in legislation; all competency requirements for registration will be recommended by the board and prescribed by the Minister; the board will make decisions in relation to all sanctions, including removal from the register; removal from the register must be confirmed by the High Court; all prosecutions under the Act will be taken by the board or the Director of Public Prosecutions; all members of the appeals committee will be independent from the board and the registration body; and the Bill allows the functions of the registration body to be transferred if the body is not performing its functions satisfactorily.<\/p> <p>It is anticipated that Exchequer funding will be required for the first two years of operation.  Once statutory registration is implemented, the income from fees will cover the costs incurred.  The registration fees can only be fixed at a level sufficient to fund the statutory register and will also require the consent of the Minister.  My Department will ensure that the registration body becomes self-financing as soon as possible, in line with the oversight provisions as set out in the Bill.<\/p> <p>The Bill provides for complaints against registered builders to be made on a number of grounds, in particular in regard to the competence of the builder or a builder providing services in a category in which they are not registered.  The Bill provides for a range of both major and minor sanctions to be imposed after investigation, including removal from the register.  This is a very serious sanction which effectively removes that person&rsquo;s right to earn a living as a builder or from their particular trade.  Upon conviction on indictment, a fine of up to &euro;500,000 or imprisonment can be imposed.  The Bill also provides for an appeals process in regard to registration decisions and for complainants in regard to the activities or conduct of registered members.<\/p> <p>I want to be very clear about the purpose of this Bill.  It is essentially a register of competence.  Failure to comply with building regulations or fire safety regulations will continue to be dealt with by the building control authorities.  This legislation is a key component of the ongoing building control reform agenda, which also includes the amendments made to the building control regulations.  This proposed statutory register will complement the reforms made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 and contribute to the development of an enhanced culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.  The Department is committed to establishing an independent building standards regulator to strengthen the oversight role of the State, with the aim of further reducing the risk of building failures and enhancing public confidence in construction-related activity.<\/p> <p>In regard to building defects, the Minister has established a working group to examine defects in housing.  The group is engaging with a range of interested parties, including homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals and industry stakeholders, among others, to examine the issue of defects in housing and report to the Minister on the matter.<\/p> <p>This legislation is committed to in Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan for housing to 2030 and it will support the delivery of quality housing.  I would like to acknowledge and thank the Members for their contributions.  I look forward to working closely with all Members as we continue the passage of this key legislation through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#Z00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648632600,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#Z00400","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#Z00500","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

This motion is our collective view.  It passionately reflects the united commitment of my colleagues to ensure that the words &quot;I stand with Ukraine&quot; have real meaning in the lives of those who are fleeing this murder.  I thank the Minister for taking this today.  I have been in Normandy on 6 June.  I have watched the commemorations of the lives lost in the Second World War, the front rows filled with the yearly dwindling numbers of veterans who stand shoulder to shoulder in honour, remembering that they fought for freedom in the face of a man who believed that whole nations did not deserve to exist.  They saw some horrific atrocities and the genocide of the Holocaust and they conquered. <\/p><p>I have stood in Ypres at the Menin Gate during the sounding of the last post at 8 p.m. which has been done every night since 1928 with the exception of the Second World War years, remembering those who died for freedom and independence in the so-called war to end all wars, and I have stood reading the names of the Irish men who made the ultimate sacrifice.  We have a medal at home from the Great War, given to my husband's grandfather, who left an impoverished Dublin, unable to find work in the fallout from the 1913 Lock-out.  He joined the British army as a means to feed his family.  He never once spoke of what he saw or experienced, not just because it was culturally impermissible in post-1916 Ireland, but because the trauma of it was unimaginable.  <\/p><p>The United Nations and the European Union were both born from a desire to ensure that there would never be war on such a scale again.  The European Union in particular was founded on the principle of ensuring peace in Europe.  It is therefore unthinkable that for the first time in seven decades, Europe again faces a war where one person and his regime have decided that a democratic nation does not have a right to exist.<\/p><p>Ukraine is a noble nation that chose a democratic pathway towards its free and independent nationhood, that aspired to build relationships with and take its place in Europe in wanting to join the European Union.  It voted, it decided, so the idea that some other nation would deny its legitimacy is outrageous and immoral.  It is a barbaric assault on democracy.  Putin has launched an assault on Ukraine because he is afraid of democracy, afraid of Ukraine's freedom to democratically choose its government and the possibility that Russia itself would so chose.  We have seen the most egregious atrocities, we have heard the stories of horrific war crimes told to us by the familiar faces of journalists we know and trust.  We have seen the images of bloodied civilians, of bodies in the street.  I shudder to think every day of what might be happening to the women in Mariupol.  In recent days we have heard reports that more than 6,000 residents of Mariupol have been forcibly deported and taken to Russia.  This evokes a painful memory and echoes of history for Ukrainians of the trauma of mass deportations inflicted by Soviet Union between 1936 and 1952, when more than 60,000 Ukrainians and Poles were forcibly deported to Siberia.  <\/p><p>Putin's threat regarding &quot;consequences greater than any of you have faced in history&quot; is not just a threat to Ukraine.  Indeed it is a threat to the West and to the whole world.  It is extraordinary that we watch, live, as Russia shuts down information to its own people as their president sells them lies.  We watch with horror from our free democracy the stories from our history books incredibly springing to life, stories of mass oppression and of murder happening live before our eyes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I looked up Tripadvisor to see what it would say about the restaurants in Mariupol.  It has very impressive photographs of beautiful restaurants with four-star recommendations but they are a grim reminder of a life that is no more and a city pummelled to the ground.  Even if there is a cessation of the murder tomorrow, Ukraine will already have lost so much.  This is to say nothing of the thousands who will never see their loved ones alive again.  Therefore, it is absolutely right that we embrace those fleeing Ukraine with open arms, think about the women and children arriving on our shores and cherish them and catch them as they, in the safety of Ireland, come to realise the shock of what has happened and await news of what is to come.  We stand shoulder to shoulder with them as they mourn their lives as they knew them and come to terms with the trauma that has befallen them.  It is absolutely right that we embrace them.<br\/><br\/>I am so proud of the Irish people&rsquo;s openness and generosity.  This war will not be without a cost to us as a people; it will not be without pain to us.  We have to brace ourselves for what may lie ahead and is yet unknown.  I am so proud of what has been done in the name of the Irish people by our Government, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, who led the charge in Europe and the UN in ensuring action against Russia.  I am also proud of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, who stepped forward very early to break down the barriers associated with documentation that may have delayed women and children in coming to Ireland, and of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, who made personal public service, PPS, numbers available at the point of arrival and ensured financial supports would be provided.  Each Department has played an extraordinary role.  I am really pleased with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which continues to be instrumental in providing accommodation, supports and care, including childcare.  These Departments have been followed by the Departments of Education and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Instrumental decisions have been made by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on supports for farmers in Ireland as we brace ourselves for the impact.<br\/><br\/>Our Government has really stepped up and has been decisive in its support of our fellow nation and citizens.  I am very proud of my Fine Gael party colleagues and their decisive leadership.  I am also proud of the decisions made in private without any publicity and that have put life, care and support first.  I am proud that having a harp on one&rsquo;s passport really means something.  It means that those affected by the changes and horror in Ukraine are supported by this State and its Government.<br\/><br\/>It is really important that we do not look away.  We must not dilute our resolve.  We must remember our Ukrainian brothers and sisters at all times.  Our initial reaction of embrace must be maintained, and we must support each other as a nation to ensure we continue to stand with Ukraine.  We must not get used to what we are seeing on television.  We must not soften in our horror over the annihilation of a nation and its people.  When we look back at this time, what will we think of ourselves and our actions?  Will we have done all we could possibly have done?<br\/><br\/>Now is not the time to debate neutrality; no objective discussion could take place in the face of the atrocities we are seeing.  Now is the time to stand strong and be biased in favour of a people and the humanitarian care they require.  These people have chosen democracy, especially while we cherish our own.  Now is the time when we must step up our efforts, ensuring the women and children coming among us in trauma and mourning will not want for anything.  Hence, we have set out this motion and all its needs and asks.  Yes, that means sharing resources that are already stretched.  It means sharing our spaces, even our private spaces, with strangers who will become friends.  When we stand with Ukraine, we stand for democracy.  We are standing against a bully and for our own way of life.<br\/><br\/>When I first spoke about Ukraine in this House, I quoted the press release from the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum.  It is particularly poignant.  It states Auschwitz has seen atrocities and also blue skies.  With the indulgence of the House, I will end with a Jewish poem of remembrance because it fits this occasion:<\/p><blockquote>\tAt the rising of the sun and at its going down<br \/><br \/>We remember them.<br \/><br \/>At the blowing of the wind and in the chill of winter<br \/><br \/>We remember them.<br \/><br \/>At the opening of the buds and in the rebirth of spring<br \/><br \/>We remember them.<br \/><br \/>At the blueness of the skies and in the warmth of summer<br \/><br \/>We remember them.<br \/><br \/>At the rustling of the leaves and in the beauty of autumn<br \/><br \/>We remember them.<br \/><br \/>At the beginning of the year and when it ends<br \/><br \/>We remember them.<br \/><br \/>As long as we live, they too will live; <br \/><br \/>For they are now a part of us<br \/><br \/>As we remember them.<br \/><br \/>When we are weary and in need of strength<br \/><br \/>We remember them.<br \/><br \/>When we are lost and sick at heart<br \/><br \/>We remember them.<br \/><br \/>When we have joy we crave to share<br \/><br \/>We remember them.<br \/><br \/>When we have decisions that are difficult to make<br \/><br \/>We remember them.<br \/><br \/>When we have achievements that are based on theirs<br \/><br \/>We remember them.<br \/><br \/>As long as we live, they too will live; <br \/><br \/>For they are now a part of us<br \/><br \/>As we remember them.  <\/blockquote><p>I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#JJ00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I second the motion.  I thank Senator Seery Kearney for proposing this motion and her very moving contribution.  From the Government support and, I hope, the cross-party support in the Seanad and the rest of the Oireachtas, it is very clear that Ireland condemns the war in Ukraine.  I very much want to pay tribute to President Zelenskiy and his country and Government for defending a democracy.  I hope the peace talks will come to a resolution.  They have to.<\/p> <p>It falls to Ireland to support a country in crisis.  As my colleague has said, the Government is acting on all fronts, which is excellent to see.  As Fine Gael spokesperson on education, further and higher education, research, innovation and science, I confirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to access to education for people from Ukraine.  Close to 15,000 people have now arrived in Ireland.  One third of them are children and young people under 18.  We expect to see 20,000 by the end of the month, which will be in another few days, and a rise to perhaps 40,000 by the end of next month, and then even more.<\/p> <p>Towns across Ireland have come together to organise collections and make financial donations.  It has been incredible.  We have seen people really pulling together.  What kept us strong during the lockdown is coming to the fore again, that is, the sense of community spirit and the empathy of Irish people.  Generations before us knew what it was like to face this type of devastation and starvation.  We know about it from our history.  Forty percent of the buildings in Mariupol are destroyed.  The people from there are fleeing devastation, death and starvation.  They may never be able to return to Ukraine.<\/p> <p>In speaking about this motion, I am speaking specifically about support for children at primary, post-primary and third levels.  We have to ensure routine and normality for these children because these are so important.  The children are leaving a war, so we need to ensure that we have supports in place to minimise disruption to their education when they arrive.  We must also ensure that well-being and counselling supports are available.  We must provide teachers with the resources to support the children during such trauma.<\/p> <p>In towns across Ireland, there are major capacity issues.  Primary schools are at their maximum enrolment levels.  This story is replicated in certain areas in towns, making things very difficult.  We need classrooms and prefabricated structures.  The latter will be required in urgent circumstances.  We need teaching supports and assistants teaching English as an additional language, EAL, in all our schools.  We welcome the liaison groups that are to be set up through education and training boards across the country and call on the Department of Education to provide accelerated teaching supports and additional accommodation for primary and post-primary schools, using the national inventory of school capacity.  That will be a great way for us to identify schools that have the capacity, and also support those that do not right now but that could, to ensure we can provide for Ukrainian children.  It has to be co-ordinated through the education and training boards and county liaison committees.  We must increase the number of posts, including those of national educational psychologists, in schools at primary and post-primary levels.<\/p> <p>At third level, we must examine supports for students across a number of areas.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, under his Department, has highlighted the opportunity to use the Erasmus programme to fund scholarships at European level.  We must also consider maintenance supports in addition to expanding the availability of English-language courses within our education and training boards.  In Fine Gael, we are calling for the expansion of the Erasmus programme and the removal of financial and regulatory barriers for students and researchers who wish to continue with their studies.  We are supporting adjustments to the SUSI programme to ensure Ukrainian students are supported to attend at third level.  Again, we must see the expansion of courses in English for speakers of other languages, ESOL, in all our education and training boards, which are in every town across the country.  This is something we can achieve.  We need to ensure qualifications are recognised in Ireland and that people can start working as per the temporary protection directive.<\/p> <p>During the pandemic, including the lockdowns, we saw a huge community call.  I am sure the Minister of State witnessed this in his area, including GAA and other sports clubs.  People pulled together.  Again, we need to see a huge national volunteer effort.  I am aware that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, is working on this.  So many are willing to help.  Part of the objective of our motion is to mobilise and co-ordinate voluntary efforts at local level.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aisling Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The people of our country are working together and supporting Government initiatives to help families to build new lives in Ireland.  These families may not be able to return to their beloved Ukraine in the interim.  This is about helping them to restart and continue their lives in the aftermath of this tragedy, be that in education or in a work setting, and to achieve what they wish to achieve in the context of qualifications.<\/p><p>I thank Senators Seery Kearney and Cummins, all my colleagues in this House and in the Lower House and all our Government Ministers.  This is a cross-departmental effort.  I also thank communities in my region, because, like all my colleagues, I have seen volunteers coming forward.  They have renovated school buildings and community centres, while families have also come forward to offer rooms to refugees in their homes.  This is an incredible response.  Let us help those out there pushing so hard right now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#KK00200","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank the Fine Gael Senators for moving this motion.  It gives us a valuable opportunity to recognise and applaud the work being done and to identify where more work needs to be done and where the gaps in our system lie.  The sheer volume of aid raised through donations of money and supplies and the time and effort spent volunteering to help refugees, along with the hospitality and generosity of people opening their homes, is a true testament to Irish people putting their hearts into helping their neighbours.  Everyone who has helped should be immensely proud.<\/p> <p>As we look forward to the weeks and months to come, I strongly believe that the people of Ukraine who find themselves in Ireland will be best served by a centralised response from the Government that plans for the long term.  The goodwill of our communities can do so much, but it will never operate efficiently without centralised oversight, and responsibility for that lies with the Government.  We need a National Public Health Emergency Team-style task force to be assembled to co-ordinate the response and for there to be one figurehead with ultimate responsibility for managing, processing and housing Ukrainian refugees.  We have reception supports at our ports of entry, staffed by departmental officials, to help to process incoming refugees.  These have been operating on the basis of opening and closing hours, and that is ridiculous.  They need to be operating 24-7, as people are coming into the country and walking past closed offices and missing out on information and supports.<\/p> <p>We also need fast-tracked Garda vetting for all individuals seeking to volunteer to work with refugees.  The Red Cross has raised this issue as well regarding the pledges which have been made to house refugees.  We need long-term supports and resources in the context of housing.  What checks are being carried out on those buildings being used to house refugees?  Are the hotels in which they are being lodged certified for fire safety?  These questions must be answered, and the questions cannot be bounced from Department to Department.  A task force must order these inquiries.<\/p> <p>Anyone processing refugees will say that the biggest problem with the system relates to opening bank accounts.  While refugees are being given personal public service numbers they have no public services cards.  To get one of those, it is necessary for refugees to have a letter from a statutory body, which they do not have.  With no public services card, refugees cannot open a bank account and without a bank account, refugees cannot work.  In 2022, the application process for a public services card still relies on face-to-face meetings, which must be booked by appointment.  In the face of this humanitarian crisis, this is ludicrous.  The process must be streamlined and made accessible to refugees.  Equally, what long-term supports are being put in place for schools?  I refer to teaching English as a foreign language classes, translators, and temporary infrastructure.  Who will make this happen?  The buck cannot be passed on to the local communities and volunteers.  They lack the resources and ability to institute the changes necessary to facilitate refugees.<\/p> <p>Regarding accommodation, the 2016 census found that there were 62,000 holiday homes and just short of 250,000 vacant properties here.  I am all in favour of an incentive scheme to make use of these buildings.  After all, it is for a good cause.  I must wonder, however, if all the homeless people in Ireland are not also a good cause.  Are those already in direct provision in this country not a good cause too?  Are refugees from conflicts in other parts of the world also not a good cause?  Such a scheme to make use of housing would be an excellent idea and it would have my full support, but the question must be asked about why we are only thinking of doing this now.  That is food for thought.<\/p> <p>Our local authorities must play a central role in accommodating refugees.  They must be given accurate and up-to-date figures on the number of refugees relocating into their areas and their current housing locations to allow follow-up and follow-on for proper planning and processing.  Each council must have a liaison officer who will deal directly with Ukrainians, and who must be fluent in Ukrainian or be accompanied by a translator, and who must remain aware of all the supports available to refugees to enable those families to best avail of them.  We need a robust authentication system for qualifications issued by Ukrainian education and professional institutions, which strikes a fair balance between workability and thoroughness.  We must also examine what needs to be done to facilitate the moving of students into third level education so they can finish their degrees.  In addition, we must help Irish students who were studying in Ukraine.  How are they being facilitated to continue their degree courses at home?<\/p> <p>We also need trauma counselling in every school that will be taking in Ukrainian students.  Recognition of Ukrainian driver licences must extend to other vehicle categories, such as heavy goods vehicles, where applicable.  Again, this is to facilitate people working.<\/p> <p>The final point is that, as unpopular as it may be, some form of screening must be put in place eventually.  This is not to prevent legitimate refugees from entering the country, but to ensure instead that our resources go to legitimate refugees, rather than to non-Ukrainian residents in possession of a Ukrainian passport who may seek to take advantage of our emergency entry requirements.  The bottom line is that the response to this crisis must be centralised and the lines of communication down the chain of command must be robust.  Only then, will we be able to do the right thing by the people who need our help now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#LL00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues in Fine Gael for bringing forward this motion and giving us an opportunity to discuss the crisis in Ukraine and all the matters relating to it.  Many Senators, this week and last week, have outlined the horrific things we have been seeing.  It feels very close to home because it is very close to home.  There are other conflict zones around the world, but this war has, for different reasons for different people, grabbed the hearts and minds of Irish people.  The outpouring of love, support and generosity from the public has been phenomenal.<\/p> <p>The situation in Ukraine is appalling.  It is a cruel and barbaric invasion of a western democratic country, where people's freedom of choice and liberty are being undermined and threatened by a dictator, Vladimir Putin.  The Ukrainian people will feel the impact for decades to come.  Many of them have fled their homes and businesses.  I discussed this issue with friends recently.  The experience these refugees have gone through would be like us here having to pack our bags, leave behind the houses we saved for, the cars we bought and all our belongings, and try to fit our entire lives into one bag or suitcase.  We might then be stopped at the border and have to leave our husbands and fathers behind while we continue the journey onward alone.  I cannot even begin to imagine what it must feel like to go through such an experience, then to land in a country about which people know little - perhaps nothing - to try and start a new life and protect their children.  If the same were to happen in reverse, if any of us here had to pack our lives into one bag, bring our children with us and move to Ukraine, with no date to return home, how would we cope with and handle that situation?  It is unbearable to think about, but that is what Ukrainian people are dealing with now.<\/p> <p>I refer to the situation at border areas.  Poland in particular is dealing with huge numbers of people.  All the countries bordering Ukraine are trying to deal with a humanitarian crisis whose scale is many times greater than the situation we are dealing with.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While it is difficult here, it is much more difficult in those countries.  I commend our colleagues in those neighbouring countries.  Poland jumps to mind because I know it has taken the largest number of refugees.  It is doing everything it can to facilitate, by housing, feeding and providing education, medical assistance and mental health supports to so many people.  It is an incredible response from those countries and we are following their steps in trying to do the same thing for the refugees.  I think some 600 are arriving here every day and a total of 15,000 or 16,000 have already arrived.  We believe it will be about 30,000 by the end of April.  The numbers are enormous for a small country like Ireland.  We will manage and we will deal with this.  It will be difficult; there is no point saying otherwise.<\/p><p>The Government's response has been very good.  We really need to make decisions as we go.  We are dealing with issues as they happen and we are resolving them along the way.  There has been no time to plan and prepare for this.  Credit is due to all Departments and Ministers who are dealing with the areas of education, housing, health, justice and social protection.  Every Minister across all Departments has been on this issue and is doing a fantastic job.<\/p><p>I also pay credit to our local authorities.  I recently spoke to one of our directors of services.  In Mayo we have welcomed a number of refugees already but the local authorities in Cork and Dublin have faced the initial wave.  They are effectively putting together lists of community halls, hotel rooms, guest houses, and bed and breakfasts that are not operational and can be brought back into use.  It really brings home the scale of the challenge presented to all our local authorities.  They are looking to put in place contingency beds, which are effectively camp beds.  Today we have been talking in this Chamber about the tented village to be set up close to Dublin.<\/p><p>It is an immense task for the country to try to deal with.  We need to be very cautious if we are putting people into such emergency accommodation.  We have been used to referring to emergency accommodation as being hotels, bed and breakfasts and guest houses.  However, that is still not a permanent home.  Now we are talking about tents, which really cannot be a permanent fixture.  This must be an initial place where refugees come for maybe a week or so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#LL00300","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>One night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#MM00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>We need to move people on to more permanent accommodation and not leave people in tents.

I believe we have received about 25,000 pledges of accommodation, including spare rooms as well as entire apartments or houses.  People are accommodating families in their homes.  That level of generosity is overwhelming and profound.  It is incredible for people to welcome somebody into their home for 12, 18 or 24 months or perhaps even longer.  It is incredible to see that number of people offering space in their homes to people in need and they should be commended on it.  It will go a long way towards helping the Government to deal with the housing situation for those refugees coming in.<\/p> <p>The task ahead of us, as a people, a country and a government, is enormous.  It is really important that we, as public representatives of all parties and none, stick together and work together.  We need to refrain from populism and from commentary that would somehow suggests this is an easy thing to deal with.  It is not easy and it will not be easy.  It will push our country.  We will do the right thing because we would expect the same in return if it happened to us.

It is always good to have a Minister of State in the Chamber.  Especially when that Minister of State is from Kildare, I have to make sure I warmly welcome him here.<\/p> <p>I commend Fine Gael Members on their very considered wording of this motion.  I commend Senators Seery Kearney and Dolan on their eloquent opening contributions.  They are a credit to democracy and to their party.<\/p> <p>I wish to make three points in the short time I have.  I would like to address the issues of renewables, accommodation and what I hope is a seismic shift in the value system of the free world in how we respond to such barbaric atrocities.  It is important for us to start to talk about what we need to do here in welcoming refugees from Ukraine.  We need to be clear on what is required to help and support people fleeing war.  The considered wording of this motion lays out fairly directly what the State needs to do, particularly in education, trauma support and work.  Using the structure of the community call that we developed during the Covid pandemic has been beneficial.  We need to ensure that the local authorities and volunteers are supported in this.<\/p> <p>We need to be clear that renewables offer us a way out of this crisis.  Increasing our reliance on gas and other fossil fuels only sets us up for failure again.  Renewables are forces of peace.  Buying fossil fuels from Russia, indirectly or directly, is the same as sponsoring Russian tanks and guns.  Europe is funnelling billions of euro into Russia which has helped it fund the invasion.  Renewables can provide a triple win of lower costs, greater security and zero emissions, while also defunding Putin's regime.  Wind energy alone provided 53% of Ireland's electricity last month.  EirGrid recently informed an Oireachtas committee that offshore wind alone could power 3.75 million homes by 2030.  It is really exciting to think that we could be producing this.<\/p> <p>I want to highlight the work that has been done to fast-track this.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has announced that he will issue maritime area consents to renewable energy deployers with the first consents likely to be issued later this year.  Ireland's maritime area is seven times the size of its land mass.  We have one of the windiest countries in the world.  There is no barrier to us and in fact it is a no-brainer to bring this home.  We are the equivalent of Saudi Arabia in the league of wind energy.  To harness that wind will be greatly empowering.  It has the potential to deliver 30 GW of electricity which is ten times the current needs of the country.  We should consider where we were in the mid-1930s and where we will be by the mid-2030s, 100 years later.  Not only will we be energy sufficient, but we will be exporting our excess energy.  That will solve many issues for us.  There will be an enormous export boom for Ireland and we need to expedite this as much as possible.<\/p> <p>I wish to highlight something that the motion deals with regarding accommodation.  The existing challenge of both building enough housing and retrofitting our homes has now become even more demanding with the additional need to house refugees from Ukraine, which is clearly the right thing to do and is our duty.  Our response to this will become a defining moment in the history of our country.  It is one that we can be very proud of.  The response of the Irish people has been exemplary.  More than 20,000 people have pledged accommodation through the Irish Red Cross.  The Government has identified State-owned and local authority-owned buildings that could be used as accommodation for the refugees as well as working with religious communities.<\/p> <p>This is not an either-or situation.  We are ramping up the numbers of apprenticeships so that we will have enough construction workers to do all this.  I know the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been identifying vacant homes that could be used.  I note that approximately a quarter of the private accommodation pledges that people have made are for vacant homes.  We need to be serious about tackling vacancy and dereliction if we want to properly house and accommodate the refugees.  My colleague, Deputy Matthews, has introduced the Vacancy, Dereliction and Regeneration Bill which experts believe would deliver 11,000 homes per year by introducing a vacancy tax to be administered by the Revenue Commissioners.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

Everything has changed, changed utterly.  There was a similar moment in Ireland, not at the start of the Easter Rising, when some were pelted with mud as they were apprehended.  The barbaric nature of the British response changed something in Ireland and there was a landslide general election victory for Sinn F&eacute;in.  I hope and believe something has changed regarding the value system in the free world.  Boris Johnson, of all people, said recently that there can be no going back.  We really have to stand our ground and say \"Never again\".  We should have done this in 2014 during the annexation of Crimea, but we did not.  Now as a free world we have to be steadfast, not take things for granted, repeatedly reaffirm ourselves, vow never to go back and have zero tolerance for barbaric dictators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#MM00400","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, roimh an r&uacute;n seo agus roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a bheidh againn anocht.

I apologise to Senator Seery Kearney for missing her initial remarks as I was at the Joint Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and the Irish-speaking Community.  People have been clear, steadfast and supportive of the Ukrainian people and their struggles.  <\/p> <p>Hope is important.  I welcome the news that the Governments of Russia and Ukraine are involved in peace talks in Istanbul.  While there are sceptical responses to these talks from some quarters, which is understandable, we know from the conflict here and our own experience, and experiences elsewhere, that all wars and conflicts are ultimately settled through peace negotiations.  The end of the war in Ukraine will emerge from peace talks, whether it is these talks or another set of talks.  All of us in the Chamber should encourage, and be encouraged by, developments in recent days.<\/p> <p>Until there is an agreed peace and approach to demilitarisation of the situation in Ukraine by the withdrawal of Russian forces, international pressure must be maintained on Russia to end its aggression and withdraw its troops from Ukraine.  That pressure needs to include further sanctions, where necessary, from the international community.  I want to acknowledge the courage and heroism of the people of Ukraine, in particular the bravery of those Ukrainian nationals here who have returned home to defend their country.  <\/p> <p>The actions of Russia are illegal and unjust.  I want to repeat the call made by my party leader, Deputy McDonald, a few days ago for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador.  This growing call comes amidst the Government's expulsion of four Russian diplomats earlier this week.<\/p> <p>The humanitarian crisis unfolding in Ukraine demands ongoing action from the EU and international community to ensure the pressure on Russia to end its aggression is relentlessly pursued.  As part of that international pressure, the Government should use its privileged position as a respected non-aligned nation with a long and distinguished history of peacekeeping missions with a seat on the UN Security Council to assist the search for an end to the war in Ukraine. <\/p> <p>We need to see the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, as endorsed by the Security Council in UN Security Council Resolution 2205.  We also have an important role in the humanitarian effort that is under way to respond to the refugee crisis and the displacement of millions of people from Ukraine.  In that regard, I would like to thank the Irish diplomatic staff and NGO personnel involved in humanitarian aid in Ukraine.  As has been acknowledged by colleagues across the debate so far, communities throughout the State and in the North are supporting refugees fleeing Ukraine.  <\/p> <p>The invasion of Ukraine is rightly seen around the world as an appalling act of aggression against the people there.  It is also seen as a fundamental breach of the international order and how disputes are settled through diplomatic efforts.  The Russian Government should immediately call a permanent halt to its aggression and withdraw its troops.  In such a climate, the prospects of a permanent peace and solution will be found.  <\/p> <p>I support the moves by the Government to assist refugees fleeing Ukraine, some of which were listed by Senator Seery Kearney in her contribution.  I want us to take the same proactive humanitarian approach of solidarity to all of those fleeing the horrors of war and occupation, no matter where they come from.  I look forward to hearing next week from President Zelenskiy in his address to this House and the D&aacute;il.  <\/p> <p>I also look forward to hearing the response of the Minister of State in terms of outlining how the Government will deal with the very necessary need to support those fleeing Ukraine.  I would like to hear how that can be managed in a practical sense and in a way that assists them, gives them the utmost protection and support, and does not compromise the needs of communities, something with which we are all too familiar.  I support the motion and commend my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party for bringing it before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#NN00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Senator Martin is right.  We can never have enough Kildare people in the one room at the same time.  I thank my Fine Gael colleagues for placing this very important Private Members' motion before us today.  It is an important issue and it is welcome that we get the chance to discuss it and ask some questions of the Minister of State and his Government colleagues.<\/p> <p>I stand here today in solidarity with the Ukrainian people.  What is happening in their country is barbaric, wrong and inhumane.  The unjustifiable invasion of a sovereign country by a neighbour must be called out and the aggressor, in this case President Putin, must be isolated and targeted economically within the international community.  I also want to support the calls from others and, in particular, my party leader, Deputy Bacik, for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador.  As Deputy Bacik said yesterday, the time for this has come when we see the horrors being rained down on the people of Mariupol and elsewhere in Ukraine.  It is now incumbent on us to do this.<\/p> <p>There has been a lot of talk over the past number of weeks about the number of refugees that Ireland will take in from Ukraine.  Whatever the final number, what is now most important is that we do our very best for those who, for whatever reason, have chosen our country as a temporary home having fled the horrors of war.  Like many in the House, through my office and at meetings I have met and tried to assist a number of Ukrainian families who are in Ireland.  The one constant from all of these meetings is the need for answers.  There should be a one-stop shop, where we, as public representatives, could get answers to their questions, some of which I will pose to the Minister of State later.  It would also allow those most in need to concentrate on enjoying, as has been said during the debate, the welcome from the people of this country as much as they can.  I am sure that welcome will continue to be provided, despite the language barrier that means some refugees do not know where to go at this time.<\/p> <p>As I said in a public meeting yesterday, there is a time to show what we do best in Irish politics, that is, working together on a cross-party basis to help those who need it most.  This is a time for the Government and Opposition to work together, leaving all of the footballs on the other pitch.  I want to put on the record and acknowledge the considerable response of the Government to date.<\/p> <p>However, in working together each Department must ensure that it provides the answers that will allow all of us to be one-stop shops.  That information needs to flow to all of us so that we can provide the answers that so many unfortunate citizens of Ukraine need at this time.  We can all appreciate and accept that this is an evolving situation that is changing almost day by day and that the Government response is a developing one, but a one-stop shop is needed and may require one Department and Minister to take overall control of the response of our Government and country.<\/p> <p>One of the public meetings I referred to was organised in Athy College, which the Minister of State knows very well.  A number of local representatives met the Ukrainian community in Athy and a large number of refugees who have come to the town.  I want to thank the principal of the college, Richard Daly, for arranging the meeting.  The questions at the meeting were similar to those I have received in my clinic and have been mentioned by many people during this debate, that is, accommodation and where people can go.  There were questions about rent allowance.  A community welfare officer with whom I have been in contact is still waiting for answers from the rent allowance section.  Many of us are seeking clarification on rent allowance.  <\/p> <p>The second issue highlighted at the meeting was work.  As mentioned by colleagues, a lot of refugees want to work and are needed in this country.  Doctors and dentists were mentioned at this meeting, and we know there is a shortage of both in all of our communities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Wall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Some of them have gone to the immigration service, which is telling them it still does not know what stamp they require, whether it is a stamp 4 or whether they need a stamp to work at all.  That is the clarity that so many of us are looking for.<\/p><p>Last night, and over the past couple of days, there was much talk about transport.  Many of these families are staying in rural locations in south Kildare, which the Minister of State and other colleagues will be familiar with.  Local Link may have an opportunity to play a part in this.  That is something, again, that was asked last night.  How will these people get their young children to school and themselves to work, should that opportunity arise?  Those are some of the questions that were asked last night.<\/p><p>Education was another serious issue asked about last night.  I am currently dealing with three university students who are looking to continue their education.  I have contacted the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, about this.  We are looking for clarity in that regard.  Two of the three young people are in their final year and they would like to continue that education here if at all possible.<\/p><p>Driving licences have been mentioned.  There was a query last night about driving licences and how Ukrainian driving licences would work in Ireland.  There has been talk about insurance over the last period of time and how Irish insurance companies will deal with that.<\/p><p>Simple questions about medical cards were asked last night.  My office has been asked how medical cards will work, as I am sure the Minister of State's office has been.  We are hearing from the great work done to the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Health that every avenue will be open to the refugees who come here.  However, what form they should they fill in for a medical card and how they should do so is a question that came up last night and has come up at my clinics and in office over the past couple of weeks.  That is the clarity many are looking for, that is, that one-stop shop.<\/p><p>I congratulate my Fine Gael colleagues on this important motion.  I ask Government to respond to those numerous questions, if at all possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#NN00300","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank the Fine Gael group for putting forward this motion and framing it very carefully in terms of international law.  When we talk of sides and approaches, the key thing is that Ireland has been unequivocal in condemning Russia&rsquo;s aggression and invasion of Ukraine because it is a breach of international law and the UN Charter, which calls on and requires countries to refrain from the use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of another state.  That is very important.  To place that frame at the beginning of the motion is crucial.<\/p> <p>Much of Ireland&rsquo;s power internationally comes from the fact we are seen as champions of international law and we come with a political record of having championed non-engagement in issues.  The non-aligned and active neutrality we have had is not about passivity or not doing things; it is about Ireland operating on a politics of principle, on international multilateral principles, on being known to be consistent and strong in how seriously we take them and being willing to criticise wherever the breach might happen and on the fact that we do not operate simply in the politics of kind of big powers or client states or a kind of a simple version of allies and interests.  The idea that we engage on principles rather than interests is fundamental to Ireland&rsquo;s credibility and its power in the world.  That is why, for example, Ireland was able to negotiate the ban on cluster munitions.  Unfortunately, Russia was one of three or four countries in the world that did not sign up for it and has shamefully used them in its atrocious attacks on Ukraine.  Again, Ireland has contributed and been powerful in that way.<\/p> <p>Another part of this motion refers to Ireland being to the forefront at United Nations level and in the General Assembly because we know the blocks that are happening at the Security Council.  In fact, by being able to engage with the hundreds of countries in the General Assembly that go beyond just the EU countries, Ireland is a crucial bridge in building international-wide support and condemnation of Russia&rsquo;s breaches of human rights and international law.<\/p> <p>Sanctions are a legitimate part of hard diplomacy, and I have always argued that this is part of diplomacy, including in relation to situations such as Israel&rsquo;s occupation of Palestine.  I am glad Ireland has been to the forefront in applying sanctions.  I have literally just come from the finance committee where we discussed how we ensure we do not just look to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT, issue, but that we make sure that assets of some of the named and listed oligarchs who act as support for Mr. Putin internally are genuinely tracked down throughout our financial services sector.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>Crucially, where Ireland has been incredibly important is in terms of humanitarian leadership, including in the argument for humanitarian access corridors, in emergency supplies and in terms of ensuring we help get people to safety.  I commend those points, arguments, suggestions and pragmatic ideas in the motion on how we make that humanitarian support real and practical.<\/p> <p>The temporary protection directive is a very good thing.  This is something that allows Ukrainian refugees to come to any part of the EU.  It is a pity this was not used in respect of Syria.  The European Parliament had asked that the same directive be used in respect of the Syrian refugees in 2015.  Again, there were refugees and hospitals in Syria were bombed by Russian bombs.  It was an early signal of inappropriate action.  We should have been addressing the same humanitarian action and intensive diplomatic response at that time.<\/p> <p>In respect of the refugee issues, there are a couple of issues I want to slightly highlight.  One of the lines in the motion talks of mainly women and children arriving in Ireland.  It is very important to sound a cautionary note here and that we do not create a dynamic where we create a stigma if there are, for example, refugees who are men from Ukraine.  Albert Einstein was a refugee and his contribution was pretty immense in terms of setting up the International Rescue Committee.  I am not suggesting that is the intention at all, but it is a phrase that is being used in the media a lot.  In fact, it is very important, in that LGBTQ and environmental activists, for example, would be particularly vulnerable at this time.  We should recognise that there will be many different kinds of people who will need to seek refuge.  What I like about this motion is that it looks not just to give people safety, but to ensure they still have opportunities to contribute, continue with their education or employment and to contribute to society in that way.<\/p> <p>Lastly, I note again, in a note of hope in a difficult time, that there is much study of how wars start, but less attention is often paid to how wars end.  As one of the other speakers said, it comes through very difficult negotiation.  I hope that we will have some progress and success in the current negotiations.  I wish President Zelenskiy and others well in those negotiations.  I know that, for example, being a neutral state is perhaps one of the outcomes that may come.  I hope Ukraine is able to be a neutral state within the European Union.  I hope that option to be a member state of the European Union is available to it.  That will be important.  We all hope for the best in that.<\/p> <p>I support and comment the motion.  I thank all of those across this House who have consistently worked together on issues of human rights.  That is something the Seanad can be very proud of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#OO00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank my Fine Gael colleagues for their work on this Seanad Private Members&rsquo; motion, which we hope is as broad and encompassing as possible in condemning the unacceptable aggression by Russia on Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereign territory.  There is no question that this invasion is an unprovoked attack on Ukraine's people and an outrageous and immoral breach of the most fundamental and basic principles of international law.  The atrocities that we have seen throughout Ukraine, not least in Mariupol, are undeniably war crimes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I wholeheartedly hope we will have full cross-party support for this broad motion which endorses the open position Ireland has taken in collaboration with our EU partners to welcome Ukrainian refugees into our country without restriction, and endorses the sanctions taken against Russia to date, while also addressing many other areas of challenge and concern.<\/p><p>I reference the need for cross-party support because it is important to put on the record of the House that while it is a popular thing today to support Ukraine and its people, as recently as December when Russia was amassing hundreds of thousands of troops on Ukraine's border, a certain Opposition party was not forthcoming in support for Ukraine.  That party was very much on the side of Russia when it failed to support a European Parliament resolution which condemned the large Russian military build-up, demanded that the Government in Moscow immediately withdrew forces and stopped threatening its neighbouring country and called for increased EU sanctions.  Only 69 MEPs out of 705 from across the European Union voted against that resolution.  Shamefully, four of those MEPs were Irish, including Sinn F&eacute;in's sole MEP, Chris MacManus.  While that party today demands the popular thing of removing the Russian ambassador, in 2018 its leader, Deputy McDonald, following the vicious nerve agent attack on a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury in England, described the move by the then Fine Gael-led Government to expel the diplomat believed to have been in involved in the attack as demonstrating \"a flagrant disregard for Irish neutrality\".  I say this not to score political points but to put on record the shifting position - albeit I welcome the shift - of the main Opposition party on this vital issue.  <\/p><p>There is no question that Ireland has always exhibited a generous spirit in terms of supporting refugees and it is no different when it comes to this crisis.  I am sure that generosity of spirit will continue in the months ahead.  Donations of goods and services, financial donations to NGOs and community response organisations and more than 20,000 pledges of accommodation to date exemplify what we already know, that the Irish people are never found wanting when it comes to supporting people in their hour of need.<\/p><p>It is important that we level and be honest with people and acknowledge the huge challenges the State faces in meeting the accommodation needs of refugees who seek sanctuary therein.  These challenges pale into insignificance when compared with the suffering of the Ukrainian people but up to yesterday, nearly 15,000 refugees from Ukraine had entered Ireland and over 8,000 of those had sought accommodation.  We have been doing our best to address that need.  All preparations are being ramped up to increase the provision of accommodation through hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfast accommodation.  Pledges of accommodation by the public are being assessed for suitability, as are State-owned or private properties which may be suitable for short-term accommodation, religious properties and local authority community facilities.  The unfortunate reality is that may not be enough.  Many hotels are, thankfully, booked out from Easter onwards as a result of our improving Covid circumstances and improvements in our tourism prospects.  The State will have to call on everyone who can play a part to do so.  To circle that square, there has to be an incentivisation scheme to get as many second-hand and holiday homes into use for Ukrainian refugees as possible.  It would be a more cost-effective and appropriate response than dormitory-style accommodation or hotels.<\/p><p>I reiterate what my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, said to the effect that the scenes we are watching on the TV should never become normalised.  We should never become desensitised to what we are seeing or the horrors being inflicted on the Ukrainian people.  We all hope progress will be made in the peace talks.<\/p><p>I welcome every Ukrainian refugee to Ireland.  I believe they will add significantly to our State and I assure them that the Government and the Irish people will do everything in our power to assist them in their hour of need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#OO00300","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I commend my Fine Gael colleagues for a well-considered motion.  As it was being proposed by Senator Seery Kearney, I agree with her words.  It is a comprehensive motion and reflects in many ways the concerns of the Irish people and our desire as a nation as to how the world should function.  I am happy that President Zelenskiy has received and accepted an invitation to address the joint Houses.  I made the suggestion a number of weeks ago.  I thank the Clerk, Martin Groves, for his assistance and work in that regard.<\/p> <p>It is important that the House puts on record our thanks to ambassador Larysa Gerasko and her team at the Ukrainian Embassy for her courage and her engagement with Members of the Oireachtas and communities around the country.  While she and her team perform their diplomatic duties, they have family in Ukraine.  For them, it is personal as well as diplomatic.  I know how difficult it is and want her and her team to understand that we know and our solidarity is with them.<\/p> <p>We have seen extraordinary generosity on the part of the Irish people in recent weeks.  I agree with Senator Cummins and others that we must ensure that continues and that, as a State, we are doing the right thing.  We need to set out clearly that we support Ukraine's passage to EU membership.  In our fight for independence, it was our right as an independent, sovereign, democratic State to determine which international organisations we chose to join.  It is similarly right for Ukraine and other countries in central and eastern Europe as independent sovereign states to determine which international organisations they wish to join.  They cannot be bullied by a bigger neighbour.  We know that from our history.   It is one of the many reasons we need to show solidarity with our Ukrainian brothers and sisters.<\/p> <p>This is Europe's 9\/11 moment and will change the face of Europe, our relationship with Russia and how the European Union responds.  I believe we should remain as a non-aligned country in military terms but we need to co-operate more closely with other non-aligned EU countries, such as Finland, Sweden and Austria, learn from their experiences and work together to ensure a safer and more peaceful Europe.<\/p> <p>I agree strongly with Senator Higgins that we should have been more awake to what was happening with Russia.  We saw in 2007 a cyberattack on Estonia.  We saw the attack on Georgia in 2008 and we saw Crimea in 2014.  The Senator is right about the Russia-sponsored attacks that happened in Syria.  I agree with Senator Cummins that there were politicians in this House and the European Parliament who denied that Russia was involved.  I found it amusing that, when the Taoiseach made reference to Sinn F&eacute;in being soft on Russia prior to Christmas, he was criticised for it.  However, that was the case and many of us warned of the dangers of Russia.  We would do well to listen to the Baltic states and Poland, because they have experience of what is happening.<\/p> <p>This leads to the point around cybersecurity.  I mentioned the cyberattacks experienced by Estonia.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to remember that the biggest cyberattack ever on a health service anywhere in the world took place on our health service in the middle of a pandemic and that it emanated from Russia.  I am not saying it was state-sponsored, but the Russian Government took very little action, even though we knew that the attack emanated from Russia.  Let us be clear that a lot of the battles of the future that will be fought in cyberspace will be state-sponsored, by Russia, China, North Korea and other countries, and that we in Europe need to be particularly careful.  I have said in this House before that our cybersecurity is not strong enough.  We have not invested in it sufficiently.  We need to co-operate more closely through the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, and at a European level with our European neighbours to be able to repel some of the potential cyberthreats.<\/p><p>Colleagues have talked about the issue of food security.  That is vital.  I have spoken in this House regularly about the need for a commercial flour mill to be established in Ireland.<\/p><p>As for energy security, if ever there was a case to advance the importance of wind energy, which Senator Martin spoke eloquently about, it is now.  We should start to look at Europe's energy coming from Irish wind rather than being dependent on Russian oil and gas.  If ever there was a need to fast-track some of our provisions on the use of wind energy and marine energy, it is now.<\/p><p>I am conscious that this debate is on Ukraine, but we should not forget about Belarus or about how the dictator Lukashenko is oppressing the people there.  Belarus has been dragged into this war by Lukashenko.

I fully support the motion.  What we see unfolding on our television screens every night is something to behold.  When, please God, all this is over, we will see that worse atrocities were carried out than those we are seeing on our television screens.<\/p> <p>In my county, Longford, we are willing to play our part in the national effort.  A significant number of households have made their homes available.  Last week I met a group of 40 people from Ukraine in the Longford Arms Hotel.  The whole community has got in behind them.  That includes the sporting organisations.  Longford Sports Partnership was out on the Royal Canal recently and has taken part in rugby, hurling and GAA matches.  The full supports are there from all the organisations in the county.<\/p> <p>It is important, however, that while we support those who come here, we also support those in our country who are affected by what is happening in Ukraine.  Both Ukraine and Russia are an integral part of the global agriculture and food commodity trade.  The war, coupled with the introduction of retaliatory economic sanctions, both directly and indirectly, is seriously affecting the agrifood trade, in particular the cost of production, fertiliser and, ultimately, global food availability.  I know that the Minister of State is working very closely on that and making sure that supports are in place, but it is important we keep working on that.  The key concern is further input and commodity price rises on top of the already elevated prices which are weakening on-farm margins to unsustainable levels across a number of farm systems.  Fertiliser prices are already high.  The Central Statistics Office has stated that prices have increased by 86.9% in the 12 months between the end of 2020 and last year and that we could see a jump of another 40%, with some grain prices even doubling.  The Russian attack against Ukraine represents a major concern for the global agricultural and food industries because of the likely effect on oil, fertiliser, wheat and maize markets.  For Irish farmers, the major impact might stem from the effect on the market for natural gas, the main raw material in the manufacture of nitrogen fertilisers.  The war has already greatly disrupted grain markets and farmers have already seen animal feed prices rise significantly through 2021.  Ukraine is estimated to contribute 12% of global wheat exports.  The war arises at a time when global vegetable oil markets are already very tight.<\/p> <p>I ask, therefore, that further supports are given for those in our country who are affected by the war.  As I said, I know that a tillage scheme was introduced to get more farmers to engage in tillage in order that there is not a knock-on effect on our own industry, but I ask that more supports be put in place.  We met the big industry farmers just outside here yesterday.  They have serious concerns.  I emphasise that we should look after our own as well and make sure that those financial supports are there for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#QQ00200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House discuss this all-important issue.

So many people are arriving daily.<\/p> <p>As for the motion, significant stress has been put on education, and it is really important that there is continuity in that regard.  I pay tribute to the ETBs and the various schools bringing people into their classrooms.  Some schools are already under pressure but are opening their doors.  People have been generous with financial supports and the donation of necessary goods.  Only today I saw one of our councillors put up in her community a message that a number of Ukrainians had moved into the area and that they are looking for supplies of toiletries and so on.  Obviously, people have arrived here having left Ukraine quickly and were very limited in what they could bring with them.  As a result, goods are still needed.  I pay tribute to bodies such as the Red Cross, which has provided a very valuable service.  It is co-operating with others and co-ordinating residential supplies.  While more than 20,000 people have pledged accommodation at this stage, more will be needed as the number of people arriving increases.  The other day I met somebody who met some of the refugees as they arrived.  An eight-year-old had travelled on their own.  It is heartbreaking to hear that an eight-year-old child was sent over alone.  For that child it must be a very traumatic experience.  I have met with many Ukrainians in Limerick who are bringing in some of their family members.  I have been working with them to try to help them with the provision of translation and other services.  Another part of our motion refers to driver licences.<\/p> <p>I lend my support to Ukraine's accession to the European Union.  While I know we as a country are collectively doing everything we can within Europe, Ukraine's accession needs to be fast-tracked.  These people are going through horrific circumstances.  We need only look at our news every evening to see the harrowing pictures, which tell their own story.<\/p> <p>I support the motion and thank the Minister of State for his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#QQ00300","speaker":"1695"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being here to take this really important motion.

While we have had the opportunity to speak about the situation in Ukraine, it is important that meat is put on the bones in respect of the response, so I thank Senator Seery Kearney and her colleagues for that.<\/p> <p>Much has been said in this House, in the Lower House, in council chambers and right around the country about the horrific situation that has unfolded over the past five weeks in Ukraine.  While we saw before Christmas an evolving situation in which Russia was really pushing at the borders, I think there was a feeling of hope that this would not happen.  Yet on 24 February we all woke up to realise that war in our time was happening and that the population of Ukraine was being subjected to shocking bombings.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Two weeks ago, 61 schools and 13 hospitals had been bombed.  I do not doubt that this figure has increased.  We have seen through the power of media and social media shocking images that the world had not seen in many decades and certainly not this close to Europe for the past 80 years.<\/p><p>The work the Government, led by the Taoiseach, has done is commendable.  Ireland was one of the first countries to open its borders in a humanitarian way in response to the horrific situation Ukrainians have found themselves in.  This is in marked contrast to our nearest neighbour.  There is no doubt that there is very strong political will to support the Ukrainians who have found their way here.  Undoubtedly, many more will come to Ireland.<\/p><p>The community response we have seen has been excellent.  My colleague, Senator Wall, spoke about schools bringing communities together to respond.  We have Mr. Richard Daly in Kildare.  Families throughout County Kildare and other counties are opening their homes.  My neighbour three doors down has taken in a family of seven and is an incredible example to all of us.  I have registered with the Red Cross to take in Ukrainians because that is the right thing to do.  My sister-in-law, Siobh&aacute;n, drove to the Polish border and returned on Monday with five women, one baby, two dogs and a cat.  She was able to offer sanctuary and transport.<\/p><p>United for Ukraine is a political organisation founded by Lithuanian MEP and former Prime Minister, Mr. Andrius Kubilius.  I have become a member of the organisation.  It is open to all parliamentarians throughout Europe to join.  Yesterday there was a meeting on humanitarian aid.  It is important to put this in context.  At present, Ukraine needs 15,000 tonnes of food every day.  It needs 10,000 tonnes of fuel, including for transport.  It needs water, medicines and other supports.  Currently, it is only receiving 5,000 tonnes of food per day.  This is one third of what it needs.  We bore witness to families, particularly in Mariupol, not having food and water.  It is important that parliamentarians throughout Europe play their part in ensuring that humanitarian aid for those in Ukraine continues in the way it has for the first weeks.<\/p><p>In the context of what is happening at a local level, substantial work is taking place throughout Government in terms of providing accommodation.  The community centre in Rathangan will be a reception centre.  We certainly welcome this.  With regard to supports for those who have arrived, there is nothing more important than access to school places and early education places.  I know of one family in Monasterevin with two boys and two girls.  Three have received a school place but one has not.  We cannot have this situation.  That is why I welcome the education and training boards playing a co-ordinating role.  We also need clarity in terms of driving licences for Ukrainians.  The Department of Education and that Teaching Council have said they will actively promote teachers from Ukraine in order that they can be registered with the Teaching Council, but it is happening too slowly.  It has not happened yet.  It needs to take place.<\/p><p>Those in the agricultural industry have been impacted most by what is happening in the war regarding the cost of fertiliser.  There have to be subsidies for fertiliser.  This should be done on tonnage as opposed to on hectares.  There are many elements to this very difficult situation.  We have to do our best for the Ukrainians who have stayed in their country.  We have to do our best for the Ukrainians who have come to our shores.  We have to do our best to try to alleviate the impact on those most impacted by the war.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#QQ00400","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

We do not have a licence exchange agreement with Ukraine.  It is important that Europe not only acts on this, it must expedite it as a matter of urgency.  The immediate recognition by the European Union of Ukrainian driving licences must be addressed.  Europe needs to recognise their driving licences.  Driving cannot happen with the emergency relocation and it is critical that Europe acts collectively.  This is not just an Irish matter, it is a European problem.  I support the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, her approach at European level to ensure that there is recognition of Ukrainian driving licences.  The immediate recognition of Ukrainian driving licences must be addressed by Europe.  Ireland has raised the possibility in the European Union of recognition.  I hope it can happen immediately.  It is important that we as a country put pressure on Europe to recognise the importance of Ukrainian driving licences in Ireland.  This is an anomaly because we have no agreement.

I support the motion and I am delighted that Fine Gael has brought it forward.<\/p> <p>With regard to the support we are offering Ukraine, I have to say I am tremendously proud of the response of Ireland and the Government and of our communities and people throughout the country.  We have had the generosity and c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte for which we are famous.  Unfortunately we do not always live up to it.  It has been very much evident in the response to this crisis.  It is lovely to see.  I hope it is much more reflective of who we are than anything else.  The manner in which Irish people have welcomed Ukrainians here is appropriate and laudable.<\/p> <p>Yesterday I attended the funeral of Pierre Zakrzewski.  I did not know him personally but he attended the same school as I did.  He was from my area.  The breadth of feeling for his loss, given all of his experience and the wonderful life he led, was palpable yesterday.  It is still only a fraction of what so many Ukrainian families are going through.  All of his family wore Ukrainian colours and they were given out to people in the church.  They certainly feel the loss that so many Ukrainian families feel in Ukraine and throughout the world.<\/p> <p>Some of what has been said in the course of the debate has hit home.  We see what is happening and it is deplorable.  It is unlawful.  In many respects what we are seeing are war crimes.  Mention has already been made in the House on other occasions to the International Criminal Court.  I have welcomed the fact that the prosecutor in the International Criminal Court, Mr. Karim Khan, has opened a file on this subject with a view to a possible future prosecution of Vladimir Putin, Russia and the people perpetrating these offences.  This is also to be welcomed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As counsel before the International Criminal Court - and there are not many Irish people in that boat - I look forward to that happening.  It is difficult to see how this is going to end.  I do not really understand the rationale behind this conflict.  Even if Vladimir Putin triumphs, which he is finding a great deal more difficult than his generals appear to have told him it would be, I do not understand how a country like Ukraine could be occupied when there are tens of millions of people there who will not accept his rule or occupation and who will continue to resist.  We have seen the pride evident among Ukrainians here and throughout the world.  I do not understand how Vladimir Putin could have calculated this action as coming to a conclusion that is in any way favourable to Russia.  There is extraordinary unity across the world against Russia.  We saw the resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations passing with only four or five countries opposing.  One of the remarkable elements of this conflict is how it has brought the whole world together.  Countries that do not agree with each other most of the time are now in wholehearted agreement in condemning this action.  I do not see how Vladimir Putin or Russia can exit this with anything that could be deemed to be success from their perspective or anything that is any way dignified.  They have thrown away their credibility, dignity and any international respect they had, respect that had already waned over recent years.  It is a really unfortunate position.  <\/p><p>To move on to one of things that we in Ireland and across Europe can do, we have now imposed a freeze on Russian assets here, in other European countries and throughout the world.  I refer not only to state assets, but also personal assets.  Those assets have been frozen and there is a de facto sanction in place.  What is going to happen to those assets?  Whatever about personal assets, can Russian state assets in Ireland that have been frozen be somehow channelled into the reconstruction of Ukraine or used for the benefit of the Ukrainian people, who have been irredeemably injured by this conflict?  That is something we could look at doing in the future, when we are nearing the end of this conflict.  How are we going to punish Russia in that way?  Is it within our power to do so?  I would like to see Ireland taking a lead on that front and saying that we will seize those Russian state assets and give them to Ukraine in some way or other to support its reconstruction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#RR00300","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Before I call on Senator Mullen to speak, I acknowledge and welcome to the Visitors Gallery Jarlath Fitzsimons, whose grandfather, the former Senator, Pat Fitzsimons, was a long-standing Member of this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#SS00200","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Last Friday evening, I was in the town of Ballgar, near to my home place, taking part in a table quiz in support of a journey that was going to be made from Ballygar to bring important food, medical and other supplies to Ukraine.  The following evening, I was cycling through Ballygar on my bike.  I had previously had an idea in my head that this was to be a fairly small van making its way across Europe but then I saw this massive truck with \"Ballygar to Ukraine\" and the Irish and Ukrainian flags emblazoned on it.  It made me very proud that this small community, the parish of Ballygar, Newbridge and Tohergar, next door to my own, which has a relatively small number of people, was showing this fantastic generosity, organisational ability and solidarity with others far away.  I give credit to Gearoid Kelly, whom I remember from my school days, and to G. Kelly Ballygar Transport.  This did not start today nor yesterday.  This outreach from that community has been going on for years in the context of various crises.  It is the best of Ireland and it makes me especially proud to see small communities doing big things.<\/p> <p>In light of our economic dependency on Russian gas and oil for energy - I am speaking about Europe, the West and countries like Germany in particular - and our economic dependency on China for so many things including money, finance, goods and services, it is time we thought about the impact of globalisation on our ability to stand up for human rights and to put up the strongest fight possible against any abuses of human rights.  It is beyond doubt that our economic dependency on regimes that do not respect democracy, human rights and the rule of law is, on occasion, crippling our ability to take all of the measures we need to take when moral and political outrages such as we are seeing in Ukraine at the moment take place.  Of course, there is great solidarity from the West.  People are in lockstep and in agreement.  However, we still wonder whether we are in a position to do everything we could do if we were not financially and economically entangled with countries that do not respect democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  Our world, and the western world in particular, needs to think about how to get out of these entanglements so that we can defend the democratic order in the future.<\/p> <p>What has been done and what is being done by the Russians in Ukraine is profoundly evil.  Many adjectives have been used.  The Russian invasion and prosecution of this war is medieval and shows an absolute disregard for human rights.  It is scary and depressing to contemplate.  It is very hard to see how one can have any kind of normal diplomatic relationships with a Russia under Putin in the future.  It will not be for the people of this House to decide what happens in the future but we must insist on getting to a place where it is sought to prosecute, in every possible way, those who perpetrate human rights abuses, regardless of who or how powerful those perpetrators are.<\/p> <p>As I have said, what the Russians have done is profoundly evil but, having said that, there is a difference between the information one gets from the mainstream media about this and the information one can find when one does a wider search on the issues.  There is a debate to be had about the promises the West held out to Ukraine with regard to NATO membership and the way it undermined the democratically elected Yanukovych regime.  The Russians are the cause of this evil and nothing can take away from that but it may well be the case that the West contributed massively to what happened through bad statecraft and excessive interference.  As I have said here in the past, we want to get to a situation where Ukraine can be independent, neutral and prosperous.  I hope that will be possible.<\/p> <p>I will mention two things in conclusion.  The first is that we need to have a discussion about our neutrality and what it means.  I support our neutrality but we have to contribute to the defence of our way of life and we have to think about what that means in these weeks and months and in the time ahead in light of what has happened.  Two weeks ago, I raised the plight of Ukrainian women who have acted as surrogates for Irish couples.  Senator Moynihan also raised the issue.  I think of those women, who are the mothers of Irish citizens, and the moral duty we owe to them.  I have raised the possibility of considering how we might develop legal rights in Ireland for women who have given birth to Irish citizens.  In particular, we need to consider and have a debate about giving them options in terms of residency rights, basic social protection assistance, healthcare and, perhaps, a route to Irish citizenship.  That is one of many issues we have to think about these days.  It is the beginning of the discussion.  I raise that issue with the Minister of State today and I would be interested in hearing what the Government thinks in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#SS00300","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, to the House and commend my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, for preparing and leading on this motion, which is extremely important.  I also acknowledge the work she has done for surrogate mothers and for Irish citizens born in Ukraine and their mothers.  A lot has been done but a lot more can, and should, be done.  This motion is very timely and very important.  In Clare, we have not far off 2,000 Ukrainian residents.  Of the 13,500 who are in the country, nearly 2,000 are in Clare.  Of those 2,000, not far off 1,000 are living in north Clare between Lisdoonvarna, Ballyvaughan, Lahinch and Liscannor and down along the coast in Kilkee.

I learned at first hand the many challenges that are there and what the State needs to do to address them.  Clearly, the most important challenge, which so far we have been able to accommodate, is to give them somewhere to sleep, a roof over their head, and food.  That is very welcome.<\/p><p>I commend the Red Cross on the work it is doing in assisting the State with offers of accommodation.  I am advising Ukrainian people to accept accommodation through the Red Cross because at least the State has an involvement in that regard.  There is Garda vetting and vulnerable adults will be put in a place which will be safe.  Some Ukrainian people are staying with family and friends they know but others have been offered accommodation by people on the street and through social media.  While most people are very well-intentioned, there is a risk when the State is not involved.<\/p><p>I encourage all colleagues to meet the Ukrainian citizens who live among us and engage with, listen to and reassure them, as I have been doing.  It is a good thing to do and they benefit from the reassurance that they are welcome, they can stay as long as they need to stay and we will support them in every way we can.<\/p><p>When it comes to support, there are a number of things we need to do.  The Department of Education has a big body of work to do because there are many Ukrainian children here and they need to go to school.  This Department needs to appoint an on-the-ground liaison officer in each county and that officer needs to have broad discretionary powers to allocate children to schools and to engage with transport providers to sort out transport.  In Kilshanny in County Clare, a bus operator provided a bus for a couple of days but that is not sustainable.  The Department of Education needs to have boots on the ground to deal with the education requirements, including the requirement of schools to have Ukrainian teachers who can do translation work.  All of those types of issues would be expedited and addressed more efficiently if officials were on the ground, on-site and engaging with people.  All Ukrainian children need to go to school and they need the normality that going to school presents.<\/p><p>Transport is a big problem.  Many of the Ukrainians here have Ukrainian driving licences but these are not recognised in this country.  We were told by Ministers last week that this requires a European response through the Commissioner for Transport, discussions were ongoing and so on.  Other European countries have sidestepped that process and are recognising Ukrainian driving licences.  I want the Government to do the same and recognise these driving licences.  Many of these people living in hotels in small rural villages.  They come from cities and need to be able to go out and about and do their business.  <\/p><p>Public transport in rural Ireland is an issue I raised long before the Ukrainian crisis.  To travel by bus from Ballyvaughan to Galway city costs &euro;28 return.  That is not acceptable or sustainable for a family of Ukrainians who wish to go to Galway to do a day&rsquo;s shopping.  An urgent Government response is needed to make public transport affordable for the Ukrainian community.  We also need to address this matter in the long term.  Why should a young person have to pay that type of money to go from Ballyvaughan to Galway city when one can travel from Maynooth into Dublin for a fraction of that cost.  There is an inequality and inequity there that needs to be addressed but we need an urgent response for the Ukrainian people now.<\/p><p>In respect of agencies, the local authority needs to be leading the multi-agency response at a local level with very defined roles.  A reporting structure also needs to be built as a matter of urgency.  Large numbers of Ukrainian interpreters are needed and must be hired.  There are people in the Ukrainian community who speak very good English and would be well able to interpret for their fellow citizens at medical appointments, in school and so on.  There are many practical steps we can take to get quick wins.  Some of the long-term issues, such as education, recognising qualifications and facilitating people to continue their third level studies, are more complicated and will take more time.  As a Government and a nation, can we get the easy wins done now?  Can the driver licences be sorted out as quickly as possible?  Can we get boots from the Department of Education on the ground in schools?  We can and should do these things in days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#SS00400","speaker":"1644","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting Senator Conway.

The services in the one-stop shop as regards where they stay and how they will be educated need to be looked at.  Last weekend, 34 Ukrainians arrived in Bandon and they do not know whether or for how long they will stay.

I am very much aware that the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department is tied in with how we will deal with this in the future.  Unfortunately, we in this country, and in the European Continent generally, need to look again at food policy.  Under our food policies for the past 20 years, we forgot about producing food and we now need to go back to start talking about that.  Ukraine is the food basket of Europe and produces large amounts of grain.  We also have a fuel issue.  We need to start talking about how the EU will become self-sufficient and that will require a change in policy.<\/p> <p>This unfortunate war, a major land war in Europe that none of us ever thought we would have in our lifetime, has frightened us.

I am acutely aware that we have some male refugees here who are lone parents and that some of their children have disabilities.  It is a point well made.  We have to be very careful that we do not get a certain image in our head.  There are many different victims and the impact of this conflict has very different consequences for so many people.  Our role in the Government and the role of the Irish people is to support everyone as far as we can in all those elements.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Malcolm Byrne, the Government stands fully behind Ukraine's application for EU membership.  We all look forward to President Zelenskiy's address to both Houses of the Oireachtas next week.  Senator Carrigy commented on support for Irish farms and food producers impacted by the conflict.  It is important to put on record that we do not have a food security or feed security crisis here.  The Government wants to support our food production sector and farmers to ensure that we do not have one into the future either.  We are acutely aware of the impact of the cost of living on Irish people, which has been made worse as a result of this conflict.  That has impacted on our businesses and farmers.  That is why we have targeted supports from the Government for our tillage sector and our pig farmers who are really struggling at present.  Discussions continue about further potential interventions to support that sector through very difficult times.<\/p><p>Since the outbreak of the war and the arrival in Ireland of the first Ukrainians fleeing it, the scale of the response to the crisis has been unprecedented.  Ireland has received 15,294 arrivals from Ukraine as of 29 March.  We have established dedicated teams at our airports and ports that meet new arrivals from Ukraine with teams from several Departments including the Departments of Social Protection, Health, Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Officials from these Departments are ensuring that every person arriving is met and given support as soon as possible. <\/p><p>The International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has temporarily taken responsibility for providing accommodation to Ukrainian refugees.  Officials are continuously working to source further accommodation and supports for Ukrainian arrivals to Ireland through hotel accommodation and various other accommodation options and solutions.  The Irish Red Cross, the Defence Forces and estate agents and valuers have started to evaluate pledges placed through the national pledge mechanism operated by the Irish Red Cross, and to inspect the properties with a view to making them available quickly to refugees.<\/p><p>It is a priority for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to ensure the system of recognition of the skills and qualifications of Ukrainians is expedited to support those Ukrainians who want to access the workplace.  This will enable Ukrainian people coming to Ireland to work and use their skills within the Irish economy.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, and his Department are working intensively with the European Commission to ensure that the qualification recognition process aligns across the EU.<\/p><p>For those Ukrainians arriving in Ireland seeking to continue or start their education, the Department is determined to ensure the provision of these services and their accessibility.  We are working to ensure the information we provide is in a language which is easily understood by those we are working to assist.  On supports for accessing further education, such as the SUSI grant, the Department is examining options to ensure incoming Ukrainian students would be eligible for student supports.  Statutory and administrative options are being considered, and legal advice has been sought as to what actions can be taken in order for incoming Ukrainians to be eligible for some assistance.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will be bringing forward proposals shortly.<\/p><p>The 16 education and training boards offer English-language skills courses for adults.  When the temporary directive was activated, spare capacity was identified in the system to meet the needs of Ukrainian people coming to Ireland.  Ukrainians wishing to learn English or improve their English can contact their local ETB for an assessment of their English language competency across the four core skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking.<\/p><p>The Government is working to ensure that local capacity, resources and knowledge are brought to bear on the humanitarian response to people fleeing Ukraine and seeking protection in Ireland.  Ireland has a well-developed volunteer infrastructure in place and the capacity, willingness and expertise exist at local level to co-ordinate responses, signpost services, and link voluntary and statutory efforts.  The response to Covid-19 has shown us the positive impact we can have by working together at local and national level.  Massive efforts were made by volunteers during the pandemic, and dedicated volunteers across the country are already working again to help people from Ukraine arriving in Ireland.<\/p><p>As the new arrivals begin to settle in, each local authority is establishing a community response forum to provide a focal point for the community response in their area.  The community response fora will enable all those involved to work together under the stewardship of the local authority.  This will ensure effective co-ordination in providing supports to the new Ukrainian communities.  The community volunteers pilot programme is also providing a way for local communities to offer support to those in need.  The programme is funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development, co-ordinated by Volunteer Ireland and volunteer centres, and supported by the local authority in each area.  The programme is initially running in counties Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Galway, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and roll-out is due this year in ten further counties.<\/p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE have put in place a streamlined medical card application process for Ukrainian refugees.  A lag in applications is apparent and was expected as refugees are settling into their accommodation.  Senator Wall raised specific points about that application process.  I can confirm that as of 28 March, medical cards had been issued to 605 Ukrainians with 224 applications pending.  The medical card section on the HSE website is replicated in Russian and Ukrainian.  Ukrainian and Russian versions of the medical card form are also available.<\/p><p>The HSE in consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation has prepared a range of bespoke options for the provision of general practitioner services to those in IPAS accommodation.  The model for each site varies depending on numbers and geographical distribution, however all have access to GP out-of-hours services.<\/p><p>Operational processes for urgent referrals or medical evacuees are in place as Ireland is supporting emergency patient care through medical evacuation where we can.  I am pleased to confirm that with assistance from a number of Departments, the HSE and the Air Corps, two paediatric patients were transported from Poland for treatment at Irish hospitals.  Although our medical evacuation capacity is limited, we will continue to review patient cases and support this co-ordinated EU effort where we can.<\/p><p>The Irish health system is also providing medical humanitarian assistance.  Over the past month, Ireland has been providing donations of medical supplies and equipment to Ukraine in response to the requests for assistance from the Ukrainian authorities and neighbouring countries.  Further instalments of this donation are expected to be dispatched later this week and once complete, the total consignment of medical equipment will include over 4,500 items of equipment from hospitals and other sources.<\/p><p>The Department of Education continues to work intensively to make education available to Ukrainian children.  This includes supporting the well-being and social and emotional needs of these young people.  The Department is already providing supports to schools and is advancing further arrangements to address the short-term educational needs of primary and secondary school age children.  The regional education and language teams, REALT, have been established to support the needs of Ukrainian children arriving in Ireland.  These teams will be hosted by the 16 regional education and training boards and will be staffed by existing regionally-based personnel working to ensure co-ordination and alignment of supports for Ukrainian children.  The primary role of the REALT will be to assist children in finding school places and to support schools to meet the needs of these children.<\/p><p>Capacity is a forefront challenge for the Department, both in terms of physical school buildings in which to accommodate additional pupils, as well as the human resources, teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and others with the skills to address their educational needs.  Work is under way to identify capacity within existing schools across the country to address the immediate educational needs of arriving Ukrainian refugees, with the location of the accommodation provided for Ukrainian people relevant in identifying appropriate school capacity to meet their education needs.  Language plays a vital role in helping students to clarify and interpret experiences, explore ideas and emotions, and deepen their understanding of the world around them.  The allocation of specialist resources to schools takes account of the needs of pupils in the school, including, where appropriate, English as an additional language, EAL, needs.  The Department is considering in close consultation with other relevant bodies and Departments how best to support intensive English language learning for post-primary age children who may have low levels of English proficiency.<\/p><p>The issue of driver's licences was raised by a number of Senators.  It is not in the notes I have for this address but I will bring the matter back to the relevant Minister and highlight the level of concern expressed about it in today's debate.  The scale of this humanitarian response is unprecedented for this State, but it is a task we undertake knowing that by doing so, we are saving lives.  I ask Senators to continue to work with communities, as they are doing on a daily basis, to welcome those who have arrived already and to prepare for the arrival of those yet to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#TT00500","speaker":"1586","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, for that comprehensive and empathic response to an important debate.

There was a report yesterday on the news about the WALK organisation in my constituency of Dublin South-Central.  The members hopped on a bus and drove over with a load of supplies for families who had children with disabilities, in particular, and people of all ages with disabilities, and they brought four families home.  The discussion with them about all they had experienced was quite extraordinary.  We are coming forward as a people.  Today, I confirmed with Mr. Harry Crosbie that he is providing a space that he calls a loading bay.  It is a massive warehouse of 8,000 sq. ft. at Vicar Street.  He asked me what we would do with it.  It would be good for fund raisers and a good logistical base for anything we need.  He is going to pull in celebrities and we will do a heap of things there.  It will be extraordinary.  People are looking into their souls to see how they can respond.<br\/><br\/>There is no question that Russia's actions should be utterly condemned.  There is no excuse or rationale for the sheer savagery.  It is not just the invasion of Ukraine and the annihilation of its cities and people, but also the weaponising of its population and the knowledge that there is very likely to be a famine in north Africa as a consequence of it.  The international community has to stand together, and I heard the Minister of State's briefing and his vision on that and the actions that have been taken.  However, the consequences here are extraordinary.  It is the weaponising of the economic impact of this across all of Europe.  When we stand today and give our support, in some respects these days are the easy days.  It is going to be hard when it has cost-of-living impacts and a heap of other impacts on us in how we live our daily lives.  At that point, we have to be very clear that we stand with Ukraine and that we do not take any populist roles.  I have already seen the tacit racism and the whataboutery online.<br\/><br\/>There are areas where we are challenged, such as with accommodation and services.  There is no doubt about that.  However, this is an extraordinary circumstance of people fleeing, and I want to look back on this time and know that we did everything we could.  My father is of an age that he remembers the Second World War.  He was a very young child, but he remembers the aftermath into the 1950s as well and the hardships and people growing their own vegetables and making all the choices they had to make to survive.  When it was tough and really hard and it bit home, it was still the right thing to do.  It is important that we stand in that solidarity.<br\/><br\/>I am very grateful to the Government and to the people of Ireland.  I am very proud of the people of Ireland for the extraordinary grace, generosity and passion they show.  We have shown ourselves to be who we really are.  When I meet and talk to the Ukrainian ambassador, she begins her speeches with &quot;<i>Slava Ukraini<\/i>&quot;, and I will end with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#UU00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648632600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#VV00300","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033000002#VV00400","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648632600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an Seanad ar athl&oacute; ar 6.30 p.m. go dt&iacute; 10.30 a.m., D&eacute; D&eacute;ardaoin, an 31 M&aacute;rta 2022.<\/p><p>The Seanad adjourned at 6.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 31 March 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
