Latest figures indicate that there are now some 72,000 hectares under organic production, an increase of nearly 50% on the position at the start of the Programme in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The Organic Sector Strategy Group, which was established earlier this year, was tasked with developing a strategy for the development of the Organic Sector for the period up to 2025 and with assessing the justification for a targeted reopening of the Organic Farming Scheme, looking to best economic and environmental outcomes, in accordance with the Group&rsquo;s terms of reference.<\/p>  <p>  A public consultation process provided an opportunity for all interested parties to contribute to the development of the new strategic plan. This public consultation process combined with an Organic Processing Survey ensured that stakeholders had their views considered in building on the progress made and providing clear direction for further development of the Organic Sector for the next seven years. <\/p>  <p>  According to 2017 Bord Bia research, categories with the greatest growth potential in the domestic market are fruit and vegetables, and dairy.  Notwithstanding the fact that a large proportion of the total organic tillage crop is dedicated to oats, there is insufficient supply to meet demand. Furthermore, the insufficient supply of organic cereals and proteins is inhibiting the growth of the organic dairy, meat, and aquaculture sectors. This deficit in supply also necessitates importation which increases costs of production and therefore impacts competitiveness. The overriding challenge is to ensure that the development of production of organic food products is in line with market requirements and consumer demand. This will be the key to long term sustainable growth of the Irish Organic Food Sector.<\/p>  <p>  Based on this assessment, the Group considered that there is sufficient market demand to justify the reopening of the Organic Farming Scheme on a targeted basis focussing on areas that are in deficit and where market demand is growing.  In addition, the reopening of the Scheme is perceived as one of the most important steps in the future direction and development of the Sector. The Group unanimously agreed that the areas to be targeted should be organic horticulture, cereals and dairy.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the recommendation of this Group, the Organic Farming Scheme was re-opened on 19 November, 2018.  An allocation of &euro;1.25m has been provided to facilitate the re-opening of this Scheme.  Applications for the scheme must be made online, but there will be no requirement to use an Agricultural Advisor to make the applications.  The closing date for submission of completed on-line applications is 19 December 2018.<\/p>  <p>  All registered organic farmers are eligible to apply for the Organic Farming Scheme.  Priority will be given to those areas deemed to be in deficit ie horticulture, tillage and dairy.  The size of the holdings and the enterprise type in each case will determine the number of farmers accepted into the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":12,"content":"<p>Question No. 14 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA01200"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[51173\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he is taking to ensure that the carbon footprint of the agriculture sector here is being reduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>Irish agricultural production is recognised by international independent analysis as having one of the lowest carbon-footprints internationally.

The FAO has also recognised the efficiency of our temperate grassland based production systems. <\/p>  <p>  Production efficiency improvements are a core part of the efforts being undertaken by the agricultural sector. Significant progress in production efficiency has already been achieved through the use of fertiliser and manure, grassland management, improved breeding and better fertility. At farm level, my Department and its agencies are actively engaged with the farming sector through initiatives such as the Origin Green Farm Sustainability and Quality Assurance schemes, Knowledge Transfer Schemes, Beef Data and Genomics Programmes, the Green Low Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) and the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS). <\/p>  <p>  As an example of my continued focus on ensuring the lowering of the carbon footprint of the agriculture sector I have recently introduced a Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot scheme that builds on the success of the Beef Data and Genomics Programme. This new scheme is targeted at suckler farmers and is specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production.<\/p>  <p>  Sequestration has also a key role to play in reducing the carbon footprint of the sector and my Department has made significant investment under the Forestry Programme.

Special Areas of Conservation, or SACs, and Special Protection Areas, or SPAs &ndash; also known as Natura sites &ndash; are designated to afford protection to the most vulnerable of these habitats and species. As such, SACs and SPAs are a key component in the protection of rare and endangered habitats and species, both in Ireland and at a European and international level.<\/p>  <p>  To tackle the decline of Hen Harrier populations in Ireland, a process has been underway since 2015 to develop a Threat Response Plan. This process, led by Minister Madigan and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, focuses on the key land uses of agriculture, forestry and wind farm development. The Plan will address pressures facing populations within those SPAs designated for breeding Hen Harrier, and also issues facing the species within the wider countryside <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is currently finalising the draft Threat Response Plan for public consultation. This follows earlier consultation with the stakeholder representative Consultative Committee in May of this year, which generated considerable feedback regarding &ndash; among other issues &ndash; proposals for limited afforestation within the SPAs. <\/p>  <p>  The timeline for the release of the draft Plan is a matter for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. However, it should be noted that any afforestation within a Natura site must satisfy Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive, and must also be agreed to by National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service. Until the Threat Response Plan is completed, my Department will not be in a position to approve afforestation projects within the SPAs. <\/p>  <p>  In the overall context of my commitment to addressing the decline of the Hen Harrier, I would point out that I fully  recognise the importance of the preservation and conservation of the Hen Harrier and other protected bird species.

This is a key part of our response to the challenges and uncertainty posed by Brexit, and in line with the market development theme of the Food Wise 2025 strategy. The opening of the Chinese market for Irish beef earlier this year was the culmination of significant work, over a number of years, and I am delighted that 6 Irish beef plants are currently approved to export beef to China.  <\/p>  <p>  My officials are currently working towards progressing applications for additional beef plants approvals, in order to increase Ireland's ability to supply the market, and this was the subject of a bilateral technical meeting at Senior Officials level in Beijing at the start of November. <\/p>  <p>  Total Irish agri-food trade exports to China were  &euro;974 million in 2017. China is now our third largest market overall for agri-food exports. Dairy exports reached &euro;667 million and pigmeat exports were over &euro;100 million in 2017. These were the two largest categories of food exported to China, and for both of these commodities China was Ireland's second largest destination market according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) trade data. China is also a growing market for seafood and other food and drink exports.  <\/p>  <p>  Last month, my colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle TD, had a series of political and promotional engagements  at the China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai and at the Seafood Expo in Qingdao.  This follows the trade mission I led to China in May, and an inward visit by the Chinese Minister for Agriculture in October, underlining our commitment to progressing key political and trade relationships with China. <\/p>  <p>  By gaining access to China, we have opened a very significant beef market for Irish beef companies. It is up to the beef companies to avail of this opportunity.  According to the  Central Statistics Office (CSO) by the end of August 2018, Irish beef exports to China were 260 tonnes or &euro;432,000. I am reasonably pleased with this level of exports given that the trade only commenced during the Summer. It indicates that Irish beef companies are beginning to gain a foothold in the Chinese market. <\/p>  <p>  On average Chinese beef consumption is now 4kg per person per year.  While that may be considered low when compared to average Irish consumption of 19kg of beef per capita per year, it underlines the potential for further growth in consumer demand for beef, driven by increasing urbanisation and  higher disposable incomes.  Total beef imports to China were around 600,000 tonnes in 2016. That is more than Ireland&rsquo;s total beef exports to all markets last year. I firmly believe that our beef industry can and will compete effectively in the Chinese market and I look forward to the opportunities that this access will bring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry","counter":29,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA02800"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[51205\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA02900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the nature and level of discussions he has had with beef factories to ensure farm producers receive a reasonable price for beef; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":31,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, in accordance with competition law, neither I nor my Department have any role in determining market prices for any commodity, nor can I intervene in this process. <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that this has been a difficult year for the sector in terms of weather and the range of challenges associated with it.

It is essential that the position of the primary producer in the supply chain be improved if the industry is to build a sector for the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Beef Roundtable also included discussions on the potential for producer organisations and the development of new technologies as ways of adding value along the whole supply chain though increased engagement in the bioeconmy.  These discussions were aimed at highlighting available tools to build resilience in the sector. <\/p>  <p>  I have also  asked Bord Bia to conduct a detailed examination of market dynamics, with the cooperation of the industry, taking into account sales of particular cuts into particular segments of the market in order to improve price transparency.<\/p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agri-food sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  I hope that this positive engagement will continue.<\/p>  <p>  More generally in relation to the beef sector, I was pleased to secure in the recent Budget, &euro;20 million for a new pilot scheme targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production. The pilot will build on the Beef Data and Genomics Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agri-food sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP.  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is working with other Departments and Agencies to broaden the portfolio of markets available to the Irish beef sector. Live exports are also an important market outlet, and the volumes have increased by 30% in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  I would urge the industry to reflect on the economic sustainability of its own supply base when considering the development of the sector into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invasive Plant Species","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA03100"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[51156\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the measures in place for tackling invasive species such as Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam and gunnera tinctoria; and the role of his Department in managing the control of invasive species.","asker":"1242","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>My colleague, Josepha Madigan TD, Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is responsible for the enforcement of  Irish legislation which deals with Invasive species.

Further meetings are scheduled throughout the remainder of this month.  The Presidency is currently working through the proposals with the Member States to try and identify areas of agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The CAP Post 2020 has been discussed at the Special Committee of Agriculture meetings on a regular basis.  CAP Post 2020 has also been a standing agenda item at every Agri-Fish Council meeting.  I had the opportunity to discuss the CAP proposals at our last meeting on 19 November.

This allows them to make informed decisions on improving the sustainability of their farms while also improving their efficiency and farm viability.  Knowledge Transfer schemes, funded under the Rural Development Programme (RDP), are essential in facilitating the transfer of information from research and advisory services to farmer discussion group networks and cover a range of topics related to sustainability and climate mitigation. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Rural Development Programme (RDP), supports are included to help farmers improve their farm&rsquo;s environmental performance. The Green Low Carbon Agri-Environment scheme (GLAS) includes specific measures to support climate change objectives, whilst our Organic Farming scheme supports organic farming as an alternative farming system contributing to improving soil quality and mitigation and adaptation to climate change.<\/p>  <p>  Improving breeding and maintaining the health of livestock is also very important to achieving efficiency and managing emissions.  This is actively supported through our Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP). This Programme ranks the efficiency of beef breeding animals on a star based system, with 5-star being the most efficient.  Building on the success of this Programme I have just announced a new pilot scheme - The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP) &ndash; which will be targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production by measuring the weaning efficiency of suckler cows. Farmers will get detailed feedback on the performance of individual animals allowing them to identify the most productive cows in their herd. On the Dairy side, the Economic Breeding Index is identifying the most efficient animals for grass based production system.<\/p>  <p>  I would also mention the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS). This scheme supports capital investment to promote sustainability such as low emissions slurry spreading equipment and energy efficiency support measures.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of sequestration, or the capturing of carbon, our most significant intervention is the national afforestation programme.  Afforestation and forests also play a key role in replacing energy intensive materials and providing sustainable renewable biomass to the energy sector. Since 1990 almost 312,000 hectares have been afforested primarily by farmers with supports from my Department, which represents a 40% increase in forest cover. It is intended to expand our overall forest estate from 11% to 18% by 2050. We are therefore investing heavily in the Afforestation Scheme to encourage landowners to establish forests on their land. The Government has recently approved significant improvements in grant and premium rates here under the agroforestry and forestry for fibre options.<\/p>  <p>  My department continues to review the types of schemes that will enable our farmers to transition to a low carbon economy.  Higher ambition on environmental and climate action are part of the new CAP, post 2020, and it is proposed that 40% of the overall CAP budget will contribute to climate action. This will require farmers to achieve a higher level of environmental ambition through both mandatory and incentive-based measures as part of their transition to a low carbon economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry Irregularities","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA04000"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[51167\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA04100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of times to date in 2018 that beef processing factories have been fined for breaching EU carcass trimming rules; the range of fines imposed; the maximum level that can be imposed; the number of inspections by officials in 2018 in such factories to check that grading and trimming is in compliance with regulations; and if will he consider publishing the names of factories fined in 2018.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>To date in 2018 there were fines applied to a total of 19 carcases that were non compliant with the EU reference carcase trimming specification.

This represented a significant boost to on-farm cash flows and once again sees Ireland at the forefront of EU member states in making advance payments on this scale.<\/p>  <p>  All GLAS participants who have selected the Commonage action are required to have a Commonage Management Plan, or a Commonage Farm Plan where the commonage is less than 10ha. These plans must be submitted to the online system on their behalf by their advisor. Currently Commonage Management Plans have been submitted for 3,653 GLAS commonages and plans are outstanding for  291 commonages.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has issued regular reminders to both shareholders and advisors emphasising the need to have this work completed so that GLAS payments can be made for the outstanding cases. <\/p>  <p>  GLAS payments can only issue once all validations have been passed - even where a Commonage Management Plan has been submitted, all other scheme requirements must also be met in order for payment to be processed. <\/p>  <p>  I would urge all participants with outstanding Commonage Management Plans to contact their advisors to ensure that their application can pass through the validation process. GLAS payments continue to issue on a weekly basis. I would also urge GLAS participants with any other outstanding documentation such as Rare Breed or Low Emission Slurry Spreading forms outstanding Nutrient Management Plans to ensure that these requirements are met without delay to allow for the early issue of payments. Participants who have not yet done so are also reminded of the need to complete a one day GLAS Training Course.<\/p>  <p>  To date, I am pleased to say that 39,665 GLAS participants have received their 2018 advance payment which equates to 96% of eligible cases paid. This amounts to a total of just under &euro;140m paid since the 2018 GLAS advance payments commenced on 14 November last.  . <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Identification Schemes","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA06100"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[51164\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600059#WRA06200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will consider developing an application that could be linked to Agfood.ie and would be accessible on smartphones in order that farmers can record births and animal movements more easily; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1345","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>My Department is at an advanced stage of development to provide a calf birth registration application that will be accessible on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets for farmers who are already registered for Agfood.ie services.

The value of exports to Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central\/South America stood at almost &euro;2.8 billion in 2017.  The value of trade to these markets increased by 159% since 2009.  These markets now account for over 20% of total agri-food exports.

The information revealed from the Site Investigation Report indicated that some of the dredge material would not be suitable for conventional disposal at sea, which would add to the overall cost of a project.<\/p><p>In June 2016, a firm of consulting engineers were engaged to prepare a report to include scoping the project, various disposal options for the dredged material at Howth and permitting requirements. Following receipt of the<b><\/b>consulting engineers<b><\/b>report in late October 2017, my Department&rsquo;s Engineers met with Fingal County Council, to review possible operational and permitting requirements. In addition, a further meeting was held between Department Engineers and the consulting engineers on 5 December 2017 to consider all disposal options and implications.<\/p><p>I wish to reaffirm my Department&rsquo;s commitment to progressing the dredging project for Howth Harbour and the &euro;100,000 allocated in this year's capital programme is for further detailed studies, including scoping, shore based re-use of dredge material and land-use layout options. This is a complex undertaking and the planning, tendering and contract award phase of this project could take at least two years. A variety of factors will impact on the final cost of a potential dredging project including the disposal options, overall scale of the project, and market factors. At this point no overall estimation of cost has been established. While the final scope and costs remain to be set, it is likely that the overall cost will exceed &euro;20M and therefore a cost benefit analysis will also be required.<\/p><p>The project will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and a Waste License.  The Department went to tender on 3 October 2018 for a Consulting Engineering practice to bring the project through the planning, environmental permitting and design phase. The tenders have been adjudicated and it is expected to announce the successful bidder in early December. <\/p><p>As is the case for all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, any future decision with regard to initiating a full dredging works project in Howth will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600060#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600060#WRB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[51195\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600060#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the efforts being made to safeguard the fishing sector in the context of Brexit.","asker":"1315","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>Overall, Ireland&rsquo;s and the EU27&rsquo;s basic position has always been and remains to be to protect our fishing communities.

In relation to Pillar 1 supports under the Common Agricultural Policy, sheep farmers continue to benefit from the direct income support available under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014-2020, contains a number of support schemes which offer direct financial benefit to Irish sheep farmers.  Sheep farmers continue to benefit from the Areas of Natural Constraint (ANC) Scheme and from GLAS in large numbers, as well as from capital investment support under TAMS.  The RDP also includes specific provision for sheep farmers within the Knowledge Transfer Programme, which has helped to build on the existing knowledge base and skills set in the sector in a way which will help to ensure continued sustainable development in the sector. <\/p>  <p>  I also introduced the Sheep Welfare Scheme as an amendment to the RDP.  Under this scheme, farmers are required to choose from a menu of actions which aim to improve the overall welfare of their flock. These actions must be completed over a 12 month period, and in return the farmer receives a payment of &euro;10 per breeding ewe.  <\/p>  <p>  This important support was introduced for a period of four scheme years, and over &euro;18.4 million issued to sheep farmers in respect of Year 1 of the Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Advance payments under year 2 of the Scheme have also issued in November this year with &euro;15.1 million paid to 18,600 participants.<\/p>  <p>  Taking the range of available schemes together, over &euro;617.5 million was paid in direct financial supports to sheep farmers in 2017.

In addition, the reopening of the Scheme is perceived as one of the most important steps in the future direction and development of the Sector. The Group unanimously agreed that the areas to be targeted should be organic horticulture, cereals and dairy.<\/p>  <p>  Having spoken to the various organic stakeholders I fully believe that opportunities exist for Irish organic produce both at home and abroad. With regard to horticulture for example, according to Bord Bia research in 2017, sales of organic fruit and vegetables make up 34pc of the Irish organic market.  There are clearly opportunities for Irish producers to substitute imports, both for established growers and new entrants to the sector as we import almost 70pc of organic fruit and vegetables sold. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly the Organic Farming Scheme was re-opened on 19 November this year.

I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.<\/p>  <p>  The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most. More than 400,000 people have died and an estimated 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition. While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan. On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalisation Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place last week.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peacebuilding. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as Head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November.<\/p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan.

It will provide a source of funding for small to medium sized residential developments on a commercial basis. The Home Building Finance Ireland Act was signed into law by the President this Monday, 3 December 2018. Much progress has been made in preparing HBFI for launch and it is expected that HBFI will commence receiving funding applications towards the end of January 2019.<\/p>  <p>  It is currently expected that an initial team of c.23 staff members will be employed by HBFI as the company commences operations. Similar to NAMA and the SBCI, all HBFI officials will be seconded employees of the NTMA. In order to ensure that HBFI is established in the most efficient manner possible it is envisaged that the NTMA shall first draw upon any relevant resources, services and experience that are already available within NAMA when appointing staff to HBFI. NAMA has amassed considerable expertise in this area through the implementation of its existing residential funding programme and this will be a key asset for HBFI. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, it will be a matter for the Board of HBFI to determine the precise staffing levels required which will be commensurate with the level of demand for lending from developers. As a result it is not possible to estimate either the total number of staff or the number of NAMA staff that may ultimately transfer to HBFI at this time. The recruitment and transfer of all staff will depend on HBFI's requirements and the availability of appropriate resources in NAMA at that point in time. <\/p>  <p>  Upon incorporation the Minister will provide equity of &euro;20m which will be used to fund HBFI&rsquo;s initial start-up costs. ISIF will then be directed to lend the remaining funding, of up to &euro;730m, to HBFI at a market rate of interest in order to fund delivery of residential property. It is envisaged that this funding will be made available on receipt of funding requests from HBFI, the exact scale and timing of these requests will be dependent on market demand. <\/p>  <p>  Exact lending rates provided to developers will be determined on a case by case basis following a credit assessment, but must be equivalent to market rates in order to comply with EU State aid rules. Based on current market rates and having sought third party market advice, it is expected that minimum lending rates of c. Euribor+5% would be applied for projects with an LTC of less than &euro;50% ranging up to c.+8% for projects at c.80% LTC. A borrowing entity must provide a minimum of 20% equity, which can include the site value and HBFI may fund up to 80% of the LTC (Loan to Cost) of a project. The maximum term of a loan facility is expected to be be 5 years. Full lending terms and conditions will be approved by the board of HBFI in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600061#WRC06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Treaties","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600061#WRC07000"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[51476\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600061#WRC07100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there will be a cost to the Exchequer as a result of the deal struck with Malta to end the single malt tax strategy; if so, the amount on a full year basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>The Competent Authority Agreement outlines the shared understanding of the authorities in Ireland and Malta that the BEPS Multilateral Convention on Tax Treaties will, once it is in effect in both jurisdictions, make clear that it is not the purpose of the bilateral Ireland-Malta Tax Treaty to enable an aggressive tax planning structure referred to as the &lsquo;Single Malt&rsquo;.

The mortgage measures limit the amount of finance that an individual or a couple can borrow to buy residential property. These limits are based on the income of the borrower (loan-to-income limit), and the value of the property (loan-to-value limit).<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank recently published its 2018 Review of Mortgage Market Measures. The analysis carried out by the Bank as part of this review confirms that the mortgage measures are achieving the Central Bank&rsquo;s objectives and are contributing to overall financial stability.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank advises that the rules, and exemptions, are based on mortgage loan drawdowns and not approvals.  The date of drawdown determines which &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; (currently defined as a calendar year) that the housing loan is included in for the purposes of calculating lenders&rsquo; compliance levels.  Exemptions are calculated as a function of the overall level of qualifying lending during the relevant period, and no restrictions apply based on an overall loan book.<\/p>  <p>  Subject to the macroprudential mortgage measures, each lender is responsible for managing its compliance with the limits of the mortgage rules.  Specifically, how a lender assigns exceptions to individual borrowers is a matter for the individual lender, and based on an evaluation of each specific borrower and the lender&rsquo;s own credit policies.  Lenders will also have their own credit policies and the mortgage lending rules are not a substitute for lenders&rsquo; responsibilities to assess affordability and lend prudently.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to any incentive offered to consumers, the Central Bank requires lenders to provide inter alia, all relevant information to consumers including the advantages and disadvantages of availing of the incentive, in order to enable the consumer to consider the incentive offered in the context of their own individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, all regulated lenders are required to ensure that in all of their dealings with customers they act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of customers and the integrity of the market.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[51478\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there are risks to Ireland both macro-prudentially andr otherwise from international banks moving significant portions of assets to Ireland in anticipation of Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Central Bank that when a licence application is received, it is reviewed from a number of different perspectives. These include  micro- and macro-prudential based assessments as well as reviews under the conduct of business and consumer protection codes. In assessing the macro-prudential risks of a banking licence application, the Central Bank examines the potential systemic risk of the applicant on the domestic financial system.  <\/p>  <p>  This assessment includes a review of the bank's business model which includes an assessment of the size of the firm, the likely interconnectedness with other financial institutions and the level of interaction with the private non-financial sectors. Consideration is also given to the potential reputation risks to the Irish financial system by the such applicants.  <\/p>  <p>  As a member of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), decisions relating to the granting of licences to significant institutions are made in conjunction with the European Central Bank (ECB).  When the assessment of the formal application has been completed, the Central Bank will determine whether to recommend to the ECB that authorisation be granted. <\/p>  <p>  A decision will then be made by the ECB on whether to grant a banking licence. A banking licence will only be granted where the ECB and the Central Bank are satisfied that the applicant complies with all of the authorisation requirements.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to licence applications, the Central Bank reviews the potential systemic risk from financial institutions on an annual basis. The objective of the Other Systemically Important Institutions (O-SII) buffer is to reduce the potential impact of a systemically important financial institution&rsquo;s failure on the domestic economy. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank, together with the ECB, is responsible for identifying O-SIIs for Ireland and setting buffer rates. The 2018 assessment was published in November. Six institutions have been identified as systemically important in Ireland and buffer rates have been applied to these institutions. The rates, ranging from 0% -1.5% per cent of risk-weighted assets are to be introduced on phased basis over the period July 2019 to July 2021.           <\/p>  <p>  Since the UK voted to leave the EU on 23 June 2016, there has been a notable uplift in the number of firms seeking authorisation from the Central Bank.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the issues that the Deputy mentions in her question are either being addressed as part of the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s ongoing implementation of its recommendations or have been examined as part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work.  In relation to returning emigrants, the Deputy may be aware that in fulfilment of one of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations, a protocol was agreed between Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance under which insurance companies committed to accepting the driving experience returning emigrants gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.  Insurance Ireland submitted a report to the Department in December 2017.  This report confirmed that Insurance Ireland members have agreed to publish the wording of the agreed protocol on their company websites and any other forms of social media, in addition to providing training for staff who can work through issues with emigrants before they leave, whilst they are out of the country and when they return to Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding drivers of older cars, I am aware of a number of complaints made through representations to my Department on this matter.  As a result  my  officials have engaged with Insurance Ireland in order to get a greater sense of the issue.  In these discussions, Insurance Ireland indicated that they had not discerned a particular trend from enquiries received through its helpline in relation to this topic.  <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, as a follow up exercise, Minister of State D'Arcy held a series of meetings  with the Chief Executives of the major insurers.  At those meetings, insurers pointed out that in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, they will, aside from the  age of the car, use a combination of other rating factors, which include the age of the driver and type of the vehicle, the relevant claims record and driving experience, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  In addition to the above factors, they indicated that  they will price in accordance with their own overall past claims experience. <\/p>  <p>  I understand from the above engagement that it would appear that there has been some movement in respect of the acceptance criteria and the vehicle age threshold levels used by some providers in recent times, particularly at broker level.  However this is an issue which my officials will continue to monitor. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to drivers that are switching from named driver status to fully comprehensive in their own right, Departmental officials have previously discussed this matter with Insurance Ireland and it confirmed that while some insurers do not recognise claims-free driving experience as a named driver, a number of providers do.  <\/p>  <p>  In summary, therefore, this issue and the other issues above, demonstrates the need for people to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo;.  As I have previously stated in replies to questions from Deputies, I would recommend drivers who are quoted increased premiums to consult the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website, which has an informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance generally.  One of the key tips listed to help cut costs is to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[51488\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the action that has been taken to date in respect of each of the recommendations made by the cost of insurance working group report on the cost of motor insurance.","asker":"1222","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Cost of Insurance Working Group is in the process of implementing both its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and its Report on the Cost of Employer Liability and Public Liability Insurance. <\/p>  <p>  The Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017, containing 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions.  While the Report on the Cost of Employer liability and Public liability Insurance was published in January 2018, containing 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions.  Both reports contain Action Plans which set out agreed timelines for implementation as well as a commitment that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  <\/p>  <p>  The seventh such update was published earlier this month and can be accessed on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website under the &lsquo;Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo; section.  The Deputy may wish to note that this provides an update on the implementation of each recommendation as well as a traffic light indicator on the status of each individual action point, including those with deadlines into the future (19 relating to the Motor Report and 11 relating to the EL\/PL Report).  The Update shows that of the 78 separate applicable deadlines within the Action Plans of the two Reports to the end of Q3 2018, 62 relate to actions which have now been completed, while substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  I believe this quarterly report outlines the significant amount of work being done to address the cost of insurance problem.  In this regard, there has been significant progress on a number of legislative fronts as well as the publication of the second Personal Injury Commission report on benchmarking of awards.  <\/p>  <p>  While I acknowledge that some deadlines have yet to be met, the general direction of travel is positive and this is reflected in the most recent CSO figures (for October 2018) which indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 22.9% since peaking in July 2016.  In this regard, I can assure the Deputy that the implementation of the recommendations remains a priority for the Government and I remain confident that the continued implementation of them cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and a more stable and competitive insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":241,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[51255\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding a flood prevention scheme (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1273","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":242,"content":"<p>The protection of Shannon Airport from flooding is the responsibility of the airport owners, the Shannon Airport Authority(SAA).   <\/p>  <p>  The airport is protected by a range of embankments on its Eastern and Western sides which are owned by the Airport Authority which is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of those embankments. <\/p>  <p>  There are other embankments adjacent to the airport which protect Shannon town and these are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works. <\/p>  <p>  The Shannon river basin Flood Risk Management Plan recognises the potential risk of damage to Shannon airport infrastructure in an extreme flood event and indicates that Shannon Airport Authority may wish to consider implementing measures to protect against such risk. <\/p>  <p>  Both the embankments that protect the airport and those that protect the town were not constructed to current engineering standards and do not offer the level of protection required to protect against the 1 in 200 year tidal flood event, which is the accepted standard for coastal defences. <\/p>  <p>  In this context it was agreed by the Shannon Airport Authority and the OPW, working in conjunction with Clare County Council, to commission engineering consultants to procure and manage contractors to undertake a joint topographical survey and geotechnical investigation of both the airport and town embankments with a view to determining the shortcomings in the structural integrity and consequent defensive capacity of the embankments. <\/p>  <p>  The technical survey confirmed that the embankments were not of the required standard to protect the airport or the town against the 1 in 200 year event.

The guidance is intended to assist employers in decision making and does not prescribe that an individual will automatically be ineligible for employment benefits and\/or career opportunities, such as increments, because they have reached a particular level of absence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD04000"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[51378\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD04100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number, date of publication and details of post-enactment reports published by his Department since March 2011, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[51394\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600062#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of Acts passed since March 2011 that his Department is responsible for; the date each Act was signed into law in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 101 together.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy on the Acts passed since 2011 and the dates of enactment is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Name of Act<\/th><th>Date of Enactment<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Appropriation Act 2017<\/td><td>18 December 2017<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017<\/td><td>16 December 2017<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Shared Services Office Act 2017<\/td><td>26 July 2017<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ministers and Secretaries Act 2017<\/td><td>19 July 2017<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Statute Law Revision Act 2016<\/td><td>26 December 2016<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Appropriation Act 2016<\/td><td>20 December 2016<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Appropriation Act 2015<\/td><td>16 December 2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Financial Emergency Measures in Public Interest Act 2015<\/td><td>27 November 2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Act 2015<\/td><td>24 December 2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Houses of the Oireachtas (Appointments of Certain Officers) Act 2015<\/td><td>15 October 2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Statute Law Revision Act 2015<\/td><td>18 July 2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015<\/td><td>23 April 2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015<\/td><td>11 March 2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Appropriation Act 2014<\/td><td>19 December 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Freedom of Information Act 2014<\/td><td>14 October 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Protected Disclosures Act 2014<\/td><td>8 July 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Officer)(Amendment) Act 2014<\/td><td>12 April 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) (Amendment) Act 2013<\/td><td>24 December 2013<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Appropriation Act 2013<\/td><td>20 December 2013<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Construction Contracts Act 2013<\/td><td>29 July 2013<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013<\/td><td>24 July 2103<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ministers and Secretaries Act 2013<\/td><td>23 July 2013<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Financial Emergency Measures in Public Interest Act 2013<\/td><td>5 June 2013<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Lottery Act 2013<\/td><td>14 May 2013<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Houses of the Oireachtas (Amendment) (No.2) Act 2012<\/td><td>26 December 2012<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Appropriation Act 2012<\/td><td>21 December 2012<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012<\/td><td>31 October 2012<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other provisions) Act 2012<\/td><td>28 July 2012<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Statute Law Revision Act 2012<\/td><td>2 July 2012<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Financial Emergency Measures in Public Interest Act 2011<\/td><td>19 December 2011<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Appropriation Act 2011<\/td><td>19 December 2011<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ministers and Secretaries Act 2011<\/td><td>4 July 2011<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The position in terms of post enactment reports varies according to the nature of the legislation in question.

It set out to raise standards in literacy and numeracy in early years and school settings. It recognised the importance of these key skills for all aspects of day-to-day life and learning.  Circulars 56\/2011 for the primary sector and 25\/2012 for the post-primary sector provided information on steps to be taken by schools under the Strategy, including the allocation of additional teaching time to both literacy and numeracy.<\/p>  <p>  An interim review was published in 2017.  The review shows that standards in literacy and numeracy have risen with Ireland&rsquo;s students ranked highly in international surveys, particularly in literacy.  To build on these achievements the review sets out updated and ambitious targets for literacy and numeracy in schools so as to further improve the standards for the all learners with specific focus on our lowest and highest achieving students.  Specific targets for disadvantaged schools have also been included. Publication of the DEIS Plan 2017 is a significant step and its implementation will be the vehicle for driving progress in terms of improving educational outcomes including literacy for pupils at greatest risk of not achieving their full potential. Achievement of targets under the Literacy and Numeracy review will be measured through the National Assessments of English Reading and Mathematics (NAERM) and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education 2018 sets out focussed actions in order to close the gap in literacy and numeracy among our learners, this focus will continue.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills does not hold data on individual children in terms of literacy or numeracy issues.

It is up to schools to adopt these supports as they see fit.<\/p>  <p>- The Department has set out the Continuum of Support framework to assist schools in identifying and responding to pupils&rsquo; needs. This framework helps to ensure that interventions are incremental, moving from class-based interventions to more intensive and individualised support, and that they are informed by careful monitoring of progress. <\/p>  <p>  - Many children require additional teaching support in schools. In such circumstances, the classroom teacher is supported by Special Educational Needs Teachers, who will have access to additional training in the area of special education, and who will work closely with the class teacher to provide additional teaching support for children with special educational needs.<\/p>  <p>  - The classroom teacher, in consultation with the Special Educational Needs Teacher as required, will consider ways in which the curriculum can be differentiated or adapted to suit the needs of individual pupils. This may also involve identifying the most appropriate teaching strategies and programmes to meet the child&rsquo;s needs, and deciding which additional teaching supports are required. Parents should normally be consulted as part of this process.<\/p>  <p>- The Department has produced Guidelines for Primary Schools: Supporting Pupils with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools in consultation with the National Educational Psychological Services, the Inspectorate and Special Education Section.

The school in question is a member of MEI (Marketing English in Ireland), an association of English language schools.  One of the obligations of MEI membership is that schools have protection for enrolled learner policies in place.  I understand that MEI are putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure that affected students will be able to complete the course for which they have enrolled, or a similar course, at another MEI member school.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of English language schools in Ireland are privately run. The relationship between teachers and private providers of education is based on a private contract, and issues relating to working conditions including payment are a matter between the two parties and do not come under the remit of my Department. <\/p>  <p>  There is an extensive range of legislation in Ireland which protects the employment rights of workers in relation to equality, employment contracts, payment of wages and related matters. It is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance to ensure that their employees receive their employment rights. Where an employee considers that their rights have been breached, the individual can bring a claim under the appropriate legislation to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). In addition, the WRC is responsible for monitoring a range of employment rights through its Inspection Service.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also taking steps to strengthen the regulation of the English language sector. The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill 2018 is currently before the Seanad.  This new Bill will establish the International Education Mark (IEM) and a Protection for Enrolled Learners (PEL) Fund. <\/p>  <p>  The IEM is a core component of the Government's policy for the English language sector and will provide a full quality framework for the provision of education to international learners in the future.  Only those providers who meet the robust quality assurance procedures of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) will be allowed to carry the Mark. <\/p>  <p>  Once fully implemented, providers must gain authorisation from QQI to use the IEM in order to be eligible to recruit international students. The IEM is a tool to further enhance and sustain the quality of our education system. It also provides learners, or potential learners, with the necessary confidence that providers with the IEM have been quality assured by QQI.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bill also contains provisions to provide QQI with additional statutory powers to assess a provider&rsquo;s corporate fitness and financial sustainability. The intention is to ensure that a provider is fully equipped in the round to provide a programme of education and training.  This will apply to English language providers seeking to access the IEM.<\/p>  <p>  Upon enactment, the Bill will also empower QQI to establish a fund for the protection of enrolled learners (PEL). This fund will be resourced by an annual charge from those providers covered by it. The fund will be used to &lsquo;teach out&rsquo; a programme in the event that a provider fails to provide a programme. Should this not be possible, the fund will be used to reimburse students for the most recent fees that have been paid. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600063#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":310,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600063#WRE02000"},{"type":"question","counter":311,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[51484\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600063#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a school (details supplied) will be housed within an existing permanent educational facility to ensure that the students are not forced to receive education in prefabs; his plans to ensure that the proposed school which has already been delayed will be completed in 2019; his further plans to ensure that funding will be provided for educational resources in library facilities and recreational facilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":312,"content":"<p>The school building project to which the Deputy refers is at Tender stage and tenders are currently being reviewed.

No. 12 of 2016) commenced the bulk of the Act with effect from 18 January 2016.  That Commencement Order brought provisions of Parts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13 of the Act into operation.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 355 of 2017) commenced part of section 47(c) of the Act with effect from 31 July 2017 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) (No. 2) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 474 of 2017) commenced provisions of the Act relating to adoption by civil partners and cohabiting couples with effect from 2 November 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Part 10 of the Act, which amended the Passports Act 2008, was commenced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 1 July 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Part 11 of the Act, which related to adoption, was not commenced and was repealed by section 2(2) of the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, which came into operation on 19 October 2017, as provided for by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 443 of 2017). The provisions in Part 11 have been incorporated into the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, for which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 177 of the Act has not yet been commenced. Following adoption of the 34th Amendment to the Constitution and its subsequent legislative changes, my Department identified a lacuna in the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 that prevents male same-sex married couples from availing of adoptive leave and benefits. To address this lacuna, my Department has prepared draft legislative proposals that will amend the Adoptive Leave Act that will afford the same entitlements to adoptive leave and benefits to all couples who are married, co-habiting or who are in a civil partnership, irrespective of gender.   In this context, I can confirm that the Government intends to amend the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 to allow an adopting couple to determine which parent is entitled to take adoptive leave, based on the best interests of their family. These amendments were approved by Government on 6th November 2018 and will be included alongside legislative provisions to introduce a new paid parental leave scheme, which was announced as part of Budget 2019.  While it is not possible to provide an exact time frame for the enactment of this legislation, I expect it will be progressed as quickly as is possible in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  The issue of the recognition of parentage for same-sex couples and their children is dealt with under Part 2 of the Act.  The Minister for Health has responsibility for commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3.  The commencement of the provisions of the Act which are related to Parts 2 and 3 will be co-ordinated with the commencement of those Parts by the Minister for Health.<\/p>  <p>  Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004, all of which have yet to be commenced. <\/p>  <p>  Certain sections in Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for the registration and re-registration of the birth of a donor-conceived child. The current position is that these sections need to be amended, to correct technical errors, and have yet to be commenced. These sections fall within the responsibility of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I am advised that the Minister&rsquo;s intention is to correct these technical errors by means of Committee Stage amendments to the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, these sections cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act are brought into operation by the Minister for Health.  The Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Act 2018 was enacted on 24 July 2018. This Act was introduced to correct typographical and technical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act.

At the last meeting of the Beef Roundtable on 3rd October I highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency. I urged processors to engage positively with their farmer suppliers to build the sustainability of the sector as a whole and to ensure a reasonable return for the farmers upon whom the sector relies for its development.  It is essential that the position of the primary producer in the supply chain be improved if the industry is to build a sector for the future.<\/p>  <p>  Global demand for beef is expected to rise by 1.9% this year, with China and east Asia once again being the main drivers of this trend. Irish beef exports grew by 5% in 2017 to reach a value of &euro;2.5 billion, and live exports increased by approximately 30%, giving beef farmers a vital alternative market outlet. These are positive developments for Ireland as a beef exporting country, which remains the fifth largest net exporter of beef in the world and the largest exporter of beef in the EU, and should provide ongoing opportunities for the development of the sector domestically and for growth in Irish exports both within the EU and to third countries. <\/p>  <p>  Securing new market access and enhancing existing Irish beef access has been a particular priority for many of the trade missions in 2017 and 2018.

With this in mind, my Department continues to issue payments under these schemes as a matter of priority.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2018 Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme some 100,828 applicants hold eligible designated lands.  The ANC Scheme is subject to a range of eligibility and compliance criteria such as having successfully fulfilled all scheme requirements. To date some 91,190 applicants have been paid a total of &euro;219.2m under the 2018 ANC Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  It is not possible, at this point, to accurately ascertain the total number of applicants who will be paid under the Scheme.  In particular, this is due to the fact that individual farmers who have yet to meet their stocking density requirements may or may not do so by the end of the year depending on their farming practice\/decisions.<\/p>  <p>In relation to the 2018 BPS, the European Commission agreed to my request for a higher advance payment of 70% under the 2018 Scheme.  This is an increase on the standard 50% rate allowed for under the EU regulations.  Payments under 2018 BPS and Greening commenced on schedule on 16 October with payments worth &euro;732 million issuing to 113,000 farmers.  <\/p>  <p>  This represented an increase over the 111,000 farmers paid at the same stage in 2017, and some 93% of eligible applicants for the BPS were paid in this first tranche.  The success of our move to full online applications this year has helped us to deliver further efficiencies in the processing of payments which are of direct benefit to farmers.<\/p>  <p>  The balancing payments for BPS and Greening also commenced on schedule on 3 December, bringing the total paid under BPS and Greening to &euro;1.2bn to 120,607 farmers which represents 98.3% of all eligible farmers.  Twice weekly pay runs will take place to ensure all cases that become clear for payment are paid as quickly as possible.  In cases where material required in response to queries from my Department is outstanding, I would urge farmers to respond to any outstanding queries at their earliest convenience.<\/p>  <p>  Payments under the 2018 National Reserve and the Young Farmers Scheme have also commenced alongside payment of the 2018 BPS balancing payment.<\/p>  <p>  Advance payment for the Sheep Welfare Scheme also issued on time at the end of November with &euro;15.1 million paid to 18,600 participants which represent&rsquo;s 99% of eligible applications.  This was the first payment run for the 2018 scheme year and additional cases will be paid as they become clear following resolution of outstanding queries such as on reference numbers and completion of actions.<\/p>  <p>  The processing of the Organic Farming Scheme payments will commence this week.  Validations on applications are currently being carried out and it is estimated that 1,160 participants will receive an advance payment in the first payment run.  Payment runs will continue thereafter on a weekly basis.<\/p>  <p>  In December, further payments will commence on schedule under the Beef Data and Genomics Programme and the Protein Aid scheme.  Payments under the TAMS II capital investment scheme are also continuing, with &euro;94.8m paid in respect of 6,503 claims to date.<\/p>  <p>  To date, 40,841 GLAS participants have received their 2018 advance payment. This equates to over 96% of eligible GLAS participants. A number of cases remain ineligible for payment as the GLAS participant and\/or their Advisor need to take action. I would encourage any GLAS applicant with outstanding obligations, such as the submission of a Nutrient Management Plan, GLAS Training or finalisation of a Commonage Management Plan to speak to their Advisor and ensure that this work is completed as a priority. Without the submission of all the required information, these applicants will remain ineligible for further GLAS payments.<\/p>  <p>   In relation to AEOS, 1514 participants have been paid their 2018 Advance payment. A further 286 cases have passed validation and are due to be paid shortly. 321 cases continue to be processed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600066#WRH05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600066#WRH05400"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[51457\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600066#WRH05500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which indicators in respect of Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025 remain in line with expectations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>The main targets set out in the Food Harvest report published in 2010 were, by 2020, to increase the value of primary output by 33% and agri-food exports by 40% (both from a 2007-09 average baseline); and to increase value added production by 40% (from a 2008 baseline).

The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.

Inspection finding reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.

The potential for a complete shutdown of postal services with the loss of thousands of jobs was undeniable. Immediate action was needed to ensure the survival of An Post and the post office network. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the actions taken by Government, An Post has been able to construct and begin implementing a strategic plan for a sustainable future. Government remains fully committed to a sustainable post office network which is a key piece of economic and social infrastructure for both rural and urban areas. Reflecting its commitment to sustaining a nationwide post office network and daily mails service, the Government made &euro;30m available in State funding to An Post to support the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a 5 day per week mails delivery service.<\/p>  <p>  Essential to delivering on An Post's renewed vision for the network is the agreement reached with the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU. The consolidation process undertaken by An Post is the result of this agreement. \u00a0In its negotiations with An Post, postmasters and postmistresses sought both the modernisation of the network and a voluntary redundancy package for those who wanted to leave the business. Talks were concluded between An Post and the IPU in April this year, following three months of intensive negotiations.\u00a0The agreement was subsequently endorsed by 80% of IPU members. The decision on whether to accept the package was solely one for individual postmasters.<\/p>  <p>  An\u00a0independent appeals process was put in place to enable communities to have a decision relating to their local office reviewed. In addition, any retailer in the locations of the 159 post offices can apply to An Post to be considered to take over some or all of the services of the closing post office.<\/p>  <p>  There is widespread acceptance that the post office network requires modernisation to build, maintain and protect a service that meets the needs of communities across the country. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is about getting communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Decisions relating to the Post Office Network, including plans for individual post offices, are an operational matter for the Board and management of An Post and I have no statutory function in relation to these issues. The review process put in place and facilitated by An Post is an independent one and neither I, as Minister, nor my officials have a role in the process. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me\u00a0to comment on\u00a0issues which are direct operational matters for An Post. \u00a0Communities and representatives must engage with An Post directly.<\/p>  <p>  An Post is already in the process of diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products; local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products.\u00a0 A partnership with Avantcard announced in September will see personal loan services available in every post office across the country. <\/p>  <p>  An Post has also confirmed the decision by its Board to provide a mortgage package from next year as part of its financial services strategy. The mortgage offer will be among a set of new products that will include credit cards, personal loans and fintech (Financial Technology) services offered via partnerships under a new brand, An Post Money.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as the banking model is concerned, the Programme for a Partnership Government envisaged that An Post, the Irish League of Credit Unions and other interested stakeholders would be asked to investigate and propose a new model of community banking, such as the Kiwibank model in New Zealand. The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to investigate the German Sparkassen model for the development of local public banks.<\/p>  <p>  A project team comprising officials from the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Finance was established to progress this commitment.\u00a0 The final report was published by the Minister for Finance, Pascal Donohoe TD and Minister for Rural and Community Development, Michael Ring TD on 4 July 2018.\u00a0The final report indicates that the Department of Finance will continue to engage in dialogue with Irish Rural Link and other stakeholders and that it will commission an independent external evaluation of ways in which the local public banking concept could possibly be promoted in Ireland. The Department of Rural and Community Development will continue to focus on rural and regional development generally and will provide a coordinating role across Government in relation to this priority area.<\/p>  <p>  Government business is the backbone of the post office network. In April this year the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection renewed her Department&rsquo;s contract with An Post to provide pensions, child benefit and other social welfare payments at post offices. As part of its consideration of the financial position of An Post, the Government agreed that further opportunities for Government business through the Post Office Network, including the payment of motor tax, should be explored.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On 4 September 2018, the Government approved the establishment of an interdepartmental group to identify options, including procurement frameworks, for delivering services to those citizens who do not wish to use, or are unable to use, digital services. Where a business need is identified, it has been agreed to develop a procurement framework which would allow for the central provision of offline services by Government. The group will provide a report on its deliberations in Q1 2019 and\u00a0the findings of this group may be of use to An Post in the longer term.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Digital Assist pilot initiative was launched on 28 September 2018. Government funding of &euro;80,000 has been allocated to roll out the pilot Digital Assist Scheme\u00a0which will see 10 post offices kitted out to assist citizens with online Government interactions.\u00a0 All 10 post offices went live in the week beginning 20 October 2018 and the pilot scheme will finish in April next year. The pilot will provide further data and insight in relation to the provision of offline Government services to citizens.\u00a0 A review of the initiative will be carried out in Q2 2019 and feedback from this review will inform consideration of further offline services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600067#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":606,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600067#WRJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":607,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[51368\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600067#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number, date of publication and details of post-enactment reports published by his Department since March 2011, in tabular form;

For that reason is it not possible to predict future state pension entitlements, or comment on individual pension planning enquiries, as the qualifying conditions at the time a person reaches pension age may be different.  That said, it is likely that state pension (contributory) entitlement will continue to directly relate to the nature and extent of a person&rsquo;s social insurance record. <\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s website www.welfare.ie provides a comprehensive suite of information in relation to current state pension entitlements, including a range of frequently asked questions.  Information is also available from my Department's offices and from Citizens Information Services.<\/p>  <p>  It is advisable that all contributors maintain their social insurance record as fully as possible over their working life.  It is open to contributors to request a copy of their social insurance record from the Department at any time.  In addition to seeking the record through normal postal means, a person can also access their social insurance record in real time online where they have a verified MyGovID account.  Information on getting a verified MyGovID account is available on www.mygovid.ie. <\/p>  <p>  In April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a state pension (contributory) increased from 260 to 520.  While this change only took effect in 2012, it was signalled well in advance.  In 1993, \"Developing the National Pension System - Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; was published, and recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 contributions, in recognition of the expansion of PRSI coverage over the decades.  The necessary legislation to effect this recommendation was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997, which provided for the implementation of the change in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002 (5 years after its introduction in law), and rising to 520 from April 2012 (15 years after its introduction in law).  There are no plans to remove this minimum requirement of 520 paid contributions for pension qualification purposes.  It is reasonable to require people who claim a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund which finances that pension, over 50 years of working age life.  Having 520 paid contributions alone does not qualify a person for maximum rate pension.  The current homemakers (disregard) scheme and (various) credited contributions can assist applicants achieve a higher rate of payment, but cannot be used to meet the qualifying conditions for state pension (contributory).   <\/p>  <p>  Those who do not satisfy the qualifying conditions for contributory pension, because they have paid few or no contributions into the Social Insurance Fund, may instead qualify for State Pension (non-contributory). This is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means), with the maximum payment set at 95% of the state  pension (contributory) rate.<\/p>  <p>  The Government plans to put in place a new Total Contributions Approach for all new pensioners from 2020.  Under a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo;, a set total of social insurance contributions paid and credited will be required to qualify for a maximum rate state pension (contributory) and people with less than this set total will receive a pro-rata entitlement.  This approach was subject to a recent public consultation.  The analysis of that consultation is almost finalised and when complete, will help inform a proposal to go to Government on the future total contributions approach for new pensioners from 2020. <\/p>  <p>  An interim total contributions approach for post-September 2012 pensioners on reduced contributory pensions is provided for in the Social Welfare, Pension and Civil Registrations Bill 2018.

Of these, 6,085 applicants have 260 or more contributions, but less than 520. <\/p>  <p>  The Department's records indicate that 331 applicants disallowed state pension (contributory) since 2012 were disallowed state pension (non-contributory), as their weekly means exceeded the statutory limit. Of these, 192 applicants have 260 or more contributions but less than 520.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for state pension (contributory) increased from 260 to 520.  The change, which took effect in 2012, was signalled well in advance.  In 1993,&rdquo;Developing the National Pension System - Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; was published, and it recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 contributions, in recognition of the expansion of PRSI coverage over the decades.  <\/p>  <p>  The necessary legislation to effect this recommendation was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997, which provided for the implementation of the change in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002 (5 years after its introduction in law), and rising to 520 from April 2012 (15 years after its introduction in law).  It is reasonable to require people who seek a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund, which finances contributory pensions, over 50 years of working age life.<\/p>  <p>  Those who do not satisfy the qualifying conditions for contributory pension, because they have paid few or no contributions into the Social Insurance Fund, may instead qualify for State Pension (non-contributory). This is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means), with the maximum payment set at 95% of the state  pension (contributory) rate.<\/p>  <p>  The Government plans to put in place a new Total Contributions Approach for all new pensioners from 2020.  Under a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo;, a set total of social insurance contributions paid and credited will be required to qualify for a maximum rate state pension (contributory) and people with less than this set total will receive a pro-rata entitlement.  This approach was subject to a recent public consultation.  The analysis of that consultation is almost finalised and when complete, will help inform a proposal to go to Government on the future total contributions approach for new pensioners from 2020. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600069#WRL03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Administration","counter":757,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600069#WRL03900"},{"type":"question","counter":758,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[51486\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600069#WRL04000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on a community employment scheme (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":759,"content":"<p>Work Schemes such as Community Employment (CE) are positive initiatives that enable long-term unemployed to make a contribution to their communities whilst upskilling themselves for prospective future employment.
