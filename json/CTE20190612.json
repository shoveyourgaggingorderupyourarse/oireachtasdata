I am also Analysys Mason's lead partner on the national broadband plan in Ireland.  I am joined today by my colleague, Mr. Pat Kidney, who is also a partner and head of Analysys Mason's Dublin office, our day-to-day partner on the national broadband plan.  I will provide in the following statement some background on Analysys Mason and take the committee through the scope of our engagement in the national broadband plan, followed by commentary and some aspects of our advice.<br\/><br\/>Analysys Mason is a sector specialist in telecommunications and works across three main areas, namely, strategy, transaction support, and policy and regulation.  The company was established over 30 years ago and now has 260 staff in 16 offices around the world.  Our headquarters are in London.  I have been with Analysys Mason for over 22 years and have worked extensively on broadband-related projects for a wide range of clients, including operators, investors, regulators and governments.  My particular focus is on national broadband policy and implementation which is an area in which I have been heavily involved in the UK and other international markets.  I have given evidence to competition tribunals and in commercial arbitration cases in the UK and Ireland on high-speed broadband networks.  My role in the project for the Department is to provide overall project direction and quality assurance to the team of technical experts working on the project.  That team has expertise across fibre networks, fixed wireless access networks, network deployment, state aid, IT systems and other technical areas.<br\/><br\/>Following a competitive tendering process, Analysys Mason was appointed in January 2015 as technical adviser to the Department, working closely with its chief technical officer, Mr. Patrick Neary.  Our scope of advice was in two main phases.  The planning phase included technical strategy, network cost modelling, developing the broadband specification and identifying the premises in the intervention area.  At the procurement stage, our work included developing various technical specification documents and technical evaluation criteria, interacting with bidders during the technical dialogue meetings, undertaking the technical evaluation and providing various technical inputs to the procurement documentation along with other <i>ad hoc<\/i>matters.  In addition, we have provided various inputs to PwC and Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran on, for example, state aid matters and some regulatory issues.<br\/><br\/>Analysys Mason's role in the pre-qualification of bidders centred on assessing the technical and professional capacity of the consortium with regard to the deployment, operation and maintenance of networks of a similar size and scale to that envisaged in the national broadband plan strategy.  When a change of consortium member occurred, we were part of the team that confirmed the consortium continued to meet the technical and professional capability criteria in accordance with the published tender documents.  We were the lead author of all technical related procurement documents covering the technical solution, future proofing, products, deployment, operations and maintenance.  We took a lead role in the technical dialogue with the bidders, clarifying bidder responses and evaluating the responses against the procurement criteria.  We also provided technical briefing notes and made presentations on technology to various stakeholders.  This included, for example, covering technology developments in fibre and wireless networks.<br\/><br\/>As the committee is aware, Eir submitted plans to expand its fibre network build to cover approximately 300,000 premises in the intervention area.  In accordance with the published criteria, we carried out an assessment of the credibility of these plans from a technical and deployment perspective.  We concluded that they were credible.  The intervention area was changed as a result.  Another area of focus for Analysys Mason was on network costing.  This took place early in our engagement and was updated at various points throughout the process as more information came to light.  Our costing work included capital expenditure, or CapEx, and operating expenditure, or OpEx, elements covering both the initial build of the network and its long-term operation.  These costs were then taken by KPMG as an input into its subsidy model.  We were also involved in technical aspects of the contract development, helping the Department to manage the various technical risks that had been identified throughout the process.<br\/><br\/>The final tender was received in September 2018.  We concluded that the bidder proposed a technical solution that was capable of delivering on the Government's requirements.  As part of that analysis, we noted that the total cost of CapEx plus OpEx was broadly similar to our costing model when differences in take-up were accounted for.  I am happy to take questions on the advice we have provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matt Yardley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Before I open the questioning to members, Dr. Yardley referred to a matter which has been raised a number of times here and elsewhere, namely, the capacity of the consortium to deliver this project.

I break it down to two stages.  During the early stages of the procurement, namely, the PQQ stage, it was really about the consortia demonstrating experience of other projects of a similar scope.  They did that across a range of areas.  We were interested in experience in the deployment or build of similar networks, the long-term live operation of similar networks, their experience of operating wholesale networks, which is particularly relevant to any state aid project, and some issues to do with quality, health and safety and so on.  At that point, we were confident they met all of the criteria laid out at the PQQ stage.  Moving forward through procurement to, in particular, the final bid stage, the bidder provided a great deal more detail on the proposed network.  In summary, the bidder is building a substantial organisation.  That includes 265 people in the core National Broadband Ireland, NBI, business.  Many of the senior managers of that entity are now public.  The NBI website lists 12 people.  What is interesting there is that many of those people are industry veterans.  They have been working in the telecommunications sector for a long time, many of them in Ireland, for a whole range of operators.  At the senior management level, we were confident that this was shaped in a well structured manner.  Beneath that, we were looking at how all of the functions within the business were structured.  That is still within NBI.  Part of the evaluation criteria looked at that in some detail from an ongoing operations perspective.  We turned then to all of the partners they would rely on for delivery of the network.  We have there a range of companies which are very well established in Ireland and which work with all of the operators in Ireland themselves.  These are the main subcontractors for the build and operation of the network.  In that sense, NBI is not doing anything different from any other operator in Ireland.  It is subcontracting to a range of very well qualified organisations.  That was demonstrated at the PQQ stage and throughout the process to final bid stage.<\/p> <p>  The whole track of evaluation was very carefully done.  NBI met all of the criteria.  As such, it passed that test.  Looking more broadly at how the organisation is gearing up, this looks and feels like a credible wholesale entity.  It is at the right scale, which is a scale similar to what we see in other markets around Europe.  It is partnering with well established and recognised organisations.  As such, we are confident that a very credible bid has been put forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matt Yardley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Is Analysys Mason confident that the cost of the proposed roll-out is satisfactory?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#B00500","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>In summary, we are.<\/p><p>As the Chair can imagine, there is a significant amount beneath that.  As I set out in my opening statement, understanding the nature of the costs in this kind of operation is complex.  Probably the first piece of work we did, back in 2015-16, was to use an existing and incredibly detailed cost model which was developed to understand the possible costs of delivering this network.  I can talk the committee through more of that detail if necessary.  As we went through the process, we learned a lot from interacting with the three bidders that were in the running at that time.  When the number of bidders went down to two, we started to improve and refine the assumptions in our cost model.  The initial cost of deploying the network turned out to be very similar to our original estimates, that is, the cost to build the network.  We were confident that the cost model in terms of homes passed and to cover all of the intervention area was very well behaved and came in very close to the detailed costed solutions put forward by the two bidders.  That gave us some confidence that the model was sound and robust.  Those are the key opening comments on the cost.  I am happy to go through more of the detail behind that if the committee would find that useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matt Yardley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I will roll the discussion out to members.

In 2015, the figure of &euro;800 million was pencilled in and circulated by those working on the project.  It is significant that there has been a 350% increase in a little more than three years.

There were changes to the project which impacted on our estimate of the cost.  That was then taken into account in the subsidy model which influenced the numbers cited by the Deputy.  From our perspective, there are three main reasons the subsidy figure increased.  Two are cost-related and within our scope of work and, as such, I will address them.  The first relates to Eir's commitment to roll out in the 300,000 homes area.  When we constructed our model, knowing that Eir would build in that area, we made an assumption that we would buy a product from Eir to traverse that 300,000 area.  That was a reasonable assumption as it would be the most cost-effective way for a bidder to get through to serve the remaining 540,000 households.  Through the process, particularly at final bid stage, it became clear that that product was not fully consistent with what the bidder needed to meet all of its obligations in a 25-year contract.  The bidder had some nervousness about relying on that product to traverse the 300,000 area because it was signing up to a range of obligations for 25 years and everything was dependent on the connection through that area.  We took the decision on the cost modelling side to inform the Department that it would be more prudent not to assume that product was available but, rather, to build through that area with new fibre using duct and poles from Eir.  That is more expensive because it involves deploying new infrastructure across that area.  That is stage 1, and it was the most important cost change through the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#C01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matt Yardley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>My understanding from answers provided to the committee over the past couple of years - I am open to correction - by Ministers and senior departmental officials is that Eir, SIRO and Enet or, as it is now, Granahan McCourt, were in the game and then the first two bidders withdrew.  Obviously, had Eir stayed in the race and won the bid, it would have rolled it out side by side with or in place of its copper network.  We were told there would be fibre to every home.  That claim was repeatedly made by the Minister.  The only change that has taken place of which I have heard is that the promise to bring fibre to every home has been dropped in recent months.  My understanding for the past two years has been that if Eir was unsuccessful or did not stay in the race, whatever entity won the contract to roll out the scheme would rent the poles and ducting from Eir at a cost of approximately &euro;900 million.  Dr. Yardley seems to be indicating that Analysys Mason costed for a new network being built alongside the existing infrastructure.

The cost increased because we were deploying new fibre in the area of the 300,000 premises.  That is element one of explaining the cost chain.  Since Eir's deployment in the area of the 300,000 premises, we went through a process of asking whether it comes off the map for state aid reasons.  We concluded it did.  It was then a matter of having to build out fibre through an area where the bidder cannot generate any revenue.  There is a double whammy at that point.  We have increased our costs, which are all upfront, so the hit is very hard, and we cannot get any revenue from the area of the 300,000 premises.  That is a very material change for the subsidy.  That is element one of the cost change.  I am explaining how it also relates to subsidy.<\/p> <p>  There was then an additional change to the cost model.  It related to a more nuanced point, which was about the assumptions in the original cost model about the mix of underground and overhead infrastructure in the intervention area.  This was very difficult to resolve because there is no obligation on Eir to publish the information.  There is no public source at all to which one can go to ascertain how many poles and how many ducts there are in the area of the 540,000 premises in Ireland.  At the time, we had a working assumption of a certain mix of underground and overhead infrastructure.  We saw, when the two bids came in, that the bidders' assumptions were different from those in our cost model.  That was quite important to us because it meant our cost was different from the one the bidders were putting forward.  We spent a lot of time trying to understand why that was the case.  Ultimately, it led to the Department issuing a request to Eir to provide its infrastructure database and infrastructure atlas detailing all the poles and ducts in the intervention area.  We analysed these and then found out that the assumptions did need refining and that had a secondary effect on cost.  That was not as big as the first element I described, which is the impact of the 300,000 premises, but it did have an effect that was quite material.  We learned through the process.  We got better information as we went through the process.  Those are the two factors that drove the change in cost.  With the revenue change also taken into account, it explains how we went from the figure of &euro;800 million to what I believe is the right figure to compare with, &euro;1.8 billion, on a like-with-like basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matt Yardley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I have just two other questions because I do not want to delay the meeting.  In the past couple of weeks, I have been told the cost is now in the region of &euro;5 billion.  Dr. Yardley confirmed what I have been told I was wrong about for the past two years and three months, namely, that the hiving off in respect of the 300,000 easiest-to-reach households has materially affected the process and has had a great economic impact on it.  I thank Dr. Yardley for this information.  He is aware that since the other two credible operators have pulled out &mdash; Eir and ESB-Vodafone, called SIRO &ndash; what I have described is what happened.  It was obvious it was going to happen at the time.  My view was certainly contradicted and I was told I was wrong and wide of the mark.  I do not get any pleasure out of saying that it now seems I was correct, as clarified by Dr. Yardley today.  I take on board all the points made in the past five or ten minutes in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I have just one question.  Eir is being given &euro;900 million or &euro;1 billion - the amount sometimes changes - for the use of infrastructure, part of which is in very bad condition, as is very obvious when driving around the country.  Since Eir was privatised, there has been little investment in parts of the infrastructure.  Some of the poles have fallen over.  Some of the poles, if they have been hit by cars or other vehicles, are broken and held up only by the cables.  I do not know with the underground infrastructure is like.  I am told by some individuals working in the industry that nothing has been done with it since the mid-1990s or late 1990s and that it is in bad condition.  On the other hand, the ESB network is in better condition and has to be because it is carrying live electricity wires.  Traditionally, it has been kept very well and has been well maintained.  Electricity goes to every house except the houses of very few who, for whatever reason, do not have electricity.  One could count them on one hand in any county.  I am only aware of two or three people who do not have electricity in my county.<\/p> <p>  Why is Eir being handed the amount of money in question?  It represents a huge slice of the subsidy.  It is one third of the overall subsidy, at least.  It is almost &euro;1 billion of taxpayers' money for permission to use infrastructure that is in bad condition and that will incur a charge year on year throughout the term of the 25-year contract while the ESB network is in place and is ready to use.  The ESB is already using that network to carry telecommunications fibre.  In other countries, the same infrastructure is used for electricity and telecommunications cabling.  Does Mr. Yardley believes this make sense here?  Is it possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#D00400","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The fundamental principle on a project of this kind, which comes down from European Commission state aid rules, is based on reusing infrastructure, minimising duplication of assets to be cost-efficient, and minimising distortion in the market as far as possible.  I would not characterise what is occurring as Eir being handed the money, in that it is perfectly possible for the bidder to use other infrastructure it thought could be used to meet its purpose and honour all its service level agreements under the contract.  It is down to the bidder to choose.  When the bidder put the final bid in, it had to have absolute confidence that the infrastructure could be used for the purpose of deploying fibre.  At the time, I do not believe it was in a position to say that in respect of the ESB, but that could change.  It is perfectly possible through this process for the bidder to engage with other providers of infrastructure if deployment is more cost-effective or if it has more confidence about delivery, timescales or whatever.  There is nothing at this stage that prohibits it from happening.<\/p> <p>  On the comment about aerial versus underground, duct infrastructure is generally not maintained that much unless it needs to be.  Typically, duct infrastructure tends to get maintained in more urban environments if it is dug up when there is some property development or such like.  It generally does not get touched unless it needs to be but I accept the point that, in Ireland, particularly the west, where inclement weather could affect infrastructure, it will need to be upgraded over time by Eir, and it will recover the cost of doing that through the charges it imposes.  On the policy objective, I have referred to what is going to Eir but NBI is delivering through its retail partners services to end users.  Ultimately, therefore, the end user will benefit.  If there are better ways of delivering in certain areas, the bidder is more than open to examining those options.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matt Yardley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>So the ESB network could be used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#D00600","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>There is a range of technical and health and safety-related issues that would need to be overcome but the Deputy is correct that there are examples in other countries-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matt Yardley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>And in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#D00800","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>-----of the low-voltage distribution network being used.

When one starts to go into the matter, it is quite complex.  There are significant health and safety issues involved.  There are also issues with wayleaves because the infrastructure does not go along the roads, it goes direct.  There are technical issues regarding how the fibre is put on the medium and low-voltage networks as well.  There is an engineering solution but the infrastructure and products ESB Networks was looking at developing were not at a stage where bids could be put in and a bidder could commit to meeting deployment targets with certainty regarding costs, etc.  The committee would have to ask the bidder why it chose Eircom.  The latter, or Open Eir, was offering a service with a defined product and a regulated price.  A bid needs to be put in - there is considerable uncertainty about how the ESB infrastructure would be used - and that bid has to be committed to.  The bidder, left with that sort of choice, went with Eir.  However, there is nothing to preclude the bidder from talking to ESB Networks with a view to using its infrastructure in all or part of their network.

We concluded that, over a 25-year period, wireless would probably cost the same, or even more, than fibre would cost.

In fact, the ComReg view was that building so many sites could take ten years.  It seems a long period and is much longer than what we have from the bidder.  The reason it could take so long is that we would need new towers and sites and a lot of these would be on private land.  With fibre net, we are building infrastructure down the roads on poles and through ducts which exist.  We do not have to build anything new but just deploy new fibre, which is very different from having to deploy a new mobile or fixed wireless site where we have to acquire the site itself and connect it to power and backhaul.  We have to deal with private landowners, negotiate wayleaves and get planning permission.

The figures for inhabitants per square kilometre in rural Ireland are pretty low and I believe they stand at 27.  That does not tell the whole story, however.  It is about road frontage and we were quite amazed when we did the analysis on this as part of a wider team.  We have built along roads in a way that is amazingly consistent all over the country.  Houses tend to be built over stretches of a couple of kilometres, with four or five in a row and then a gap until another four or five.  There is a linear distribution of houses and premises in rural areas and this does not lend itself to a high site.  We could end up building a high site that would only cover tens of homes and we may still miss some of them due to the topography and foliage etc., meaning we would have to build out to those houses.  We did considerable work on this across the entire intervention area in every village and small cluster.  We looked at going 1.5 km from each village and took four case studies.  We looked at a detailed design of what would happen if we were to build out to homes and premises in this way.  It left us with orphaned premises and 16% of them would fall out of coverage as a result.  It is a considerable challenge to deploy wireless in an overlay sense.  When people suggest 20% wireless, it would not be in an area contiguous to a village.  It would be spread all over the place and would be difficult to get to.  When the bidders came in they started looking at wireless and two of them had related wireless entities, but they decided on a 100% fibre solution.

On the day of the press conference, a map was handed out and it was very clear to me what would happen.  I could identify areas in my constituency, which I know best, where there were clusters of houses and quite a high density of housing for what are rural areas.  Other more-difficult-to-reach premises were out the road, up boreens and were more scattered.  Mr. Kidney has referred to the difficulties in reaching them.  We are talking now about having to roll out parallel fibre cables on existing poles or through ducting in the area that Eir now has, which is now covering approximately 340,000 households.  It is my understanding from what the witnesses said that the original intention was that the developer would splice into that or would use the telecommunications network that is there already.  To be clear, Eir, got that area and took it over.  The developer is left with between 480,000 and 500,000 households.  Dr. Yardley seems to be suggesting that the developer working on the area with 500,000 premises must overlay fibre cable because Eir has stated that it has the area with 300,000 premises and if the developer wants to pass that area, it must install its own system and fibre cables alongside those installed by Eir.  In other words, the developer cannot use the Eir equipment.  That is one point that I want the witnesses to clarify.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#J03500","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":205,"content":"<p>If I could correct the Deputy on that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#J03600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matt Yardley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>My second point-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#J03700","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I ask Deputy Stanley to let Dr. Yardley respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061200002#J03800","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>That is not correct.

We know what things were like in the past.  We know what the structures were.  Gigantic changes lie ahead as a result of Brexit.  It is imperative that we all work to ensure a great deal of thought, work and deliberation is put into the future of Europe.

We are aware of the Chairman's deep interest in and commitment to European affairs.  We would like to compliment him on his participation in the Europe Day debate with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and others at the Royal Hospital on 9 May last.<\/p><p>It is an honour to be invited to address the members of this committee, some of whom I have had the privilege to meet over the years.  In this short presentation, I will outline the context in which the IIEA's work on the future of the EU 27 project is situated.  I will then briefly explore how the concept of alliances has changed, as a background to the work which the IIEA has conducted in mapping possible future alliances for Ireland in the EU.  I will briefly refer to the country profiles which the institute developed for this purpose as part of a project on the EU 27 post Brexit and I will conclude with a few remarks on existing and potential alliances for Ireland.  My colleague, Marie Cross, former ambassador and chair of our EU 27 project, will give an overview of how the institute engaged with Irish citizens in the course of the EU 27 project by hosting public events both at the IIEA in Dublin and in rural venues nationwide, and its online outreach strategy via podcasts and explainers, and by convening a group of young professionals, called &quot;emerging voices&quot;, whose publication we have brought with us today.<br\/><br\/>Across all of these elements of the project, the institute has sought to amplify the voices and concerns of citizens young and old, urban and rural, and to bring European voices to both the institute and the regional venues in order to broaden citizens&rsquo; understanding of the priorities and concerns of other member states and to listen to their priorities.  I acknowledge the key role played by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Mc Entee, in the citizens dialogue process, in which we and European Movement Ireland, EMI, were participants, and I thank the Deputies and MEPs who were very gracious when approached to participate at our regional events.<br\/><br\/>This is a strategic moment for the EU.  Its institutions are in a period of transition and the five key appointments which will be decided at the European Council on 20 and 21 June next are eagerly awaited.  We are on the cusp of the Finnish Presidency, which will have to oversee the Brexit process and the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, negotiations.  However, the defining event in terms of the future of the EU was the UK referendum in 2016 that led to widespread reflection on the future of the EU 27 post Brexit.  This commenced with discussions in Bratislava and Rome, came to fruition at the Sibiu summit in Romania on 9 May last and the culmination of this process will be the EU strategic agenda for the period 2019 to 2024, which will be decided at the summit in Brussels later this month.  One overriding conclusion from this process was the need to create new alliances between member states post Brexit.  This is particularly the case for smaller states like Ireland which, in the absence of the UK, will need the support of other smaller states, or alliances with larger member states, in order to exercise influence in the EU in the future and to have its voice heard at the EU table.<br\/><br\/>Although alliances are traditionally understood as fixed associations between countries with a common goal, a new interpretation of alliances envisages bilateral relationships that involve flexibility, as well as long-term co-operation towards common strategic goals.  Alliances can also be used as a foreign policy tool to advance national interests towards a common goal.  Ireland, like other member states, should seek to influence the EU&rsquo;s strategic agenda for the next five years and to shape EU policy according to its policy preferences at an early stage.  To achieve this it will have to turn its attention to a review of its already existing alliances, consolidating its partnership with like-minded member states, and exploring the possibility of creating new alliances with other members of the EU post Brexit, including countries with which we do not share the same perspective on every issue.  In a speech to the IIEA in May, Mairead McGuinness, MEP, argued that it is not sufficient to put on the green jersey in the EP and promote one&rsquo;s national interests in an overt manner.  Instead, it is important to develop a broader understanding of the views and perspectives of others in order to proactively develop Ireland&rsquo;s influence in the EU by offering genuine support for the priorities of other member states when required.<br\/><br\/>Developing connections with our partners in the EU 27 is not limited to official government relationships.  It also involves engagement with civil society, think tanks and universities, to get a deeper and more informed understanding of local issues in other member states.  To this end, the IIEA engaged in a mapping exercise to identify relevant ideas from think-tank analyses in other member states and speeches by Ministers and MEPs from partner countries for the purposes of better mutual understanding of policy positions across the EU 27.<br\/><br\/>As part of a three-year project on the future of EU 27 post Brexit, supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the IIEA developed a series of country profiles on the 26 EU member states, set out in the form of a map of Europe that is accessible on the IIEA website.  This interactive web tool, EU Explorer: Mapping the Future of Europe, allows the user to hover over a particular country and to search the overall profile of a given member state, or focus on a particular policy profile within a member state.  Each country profile commences with a short overview of the political complexion of the member state and its vision for the future of the EU 27 post Brexit, and each one concludes with an exploration of pre-existing informal or formal alliances of that member state.<br\/><br\/>It was too large a task to look at all policy areas but as part of the initial pilot project programme, we investigated issues such as the budget, economic and monetary union, EMU, taxation, defence, digital policy, justice and home affairs, agriculture, social affairs and trade policy.  The objective of developing the country profiles was to build an understanding of the wide variety of views and policy positions across the EU and to examine the potential for alliances with other member states based on convergent or divergent strategic goals.  Using a traffic-light colour system, the explorer highlights areas of divergence from Irish policy positions in red, and areas of possible alignment or existing convergence between Ireland and a given member state in green.  The country profiles can be found at <i><\/i>and are updated at the end of each month.<br\/><br\/>One advantage of the explorer is that it provides information that has not previously been available to policy makers or the wider public in an accessible visual mode.  A somewhat similar exercise was carried out by a sister think-tank, the European Council on Foreign Relations, ECFR, and its EU Coalition Explorer, which adopted a different methodology from that of the IIEA to identify the preferences, influence, partners and policies of member states and their potential for future coalition building in the EU.  One of the important conclusions of that study was that Ireland needs to select its strategic partners with care, prioritising those who already offer a broad network of contacts and relationships.  While the ECFR explorer seems to imply that countries on the periphery, such as Finland, Portugal or Ireland, have more difficulty in engaging in successful networking, I contend that Ireland&rsquo;s position as a psychological insider in the core of the EU since its accession, coupled with the practice of diplomacy and networking by the Irish foreign service and by Irish business, citizens and officials, as well as parliamentarians in COSAC, is second to none.<br\/><br\/>It is interesting that the Government's approach to alliances seems to have moved from <i>ad hoc<\/i>, issue-based alliances to strategic partnerships with like-minded countries.  An example of such a new alliance is the so-called Hansa group, which includes the Nordic Baltic states plus two, that is, Ireland and the Netherlands.  This group shares a liberal economic view of trade and financial matters with a focus on growth and innovation.  In the absence of the UK, such a coalition of states is necessary in order to have a voice at negotiations.  The IIEA, by the way, is organising a public seminar in the autumn of 2019 in tandem with all the ambassadors of the Nordic and Baltic countries and with the support of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to develop a broader understanding of our mutual interests.<br\/><br\/>Portugal is another small member state which, like Ireland, has a long-established relationship with the UK and is seeking to realign itself post Brexit.  As an Atlantic country, Portugal shares Ireland&rsquo;s interest in maritime issues and transatlantic relations, and has a common interest in Africa.  Similarly, Ireland is actively involved the wider group of 17 on Single Market issues.  Traditional alliances such as the Franco-German alliance will, however, continue to play a significant role in determining the future of the EU.  It is important for Ireland to continue to maintain a strong link to both France and Germany and to invest in deepening these relationships.<\/p><p>Traditionally, the relationship with France has been based on a common interest in the CAP, while the relationship with Germany focused mainly on financial services matters.  Nowadays, there is an appetite to take co-operation to new fields, such as digital co-operation where France, for example, is playing a leading role in artificial intelligence and where Ireland is establishing its digital credentials as part of the digital forerunners group.  The institute is working closely with the French and German embassies in Dublin and the German ambassador in Dublin, H.E. Deike Potzel, has invited some of our emerging voices and our young professionals network to visit Berlin on a study trip in the autumn.  We have also organised a conference with the French Embassy on climate change to explore commonalities of interest in that area.<\/p><p> The IIEA&rsquo;s motto is \"sharing ideas, shaping policy\".  The institute is grateful to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for its support for this EU 27 project which, among other things, examines how Ireland can play a leading role in certain policy portfolios, forming new alliances and aligning itself with like-minded countries, and shaping the future of the EU for the next five years.  The EU strategic agenda will provide the outline and framework, but the challenge will be to fill it with ideas that will represent the vision and voices of our Government, our Parliament and our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jill Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Ms Donoghue has covered many of the areas and I will simply add some details of the projects in which we are engaged.  When the Brexit referendum delivered the result that the UK wished to leave the EU, the IIEA, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs, looked to the future of the EU 27.  Much time and thought has been devoted to Brexit but the institute has also given considerable attention to the future of the EU and to Ireland's place in it.  The future of the EU 27 is a three-year project which the IIEA has undertaken with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The objective is to contribute to the debate about the future of Europe within the group of 27 member states, by providing in-depth analysis of emerging trends in order to gain insight into the major challenges facing Ireland and the EU.  It is also an exercise in listening to Irish people, to their views of the EU, how they wish the EU to develop, what issues are of concern and of interest to people.<\/p> <p>  As we face the challenges of the future for the EU there are a number of factors that can guide us here in any post-Brexit situation.  First, the most recent poll in May of this year showed an approval rating of 93% support for EU membership in Ireland, which has increased steadily and is now at its highest ever.  Second, Brexit has had the effect of exposing very clearly, and in a very raw and sharp focus, what the UK is losing.  The Brexit debate, covered extensively in Ireland, has had the positive side effect of providing more detailed information on the EU than might otherwise be effective.  This is a significant support to the Government in engaging with the strategic agenda of the EU and to the institute in the roll-out of the various programmes in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The IIEA, in drawing up the programme for the future of the EU, has been conscious of the need for Ireland to play its part in support of the European project as a whole.  In this context, we are conscious that we must invest considerable resources in strategic co-operation with the other 26 member states.  Co-operation with the larger member states is important, particularly in the case of the Franco-German alliance but co-operation among smaller members gives support and validation to the larger member states and the EU as a whole.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of elements of the future of the EU 27 programme.  The first was a series of research papers produced by the Commission, which laid out the policies in various areas such as the eurozone, security and defence, the EU budget, social policy and globalisation.  The institute researched these areas and provided recommendations to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It also produces its own research papers on the future of the EU institutions after Brexit, the state of the enlargement agenda, the EU social agenda, the EU security and defence agenda and a number in the economic area.  A wide range of events, open to the public, have been held in the institute with invited speakers from home and abroad, including European foreign and finance ministers, MEPs, politicians, diplomats, European Commission officials, academics and think tank members.  The objective of these meetings is to inform the Irish audience of the views from other member states on the topics which are of significant interest in the discussions under way, not just in the EU but internationally, and which influence the EU in its interaction on the global stage.<\/p> <p>  We have also organised regional events and there have been six in towns and cities throughout the country - Galway, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Dundalk, and Sligo.  Each had a different theme.  For example, the event in Sligo in May 2019 was on climate change and the future of agriculture.  The Limerick event in February 2019 focused on how the EU spent the people's money, with a particular focus on the EU budget.  Each event involved a panel of politicians and experts on the respective topics.  These meetings were successful with very good engagement with the public.<\/p> <p>  A new and exciting development for the institute is the \"emerging voices\" anthology.  The emerging voices group is a pivotal component in the future of the EU 27 project, which brings an extra dimension and fresh perspective to the work of the IIEA.  The group was established in 2017 and the purpose of the initiative was to convene a group of emerging leaders from a diverse range of professional and social backgrounds, taking account of gender balance.  The group met on a monthly basis to share their vision of Ireland&rsquo;s place in the EU and to further their understanding of European affairs.  A collection of papers written by 18 members of the group, reflecting an interrogative approach to EU affairs and proposing forward looking recommendations, was launched in an anthology publication by the Minister for State, Deputy Helen McEntee, last week on 4 June.  Examples of the topics are citizens' engagement in Europe; citizen access to the European Court of Justice; the case for a European mortgage market; EU counterterrorism policy; and re-imagining the African continental free trade agreement, and there are 12 others.  We have also produced a series of 11 so-called \"explainers\".  These are a series of short fact sheets providing answers to common questions about EU affairs and providing insight into what goes on inside the EU.  Examples include why the EU needs 27 Commissioner; how the EU plans to spend people's money; the key upcoming changes in Brussels; what is next for EU enlargement; and where the EU stands on security and defence policy.  Eleven have been produced and four more are in preparation.<\/p> <p>  The IIEA is also producing a series of podcasts, due to be released shortly on a two-weekly basis.  These will deal with broad themes such as EU institutional affairs, populism, migration, transatlantic relations, and the elections to the European Parliament.  The purpose of the podcasts is to attract a wider, younger audience who receive information and analysis in an audio rather than a written form.<\/p><p>The younger researchers in our institute have informed us that this is a popular way for young people to access information about the European Union.  The  institute has also held podcast interviews with a series of visiting speakers, including Philippe Lamberts on the green perspective on the future of Europe, the Russian speaker, Dr. Dmitri Trenin, on Russia and Europe, and Dr Constanze Stelzenm&uuml;ller on transatlantic relations in the age of Trump.  Other themes included Franco-German relations and the question, \"Is Europe facing a democratic recession?\"<\/p><p> The German Irish joint forum mentioned by Ms Donoghue is a very interesting initiative and project in the overall development of Irish-German policy.  Last year, and again in May of this year, the German and Irish foreign ministries, together with the prestigious German think tank, the Foundation for Science and Politics, and the institute joined together for a seminar over two days.  It was hosted this year by the Institute of International and European Affairs.  On the agenda were German-Irish bilateral relations, the EU strategic agenda and transatlantic relations.  This was in line with the objective of creating a closer relationship between the two countries.<\/p><p> As Ms Donoghue has outlined, we have a very significant country profiles programme which has been very popular with the number of people have accessed it at home and abroad.<\/p><p> Looking forward towards the next phase to be developed with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, we will work on a programme focusing on the implementation of the commitments agreed by the Heads of State and Government at their meeting in Sibiu in Romania.  These will be brought forward in the strategic agenda to be adopted by the leaders at their meeting on 20 and 21 June, which will set the overarching priorities that will guide the work of the EU over the next five years.  The IIEA will continue the work of assisting the Government in shaping its policies in the implementation of the strategic agenda and in contributing towards a well-informed debate on the EU issues and challenges on the domestic front.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cross for her valuable and informative contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#E00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I thank both speakers for the contributions, particularly for the copy of the emerging voices anthology.

I will be happy for either of our speakers to respond in due course.  Both have spoken about the very strong relationship and of the events held by the IIEA with German partners recently.  What other strategic partners does the institute have?  What work does it do on a European level with similar foundations and think tanks?  It is important that engagement involves every sector of society and is not only on a member state level. <\/p> <p>  Ms Donoghue mentioned Ireland's role as a psychological insider and the very strong work of our diplomatic corps in Brussels in recent years, as did Ms Cross, and our strength at permanent representation, ministerial and Council level.  Ms Donoghue also mentioned the COSAC.  Beyond COSAC, what can we as parliamentarians do to strengthen the reputation of Ireland at that level and build those alliances?  What EU and other fora can we engage with to build that alliance?  Does COSAC meet often enough?  I mentioned that we meet every six months, which is great, in the country that holds the Presidency and the Chairman attends a different meeting.  Where is the opportunity for national parliamentarians to meet to discuss European issues?  Members of the European Union discuss issues at a European level and are not members of their national parliaments.  What about parliamentarians?  Where is the grand intra-European agrifood committee or home affairs committee to mirror the European Council?  Is that something that could be developed or can we improve?<\/p> <p> I have identified, although I am open to correction on this, three major issues other than Brexit facing the EU over the next five years.  It is very hard to look beyond Brexit, particularly in this country, and our approach to these issues might be determined by what happens in respect of Brexit at Hallowe'en and subsequently.  The issues I have identified, which may be considered more important in other countries than here, are migration, the future of the European budget, particularly the CAP, and the climate emergency.  Who are Ireland's key allies on all three of those issues?  On CAP, the obvious relationship, as was noted, is with France.  On migration, we are a little isolated because it does not necessarily impact on us as immediately as it does on other member states such as Greece and other southern Mediterranean countries.  My queries are on those three key areas.  I thank the speakers again for their presentations and the ongoing work on the bevy of reports they produce.  I try my best to read as many as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#E00300","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I think the IIEA for its presentation today and the ongoing work it is doing on the European Union.  I have attended many of its events in North Great George's Street, which are always very interesting and produce lively discussion among its members.  It is interesting to listen to the scientific approach of our speakers to alliance building.  This is a subject the committee has given some attention to since the Brexit referendum in the UK.  The scientific approach to this issue is an interesting perspective and one which we will consider further.<\/p> <p>  I was delighted when Miss Donoghue stated that the practice of Irish diplomacy and networking by the Irish foreign service is worthy of note.  We can be very proud of our diplomats at European Union level in advancing our interests and those of the European Union.  We have had the national statement on the future of Europe, which was debated in the D&aacute;il just before Easter.  This will feed into the strategic agenda later this month at the European Council meeting.  <\/p> <p>  I have two questions in addition to my main contribution which is to thank our guests for the work they doing.  On the question of personal relationships, particularly at European Council level, what weight would our guests give to relationships at that level, namely, between Heads of State and Government when they meet and the friendships that build up?  Do our guests believe they are critical, slightly important or something else, apart from all the other work that is being done?<\/p> <p>  Ms Donoghue also mentioned the Franco-German alliance.  That is central to the EU and we all watch it very carefully.  It occurs to me that if the Taoiseach of the day, regardless of who it is, has a good relationship with the German Chancellor or French President, it is always in Ireland's interest.  How important are personal relationships at European Council level?  <\/p> <p>  In the experience of our guests, do they consider that Ireland is looked upon as something of a bold child, as it were, within the European Union, having regard to our banking crisis, the bailout and so forth?  Are we considered problematic as to the Northern Ireland backstop and Border situation?  We have been taking up a great deal of the EU's attention.  We punch above our weight and are well respected but do some of our allies or colleagues consider us as problematic from time to time because of these various issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#E00400","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560294000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Deputy Bernard Durkan took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I am in an awkward position because I was thinking about what I would say when I was sitting opposite as a committee member.  Perhaps our guests will forgive me if I continue with those thoughts because I wanted, like everybody else, to thank them for being with us today and to welcome their presentations.<\/p> <p>  It goes without saying that the formation of alliances and friendship groups is more important now within the European Union that it was at the beginning of European integration.  I will continue on the theme of my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, on which I take a contrary position.<\/p><p>We are not so much a bold child, but we are seen as a child who might have a problem within the association of which we have become members and whose problem might become the Union's problem at a later stage if not attended to.  It is very important that we learn from this and that we use our position strategically to intone the importance of forming alliances and listening to each other.  We can have alliances with bigger countries and smaller countries to our advantage and to theirs - in our case to learn where they are coming from, where they are going and what their interests are, and at the same time for them to learn from us and for us to learn from them.<\/p><p> This phrase \"bringing Europe closer to the people\" has become a theme across Europe.  I have always held the view that we have to bring the people closer to Europe.  If the people of Europe do not have a commitment to the European strategy, it is a waste of time.  We can bring them as close as we like; it will not make any difference.  The opinion polls in this country indicate the people are closer to Europe because the people have now focused on Europe in a way that we have not had to do since our membership began.  When looking at Europe we see it as part of us as opposed to the reverse.  I do not want to be critical of our good friends and colleagues across the water in the UK.  However, in many situations that have emerged over the years they have adopted the opposite approach: that the European system should become more in line with what they have themselves.<\/p><p> In contrast to that, way back when Ireland aligned itself to the German monetary system as opposed to sterling, that was an important move.  It brought us into the centre of Europe and made us aware of the kind of territory in which we had to operate.  It also made them aware of a smaller country.  It was a very important exercise and that needs to continue.<\/p><p> If we were considering the future without the dialogue among smaller countries and between smaller countries and bigger countries, we would make a grave mistake.  I have had, as we all have had, interaction with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which did a great service to what was needed at that time.  Various EU member states can move on to a different challenge, to meet the new challenge as it comes, and deal with it in a way that we have not had to do before, ensuring that Europe and the European project remain on-stream because if it does not and one block is dislodged from that European brickwork one at a time, then the Europe as originally intended will cease to be.<\/p><p> I am saddened to hear from time to time expressions to the effect that people want their freedom from Europe.  They should reconsider what that means.  In recent weeks one person when interviewed on television said of the modern Europe that since the end of the Second World War, we have had the longest period of peace in the history of Europe.  That is his greatest thing to say, but it says it all.  It says it all that the European project was the best, most important and single biggest peace project worldwide in the history of the globe.  That is something we need to bear in mind in the future.<\/p><p> There is an obvious need for dialogue between all countries at the moment, which is a good thing.  It is good to make ourselves understood and to be understood.  By the same token as we proceed into the next phase of the Brexit era, we need to recognise that we have a story to tell and we wish to hear the story of others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#E00600","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I apologise to the witnesses; during their presentation I was involved in legislation in the Senate and I do not have time to go into great detail here.<\/p> <p>  One of the documents before me is entitled The Specific Character of Ireland's Security and Defence Policy.  Reflections on neutrality is mentioned.  One of the great challenges for us relates directly to our defence policy.  We no longer fight wars on land in the way we once did, but Europe is at war - the Continent, the European Union, is at war.  It is at war in the cyberworld.  The most vicious criminals are working all day, every day to engage in cyberattacks on the European Union and every financial institution and any other institutions one cares to think of.<\/p> <p>  In that context Ireland needs to move its strategic defence policy into that era.  We have security elements within the country.  I believe we need to set aside this notion that Ireland is a neutral country; we were never neutral.  We were militarily non-aligned and that is all we ever were.  The notion that neutrality is in some way challenged by involving ourselves in something as important as PESCO needs to be challenged.  It is only with the might of the combined 27 and the economic might that will bring that we will be able to find the funding required to challenge the modern-day war of cybersecurity.  If we are to do anything, we need to identify precisely where Ireland is from a defence perspective.  We then need to invest.<\/p> <p>  I believe we should have a director of cybersecurity encompassing a slightly broader definition than just cybersecurity because there are other areas.  Ireland's economy hosts approximately 40% of the world's soft balance sheets, representing an enormous amount in this country.  However, this money is footloose and could move rapidly if there is a challenge.  That rapid movement has the capacity to break the country and destroy our economy in a short time.  We should set aside this notion of Irish neutrality and instead start talking about Ireland's alliance in the war in the cyberworld.<\/p> <p>  We are not talking about putting troops on the ground or some notion of a European army at some stage in the future.  However, very soon Ireland will be contributing &euro;280 million to the PESCO project comprising approximately &euro;13 billion.  Through the money we will put in, we will have the capacity and the intelligence in the academic institutions in this country that are capable of providing the research and leading the world in cybersecurity.  This is something we should try to promote.<\/p> <p>  However, this needs an explanation to our citizens who have been told for so long that Ireland is a neutral country.  We can hardly say we were neutral when we provided the weather forecast for D-Day.  We can hardly say we were neutral when we provided safe flight paths over Donegal into Northern Ireland.  We can hardly say we were neutral when we allowed those who landed in the country from sunken ships or whatever to quietly walk back across the Border.  Let us get away from the nonsense of neutrality and talk about the real challenge from the world of cyberspace and everything associated with it.<\/p> <p>  Today is the first day I have publicly spoken on this, but I am becoming extremely concerned about it.  Unless we have a director of cybersecurity under the command of the military, reporting directly to the Taoiseach, we will not be at the races when it comes to exploiting the advantages that will arise from PESCO.  I would look for a co-ordinated group or seconded group of academics under the control of a senior military officer.  Having a senior military officer at the front gives great confidence in the event of an attack when one sees someone in uniform coming out and speaking on it.  We need to bring together academics and the business world, both the financial business world and the producers of goods.<\/p><p>We need to bring them all in under an umbrella group where they are managed and working together to source funding to develop better security systems in the area of software.  We need to have an immediate response system in place in the event of an attack.  In the world we live in today, there are attacks all day every day.<\/p><p> I taught information technology for 25 years.  I worked mainly on the hardware side but I worked to some degree on Microsoft certified professional and Computing Technology Industry Association, professional certification.  At the time we spoke about hardware chasing software because hardware was developing at a slower rate.  We now have a situation whereby software and negative software are developing at a rate far faster than we can keep pace with.  We need to put the resources in place.  I think I have said enough on the matter.  I am really sorry I did not get the full presentation from the Institute of International and European Affairs representatives.  This place is rather busy at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#F00200","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Thank you, Senator Craughwell.

We have to understand that in the dialogue we cannot expect Italy, France and Germany to close down their motor manufacturing industries or engineering sectors.  Likewise, we should not be expected to close down our agrifood sector to comply, but there are other ways and means of doing it.

It is becoming a lively and interesting discussion.<br\/><br\/>Reference was made to our partnerships with other think tanks.  This is something close to my heart.  I am now 20 years at the institute and I have been trying to develop links over the years.  We have three groups of partnerships.  We are members of an organisation called Trans European Policy Studies Association, TEPSA, which organises meetings twice per year before the assumption of the EU Council Presidency between sister institutes of international and European affairs throughout the EU.  We are also involved with foundations as such as the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung and the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, the respective conservative and social democrat foundations, as well as the Green Party's Heinrich-B&ouml;ll-Stiftung in Germany.  These relationships go back over many years.  We have hosted joint conferences with these foundations and sometimes with their support.<br\/><br\/>Many of my researchers write for some of the think tanks in the context of TEPSA.  We have written a joint book with the institute in Croatia.  We have a former director of the Institut fran&ccedil;ais des relations internationales, IFRI, the French think tank, who has been writing blogs and a long analytical paper for us on populism.  The final group is made up of think tanks outside of the TEPSA network such as Chatham House, the Centre for European Reform and the Federal Trust in London, as well as many others that are specific to particular areas.  These may include think tanks that focus on economic areas, like Bruegel.  We have regular contact with such bodies.  Our economist group invites members of these think tanks to discuss economic issues.  We have active interaction with all of these think tanks.  We each read the work all these organisations produce and that helps us to see where others countries are coming from.  It is an important element in the work we are doing on the future of Europe.<br\/><br\/>Some of the themes raised in the questions are of interest.  We were asked who our contacts are and who we have relations with on particular themes, such as migration, the budget and climate change.  The relations are differentiated.  We have done considerable work with Malta and countries on the front line in the southern region that have had the experience of migration in a manner that is far more direct than we have experienced in Ireland.  Solidarity and responsibility are the two concepts most associated with what an Irish response could and should be.  We have also looked closely at the budget.  The negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework are interesting and committee members will see as much if they go online to our EU Explorer tool.  One option available to us involves maintaining the same amount of money and the same priorities that we have had.  The second scenario involves increasing the amount of money that we have and keeping the same priorities.  The third scenario involves increasing the amount of money that we spend and increasing or perhaps changing the priorities from the traditional priorities to accommodate issues such as counter-terrorism and the challenges of migration and climate change.  It is envisaged that these discussions will come to a close under the Finnish EU Council Presidency and, if not, in the following Croatian Presidency but well before the German Presidency.<br\/><br\/>We were asked about parliamentary relations.  I know from talking over the years to Deputy Durkan in this context that this committee has been active in developing relations with parliamentary friendship associations in other countries.  Perhaps there might not be a grand committee for home affairs in the Parliament at which everyone will get the opportunity to engage.  The key is perhaps to break down the issues in justice and home affairs into smaller bite-sized pieces to cover cybersecurity; counter-terrorism; fake news; digital issues associated with privacy; fraud; human trafficking and how blockchain and artificial intelligence affect all areas, including justice and home affairs.  Those of us at the institute have found that by engaging with rapporteurs from committees, who have written expert reports, we get a good insight not only into the combined consensus reached in a committee but a more differentiated view of where individual member states are coming from as well.<br\/><br\/>I will leave the question on personal relationships to Ms Cross, who has experience at first hand of dealing in a diplomatic context with the European Council.  In general, the view in the institute has always been that the more engagement we can have, the better, not only at the highest levels but all the way through the different levels in the EU institutions, whether the European Commission, the European Parliament or the European Court of Justice.  Going to committees, making friendships and having a direct relationship with people definitely yield a bonus.<br\/><br\/>I was asked whether Ireland is the bold child of the EU.  I think we are now what the Germans would call the <i>Musterknabe<\/i>.  We are in fact the model child again in the EU.  We had our problems with the banking crisis but I have come back from various visits in Berlin during the months since January and I have been delighted to see how Germany respects the Irish people for the way they dealt with the crisis and how in many ways, the crisis led to a development of entrepreneurship.  Where people lost their jobs they suddenly tried to create new jobs.  Perhaps the digital area was one of the areas in which this was a possibility.  There is a strong sense of cohesion and solidarity in Germany in particular, as well as in other states, for the position of Ireland regarding the backstop and that is certainly music to our ears.<br\/><br\/>We are working with various countries on climate change.  I mentioned earlier that we hosted a major conference last year at which some 500 people attended to discuss solutions to climate change.  When I met the French ambassador, H.E. St&eacute;phane Crouzat, we talked about what approach we would take.<\/p><p>There is much talk about the threat posed by climate change, the planet burning and the negative issues associated with it.  It might be interesting to adopt a more solutions-oriented approach.  Accordingly, we came up with the proposal of a <i>march&eacute; des id&eacute;es<\/i>, a market of ideas.  It was a conference to produce many ideas and solutions.  We then invited young and older people across the country to enter a competition to come up with ideas to provide solutions to the problem of climate change.  We had everything from musicians playing the sounds of a melting iceberg &ndash; perhaps not the most practical &ndash; and apps developed by younger people to the young lady in D&uacute;n Laoghaire who had started work on her machine to draw plastic from D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  That is a concrete example.  Likewise, in the autumn, with the ESB, we will host a climate change event to look at designing a low-carbon future.  We will be looking at energy use in cities.  We seem to be drifting towards an urban future where climate change will play an important role.  We will be looking at the design of traffic systems and houses, as well as how to make buildings smarter and help people who are willing to invest personally in climate change measures to achieve this.<br\/><br\/>On the digital side, we have been working in our digital and justice groups on issues associated with cyber security.  I will leave the defence issue to Ms Cross who is an expert in the area.  We have been looking at issues such as cyber security, critical infrastructure protection and disinformation, with many other areas such as ethics and the governance of artificial intelligence and block chain technology.  Again, these are opportunities but also hidden threats, unless frameworks are put in place in advance to enable Ireland to adopt an appropriate position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jill Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>In the presentation we referred to the Hanseatic League &ndash; the term may not be welcome at European level &ndash; comprising the Nordic and Baltic countries.  On the areas referred to by Senator Richmond, the migration budget, the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and climate change, those countries have a particular interest in them, although some of them have different views.  For example, the Dutch have a somewhat different view on budgets.  They are more in favour of budgets sustainability and the CAP.  We are working not only with countries with which we have a close relationship on the CAP such as France but also with others which might have a different view.  The idea is to convince them of our interests.  This applies to EU budgets and climate change.<\/p> <p>  We are not at the forefront when it comes to migration.  We have to make a point of showing empathy and understanding for those countries for which it is a significant issue.  Across the European Union, migration is still at the forefront of the issues to be tackled.<\/p> <p>  Having been involved for many years in different Councils, relations at the European Council amount to an important issue.  It is important for us to have good relations with our colleagues in each of the Councils.  I have seen Ministers criss-crossing the floor to talk to Ministers of other member states.  They have dinner meetings and breakfast meetings before Council meetings.  There are groupings for the Benelux, the Nordic and Mediterranean member states.  We are an outlier in that we do not have a natural grouping, but it is important that we have contacts at European Council level and with other member states.  When one is talking to colleagues, one can explain and also listen.  It is invaluable and most important.<\/p> <p>  As to whether we are bold children, each country has its difficulties, although we might believe we stand out because of the banking crisis.  However, others have had banking crises too.  Ironically, the Germans have come in for considerable criticism for the way they handled the banking crisis.  Was there too much austerity?  The Northern Ireland backstop is a specific problem, but the issue of EU unity is bigger than the backstop.  When we had discussions with the Germans two weeks ago, they made the case to us that the major issue for the EU 27 was unity and its maintenance.  They see it in the Northern Ireland backstop.  A country has a problem, but other countries have had problems, including Cyprus and Malta.  However, the issue of EU unity is paramount for other member states.<\/p> <p>  I am co-chair of the security and defence policy group in the institute.  We have people talking about these issues from other member states&rsquo; views.  In the next two weeks we will have a cyber security expert addressing us.  There is no doubt that this is an issue for every country.  On the EU leaders&rsquo; agenda, the first point they will approve is protecting citizens and freedom, as well as tackling hybrid threats and cyber security.  The institute also has a cyber security committee.  We are very much at the forefront in dealing with it and getting experts to talk to people about international threats as they see them.<\/p> <p>  We have to understand other member states on climate change.  They all have different issues in that regard and we must put forward our particular priorities.  However, we will have to deal with climate change collaboratively as we cannot do it on our own.  It is another significant issue on the leaders&rsquo; agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Cross"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I am chairman of the German-Irish parliamentary friendship group and have just left a meeting of it.

I thank the Chair and members for their very kind invitation to attend to today's meeting, the purpose of which is to discuss Irish public opinion on, and engagement with, the European Union.  As executive director of European Movement Ireland, I am delighted to present before the committee again.  I am particularly pleased to be joined by our head of policy and advocacy, Mr. Daniel Keohane.  Mr. Keohane has recently returned to Ireland after spending many years working on the Continent where he focused on a variety of policy areas, particularly defence.  With his extensive experience, he will share some valuable insights into some of these topics and how Ireland is perceived by our fellow EU member states.<\/p> <p>  As members are no doubt aware, European Movement Ireland is Ireland&rsquo;s longest established not-for-profit membership organisation dedicated solely to European issues, founded in 1954.  We are a non-partisan, not-for-profit, membership-based organisation.  Our aim is to develop the connection between Ireland and the rest of Europe and to increase awareness, understanding and debate of European issues here in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  It is a privilege and a vital part of our work programme to engage with all Members of the Oireachtas, particularly members of this committee.  I congratulate the joint committee on initiating this important and timely debate of how best to engage citizens on the issue of our EU membership as well as the vital subject of alliance-building for Ireland within the European Union.  These are topics which demand much more focus and attention over the coming years, particularly as we look ahead towards a European Union which does not contain our nearest neighbour, the UK, as a member state.<\/p> <p>  Through being an engaged member state, willing to regularly debate EU issues in our national Parliament as well as hearing a range of perspectives and evidence from our EU partners, there is certainly both opportunity and room for Ireland to increase our effectiveness at a broader EU level.  Reasoned and robust debate as a country is crucial to enable Ireland to clarify and sophisticate our position on EU policy areas.  So too, is hearing where other member states stand on the same issues.  This combination will allow us to act maturely and confidently at EU level as we approach the next chapter of the EU&rsquo;s history, with a new Parliament and Commission coming this year, as a union of 27 rather than 28.  Such exercises are useful in identifying potential avenues for alliance-building over the coming years.<\/p> <p>  As an organisation, we continue to be very active in calling for Ireland to continue its robust engagement on the future of Europe process through supporting the work of this committee on the subject as well as working closely with the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy McEntee, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to organise the Government&rsquo;s citizens&rsquo; consultation process on the future of Europe and through working very closely with the offices of the European Commission and of the European Parliament offices here in Ireland on this vitally important topic.<\/p> <p>  At European Movement Ireland, we have found the process of travelling the length and breadth of the country to debate the future of Europe inspiring, invaluable, and incredibly important.  From Cavan to Cork, we have gained a huge level of insight about how people in Ireland connect at a local and regional level with our EU relationship.  This has also helped us as an organisation in thinking about how we can work best to communicate Europe to citizens and to ensure that debates on EU affairs here in Ireland are as inclusive and relevant to people as possible.  The value of participative democracy, of going out to different towns and regions around the country, engaging with people and, crucially, listening to what they have to say, was clear.<\/p> <p>  If alliance-building is to be productive and a benefit to the Irish public, we must first endeavour to ascertain what Irish people think about the issues on which Ireland is trying to develop alliances.  The process has led us to question and explore in greater detail some assumptions we might have previously held about, for example, Irish attitudes to defence co-operation, as well as reaffirming others such as Irish positivity towards remaining an active, committed and engaged member of the European Union.  These are issues which we chose to explore further this year in our annual independent poll on Ireland relationship with the EU, of which members of the committee will have received a copy.  With the health warning, which members of this committee will no doubt appreciate, that polls are but a snapshot of sentiment at any one time, they nonetheless serve as a useful barometer of peoples&rsquo; opinions on various issues.<\/p> <p>  We first began commissioning these polls in 2013 to coincide with Ireland holding the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU with the goal of ascertaining the views of people in Ireland on a range of issues concerning Irish-EU relations.  Since then, Red C has been commissioned to conduct the annual Ireland and the EU poll.  We have continued to ask some of the questions from the very first poll each year.  This really shines a light on how the views of Irish people have evolved over time.<\/p><p>It has also helped us to track and annotate these views every year.<\/p><p> Last year&rsquo;s poll showed positivity for Ireland&rsquo;s EU membership at an impressive high, so it is a little unexpected but very welcome to see that support has risen yet again in 2019.  A couple of weeks ago, 93% of those polled thought that Ireland should remain in the EU.  This figure is consistent with other polling on Irish attitudes to Ireland remaining in the EU.  For example, a Kantar poll in April this year found that 91% of Irish people would vote to remain if an in-out referendum were to be held.  A Eurobarometer poll in October 2018 found that 92% of Irish people felt that the country had benefitted from EU membership.  The most recent polls are all showing incredibly high figures and support for Ireland remaining in the EU, at well over 90%.  Since Brexit, there has been a rise in support for the EU across many member states as some of the effects, challenges and complexities of leaving the EU become clear.  In our first annual poll in 2013 support for EU membership was at 81% and, as I just mentioned, we are now at 93%.  This \"Brexit bounce\" or \"Brexit dividend\", as it were, has helped to increase support for the EU across the member states, not only in Ireland.  We would argue, however, that Irish support for the EU goes much deeper than Brexit.  I will now pass over to my colleague, Mr. Keohane, to speak more to that point.  He will also concentrate on some of the other questions explored in this year's poll, and on what its results tell us about the policy areas in which we might seek to build alliances with other like-minded member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir liomsa a bheith anseo le Noelle O'Connell ar son foirne Gluaiseacht na hEorpa in &Eacute;irinn.  As Ms O'Connell said, there has been a so-called Brexit bounce or dividend reflected in our poll.  There is no doubt about that.  We asked a specific question about Brexit, namely whether it had improved the respondent's opinion of the European Union.  The answer was a strong agree at 58%, but arguably that was not as high as one might expect, given how strong EU support for Ireland&rsquo;s national interests has been during the Brexit story.  Brexit has made us all very aware of how valuable the EU is for our daily lives, even more so than before.<br\/><br\/>Another way to think about all this is that the Brexit bounce was building on something that was very strong already.  In our first poll in 2013, Irish support for EU membership was at 81%.  It went up to 93% this year, which is staggeringly high.  Support for membership was already high, however, long before Brexit was even being seriously discussed or debated.  It is worth bearing in mind that the Brexit effect is purely augmenting something that was very strong already.  This is also borne out by other questions in our poll.  We asked, for example, if Irish people would be willing to contribute more to the EU budget.  If people are willing to pay more for something, it usually indicates that they like it.  In this case, 58% agreed with the statement that they would like to contribute more to the EU budget to continue to get the benefits of membership.  It is very clear that we are aware of what Ireland has received from the EU and that we want to receive those benefits continuously and for everyone to continue to receive them.  It is telling that respondents in Ireland are willing to pay more into the budget.  That is not always the image of Ireland in other EU member states because we are seen to have benefitted so much.  Now we are willing to pay more.<br\/><br\/>Since it is 20 years since the common currency, the euro, was launched in 1999, we asked how Irish people feel about it.  The question was whether the euro has been a positive thing for Ireland.  It was an extremely high positive result; an impressive 86% agreed with the statement.  As Ms O'Connell said, I have been away for the past 22 years, since before the euro was launched.  It was still punts when I left.  Ireland has had a very mixed economic experience over the last 22 years.  Let us say it has been very up and down; some would say it has been a roller coaster.  Yet the euro is seen as an incredibly positive thing for Ireland.  This is interesting in itself.  In the UK, it is very common to blame the euro for the economic problems in Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal and so on.  That is not how Irish people feel about it, it seems.  That is the not the story of those of us who use the euro.<br\/><br\/>We also asked about openness to co-operation in a few more sensitive policy areas, such as tax.  As we all know, there is a very interesting debate about tax in Ireland and in the world, for example at the OECD with the United States, France and so on.  It surprised all of us at European Movement Ireland that fully half of respondents said they were open to more co-operation on tax.  That is a very open statement.  It does not refer explicitly to fiscal policy, tax rates, tax bases, corporate tax specifically, or digital tax specifically.  It was a very broad question.  It does suggest, however, that there might be more openness among the Irish population to discuss tax at EU level than is sometimes perceived from outside.  <br\/><br\/>We also asked about security and defence.  For the third year in a row we asked if Ireland should be part of increased co-operation in security and defence.  For the third year in a row, we got practically the same answer, with the figure consistently around the 58% mark.  This year it was 58%, last year it was 57% and in 2017 it was 59%.  That is a striking pattern and it flies in the face of the image that some people have of the Irish debate around these subjects and indeed sometimes the image people have of Irish activity on these subjects.  However, this result is lower than some other polls on the subject.  For example, in a Eurobarometer poll about a year ago, nearly two thirds said they were for EU security and defence co-operation.  It is a slightly different statement but members will get my point.  A lot depends on how one frames the question.  If one asks people if they want to co-operate with others more, they will generally be more positive.  If we ask people if they want to sign up to an EU army, they will generally be much less positive, as was shown by the recent RT&Eacute;-Red C poll, which asked a number of questions about neutrality and had a specific question about joining &quot;European armed forces&quot; which, of course, is not on the table; there is no such proposal.  Only a third responded positively in that case.  Clearly citizens - the Irish public - know the difference between co-operating with others, as we do at UN level as well, and joining an EU army.  It is very important that this distinction is made.  It is sometimes missed in the public debate.  We saw this during the European Parliament election campaign as well.  There is a difference between a European army run by Brussels and governments co-operating on peacekeeping or on having better capabilities and equipment for their armed forces.  They are two very different questions but it seems as though Irish respondents clearly know the difference.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I will move on to alliance building.<b><\/b>The so-called Brexit dividend is only a small extra interest rate on top of what was very strong already, namely, Irish support for remaining in the EU.  There is a general openness to more co-operation and to building on what is there.  Ireland is already highly aware that it needs to build alliances and coalitions.  We tend to be quite good at joining coalitions.<\/p><p>Everyone knows that we are already part of the New Hanseatic League, as it is called, which is led by the Netherlands, with Nordic and Baltic states.  It is a policy-specific coalition in the eurozone.  It might evolve into something broader, but we will have to wait and see.  It is worth debating whether Ireland wants to be involved in something broader.<br\/><br\/>That brings me to a bigger point.  Ireland will have a major structural disadvantage after Brexit when we will no longer have a next-door neighbour in the European Union.  We are not part of a regional grouping, unlike most EU member states.  For example, we can think about the Baltic, Nordic, Benelux and Visegr&aacute;d countries and so on.  This is a major disadvantage for Ireland.  Based on some recent studies by the European Council on Foreign Relations of coalition building and cohesion which I highly recommend, only a few EU member states consider Ireland to be a potentially important partner.  They include Cyprus and Malta which are small islands like Ireland.  It is worth reflecting on this as it suggests we have a major challenge ahead of us after Brexit in alliance building.<br\/><br\/>All EU member states will try to influence France and Germany.  It is wonderful that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is investing much more in these relationships, including having consulates in Frankfurt and Lyon.  Based on how I analyse what came from the European Council on Foreign Relations, perhaps we should be investing much more in relationships with countries such as Denmark and Portugal.  They are not the first two countries one might think of in alliance building, but I stress our structural weakness.  Why, therefore, have I picked Denmark and Portugal?  Denmark joined the Common Market, as it was then called, at the same time we did, with the United Kingdom, in 1973.  Like us, it also has a history with referendums on EU treaties.  It has similar interests in global trade and agriculture.  There is, therefore, a natural alliance of interests and an openness in Denmark to Irish ideas.  The same is true of Portugal which has similar interests to Ireland in trade and agriculture.  We should not forget that it shares a time zone with Ireland.  It also has a very strong Atlantic identity.  In other words, we need to start to think a little outside the box and more strategically, rather than tactically.  We are extremely good at joining coalitions in policy-specific areas, but we need to think a little more in the medium to long term in a strategic fashion.<br\/><br\/>As the former Secretary General of the European Commission, Dr. Catherine Day, elegantly noted when she spoke to this committee on 3 April, Ireland has a very defensive image among the rest of the European Union.  I am more blunt.  Other countries believe we are very quick to say &quot;No&quot; in corporate tax discussions, some defence discussions or on other issues.  We are seen as very slow to initiate a policy idea of our own and I cannot think of one right now.  I am sure somebody will correct me or I will be criticised for saying this, but that is fine.  We must also bear in mind that we have been shown incredible solidarity on Brexit.  The other 26 governments in the European Union have shown Ireland incredible solidarity on the backstop.  I would be very happy to debate why that is the case, as there is a host of geopolitical, geo-economic and value reasons for it.  The others care about a peace process and let us not forget that in itself the European Union is a peace process.  However, some day some of those member states may ask for that solidarity to be reciprocated.  Some of these countries such as Sweden and Finland are not members of NATO and are facing serious aggression from Russia, including military and non-military action.  Are we prepared to support them on their vital national interests of peace and security in the same way they have supported us in our vital national interests of peace and security?<br\/><br\/>A final challenge will be to develop Ireland-based knowledge of the European Union and depend less on English language analysis from the rest of the non-EU anglophone world.  That will be a big challenge for us.  Only one Irish newspaper, for example - <i>The Irish Times<\/i>- has correspondents in the main EU capitals beyond Brussels.  They include Paris, Berlin, Rome and Madrid.  There is a lot of growth potential to have Ireland-based knowledge in that respect.  This weakness could become a strength.  After Brexit, Ireland will be the largest EU member state in which English is an official language.  Malta is the other.  Of course, Ireland will want the relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada to be as strong as possible.  That is in all of our interests.  In other words, there is great potential for Ireland to position itself as an obvious partner for those in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and so on who share the objective of having better UK-EU, transatlantic and global relationships.  That, in turn, will help us to strengthen at a time when, if we are honest, things have been difficult between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  It will help to rebuild trust and relationships with the United Kingdom and strengthen the relationship with the United States and others even more.  Brexit has been and will remain challenging for Ireland but in many ways the post-Brexit European Union will be even more challenging for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Keohane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":287,"content":"<p>May I make some concluding remarks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I will bring in committee members now, but the delegates will be able to contribute again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#L00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keohane as usually I am the one who is accused of depressing people when describing future relationships.  He has outlined a number of very clear challenges in a stark and welcome way.  It feeds into much of the work we are doing.<\/p> <p>  What policy should we be initiating or where is the scope to initiate particular policies?  The term \"investing in relations\" is great.  One of the great achievements of this and the previous Government is that during the austerity years we maintained the diplomatic network throughout the European Union.  The strengthening of the Permanent Representation in Brussels is most welcome.  Beyond this, how can we specifically invest in developing relations?  It is evident that we have seen a great deal of solidarity.  This morning I met a delegation from the Bundestag.  Are we taking that solidarity for granted and how far will it get us if, ideally, we move to the second phase and speak about future relations after Brexit, or if we face the more likely challenge presented by a no-deal scenario?<\/p> <p>  I have some country-specific questions.  It is interesting that the Danish and Portuguese Parliaments sent delegations to us recently from their European affairs and Brexit committees.  I acknowledge everything Mr. Keohane noted.  I do not want to pick at matters as we have a great relationship with both countries.  The obvious challenge in deepening relations with Portugal, in particular, is presented by the language barrier.  As we know, Irish people do not have a great ability to speak a second or third language and there is a particular weakness when it comes to speaking languages like Portuguese.  We may have French or German speakers, but barring a few of my friends who are married to people from Portugal or Brazil, if I am honest, I do not know anybody who can speak Portuguese.  How can we work on this or improve matters in that regard?  How can it be removed as an obstacle to developing that strategic alliance?<\/p><p>With the Danes, it is a far more political point.  I do not expect Ms O'Connell and Mr. Keohane to go into the politics of Denmark too much but there is in Denmark, as in the United Kingdom, a lingering Euroscepticism.  We see that reflected in the recent election results.  While the Social Democrats have come back into power in Denmark, it is a very different social democratic party from, for instance, the social democratic parties in southern Europe or elsewhere where migration has been a much bigger factor.  Indeed, while we have great commonalities with the Danes and very warm relationships, are there areas, especially in agriculture where we are perhaps more competitors than allies, and how do we get over that and make sure that we get the most out of that strategic alliance?<\/p><p> The French and German alliance was mentioned.  I fundamentally believe that we need to maintain the strength of our relationship, and if everyone is looking to improve that alliance, so be it.  The Franco-German alliance will dominate the EU post Brexit more than it has in a long time.  That is merely a fact of life.  We are lucky that we have such a strong relationship with those two member states at diplomatic, political and parliamentary levels.  I would always have seen a strong relationship, definitely at a political and governmental level but also at an internal political level, with the Benelux countries.  To be party political, when I attended meetings on behalf of Fine Gael or Young Fine Gael, our natural allies were always the Christian Democrats from the Benelux region.  It is literally who we sat beside for dinner.  We were able to work together on a range of common motions on what we believed Europe to be in terms of a Union of values and law and order, as well as an economic Union and a social Union.  I note that the Dutch royals are visiting Ireland at present and I am lucky to be attending the event with however many others tomorrow evening.  They met the President today.  I still think those are two relationships on which, going back to my earlier point, we cannot take anything for granted in terms of solidarity.  We also cannot take for granted the relationships with the Germans, French, Dutch, Belgians or any of our European partners, because I would maintain we have very good relationships with all the other 26 and the United Kingdom as a departing member state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#L00400","speaker":"1399","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank European Movement Ireland for its presentation.

I think that not one voter raised a European issue with me on the doorstep, and that is a little disappointing.  We must get people more engaged with the European Parliament elections.

I note the way the debate has been moving in recent weeks in Europe and there being a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for one type of support or another.  I am not sure that is the right way to go.  Europe had a test with the economic crash, and there is a debate as to whether Germany went the right way.  It should not be forgotten that Germany has a history of quantitative easing and it is not a happy one.  It was obviously reluctant to go in that direction again.  Not everybody understands that but it is a fact of life.<\/p><p>The most important aspect of recent events is that all the European 27 member states have stood together.  My belief is that they have done so because they recognise the writing on the wall.  Do we want a Europe in the future or do we want a disjointed Europe, a two-speed Europe or a broken-up Europe?  Having listened to the comments of some who say they want freedom from Europe, I ask what is freedom?  Can we define freedom?  What is our state of mind when it comes to determining it?  One person's freedom might be another person's incarceration.  We need to know that we have some experience ourselves in those areas as well.<\/p><p>I believe we have responsibility for matters such as taxation and security, and we have no difficulty debating that.  The fact of life is that, geographically, we are not in the centre of Europe and we are at a disadvantage.  This will be particularly the case in the aftermath of Brexit.  We are on the fringe.  The countries on the fringe or on the outer rim, as in the analogy of the wheel that I have used previously, feel the draught first and the heat last.  We need to learn from that.  We can learn a lot from European history, the way things have happened, and the way things can lead in the future.  All we need is recognition.  We need to proceed in a unified fashion, supporting each other as opposed to poking the bricks out of the wall, so to speak, to improve the circumference of the wheel.

I appreciate that probably is not a subject for this committee but it is one that we need to bear in mind and consider.<\/p> <p>  We might do our Cork two-hander and continue the winning formula.  I will touch upon some of the topics that Senator Richmond picked up and address some of Deputy Haughey's valid points.  On anything that I omit, I am sure my colleague, Mr. Keohane, will perform an excellent sweeper role on that policy side of things.<\/p> <p>  Senator Richmond raised an important point in terms of languages and the language barrier.  This is something about which we in EM Ireland are incredibly exercised, along with our colleagues and partners in the Commission and the European Parliament, and obviously as are the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister.  I refer to the area of the EU jobs committee and the work of encouraging and promoting a career in the European institutions as a viable and valuable career pipeline and career opportunity.  That Irish pipeline is concerning.  That is why concerted efforts are ongoing to ensure that language abilities are improved.  However, the Senator is right.  It is a challenge and something that needs more focus and support to be given to it.<\/p><p>The Permanent Representation in Brussels is doing a lot of work, but we need to figure out creative ways to enhance our collective efforts to ensure the Irish presence at all levels and in all institutions will continue to play an important role.  <\/p><p> Deputy Haughey touched on the agenda for the debate on the future of Europe.  I thank him for his ongoing support for and engagement in it.  When we were in Letterkenny, Cork, Navan, Kilkenny and Wexford, the topics debated reinforced how important it was to listen to what people were saying and try to get their views and perspectives, for example, on defence, sustainability and climate change.  The consistency in the level of concern expressed about climate change and sustainability was incredible wherever we engaged in dialogue on the future of Europe.  It is important and clear that we cannot be complacent.  If Brexit demonstrates anything, it is the impossibility of reversing over 40 years of negative discourse and diatribe.  The engagement in Ireland on how we would like to shape our European Union membership must be constant.  We have to view the engagement with citizens as an ongoing process, rather than as a stand-alone event, if we are to truly develop, articulate and defend a comprehensive Irish vision of the European Union in which we want to live.  <\/p><p> I can empathise with the challenges mentioned by Deputy Haughey encountered in the European Parliament elections.  Ours was one of the few organisations that invited all 59 candidates standing for election to the European Parliament to participate in a candidates debate to present their views and perspectives and say why they were standing for election.  We did this as part of a series of three constituency debates and engagements.  It was a challenge to move the debate to some of the non-local issues and focus on European issues.  Nonetheless, it was an important and worthwhile exercise.  <\/p><p> We were disappointed that this time around voter turnout dropped from 52% to 49.7%.  It was the first time in 25 years that voter turnout in Ireland was below the overall EU average which stood at 51%, reversing the overall decline in voter turnout since the first European Parliament elections were held.  We welcome the increase in voter turnout across the European Union.  It is encouraging and a sign of greater citizen engagement, notwithstanding the challenges presented by populism that have been mentioned.  Our civic objective and responsibility must be to work constructively with the committee and other partners to reverse the decline in voter turnout here in the next European Parliament elections. <\/p><p> That leads me on to what we are debating.  Alliance building is not just an activity for our political leaders, politicians and Members of national parliaments, it is also part of a whole-of-Ireland approach.  Whether it be civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, business groups, trade associations and chambers of commerce, there is a collective onus to include all sectors of Irish society in the dialogue on relationship building.  European Movement Ireland is actively doing this with its counterparts in the European Movement International network which has a presence in over 40 countries as far as Azerbaijan.  We also try to support and amplify the work being done by many other organisations and trade associations.  It is a very important aspect of their work.  <\/p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Keohane in case I have forgotten anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Building on what Ms O'Connell said, I reiterate the point that having an all-of-Ireland approach to the debate on the future of Europe should be the basic principle.  I personally would love if the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade could be doubled in size as quickly as possible.  We have very small diplomatic capacity, but, thankfully, we manage to have diplomats in every EU member state and most member states of the Council of Europe.  Not every EU member state has this.  I understand we are to open an embassy in Kiev next year, or perhaps sooner.  We must maintain that capacity which we need to increase to have a presence in all member states.  All member states are our partners, not only France and Germany.  Looking beyond what the Government could do, organisations such as ours which have EU and Europe-wide networks are invaluable, whether they are business, trade union, civil society or sectoral networks.  To use the seanfhocal, an t&eacute; nach bhfuil l&aacute;idir n&iacute; fol&aacute;ir d&oacute; a bheith glic.  The small or weak man has to be clever.  We have to be clever in how we think about where we put our resources.  I am not imagining that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be doubled in size by next year, but I hope it will have more resources in the next decade.<\/p> <p>  I made the point about Portugal and Denmark deliberately to encourage people to think hard about this issue because all of the other 24 member states will want to talk to Paris and Berlin.  Germany has more neighbours than my beloved County Meath.  It has a lot of neighbours.  That is a lot of people to talk to and try to keep happy.  The same applies to France.  Territorially, we are relatively isolated.  In that respect, Ireland is the Aran Islands, but if it is not possible to talk to the main person, one talks to their adviser or best friend.  France and Germany's best friends are already pretty busy, but the Netherlands is an obvious place.  Sweden is also an obvious place as it is at the heart of Nordic co-operation.  The Netherlands is at the heart of Benelux co-operation.  It is also leading the Hanseatic League.  Suddenly one ends up with Denmark and Portugal which may get less love from their neighbours.  Spain does not talk to Portugal as much as it probably should.  Sweden does not talk to Denmark as much as it probably should.  Neither does the Netherlands.  Why, therefore, do we not talk to them?  Our only natural allies are Malta and Cyprus.  I want to keep them on our side as it were, but I would also like us to build more of an Irish network. <\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Haughey's great question about the European Parliament, the next European Parliament will be very complicated.  The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, which includes Fianna F&aacute;il and the Alliance Party in Northern Ireland is being reconfigured with the accession of President Macron's Renaissance group.  Even the Socialist Party of Portuguese Prime Minister Costa is thinking about joining it.  As a group, the number of Liberals went up, as did the numbers of Greens, including the numbers of Irish and German Greens.  The numbers in the centre left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats and the centre right European People's Party groups went down slightly.  The overall number in the block of moderates went down slightly, from approximately 526 to 506, but I may be wrong on the precise figures.  However, the drop was very slight.  The extremes did not gain much, but the European Parliament will be more fragmented than it was precisely because those in the centre left and centre right lost seats to the Liberals and the Greens.<\/p><p>We can play with this in all sorts of ways, but it is worth remembering that political groups in the European Parliament are alliances of national parties, not full-blown political parties.  Deputy Haughey knows this better than I do.  They do not always vote together in the same way.  I am not sure politicians in Fine Gael always agree with the German Christian Democrats on tax, for instance, which is fine.  I do not know whether Fianna F&aacute;il MEPs like Barry Andrews will agree with President Macron's party, which is fine too.  That is the way it should be.  Ultimately, all of these MEPs are independent or represent national parties.  That fact should not be overlooked.<\/p><p> Perhaps the bigger story is how the far left or united left group which includes Sinn F&eacute;in, independent MEP Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, Podemos and Syriza lost some seats.  Perhaps Deputy Clare Daly might join this group.  There is about to be a general election in Greece.  It is interesting that this group which describes itself as Eurocritical, if I understood the Sinn F&eacute;in MEP candidates correctly, lost some seats.  The Eurosceptic centre-right conservative and reformist group which includes the Polish Law and Justice party and the UK Conservatives, both of which are in government in their respective countries, also lost seats.  What is going on?  The problem is that far-right nationalists gained seats, mainly because of Matteo Salvini's Lega Nord party.  Marine Le Pen's National Rally party stayed static on 23 seats, if I remember correctly.  The Lega Nord party went from five seats to 28.  I think that was the final figure.  Those on the far right gained.  The Brexit Party was in talks with those on the far right.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, the overall size of the European Parliament will be reduced.  Ireland and other countries will gain seats.  In a nutshell, it will be more complicated.  I know that is not a useful answer, but it is the simplest one.  The easiest way to answer the question is to say we need to see beyond the groups.  The good news is that the moderate centre in European politics has held.  We remember that during the last elections and the Brexit referendum in 2016 it sounded like the Dutch were thinking about a Nexit and that Marine Le Pen might push for a Frexit.  All of this was being spoken about as recently as 2017, but the sceptics have become less sceptical since Brexit.  Hardly anyone in the Netherlands is calling for a Nexit and not even Marine Le Pen is calling for a Frexit.  Even though Matteo Salvini hates the bond markets, he is not calling for an exit from the euro.  That tells us everything we need to know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019061200002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Keohane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keohane and Ms O'Connell for being with us.

I am joined by Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, at the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.<br\/><br\/>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, was appointed in August 2013 to design, build and equip a new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  A planning application was lodged in August 2015 and An Bord Ple&aacute;nala granted planning permission in April 2016 for the new national children&rsquo;s hospital, the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres at Connolly and Tallaght hospitals and related developments, including the Children&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Centre, CRIC, and a family accommodation unit adjacent to the new national children&rsquo;s hospital. <br\/><br\/>I will start with developments related to the development board.  My last appearance in front of the committee was preliminary to my appointment as the new chairman of the board.  The Minister for Health subsequently confirmed my appointment.  Two board members have since resigned, having given great service for six years.  The appointment of new members is within the remit of the Minister for Health and we are working together to fill the positions.  There have also been resignations by executive personnel, including the project director.  An open competition is under way to find a new chief officer.  An interim chief officer and an interim project director have been appointed in the meantime. <br\/><br\/>On progress, the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital is the most advanced element of the project.  Construction work is substantially complete and the building was handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland in May.  Services will commence in the new building once the usual commissioning activities are completed.  That will be a very significant milestone in the delivery of suitable treatment centres for children. <br\/><br\/>Good progress is also being made at the new paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre at Tallaght Hospital.  The decant works are complete and the new cr&egrave;che, changing facilities and offices are open.  Construction of the foundations for the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre building started earlier this year and the new building has reached first floor level.  The new national children&rsquo;s hospital on the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital site is by far the biggest element of the project. <br\/><br\/>The committee will be very aware that the construction costs of these works, as finally agreed with the main contractor BAM, are considerably higher than the previously estimated costs.  Notwithstanding the difficulties in reaching agreement with BAM, the view of the development board was that it would be better to proceed with BAM rather than stop the project and retender for the main construction work.  We could have retendered the contract, but it would have added years of delay.  Between tendering costs, inflation, increased owner costs and mobilisation costs, the likelihood was that retendering would ultimately result in higher rather than lower project costs.  Accordingly, the board recommended to the relevant stakeholders that construction proceed on the basis agreed with the main contractor, BAM.  At the end of last  year the Government authorised the board to proceed with the main construction works. <br\/><br\/>Another significant development is that it has been decided to procure employer-supplied health technology equipment through traditional procurement means, rather than a managed equipment service.  This decision is timely in that it allows for competitive tendering, procurement and delivery of the equipment in line with the overall programme. <br\/><br\/>The construction focus for the last year or so has been on heavy civil works in excavating the site, pile driving and so on.  The building frame is under construction.  The frame can be seen above ground level in places and as it rises, it will give a real sense of the scale of the works.  The mechanical and electrical installation work has started in the basement.  The next construction milestone will be completion of the new access road loop around the site perimeter, thus allowing the excavation of the strip of road running east-west through the building site.  It will be visible later this year.  Drone footage from the site taken at the end of May can be viewed online at <i> .<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barry and invite Ms Hardiman to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#D00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for inviting Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to attend to update it on the new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  I am joined by Professor Jim Browne, chairman of the board of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to provide the committee with an update on the new national children&rsquo;s hospital project as requested in its invitation.  As Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland is the client of the development board for the project, my update to the committee is in accordance with this remit. <\/p> <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland commenced on 1 January 2019 as the entity that governs and delivers acute paediatric services at Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght hospitals and from July at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown.  The commencement was facilitated with the support of the boards and management of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin and Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, both of which dissolved this month.  I take the opportunity to thank the two former boards and the existing board at Tallaght University Hospital, as well as the previous Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board, for their stewardship of acute paediatric services for many decades and, in some cases, centuries.   I also acknowledge the previous Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board in helping to get Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland commenced.  I point out that all board member positions are voluntary and involve the greatest of dedication and effort.  <\/p> <p>  In the delivery of the physical buildings Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland continues to work closely with the development board on matters related to the build, design and equipping of the new facilities.  A series of management and working groups engage on a monthly basis to progress all matters related to ensuring the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres at Connolly and Tallaght hospital and the new national children&rsquo;s hospitals meet the clinical and operational needs of children, their families and staff.   I take the opportunity to recognise the commitment, work and support of Mr. John Pollock, the former project director of the development board.  Within weeks, we will be delivering a service at the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre at Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Connolly Hospital.  It will be followed next year by the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre at Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Tallaght Hospital.  The new facilities, together with the opening of the new national children&rsquo;s hospital in 2023, will transform how acute paediatric healthcare is delivered to the sickest children in Ireland and local secondary care services are delivered in the greater Dublin area in delivering better healthcare outcomes, as well as ensuring better experiences for children, their families and staff. <\/p> <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown was handed over by the development board to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for clinical commissioning in May.  Equipment installation is near completion and operational.  We hope it will be done next week.  Clinical commissioning is under way in time for opening on 31 July, initially on a phased basis.<\/p><p>I remind the committee that 25% of the population are children under 18 years of age.  The majority are healthy, which is good, but one quarter of three year olds are obese, while 16% of children have a chronic disease, such as diabetes, allergies and asthma.  This figure is increasing and 2% are acutely ill or have very complex care needs.  <\/p><p> There is an over-reliance on hospital based inpatient care, with many services accommodated in facilities in Dublin that are no longer fit for purpose.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will provide national paediatric tertiary services which account for about one quarter of what we do, as well as secondary paediatric care services for children in the greater Dublin area  There are 442 beds and 3,388 whole-time staff equivalents delivering services annually to 25,000 inpatients, 28,700 day cases, more than 145,000 outpatients and 120,000 emergency department attendees at the three children&rsquo;s hospitals.  <\/p><p> All national paediatric services are within the remit of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, some with an all-island remit, for example, the all-island congenital heart disease network.  The plan for children&rsquo;s healthcare is outlined in the integrated programme for child health which includes acute paediatrics, social, community, primary care and child and adolescent mental health services.  This cross-divisional programme, rightly, reflects a population-focused, integrated and interdisciplinary approach to children&rsquo;s healthcare and identifies the resources required to best support parents, guardians, families, children and young people in achieving healthier outcomes.<\/p><p> From the perspective of Children's Health Ireland, we have been focusing on our integration programme.  The programme centres on valuing and aligning the different cultures of the three hospitals, integrating ICT systems, standardising clinical and operational protocols and staff recruitment and training.  Significant work is under way across Children's Health Ireland and I will update the committee on some of these aspects.  We have implemented a single patient administration system.  Part of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland&rsquo;s path to integrating ICT systems is a new patient administration system.  It was implemented and went live in mid-April at Crumlin and Temple Street children's hospitals.  It was done without any disruption to services.  It will allow Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland healthcare professionals working in both hospitals and Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, when it opens to view shared patient details, including inpatient and outpatient history, referrals and waiting list details, transfers and chart tracking.  This means that patients will have a single Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland unique identifier across Crumlin, Temple Street and Connolly hospitals.  It is a tangible and valuable result of the early part of our integration work to support shared and common outpatient waiting lists, starting with general paediatrics.<\/p><p> Turning to staffing, the majority of recruitment for the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital is well advanced, with most doctors, nurses, health and social care professionals and administrative staff recruited and start dates in the forthcoming weeks and months.  We will start to treat patients from 31 July.  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Connolly Hospital will provide a range of services, including urgent care, with a short stay observation unit.  Children will be observed and treated for up to eight hours before being discharged.  A very small number will require admission to one of our hospitals.  The facility will also have outpatient care services, including general paediatrics and orthopaedic fracture clinics.  Other specialties will follow.  At Connolly Hospital Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland will create additional capacity for general paediatrics, which is a welcome development in addressing waiting lists.  It will also contribute to significant reductions in waiting times and make the situation better for children and their families.  <\/p><p> Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Connolly Hospital represents a significant transformation of services for families and children.  It will facilitate a new model of care in paediatric services in north County Dublin and its environs, something it does not have.  It will deliver the right care, at the right time, in the right facility and as close to the child&rsquo;s home as possible, as outlined in Sl&aacute;intecare.  I welcome the opportunity to invite and bring members of the committee to the centre ahead of its opening in order that they can see at first-hand this new state-of-the-art facility and the impact it will have in the delivery of care and services.<\/p><p> Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland is in a period of transition, not just for our staff who transitioned to the new entity in 2019 but in how acute paediatric services are delivered in Ireland.  We believe the changes we are making and the impact they will have can be used as an exemplar for the transformation of services across the system.  The changes we are making will deliver better, safer and more sustainable healthcare for children, young people and their families.<\/p><p> I thank members of the committee for their attention.  I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hardiman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#E00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their updates.

Clinicians I have spoken to are very worried about the fact that this has been dropped.  Their point is that around the world it is best practice to have managed equipment services.  For example, in our children's hospitals in Dublin at the moment, some of the most important diagnostic machines such as MRI machines were meant to be decommissioned years ago.  The magnets, for example, are way beyond their use.  The current position is that when - and I am told is \"when\" rather than \"if\" - these machines go, there will be no replacement for them.  This is a high-risk way of running a health system.  The solution to this in other countries, which was meant to be used in the children's hospital, is a managed equipment contract.  Our children would be diagnosed by our clinicians using the most up-to-date equipment, which is refreshed and renewed so that the best possible technology and medical care can be advanced.  I appreciate that there may be a cost saving in moving back to the old way of working.  Is it not the case that this introduces a significant medical risk and that we will end up in the worst conceivable position because we have paid so much for a fancy building that may be beautiful but due to its design is expensive, and as a result, the medical services provided in the building will be reduced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#F00500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I will pass this over to my colleague but the medical equipment that will be provided through direct purchase will be the equipment that is required.

Medical care in the building is being sacrificed because of the overrun.<\/p> <p>  On the previous occasion Mr. Barry was before the committee he suggested that the best way to manage the risks and costs was to look at minimising further additional overspends.  He was new to the job but when a member of the public, who is ultimately paying for this hospital, looks at the hospital, they will see a beautiful glass doughnut, curved in every conceivable way.

I will start and my colleague, Dr. Curtis, might wish to chip in.  It is important to note that there is a national model of paediatric healthcare.  It sets out the grand scheme plan for 25% of the citizens of Ireland.  It is an integrated plan, which means that it takes into account community and acute services.<\/p><p>We have to work in an integrated way, which I am aware the committee supports, and as has been outlined in Sl&aacute;intecare.  In that plan we have identified the priority issues for the next five years that help to address the challenges facing children's healthcare.  This involves us working collaboratively with our colleagues in the community - GPs, public health nurses and others - to look at implementing Healthy Ireland and other plans that have a significant element focusing on children.  The Government's First 5 programme is a very important plan that identifies getting a child started in the right direction around their health and healthcare outcomes and has significant benefits to the healthcare system and to the health and wealth of a country into the future.  There is much planning and integration work.  There is great collaboration among the paediatric community and the acute system, which work together on the priorities.  We know that everything cannot be invested in during the first year and collectively we have identified the priority areas where we need to focus.  We work with some of the national leads with regard to the plans to roll this out.<\/p><p> From our perspective, this year we have identified the regional units in Cork, Limerick and Galway in particular and they have received almost &euro;5 million in investment to build services there.  We are working in such a way that the new children's hospital is about a network of services rather than just one bricks and mortar building.  We work collaboratively with our colleagues in these services to ensure as many of the services as possible are delivered locally.  Some of our clinicians will do outreach clinics in the regional hospitals in specific areas that we have all agreed.<\/p><p> It is a ten year plan and currently we are looking at every year over the next five years for the children's hospital to see how we can invest to add to the existing resources in children's healthcare and to work in a more integrated way with our colleagues, between community, mental health and the acute services especially.  We are looking at how to change the delivery of services to get a better outcome.<\/p><p> I am glad to report, and Dr. Curtis will concur, that obesity has started to plateau.  There are some positive signs around that.  Unfortunately, chronic diseases are still on the increase but I am glad we are getting our second allergist starting, along with a dermatologist and a rheumatologist, which is important.  These are areas in which we have new investments this year in Children's Health Ireland that will transform how we address some of those chronic diseases.  The plan is not to get down on the numbers of super specialties - we definitely have a need and requirement for some of those - but we plan to build a very strong bedrock and foundation of general paediatrics and to support them with tertiary specialty services.  We are glad to say that there has been an increase in general paediatricians with six joining us on the whole team at Children's Health Ireland.  Already they are bringing in expertise around adolescent care and transition care and we also have a general paediatrician with a special interest in dermatology.<\/p><p> We are interested in doing things a bit differently whereby the GPs do not have to wait to refer to the specialist who might have a long waiting list.  Our general paediatricians are taking on board those referrals on a single waiting list that is jointly shared across Children's Health Ireland and it goes to whoever has the next available clinic.  It is about more efficient use of our existing services.  We are working with our colleagues to triage to see what could go to the specialist and so better use their time, and to see what can and should be managed with our general paediatricians.  In using them and engaging much more closely with our GPs in the community we aim to manage those chronic diseases in that way.  It is about supporting them to work a bit differently.<\/p><p> All of the elements mentioned in Sl&aacute;intecare are the new ways of working that we are embedding into the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital, for example, with clinical triage of referrals.  Our general paediatricians are doing a triage clinic where they clinically triage the referrals and then phone the GP, which is very important.  They have managed to divert some 30% of the referrals by engaging with the GP and supporting them to care for the child, as opposed to the child having to come in for a referral.  We are also bringing in general nurse specialists in general paediatrics who can deal with some of the chronic elements in paediatrics such as constipation, some of the rashes and so on.  These nurses can work with the families as opposed to the child having to see a consultant.  All of these new ways of working are how we are trying to transform the services.  The new facilities at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown allow for that.  We have not had paediatrics in north county Dublin and its environs previously.  I am glad to report that the GPs and our community colleagues in CHO 9 in that area are looking at this and working collaboratively to try to use this as a new opportunity to transform, not do the same old same old, and to implement new ways of working, especially around managing chronic disease as much as possible in the community.<\/p><p> Perhaps Dr. Curtis would like to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#G03100","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hardiman.  It is probably best to look at chronic disease management in two different categories.  To a certain extent there is an increasing number of children with chronic and complex disease because we have got so much better at managing those conditions.  Conditions might previously have led to the child's demise in early years but that no longer happens.  This is due to great progress in the quality of care delivered and in medical science.  There is an increase in chronic disease because children are living now with chronic disease.  The emphasis now is not only on continued survival but also on improving the quality of care.  This is a community and a hospital function because those children are all over Ireland and they need the support in the community such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.  That is where the national model of care comes in.  It is making sure that children receive the specialist medical care they need and the community clinical care they need in order to enhance quality of life.<\/p> <p>  Another interesting part is that with the advances in understanding in genetics we can see that conditions such as diabetes, rheumatoid disorders and many of the epilepsies appear to be genetically determined.  We are now understanding where the chronic conditions of a large cohort of children come from.  This gives us a lever in improving treatment.  These conditions are inherent to the person and therefore are not related to lifestyle or anything like that.  There is a medical component.  I believe that we now understand why there is an increase in the number of children with chronic and complex conditions: it is because care has improved.  We do, however, have to continue to improve it.  We really have to make sure we improve quality of life.  Living with poor quality of life is not a huge improvement.<\/p> <p>  Obesity is a mixture - while there is a clinical medical component there is also a huge multi-agency, community and multidisciplinary aspect to obesity.  Within the HSE, for example, the role of the national programmes has made a huge difference.  The paediatric national programme gave us an understanding of paediatric services around the State that we really never had before.  It has enabled Children's Hospital Ireland to have a national co-ordinator for this national network.  The other piece that is of value from the clinical programme perspective is that it brings all of those programmes in the HSE together into a super group looking at important public health issues.  Childhood obesity and well-being is one of those issues.  It will involve education, facilities for sport and recreation and basic nutritional advice for every mother of a young child.  It is a huge programme but it is encouraging to see that it is more of an issue now and people understand that it needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  We will continue to see a growth in complex and chronic health conditions, and hopefully through a multi-agency involvement we might begin to address a more complicated issue such as obesity, which is a health issue because of its consequences but the origins of which are much more complicated.  That requires everybody to be involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emma Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Curtis.

It was explained to us that when it comes to a certain stage, the numbers working on the site will have to increase substantially as regards fit-out and all the necessary specialists who need to go in from electricians to plumbers and so on.  My understanding is that in any major project a time chart is made out on which there are targets to be met by certain dates.  What is the position in terms of meeting those targets?

The frame of the building is beginning to rise above ground level so it can be seen from the outside.  Some of the work is behind the original programme.  Some of it is not.  There probably is not a single reason for that.  It is a very big job and even for a very large international contractor such as BAM, getting up and running efficiently on the scale required is always difficult and can take a little longer than anticipated.  Sub-contracts have to be finalised and even though everybody knew the contract would be awarded and so on, the further negotiations with sub-contractors sometimes take a bit longer than might be the case.  Design details have to be agreed in support of the construction.  The construction industry is very busy and resourcing skilled tradesmen and construction management staff as well is difficult because they are hard to come by at the moment.

In the same vein, as soon as this was spoken about there was a raft of people rushing in to explain that the money for any private medicine would be recouped.  I have asked the Minister and I am asking our guests now if that is worked out in any structured way.  Is there a calculation for what the private facility is going to cost?  If we do not know how much it is going to cost, we cannot know how much we are going to recoup.  We cannot say with any confidence that we are going to recoup the money that will be spent on any private section of the hospital without knowing how much it is going to cost.  If our guests know how much it is going to cost, I am interested in hearing what they have to say.  I am also interested in the structured arrangements that will be put in place to ensure that the money is returned to the Exchequer.  Clearly, notwithstanding the attempts by some on the committee to reframe this as something other than a massive overspend or underestimation - whichever way we put it, ultimately it is going to cost significantly more - the idea that contrary to the spirit and the letter of Sl&aacute;intecare we are now going to be stacking private care into a public hospital is very disturbing for many people.

That was a new departure and an area it never went into previously, primarily because it was not much of a feature.  It was starting to become a feature more and more.  That the INMO counts waiting times now is a clear indication that there are issues regarding staffing.  One can talk about backfilling as staff progressively move out but if one is only backfilling to the current level, one is still going to be understaffed in the original hospitals before people start to move.  There is genuine concern among staff that the push to open the urgent care facility will leave already hard-pressed staff in the main hospitals under even greater pressure as personnel move out.  While we are told the plan is to backfill rapidly, if the staff are there to backfill, why are they not there to fill the roster and ensure staffing levels are maintained at the required level?  There is no group or category of workers in the hospital outside, possibly, of administration where people are operating with a full staff complement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#O00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I concur completely.  In fact, we have a staffing plan that has identified increased staffing, which needs to be funded every year through the Estimates process, as an investment in paediatrics.  We have based that on evidence from comparable international services.  Nobody disagrees with us on whether we have identified deficits.  Within Children's Health Ireland, we have identified where our priority areas for investment are.  We know we cannot do it all in one year.  We have clearly worked across all three hospitals with clinical directors, nurses, managers and the head of the health and social care professionals and identified and prioritised our areas for investment.  I am happy to say we have had the largest investment in paediatrics in 2018 with an additional 173 posts coming into Children's Health Ireland.  The vast majority of those are clinical posts and we are working hard there.  However, we are cognisant of the need for further investment and will identify that as part of that annual investment process.  All of that has been identified in our future workforce plans.<\/p> <p>  We have a challenge in that there is only so much capacity within the existing hospitals.  We are in a very challenging area at the moment.  If one walks around Temple Street Hospital, one will see that we cannot squeeze anything else in.  That is why people welcome the investment in the new facilities.  They are not seen as being in competition.  We are seeing it as taking some of the pressure out of Temple Street in particular so that we can concentrate on tertiary, high-end services within the hospitals and get general paediatrics, orthopaedics and other services out to Connolly Hospital, which will help greatly.  We are looking at strategic alliances through the National Treatment Purchase Fund and others over the next few years as we will have to increase our workforce.  We cannot leave it all to 2023 to do a sudden leap.<\/p> <p>  We have an evidence base with our waiting list whereby there is a requirement for further investment.  With the HSE and the commissioning team around children's health, we have mapped out what we think we need, including identifying the pipeline and whether we can realistically fill these posts.  Some of that means we have set up a whole workforce planning group with the HSE.  We have established specific sub-committees on nursing because of the quantum of the numbers involved.  We have identified a clear action plan for the supply and demand in nursing.  We have worked up something with our colleagues in the doctor training unit on the future, in particular for specialist registrars and having a pipeline there.  We have sought to identify colleagues who have left the country and would return if they saw the investment taking place.  We are making some progress although it is slow and takes time.  There are niche areas in which it is particularly challenging to fill posts.  We want to work also with health and social care professionals.  While they are not among the cohorts with the highest numbers, there are still a lot of them.  There is, therefore, a need to ensure we have a pipeline and, when they come to us, that they have somewhere to work.  It is complex but while the board continues to engage with colleagues on the build project, we have very much moved from the building to issues around staffing and ICT.

He made some quite extraordinary statements earlier which, from what I can see, fit very neatly with Orwellian doublespeak.  He seems to have recast a &euro;650 million budget going to &euro;1.7 billion as not being an overspend.  According to Deputy Durkan, there has been no overspend or overrun, there was simply an underestimation.  That is extraordinary.  It is a bit like agreeing a price of &euro;200,000 for a house with a builder who comes back 18 months later and states that more pipes and wiring are needed and that the new cost will be &euro;600,000 but that the good news is that this is not an overspend or an overrun, it was just caused by an underestimation.  On a serious point, the Deputy's recategorisation of the amount of taxpayer's money that is being used is an insult to everyone who uses the healthcare system and to those who pay taxes.  The idea that we would dismiss an increase from &euro;650 million to &euro;1.7 billion and counting - because it seems like it will go a lot higher - as not being an overspend or an overrun is an insulting re-spin in the context of what we all know to have happened.<\/p> <p>  I would like to go into the issue of private practice with Ms Hardiman.

There are multiple factors that would help us both in recruiting and retaining staff.  Restoration of pay parity is one such factor, as the Deputy mentioned.  Helping staff to find affordable accommodation in Dublin is one of the priority issues we have identified.  To that end, we would like to work with Dublin City Council and others.  We are working on policies on affordable housing to ensure our staff have a sustainable commute to and from work, as opposed to having to drive many miles.<\/p> <p>  Another issue we have identified is that digitisation of the system would help because people are coming from a system that is digitised and want to work in that way.  They are coming to us with lots of ideas on how to connect with patients, patients' families and other clinicians.  It is not just about new electronic healthcare worker records but also using apps and so on and looking at new ways of doing things.  The most important aspect is that when staff come back and talk to us about this, it is clear they really want to make a difference.  They are here because they want to care for children and make a difference.  The new buildings and new ways of working attract them and they are up for the change and willing to be rostered until midnight if it makes services better for children.  We must find ways to support them as much as possible in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We have seven new emergency department consultants, but some of them are on maternity leave.  That is just the reality of the challenge we face, that there are often temporary reasons we do not have every position filled.  We have two people in promotional posts.  We seem to be able to fill the permanent posts, but the challenge lies in filling locum positions.  These are some of the issues we are looking to address, especially accommodation, pay and, in addition, ensuring the team we are putting in place is an interdisciplinary one.  Our staff want to work in new roles and with new people.  The general paediatricians, for example, are being assigned clinical nurse specialists which they never had before.  That type of change is making a great difference to how they deliver their services.  In general, we are concerned not just to keep doing the same old thing but, instead, to use digitisation, new roles and other things that deliver better value to patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#Q02200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I have a question about Holles Street hospital.

That is entirely reasonable because of the difficulties the project has faced over the time.  One of the consequences has been that for the staff in the three children's hospitals, and paediatric services, children and families who will avail of it nationwide, there has been doubt and confusion about whether it will ever happen.  It is seen as a poisoned chalice.  We have done good work on planning and design and we have great staff.  In paediatrics, almost all our staff have been trained outside the country or else trained by the best people here.  Obviously, it is not the building that makes for excellent care but an inadequate building can make excellent care more difficult to deliver, whereas a good environment and resources can enhance the ability to deliver excellent care.  I would like a positive perception of the project to emerge but that is not how people see it.  I know the design inside out, I work closely with the CHI and, therefore, I am familiar with its work on integration.<\/p> <p>  The hospital will be excellent.  It will be a very good place for children who have illnesses and conditions and who need medical input, which is a shame because, ideally, childhood is not marred by such problems.  In some way, it is important that it is seen for what it is, namely, a fantastic investment, long overdue, in the health and well-being of children and young people.  That is not the responsibility solely of the Oireachtas but we are all part of ensuring that the hospital is seen in that way rather than as something terribly negative, which is sometimes how it feels.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hardiman outlined the difficulties in staffing and the genuine challenges in merging three hospitals, doing everything together and commissioning three new buildings.

Perhaps we can refrain from mentioning there is a global shortage as we all know that.  What we specifically want to know is what is being done here.  With regard to nursing recruitment, I presume if there is to be an expansion of service, we are going to need more qualified nurses than we have now.  Given the likely timeline, those nurses are either doing their leaving certificate now or are just finished their first year in nursing.  In terms of how they are to be phased in, can Children's Health Ireland give us an idea of the numbers and whether it has sourced these nurses?  I met some of the student nurses.  A recent survey from the INMO indicates those nurses have no intention of waiting here and working within the health service, and they have every intention of emigrating.  From my previous work, I know that cohort of workers very well.  Traditionally, they would go away for a year and come back, but they are not coming back.  Is there a specific plan in place?  Is there any incentivisation?  Is anything being done with the universities?  Have any of the nurses given anything like a commitment that they are going to stay?  Without the staff, we just have a massively expensive building in which no services can be delivered.  It is the aspiration of the Oireachtas Members to work with the people in this room because we all want to see the hospital built.  However, it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine it is going to be staffed, given the absolute crisis in staffing that exists within the health service at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#S00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":603,"content":"<p>To reiterate, workforce and ICT are the two areas we are focusing on in terms of trying to ensure we are able to leverage this capital investment.  It is of assurance to us that we have oversubscribing among students coming out of the leaving certificate who want to undertake nursing, which is helpful.  Paediatric nursing has the highest points in the whole of the nursing system, sometimes very high points, yet we are oversubscribed.  What we have managed to do is demonstrate that we have increased the undergraduate places for paediatric nursing by ten places, which is good, so we have ten more every year cumulatively going through since two years ago.  Increasing that again is part of the plan we are talking about in regard to the supply and demand of nursing.<\/p> <p>  We have also assessed and discussed this with the nurses who graduate.  The vast majority, up to 90%, are offered a contract and they accept it on graduation, and we will be doing that again.  We have to work very creatively, within a system that is currently very strong on headcount and budget, to try to address that.   We have 90 graduates coming out from September to December of next year and we know we need them because we are in expansion mode.  It is a question of how to do that and that is a challenge we are trying to work through at the moment.<\/p> <p>  From evaluating our existing nurses, we know that postgraduate nurses - those that are qualified in general nursing and then do a postgraduate course in, for example, paediatrics - stay longer with us and those courses do not take as long.  In our plan for supply, we are looking at how we can increase the number on postgraduate courses.  That requires funding and investment because those nurses are not full-time on pay but are 0.5, which means somebody else has to pay for the other 0.5.  That is part of the plan we have identified to see how we can increase the numbers. <\/p> <p>  With regard to accommodation, we have exit interviews when people are leaving the services.  Some of them have had to travel long distances and it just becomes too hard to continue doing that from a long-term perspective.  Key worker accommodation is something we want. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I agree the cost of accommodation is an absolute challenge.

That is what we have identified.  We are then looking at the mix between healthcare assistants and nurses and how we can contemporise that.  That is something we are looking at with the unions involved.  We have sat down and we are doing this in a very collaborative way.

To us, that is using nursing resources better.  We have identified there are elements of paediatric nursing where one does not need to be a paediatric specialist, such as in theatres.  We are looking at all of those elements.  That is all in what we call the supply and demand of nursing that we have mapped out.

We have a work plan mapped out in regard to how to progress with that.  Nursing has been a bit ahead of the others because it is a bigger number and a bigger challenge, and the other is with regard to doctors in training.  We have identified what the requirements are.  Within Children's Health Ireland, we are then looking at how we get the clinical placements and we are all doing all of that planning.  The directors of nursing are working actively on that.<\/p> <p>  We are also doing what we are calling \"healthcare in a box\".

Yesterday, the Canal Way Educate Together kids came back into our offices and we awarded them some nice certificates relating to their understanding of where their future roles could be.  We agree that we have a broader remit than just looking at what is coming out of the universities.  We believe that we have to work with primary schools and the education system.  What we have pulled together, with the development board, is a community benefits group that includes the education boards and authorities in Dublin 12 and Dublin 8, Tusla, the Garda, the HSE and Dublin City Council, working with us to see how we can leverage this investment in an area that is socially deprived so that the whole area would benefit from that.

I have attended many meetings at which this project has been discussed.  Most of the issues have been exhausted.  It is important to reiterate Dr. Curtis's point about the positive role of those who are delivering the hospital.  I have made this point on many occasions.  Perhaps the Chairman and the other members of the committee are aware of the state of Temple Street Hospital and Crumlin hospital.  The witnesses are definitely aware of it.  When I was in the car park of Crumlin hospital nine years ago, I saw cranes lifting prefabricated theatres into the hospital.  I thought it was a waste of money because a new hospital was being built.  I am sure children are being served as well as possible in these prefabricated units, which have been in existence for nine years.  They represent an example of the facilities being given to our children.  I acknowledge that the negativity around this must be very difficult.  Dr. Curtis mentioned that a very good job has been done with planning and designing.  Our job as public representatives is to try to get value for money.  I never had a problem with the location when I studied it.  I have never had a problem with providing the best care for our children.  This is long overdue.  I am a big supporter of trilocation and would like a planning master plan to be delivered for the site.  I understand that the money is not there in the national development plan.  I understand the cascade of priority when it comes to the national maternity hospital being first on the list.  Many people who are looking at this project as it unfolds are losing the will to support it at times.  Many people support it because of the trilocation model and as the best provider of healthcare.  To my mind, the public anger has been about the money element.  It is just so much money.  That is where our job comes in.  We have to take money from elsewhere to pay for it.  It will be a fantastic hospital.  None of this criticism is personal.  We put ourselves in the public eye and take what we are given most of the time, much of which is deserved.  Many of the witnesses have received undue public criticism, but that is just the way it goes.  I will support them in any way I can as they continue their challenging job of delivering the new hospital.  Many of us would sleep easier at night if we could see a maternity hospital happening in the near future, perhaps if we have a few pounds to spend on another hospital in the next plan.  I thank the witnesses for their work and for their time this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#U01000","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I will give Deputy Durkan the final word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#U01100","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I apologise to my colleague whom I lampooned when he was unavoidably absent.

Much of what we are going to be talking about involves the report from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children on family hubs.  We welcome the report and think it is a substantive and wise contribution to the debate.  It mixes the voices of the children experiencing homelessness with questions on policy, or the absence of it.  It is important for the committee to remember that the report is looking at the very best of what we offer for families who are homeless.  The family hubs are a specific outcome of policy.  The vast majority of homeless families experience a much lower level of accommodation and support.  We really have to keep our attention on that aspect of the situation.  It brings us to a point where we must not be spending all of our time thinking about what is the best form of hub and emergency accommodation.  This committee, more than any other, needs to be addressing the real answer to homelessness, which is getting an adequate supply of homes.<\/p> <p>  The discussion on the hubs, and the way in which the report from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children highlights the absence of policy behind it, emphasises something which has been evident all of the way through the homelessness crisis.  Every stage of the way, these problems have been addressed by simply stating that one form of intervention is better than another.  Let us take the case of someone lying on the side of the street with no food and no cover.  It is better in that instance if someone comes along and gives that person some soup.  Once that soup has been provided, it would be better again if somebody else then came along and gave that person a free sleeping bag.  Once that person has the sleeping bag, it would in turn be better if he or she had some form of accommodation, even if that was a dormitory with ten other people, some of whom were on drugs.  Each of those scenarios is, arguably, better than the other. <\/p> <p>  Similarly, having families living in single hotel rooms is unacceptable and hubs are better than that.  Better than, however, is not a policy.  If a voluntary organisation states that handing someone a sandwich is better than that person going hungry, that is fine.  It is a voluntary activity and a humanitarian response.  Quite reasonably, we expect \"better than\" that in respect of policy from the State and the way that it addresses this issue.  Regarding hubs, we have to ask what is the analysis of the problem which has informed the proposal to put hubs in place.  In what sense is a hub a response?  How will we know if that policy works?  There is a complete vacuum in that respect.   <\/p> <p>  We have highlighted two issues in the report.  What impact is a hub meant to have on the duration for which families are homeless?  We all agree that we would like to live in a world where no family was homeless.  We are, however, in the middle of a crisis and the type of question we need to ask includes asking how long we are willing to put up with certain families remaining homeless.  The most recent figures published were from March this year.  Those figures showed that 167 families were homeless for more than two years.  <\/p> <p>  A number of questions arise.  Is it policy that those families should be in hubs because they provide a better form of accommodation or is it policy that they should be in hotel rooms because of some other reason?  Do we expect the families in hubs to move on more quickly?  Alternatively, do we expect them to move on more slowly because they have more problems?  These are not complicated questions.  These are the basic questions that anybody addressing the issue of homelessness should have asked on day one.  We do not know the answer.  What are we doing about the fact that those families are homeless for so long?  We know the utter destruction homelessness causes to the lives of the people in that family unit, which is protected in our Constitution, and especially to the children in that family, who are also protected by our Constitution.  We have allowed homelessness to grow, however.  It has been detailed in the reports year after year for some time now.  What is our policy to address that, how do the hubs, and everything else we do, fit in with that policy?  <\/p> <p>  We have also had an absolute concentration from Government, and elsewhere, just on the numbers.  I acknowledge that we have played our part in that as well.  Every time the homeless figures come out, and mostly they go upwards, the Government states that X numbers of families have moved out of homelessness.  If we concentrate only on getting the maximum number of families out of homelessness every month, so that we can have a press release on that achievement, the inevitable result is that the families with the highest degree of social problems will become the ones that remain in that situation the longest.  They are the families that it is the hardest to support sustainably out of homelessness.  When we finally reach the end of this crisis and we have enough homes, we will then be in a situation where there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of families whose capacity to operate independently has been entirely undermined by years spent living in institutions.  <\/p> <p>  Even aside from the housing, that is a problem we can address.  It is shocking that there is an absolute absence of any Government policy to even acknowledge that as an issue or to state how it is to be addressed.  It has to remain shocking and be as solvable as the whole problem.  Similarly, Focus Ireland has been recognised for more than 30 years as having expertise in dealing with family homelessness.  The details of what we have done are in the report so I will not go through all of it.  We are, however, recognised by every local authority and by the Government as having that expertise.  We have argued consistently that there needs to be a case manager and a child support worker for every family in need of such support.  <\/p> <p>  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, is responding to that need in a way that may be positive.  It is recruiting up to 25 case managers to be employed by the DRHE and to work directly with homeless families.  Those case managers will be paid at a higher wage level than the DRHE is willing to pay us to employ staff to do the same thing.  It is not explained anywhere, that I have seen, why this is a good shift to make.  It has been the policy of Government and local authorities for the past ten years, at least, that specialised groups are better at delivering these services.  That is why organisations such as Focus Ireland, as well the Peter McVerry Trust, the Simon communities, Depaul and others, has been subcontracted to work with homeless people.  We have that expertise.<\/p><p>There is a very substantial shift, involving a budget of over &euro;1 million, from doing that directly.  I am not criticising it.  Let us be absolutely clear, I am criticising that I have not seen a single piece of paper which explains why that is a better use of public money and what benefits it will provide to the families, their children or to the homeless social taxation issue.  It is yet another area where policy is being developed.  We call it policy but there is not policy behind it.<\/p><p> The last point I will make since this is the housing committee is that concentration will be obviously on this issue of managing homelessness but it is housing that is the solution.  There is a figure that surprised me in the fiscal report that came out yesterday.  The Government is projecting that by 2023 there will be 48,000 housing completions.  Completions will reach this sort of peak.  I am sure the members of the committee will have views as to where the 48,000 figure came from and the realism of it - it came from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  If it is the Government's aspiration that we will reach 48,000 new completions in 2023, at that point the problem of homelessness will stop getting worse.  We can assume that the problem of homelessness, that is, there are too few homes for the people who need them, will continue to get worse even on the Government's most optimistic statement.  It will not stop getting worse until 2023.  That is a very serious situation in terms of the pressure that is on homeless services, and particularly on homeless families, and the total absence of any coherent policy to deal with family homelessness is a distinct problem from the general one of homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Allen.

I will say a quick word about the alliance.  We unite over 100 member organisations working to make Ireland one of the best places in the world to be a child.<\/p> <p>  Children under the age of 18 experienced the steepest rise in homelessness of any age group over the past five years, with children under four making up the largest cohort living in emergency accommodation.  As a society, I think we can agree that this is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>  Young parents aged 18 to 24 years make up almost one-in-four of families in Dublin experiencing homelessness.  We often think of this as a Dublin problem but outside of Dublin, the problem of child and family homelessness has also increased.  We had almost 500 families with over 1,000 children in emergency accommodation only two months ago - those figures are from April 2019.<\/p> <p>  The Report Card is a Children's Rights Alliance annual flagship publication.  It is our tool for identifying serious issues for children.  It examines the Government's commitments to children in its programme for government.  This year, in our report card, the Government received an F, or a fail, for child and family homelessness.  This is due to the ongoing phenomenon of child and family homelessness and the failure of Government to embrace strategies that will reduce the number of children living in emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I briefly want to paint a picture of what living in emergency accommodation is like for children today.  First of all, what is a home?  A home should be a warm, secure and safe place for children.  We released a report last year entitled Home Works on the educational needs of children experiencing homelessness.  What that study showed us was that these children wake up in the morning, often really early, for instance, at 5.30 a.m., so that they can make a long journey to school because they are often in emergency accommodation that is further away from their schools.  They wake up in one room, which they share with family, with their parents and siblings.  Since there is a lack of storage and cooking facilities in the room, often the parents struggle to find breakfast for their children.  What we have found in our reports and what we hear through our members and through our Access to Justice information line is that the parents are going to an Esso station to try to find a roll or something to give these children for breakfast, and often they make a choice between paying expensive transport charges for the bus journey to school and breakfast.<\/p> <p>  The education of these children is severely disrupted.  They have inadequate rest because of the conditions that they are sleeping in.  Homeless accommodation can be noisy, with discos or merely other residents in emergency accommodation making noise.  They are falling asleep at school.  They are falling behind in their education.<\/p> <p>  When they come back to the emergency accommodation in the evening, they have no place to do their homework.  They have no place for normal things that children do, such as play dates, and to rest and relax.  We are finding that their friendships are strained.  Older children do not want to tell their friends - they are embarrassed to tell their friends where they are staying - and they experience anxiety, low self-esteem and feelings of isolation where these friendships breakdown.<\/p> <p>  The cycle continues.  We believe that the system needs to be redesigned in order to change this.  I will hand over to my colleague, Saoirse Brady, who will set out some of those solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":689,"content":"<p>We all know that there is no constitutional right to housing, but the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland has ratified, affords children the right to an adequate standard of living, including the provision of quality housing for those children.  While the convention does not apply directly in Irish law, the courts can exercise discretion in how much weight they give international law in their decisions.<\/p> <p>  In 2016, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child examined Ireland.  It expressed concern \"at reports of families affected by homelessness facing significant delays in accessing social housing and frequently living in inappropriate, temporary or emergency accommodation on a long-term basis\".  The UN committee called on the State \"to undertake measures to increase the availability of social housing and emergency housing support\".<\/p> <p>  I think we can all agree that the face of homelessness in Ireland has changed.  When the existing legislation was put in place, it was to support single adult males.  Nowadays, lone parent families with children make up the biggest cohort in the homeless population.  It is not right that when local authorities decide where families with children will be accommodated, they do not have to take the children's best interests into account.  This is why, as part of our No Child 2020 campaign, which is focused on child poverty and looks to the aims of the Democratic Programme of 1919, we are calling on the Government to put in place progressive legislate that would recognise the best interests of children and would mean that decision-makers, when deciding where those children should be placed, should take their best interests into account and ensure that their needs are met.  This would mean that they would have to consider such matters, as Ms Quinn stated, as to whether or not children would have to get up at 5.30 a.m. to make a two and a half hour journey to school, whether babies and toddlers would have the room to learn to crawl and learn to walk and whether teenagers would have enough privacy from their parents and siblings.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, the amended legislation should clearly time-limit the use of emergency accommodation for families with children.  Some families are locked into homelessness for years, as Mr. Allen said.  He gave the figure of 167, or 13%, of families who are living in homeless accommodation for more than two years.  Both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Ombudsman for Children, from whom the committee will hear this morning, have called for time limits on how long a family should spend in temporary accommodation.  This is to avoid the risk of institutionalisation and the normalisation of homelessness.<\/p> <p>  In July 2017, the Government began to roll-out family hubs after it did not meet its own target to use emergency accommodation only in limited circumstances and at the beginning of 2019, there were 26 hubs nationwide with capacity to accommodate 600 families.  When we were producing the Report Card last year and asked the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, we found that up to the third quarter in 2018 the Department had put &euro;45 million into those family hubs.  While the hubs are more suitable, they do not represent a long-term or child-appropriate solution.  Children themselves, as I am sure the committee will hear from Dr. Muldoon shortly, do not see family hubs as a solution.<\/p> <p>  What is the long-term solution?  If we want to realise the right of children to a home, we need to provide quality public housing.  We would hope to see a move away from a reliance on the private rented sector and instead provide families with suitable, adequate and affordable accommodation where they feel security and where children feel that they have a place that they can truly call home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Saoirse Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I now call on Dr. Niall Muldoon from the Ombudsman for Children's Office to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#E00600","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members for the invitation to appear before the committee today.  As members of the committee will be aware, the Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO, is an independent statutory body which was established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, as amended.  We have two core statutory functions: to promote the rights and welfare of children under 18 years of age; and to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools or voluntary hospitals that may have had an adverse effect on children.<\/p> <p>  Since I came into the office, the strategic priority for my office has included the crisis in homelessness, including family homelessness.<\/p><p>In light of the ongoing crisis in homelessness, including family homelessness, the circumstances of children experiencing homelessness will remain a priority for my office as part of our new strategic plan for the period 2019 to 2021.  I will take this opportunity to highlight to the committee issues and recommendations contained in No Place Like Home, a report published by my office in April 2019.  Its main purpose is to highlight the views and experiences of children living in family hubs.<br\/><br\/>As members of the committee know, the development of family hubs emerged in 2017.  As has been highlighted by Mr. Mike Allen of Focus Ireland, they were introduced as an alternative to hotels and bed and breakfasts in the provision of the emergency temporary accommodation needs of homeless families.  Family hubs have proliferated in the absence of an evidence base and an initial pilot phase and there were no clear public policy objectives set out for their use.  As the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government indicated on 29 May, 27 hubs are in operation nationally, providing 650 units of accommodation.<br\/><br\/>In light of how family hubs emerged, we wanted to learn more about what it is like for children to live in them, and we have had a taste of it in the presentation made by the Children's Rights Alliance.  This focus is not to distract or detract in any way from the very challenging circumstances faced by many other families being provided with emergency accommodation in hotels and bed and breakfasts, families who are self-accommodating by finding their own emergency accommodation or families in the hidden homelessness sector.  The consultation we undertook was between October 2018 and January 2019.  It involved engaging directly with 37 children between the ages of five and 17 years and 33 parents of 43 children under five years of age who were living in a family hub at the time.<br\/><br\/>We went to eight family hubs, comprising five in the Dublin area, two in Limerick and one in Cork.  They varied in terms of whether they were operated by an NGO or a private body, their location and size, and the facilities and supports provided.  This variation is reflected in the perspectives shared by the children, young people and parents who participated in our consultation and told us what they liked about living in a family hub, what they found challenging and what changes they would like to see in the hubs.<br\/><br\/>The positives spoken about by younger children were making and having friends in the family hub and the importance of outdoor play space and equipment where available.  Children living in family hubs with child support workers on site spoke positively about the activities organised by them and the support they provided.  It is important to note that several younger children could not identify anything positive about living in a family hub, with some children responding simply with the word &quot;nothing&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Children aged between 13 and 17 years also identified positives, including the support provided by staff in the family hub where they lived and the food they received.  Where facilities such as computers, a TV room and study room were provided, older children identified these as positives.  Some older children identified living in a family hub as comparatively better than what they had previously, for example, some of them had been living with extended family in overcrowded housing.  They also said the hubs offered more stability than living in a hotel or bed and breakfast.  Parents of children under five years of age welcomed the relative security and stability provided by hubs when compared with more precarious living arrangements, including hotels.  They also spoke about the support and helpfulness of staff working in the family hub.  Parents living with their children in family hubs that had good facilities, activities for their children or access to a child support worker or both highlighted these as positive features.<br\/><br\/>No Place Like Home points to the real difficulties that living in family hubs presents for the children, notwithstanding the efforts and kindness of staff working in the hubs.  In brief, the children highlight the negative impact that living in this type of environment is having on family life, parenting, individual and family privacy, children&rsquo;s ability to get adequate rest and sleep, children&rsquo;s health, well-being and development, children&rsquo;s ability to learn and study, children&rsquo;s opportunities for play and recreation, children&rsquo;s exposure to aggression and fighting, children&rsquo;s freedom of movement and children&rsquo;s ability to maintain relationships with extended family and friends.  Compounding these challenges were the feelings of shame expressed by the children about being homeless and the feelings of failure that parents expressed about their situation.<br\/><br\/>As regards changes that could improve family hubs, children and parents spoke about needing more and better space, the provision of more open communal areas for families to use, providing a separate study space for children, providing space for families to meet visitors and providing outdoor play spaces in hubs that do not already have them.  They also spoke about the need for better facilities, including cooking facilities, and about reducing rules and restrictions insofar as possible.  Several older children spoke about the need to combat the stigma associated with family homelessness, while a number of parents expressed the view that regular reviews of family hubs should be undertaken.  The recommendation that was made most frequently was that families should have long-term, secure housing and should receive all the support they need to access it.  As one parent observed:<\/p><blockquote>If you change small things ... the bigger problems are still there.  This is emergency accommodation, the emergency is the problem.<\/blockquote><p>Arising from the experiences and perspectives shared by children and parents and having regard to international standards and developments, we set out a number of priorities for action in the report.  With regard to policy and provision we believe timelines need to be put in place, as was mentioned earlier, to end to the practices of self-accommodation and providing emergency accommodation to families in hotels and bed and breakfasts.  An independent, formal evaluation of the suitability of family hubs is needed.  Additional measures are needed to combat the stigma associated with family homelessness and to support the dignity, self-worth and resilience of children and parents experiencing homelessness.  Practical measures in this regard that need to be seriously considered include increasing the number of child support workers, therapeutic supports and family support services available to children and parents.<br\/><br\/>We need to look at the national implementation of the national quality standards framework, NQSF, for homeless services in Ireland.  We were delighted by the recent indication by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government that the framework will be introduced nationally over a 12-month period from 1 July 2019.  To ensure appropriate monitoring, oversight and accountability, a mechanism for independent, statutory inspection of homelessness services needs to be put in place.  We are concerned they do not appear to be in the offing at any time in the near future.<br\/><br\/>Data are a problem and prompt progress needs to be made with regard to developing and implementing improved practices for data collection and disaggregation.  This is vital to provide for an evidence-informed approach to legislation, public policy and provision in this area.<br\/><br\/>Existing legislation needs to be amended and strengthened to make children visible and to require housing authorities to provide appropriate accommodation and supports to homeless families with children.  The issue of enumerating the right to housing in the Constitution needs to be progressed as a matter of priority.  We would like the Oireachtas to proceed with a detailed examination of the recommendations contained in the 2014 report of the eighth Constitutional Convention on economic, social and cultural rights.<br\/><br\/>I am pleased to inform the committee that following the publication of No Place Like Home, I had a constructive meeting with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government in May.  I look forward to engaging further with him and the Department on the proposed evaluation of family hubs.<br\/><br\/>In light of the roles that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla have under Rebuilding Ireland with regard to supporting families experiencing homelessness, I have also written to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to ask her to give serious consideration to increasing the practical supports, including child support workers and family support services, that are available to children and parents living in emergency accommodation, including family hubs.<br\/><br\/>My office fully appreciates that the crisis in family homelessness in Ireland is multifaceted and complex and that family hubs are only one aspect of the current response to it.  I hope our No Place Like Home report is a constructive contribution and I assure the committee that we will build on it over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon.

We warmly welcome the focus of the committee on child and family homelessness.  Mercy Law Resource Centre, MLRC, is an independent law centre and registered charity.  Our principal focus is the provision of free legal advice and representation to individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.<\/p> <p>  Since 2015, an increasing number of vulnerable families have accessed our services.  Overall in 2018, Mercy Law advised more than 720 individuals and families, of whom 244 were experiencing homelessness.  At present, 57% of our clients are families with minor children who are homeless and 77% of our clients are of ethnic minorities.<\/p> <p>  Building on our substantive submission and other Mercy Law reports before the committee, I will highlight a number of key concerns and related recommendations.  Since 2015, Mercy Law has frequently engaged with families who were refused emergency accommodation, with their only options then being to sleep in parks, cars, uninhabitable caravans, chronically overcrowded or unsafe conditions or in Garda stations.  Mercy Law sees at first hand the devastating impact on families and their children of improper refusals of emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  At present, there is no strict legal obligation on housing authorities to provide emergency accommodation.  There is a discretion but no duty.  Recent High Court decisions have afforded broad discretion to housing authorities with respect to the homeless assessment.  It is our position that the wide margin of discretion afforded to housing authorities in the current legal framework does not adequately protect homeless families with minor children.  Mercy Law continues to call for protection of the right to housing in the Constitution.  Specifically as part of a shift to a legal rights-based approach, we recommend tightening the statutory provisions contained in the Housing Act 1988 to eliminate the statutory discretion and impose a duty on the housing authority to provide such emergency accommodation.<\/p><p> We also raise a most urgent concern in respect of the provision of one-night-only emergency accommodation.  MLRC frequently assists families placed in one-night-only emergency accommodation, including those with very young children, children with special needs, new mothers and their newborn babies discharged from maternity hospitals and victims of domestic violence.  On numerous occasions MLRC experiences first hand the deep distress and chaos of families placed in chronically unstable emergency accommodation.  Families must move every day.  They frequently cannot access their accommodation until 8 p.m. and must leave by 9.30 a.m.  Families have no secure place to go during the day and spend prolonged periods in shopping centres, in parks, on the streets or on buses.  Families of no access to cooking or laundry facilities.  They ordinarily cannot register their children for school or access primary healthcare because they do not have a fixed address or stable accommodation.<\/p><p> As of 1 June, MLRC understands that 80 families were in one-night-only accommodation, an increase on the figure we understood to be 50 as of December last.  MLRC has, without success, sought information on the legal basis and reasons that some families are placed in accommodation of this kind while others have rolling placements in more stable accommodation.  This affects families that are on the housing list and those that are not.  In our experience it affects minority families disproportionately.  A family in this type of accommodation cannot meet its basic needs let alone resolve its long-term housing issues.  It compounds the chaos and distress of homelessness.  This type of accommodation provision is not fit for purpose.  MLRC believes that it may expose families and their children to inhuman and degrading treatment of such severity as to engage Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is also observed that there may be discriminatory practice such that ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected.<\/p><p> Our strong and unqualified recommendation to the committee is for a cessation of the provision of one-night-only emergency accommodation to homeless families and provision of stable placements in suitable temporary accommodation for such families.  We also call for transparency as to why families are placed in such chronically unstable accommodation and also call for an equality review to be carried out by Dublin Regional Homeless Executive and housing authorities to identify and address any potentially discriminatory practices.<\/p><p> We concur with the committee's other guests in respect of self-accommodation provision, which we see as failing the most vulnerable families.  This type of provision is made to families across the board with little or no regard to their individual needs or vulnerabilities.  Vulnerable families, including, in particular, ethnic minority, non-Irish national and larger families, face insurmountable barriers to accessing self-accommodation.  They do not have the language skills or resources to identify potential hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation bookings and-or the size of their families mean that hotels and bed and breakfast establishments are not a feasible option.  Bookings, if achieved, are insecure and unstable and families must frequently move, which interferes with access to education, healthcare and social and family stability.  MLRC agree with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that families should not have to source their own emergency accommodation.  We support the call by Dr. Muldoon for an end to self-accommodation.  We also recommend the issuing of regulations by the Minister to specify and restrict the type of emergency accommodation provision in which families may be place, therefore ensuring its suitability and adequacy.<\/p><p> It is stated in Rebuilding Ireland that by the middle of 2017 hotels would be used for emergency accommodation purposes in very limited circumstances.  Yet, as of February last, over half of homeless families in Dublin remain in commercial hotels.  We regularly engage with families that have been in inappropriate emergency accommodations for excessive periods.  Very recently we engaged with a family that had been in a hotel for 28 months.  Last week we had a call from a family that had been in hotel accommodation for three and a half years.  That hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation, even for short periods, is unacceptable and inflicts damage on families has been established and is widely accepted.  We need to see the end of reliance on commercial hotels and bed and breakfast establishments as a form of emergency accommodation for families.  As previous speakers have done, we call for a limit on the time that families spend in unsuitable emergency accommodation such as commercial hotels.<\/p><p> We share the concern that hubs present a risk of the institutionalisation and normalising of family homelessness.  We would like to add, on the basis of our casework experience, specific concerns about family hubs that are additional to those already articulated..  There is a clear lack of transparency regarding access to family hubs and transitional accommodation.  MLRC has been informed by two housing authorities that there are no published criteria or process for accessing family hubs.  As one housing officer indicated, identification of a family for placement in a hub will depend on that family being in the mind of the housing officer.  Our clients are rarely in the position to put themselves in the minds of housing officers.  We question the equality of access to family hubs.  With a relatively low number of spaces - as already stated, the vast majority of families, well over half, are in commercial hotels - there are substantial delays in any placement in such family hubs.  Hubs are generally not configured to accommodate larger families.  We have concerns, these are reflected in the report from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, regarding the variation in standards in family hubs.  We have particular concerns about the fact that several former commercial hotels that have been effectively rebranded as family hubs.  We call for a shift away from family hubs to the provision of transitional, own-door accommodation.  We recommend the publication of accessibility criteria and procedures for accessing family hubs and transitional accommodation placements.  We share the call for the creation of an independent body to conduct regular inspections of homeless services.<\/p><p> MLRC welcomes the recognition in Rebuilding Ireland that families with children presenting as homeless require a separate and distinct response.  Yet a common theme in our concerns, as presented here, is the failure of housing authorities to recognise and meet the particular needs and take account of the vulnerabilities of homeless families.  MLRC has previously received assurances from the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive that mechanisms are in place to identify and provide supports to vulnerable families.  However, it is our experience that these mechanisms are failing those families.  To remedy this, we support the proposed amendment to the Housing Act to place a statutory obligation on housing authorities to regard the best interests of children as paramount, have regard to the needs of the family unit and to make provision of suitable accommodation to that family unit to ensure its effective functioning.<\/p><p> MLRC believes in the inherent dignity of each human person and sees such dignity frequently violated in the deep trauma and distress of homeless families.  This crisis calls for urgent and progressive measures to meaningfully address such trauma, restore dignity to those impacted upon by this housing crisis and minimise the harm currently being inflicted on homeless families.<\/p><p> I thank the committee and we look forward to engaging with members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rebecca Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keating and call Deputy &Oacute; Broin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#G00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I think all of our guests for their presentations.  I acknowledge the work their organisations are doing to highlight the issues raised.  I refer, in particular, to the reports they have been publishing.  It is important not to underestimate their value.  Our guests spend a great deal of time researching, publishing and launching such reports and then they are left to wonder what happens to them.  Those reports are a vital resource, especially for a committee such as this, in order to fully understand the issues involved.  Those reports that give a voice to children in the context of outlining their experiences are particularly valuable.  I want our guests to know that their in this regard work is in no way wasted.<\/p><p>Two significant items of research have been published this week.  The first of these is a report from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, one aspect of which is an examination of accommodation and homelessness.  One of the most stinging sentences in the report is where the commission outlines its belief that the rise in homelessness has been &quot;significantly exacerbated by Government policy choices&quot;.  On the same day, a very important paper by three academics was published in the <i>The Geographical Journal<\/i>.  This paper looks at the experience and the negative physical and emotional impact of hotel accommodation on children.  It would be worthwhile if the committee secretariat could circulate both publications to the members of the committee because they make for very stark reading.<\/p><p>It is important to acknowledge that the voices raising these concerns are not just those in the traditional NGO sector.  I am not disparaging the NGO sector in any way, particularly as I worked it in for a time, but it is important for members to understand that when NGOs are joined by statutory organisations such as the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, it is a significant development because the latter are funded by the Government and they play a very different role.<\/p><p>We have heard very strong, independent, academic research emphasising that the depth of this problem is far greater than many people fully appreciate.  The Department publishes a range of monthly reports on homelessness numbers, and quarterly reports on performance and financial indicators.  Committee members will know Professor Eoin O'Sullivan from Trinity College Dublin who has been in to this committee.  Professor O'Sullivan produces an explanatory guide to those because the reports are quite difficult for us to digest and he has circulated the most recent summary.  From the Government's information, Professor O'Sullivan has concluded that in the past quarter and to year end, entries into homelessness are up, repeat entries into homelessness are up and exits from homelessness are down, the length of stay that families and individuals are spending in emergency accommodation is up, and more than 80% of the homelessness budget is going on emergency responses with less than 5% spent on prevention.  Again, it is not just the statutory sector saying this.  The NGO sector, the academic sector and even the Government's own figures as presented by Professor O'Sullivan show that we have a significant problem.<\/p><p> Given the strength of what we are hearing I would like the committee to consider not just taking the submissions today but also contemplating seriously the compilation of a report to the Minister outlining the kinds of policy changes we believe he needs to consider.  This could include some or many of the options that have been put on the table, so that the good people here are not just making a presentation to us but that the committee is also considering which of the recommendations we support or want to prioritise.  We could then forward that to the Minister.<\/p><p> I have four straightforward questions for all the witnesses.  There are a lot of recommendations and clearly many of us would like to see all of them implemented.  We also, however, live in the real world.  If the committee was to do a report and try to identify some priority recommendations for each of the organisations and alliances, what would be the one or two significant recommendations they would like the committee to make?  We could possibly stretch it to three recommendations but it is important that we are focused on what we should call on the Government to do.<\/p><p> If the Minister or the Department were at the committee, he or his officials would remind us of the increase in social housing output.  We have to acknowledge that there is an increase in social housing output, but many of us are critical that it is nowhere near enough.  I would like to hear the views of each of the organisations and alliances on the current and proposed output of real social housing owned by approved housing bodies and local authorities.  Do the witnesses believe it is enough to meet the demand that they know is there?  If not, what do the representatives think should be the output?  The debate is not whether houses are being produced but whether the number being produced is enough.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on this.<\/p><p> The quality standards framework produced by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive is very good.  I have met its representatives and I have seen it.  If I understood the Minister correctly when he presented to this committee recently, those standards will now apply to the voluntary sector and private sector emergency accommodation, which I welcome as this was not the case originally.  I am greatly concerned, however, that the inspections will not be independent.  I am not questioning the people in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive or in the local authorities, but if one is funding that emergency accommodation, there is clearly a conflict of interest if one is then inspecting it for the standards.  What are each of the organisations' views on the importance of independent inspections and where do they think the inspection role should be located?<\/p><p> My final question relates to the right to housing.  We held an Oireachtas debate on this matter.  Not everybody in this committee is on the same page in this regard.  Some Members of the Oireachtas have said they are open to the idea but that they are yet to be convinced.  I am aware that each of the organisations here today have advocated for this.  In as plain a set of arguments as they can make, will the witnesses tell the committee what they believe would be the difference of having a constitutional right to housing?  I am already convinced but I ask the witnesses to direct their responses to other members of the committee who are genuinely open to considering it but who have yet to be convinced of it.  What will the witnesses say to members of this committee who have yet fully to appreciate the value of that?  What difference would a constitutional right to housing make, and why is it something the Government should support?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#G00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I will take questions, some in reverse order.  I will also ask Ms Lambe to comment on the specific things we would like to see, which was the first question.<\/p> <p>  On the question around the constitutional right to housing, Focus Ireland has made a contribution to that debate.  The number of times I have heard Ministers say that things they would otherwise wish to do cannot be done because the Attorney General has said it would be against the Constitution proves to me that the Constitution, as interpreted, presents a genuine barrier to some of the solutions that Ministers while in office claim they would wish otherwise to take.  This goes right back.  There are very positive reasons for changing the Constitution but I would ask the committee to consider one.  Repeated Ministers cite the Constitution and the current balance between the public good and the right to property.  It is being interpreted in such a way that the individual right to property is trumping the desire of committees, the D&aacute;il and Ministers to make changes in areas such as tenancy rights and the taking of property that is not being developed and so on.  The Constitution is supposed to represent our will, but if the Constitution is presenting that sort of barrier against the people's will, then we should change it, if there are positive reasons for it.<\/p> <p>  Focus Ireland does not have a formal position on how we think independent inspections should be done.  We do agree that it should be independent.  As an organisation we are reluctant to see the creation of more long-term institutions that assume homelessness will always be with us.  We believe that the inspection role should probably be attached to an existing institution that is able to do that.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is the obvious one, but it would require some significant changes in what HIQA does because the facilities to be inspected are not clinical and so on.  We want high standards set for independent accommodation, but not clinical standards.  That would be one way to go.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the output, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has identified, it is quite clear that the number of people exiting homelessness is going down and the number of people becoming homelessness is going up.  Quite clearly, the supply of social and affordable housing is totally inadequate.  While it is arguable whether the targets are being met as intended in the plan, we believe that the targets are not high enough for the scale of the problem we have.  A consistent underestimation of the scale of the issue by successive Governments has bedevilled the entire response to homelessness from the beginning of this crisis in 2014, and therefore the scale of the housing that is required.  The single player who is refusing to come onto the pitch and who is essential to this is the local authority.  This is not an ideological position.  Families do not care if their house is built by the private sector, an approved housing body or a local authority.  People care about the quality of it, the tenure they have and the rent they will pay.  Historically, the player that delivered a quarter of the housing in which people in Ireland live was the local authority.  If local authorities refuse or fail to play a role, which is happening in the delivery of social housing generally, we will suffer from that.  The local authorities have to be there but they are not.  That needs to be changed.<\/p> <p>  There is always the question of what our single demand would be.  If there was to be one thing, I would say that we need a strategy.  I know this does not answer it, but one particular response is not going to solve the issue.  I will ask Ms Lambe to address specific elements, but unless there is some sort of plan to deal with it, to lay out what we understand the problem to be, the sorts of things we are going to do to resolve it, and the expected solutions, then any individual request one throws into that is just going to get lost in the mix.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Allen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I will address some of the specifics.  The family home section team in Focus Ireland works with the majority of homeless families in Dublin.  Last month we worked with 1,074 children in homelessness.  Every one of those is a child who is struggling, who is in trauma and in accommodation.  I am struck by Ms Quinn's comment that many of these children are under the age of five.  Some of them are born into homelessness.  Our child support workers and our team are seeing this week in and week out.  I welcome the report from the Ombudsman for Children's Office and the recommendations for more child support workers in hubs.  Family hubs are not the ideal, but while children are in hubs, we need to have a better support mechanism in place for them such as child support workers allocated to families.  My team has children linked to our services in 24 locations all over Dublin.  Only 9% of those children have child support workers.  I would suggest an increase in those supports.<\/p> <p>  On the standards of accommodation, the hubs are not ideal, but while they are in hubs, we are all agreeing to improve that.  For the move-on options for families, last year the family homeless action team moved on most families to housing assistance payment, HAP, accommodation.  This year it is the same.  The majority of move-on options are with HAP.  We are all too aware that the private rented sector is not the ideal move-on option for families.  There is a good possibility that many families are returning back into homelessness from HAP accommodation.<\/p><p>It is about having better and more long-term sustainable accommodation for families with an increase in social and affordable housing.  <\/p><p> I echo what Ms Keatinge said about bringing an end to self-accommodating families.  These families are the most traumatised.  There are layers of trauma in homeless families.  Each night these families do not know where they will stay the next night so they pack their belongings on a nightly basis.  They must also tell their children they may be unable to bring them to school in the morning and that they are not sure where they will stay the next night.  These families walk the streets by day with nowhere to go.  To hear 80 families are self-accommodating is quite stark.  We should never forget these figures represent many children and their parents.<\/p><p> Finally, I agree with the stance by Focus Ireland on independent inspections, and that HIQA is best placed to do the work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Lambe","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560294000,"counter":702,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Casey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":703,"content":"<p>My colleague and I will share the four questions.

The long-term recommendation is to redirect EU investment away from short-term solutions to long-term public housing.<\/p> <p>  A right to housing would mean enforceable rights for children.

There is a commitment to provide rapid build houses in the programme for Government, which we consider when compiling our annual report card.  We asked the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government about the commitment but it switched tack and told us that there is now a focus on putting that investment into family hubs.  Since the rapid build programme was introduced in 2016, only 350 houses have been built. so it has not delivered.  The answer is that local authorities need to invest and build more housing.<\/p> <p>  Regarding quality standards, we have been quite clear about our position and stated our choice is HIQA.  We advocate for the authority to take on independent inspections of both direct provision accommodation as well as emergency homelessness accommodation.  HIQA has standards and a good track record in carrying out inspections.  It inspects places where children live such as Oberstown children detention school and residential units where children are in care.  Recently we worked with the Department of Justice and Equality to produce the national standards for direct provision accommodation and we drew very heavily on HIQA standards.  The authority would be the most cost-effective option because a new framework would not be needed to be put in place and the public has confidence in the authority  We strongly advocate for HIQA to take over inspections.  We have spoken to the authority's officials about such a role.  They would have to expand their team and the Health Act would have to be amended.  Amending the Health Act would probably be more time effective.  It is not that big a change.  We have drafted some provisions and I know Deputy &Oacute; Broin has done so as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Saoirse Brady"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":705,"content":"<p>On priorities, we can quickly get child support workers into every family home.  We can provide significant support in this regard.  We have also mentioned the possibility of therapeutic support in that situation.  We are talking about adverse childhood experiences and these children will come back to us in ten or 15 years to say they have been traumatised by the State's inability to find them a home.  It would be good if we intervened now and provided them and all of their family members, including parents, with therapeutic support.  That could be a quick intervention for three or four years, depending on when the Government feels they should will moved out.<\/p> <p>  We are also considering, whether it is medium-term or short-term, primary legislation changes.  They have been highlighted by the Mercy Law Resource Centre and all of my colleagues here.  The changes would get the voice of the child into legislation so they have to be adhered to by local authorities.  Our children are not part of what they need to follow.  As has been said many times previously, legislation creates behaviour and legislation is what local authorities must follow.  If legislation does not mention children, they will not be of interest to local authorities and officials who have to make decisions in this regard.  We need to change that as quickly as possible but whether that is short or medium-term is up to legislators.  From our point of view, the long-term change is the constitutional change so that we acknowledge, as a society, that we will set a floor below which we will not allow any child to fall.  We are talking about 4,000 children currently but three years ago there were only 2,000 children.  We are not getting away from the problem.  As Mr. Allen has said, it will be 2023.  That is a significant number of children who need to know that they will get a safe, dignified and peaceful place to spend their childhood.<\/p> <p>  According to the hierarchy of needs, if one does not have shelter, one cannot provide for oneself and reach one's potential in any other area such as education, health and relationships.  I agree with Mr. Allen that we need to challenge the constitutional amendment in some way whether that is through a referendum or the courts.  We need to find out what the real parameters are and what society wants.  My understanding is that if the correct options are put to the people, they would see the benefit of creating a constitutional right to housing.  The UN special rapporteur on housing said that homelessness is an assault on human dignity.  We need to accept that this is happening continuously on our watch and there is a need for change.  A constitutional change would be a long-term intervention.<\/p> <p>  We are not experts on housing output but I listen to everything that is said in this regard.  There has been a lot of cheerleading about co-location or co-living, student accommodation and different types of rental accommodation.  I do not hear an awful lot about family accommodation and where children will grow up.  We have heard about where we will move independent, well-financed young people to and different options such as that.  However, one-third of rental accommodation is now buy-to-rent accommodation.  If they are the right size and space for families to grow up in over the next 25 to 30 years, that is fine, but that has not been part of the core discussion.  The discussion is about bodies and not about children and their families, and the growth that they deserve into the future.  When we talk about the output of housing, it is about making sure that the families of these children and our future generations have somewhere where they can grow, thrive and survive, which is what the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child offers them.<\/p> <p>  Dr. McAuley will refer to the framework and the national qualifications or standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":706,"content":"<p>Ws we highlighted in our report, the key issue for us is statutory independent inspection.

As others said, and as the Ombudsman for Children has said, HIQA may be an obvious candidate for such work given its standing and experience.  The authority has extensive experience of inspecting different types of accommodation for children, which are there for different purposes, and of engaging with children in the context of conducting independent statutory inspections.

With respect to the right of housing, we have published a trilogy of reports on the right to housing and have consistently advocated for a constitutional protection on the right to housing.  I concur with the points made by colleagues in respect of why it would make a meaningful difference in this time of housing crisis.  Mercy Law Resource Centre views it from a future-proofing approach as well.  We are trying to safeguard against a recurrence of this crisis in the future.  We believe such an amendment would provide a long-standing floor of protection for homeless individuals, families facing housing difficulties and influence on a much broader scale by way of policy-making and law-making in respect of housing.  I agree with the comments about policy measures and legislation being brought forward, which have essentially been blocked on the basis of a constitutional barrier.<\/p><p>We see a need for a rebalancing of the constitutional provisions that prevent this from being a repeated block on measures coming in to address meaningfully the serious crisis we face.  We have heard a great deal today about Rebuilding Ireland.  Those commitments were made in 2017.  We are here two years later with the same issues and the same statistics.  The figures are going up.  We need to look at bigger-picture measures that will address meaningfully the crisis we are facing.  I acknowledge that the constitutional amendment is not a silver bullet.  It has to be accompanied by political will and meaningful resources to change policy properly.  Our second report, which was a comparative analysis looking at other jurisdictions, may be of interest to the committee.  It established that the protection of this right is common in well-functioning democracies.  Everybody has a different model.  There is no one-size-fits-all model.  This model exists elsewhere and has had a meaningful impact.<\/p><p> I am going backwards.  I am taking Mr. Allen's approach as well.  While the national standards framework is welcome, in our experience there is a low level of awareness of these standards, and of the complaints mechanism, among homeless people and families.  We frequently engage with families that are having issues with their emergency accommodation which might not yet be legal issues.  They might not have their hands on the substantial standards document.  They might not be engaged with key workers.  The reality is that key workers are generally allocated to those in the most stable forms of emergency accommodation.  At the early stages, families in one-night-only arrangements or in self-accommodation do not necessarily have a key worker who can direct them to the standards and the complaints mechanism.  We agree that a statutory independent inspection regime is needed.  We do not have a formal position on the appropriate body to undertake that role.<\/p><p> I have to say categorically in response to the question about whether the level of output of real social housing is enough that the current level is completely inadequate.  That is why the statistics are continuing to increase and why we are all here today to discuss the issue of child and family homelessness.  The HAP scheme, which is the default option presented by housing authorities to our clients, is part of the social housing framework.  The legislation has been amended to make HAP the new form of social housing support.  It is clearly unsuitable for many families and inaccessible to many families.  We deal with ethnic minorities with large family sizes.  When they are unable to source tenancies in the private rental market, the housing authorities assume they are not looking hard enough despite clear evidence to the contrary.  The HAP scheme is not the solution to this crisis.  The solution is to build more housing, including public and social housing.<\/p><p> We have a number of clients who move into the approved housing body sector, where the standard is excellent.  It seems that the vast majority of social housing is coming from that sector.  It is important to note there is less security of tenure in an approved housing body dwelling than in a social housing dwelling.  That should be noted because the approved housing bodies come under the residential tenancies legislation.  We work with clients whose tenancies have been lawfully terminated in the first six months after being transferred from social housing to approved housing bodies.  A client may have had a secure tenancy for 25 years, or 40 years as was the case in one instance, only to have it terminated in the first week after it came under the new legislation.  That is a deficiency in the legislation.  It is quite a niche area, but it can cause huge suffering.  That would be a concern arising from our case work.<\/p><p> I was asked whether we have two or three priority recommendations.  I will mention three priorities for us.  First, we are calling for section 10 to be examined as a matter of urgency to facilitate a shift from a discretionary power to provide emergency accommodation to a duty to make such provision.  We believe that in the absence of such a duty, there is considerable confusion and obfuscation, which is leading to improper refusals of emergency accommodation.<\/p><p> Second, we are calling for the cessation of one-night-only arrangements.  I would like to make a distinction between such arrangements and self-accommodation, which arises when a family can book its own hotel.  If one is on a one-night-only arrangement, one is not permitted to make such a booking.  Instead, one is placed somewhere for a single night.  Self-accommodation families are sometimes unable to find bookings so they revert to the one-night-only system.  Such families are vulnerable because they are in the most precarious, distressing and chaotic circumstances.  They are not in a position to articulate the nature of their plight because they are too busy packing their bags, getting on the bus and trying to figure out how to feed their children and get them to the doctor.  We would really like some attention to be paid to that issue.<\/p><p> Third, we are calling for regulations to impose a limit on the amount of time a family can spend in inappropriate accommodation and to oblige housing authorities to assess the suitability of emergency accommodation.  We need to stop putting families in hotels.  There should be a statutory obligation on housing authorities to assess whether hotel accommodation is appropriate for a family.  That does not happen at the moment.  There is a blanket use of hotel accommodation.  We see very little assessment of actual needs.  We believe such regulations would go some way towards putting an obligation of this nature in place and bringing vulnerability assessments into the legal framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Rebecca Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560294000,"counter":709,"content":"<p>Deputy Maria Bailey resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keatinge.

During my three years as a Deputy, the issue that has come back to haunt us has been the complete failure to get to grips with this country's child homelessness problem.  There has been a 90% increase in family homelessness and a 102% increase in child homelessness over that time.<\/p> <p>  As I have said previously, I have witnessed child homelessness in my own hotel, which is located in a very remote part of County Wicklow.  I have seen families arriving late at night and getting up exceptionally early the following morning so that the children can go back to school in Dublin city.  In many cases, I have received a phone call later that day to say the same family is coming back that night even though they packed up their bags that morning.  I have witnessed the horrendous experiences that such families are going through.  The effect of child homelessness on children is the greatest scar on this country at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to get into the figures with Mr. Allen because I agree that we need to move beyond them.  I was concerned to read in the Focus Ireland report that 94 families and 137 children presented as homeless in April of this year.  According to the Department, the homelessness figures decreased by 13 families and 37 children in the same month.  If both figures are accurate, there were substantial new child and family homelessness presentations in the month of April.  This shows that we are nowhere close to getting on top of the crisis that exists.<\/p> <p>  We know that the long-term solution is to build more houses, but we do not seem to be able to get there at the moment.  Mr. Allen mentioned this week's Irish Fiscal Advisory Council report and the target of 48,000 housing completions by 2023.  Is 48,000 the magic figure we need to reach to prevent child and family homelessness?  Do we need to go beyond that?  What happens with the historical stuff?  We are failing to reach the targets we have set for the delivery of social housing.  Is there a historical build-up?  Would the provision of 48,000 houses deal with the historical build-up as well?<\/p> <p>  Ms Quinn spoke about the impact of homelessness on schools.  It was suggested in a recent debate - I do not know whether it was at this committee - that schools with DEIS status are better able to deal with these problems than schools without such status.  Schools with DEIS status probably have more funding to deal with child homelessness from an educational perspective and to put in place measures to help their pupils to deal with the crisis of homelessness.<\/p> <p>  I have mentioned that I have witnessed child homelessness.  My heart goes out to people who have to find accommodation on a night-to-night basis.  I cannot understand the simple logic that treats a pregnant woman, whose child is due imminently, on a night-to-night basis.  I cannot fathom how this can happen in today's society.  It is horrendous and completely unacceptable that such a woman does not know where she will be going that night, regardless of whether it would be a hotel room, a hub or some other type of accommodation.<\/p><p> The delegates referred to refusals of emergency accommodation.  I ask them to expand a little to enable us to gain a better understanding of the cohort who are being refused emergency accommodation.  I also ask them to explain what \"own-door accommodation\" actually means.  They are anxious that a figure be identified for it.  <\/p><p> As we are all aware, there is no immediate solution to the problem.  Everyone in this room wants to see the crisis resolved.  In the absence of a significant amount of social housing being delivered, we must consider the solutions that are before us.  There is no other solution of which I am aware.  Is there something we are missing that is better than what is being offered?  Reference was made to a constitutional right to housing.  I am open to any solution.  I do not really care how it arrives, but if there is the political will, we can find a solution.  We must take the risk, make the tough decisions and implement the legislation required.  I do not think we need to provide for a constitutional right to housing, but in the absence of political will, children and mothers need such a right.  What is needed more than anything is the political will to resolve the crisis.<\/p><p> I have ended up making statements rather than asking questions because Deputy &Oacute; Broin has asked most of the relevant questions.  What can we do in the next six months to address the problem?  We all know the long-term solution, but how can we improve hubs and hotels?  What could we do differently tomorrow morning that would improve quality of life for the almost 4,000 children and 1,700 families in emergency accommodation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#K00300","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":713,"content":"<p>To make the more efficient use of the time remaining, I will call Deputy O'Dowd before reverting to the delegates.

There is nothing that they have either written or said with which I disagree.  <\/p><p>I wish to take up the last point made by Deputy Casey.  There is a lot more that we could do.  One thing that struck me during the recent election campaign was the number of empty houses that I came across.  There are many reasons those houses are empty.  Some have trees growing out through the front door and are obviously derelict, but a significant number are occupiable.  I do not know why they are empty, but it would not take a lot of money to put them right because they are in newer housing estates.  I am not criticising anybody, but local authorities are supposed to have officers in charge of sourcing empty homes.  In County Louth approximately 100 homes which were empty were brought back into use for less than &euro;100,000, including all legal fees.  We need to drive that agenda with renewed energy.  It must be driven in areas where the homelessness problem is most acute, namely, the bigger towns and cities.<\/p><p>Some homes are empty because the owner is in a nursing home.  While I absolutely respect the right to integrity of persons <i>vis-a-vis<\/i>their property, I do not see why a local authority, in conjunction with the HSE, cannot make appropriate and respectful communication with such owners or their families to see if there is a way of getting the property to make it available for short-term occupation.  There is a lot more that we should be doing with empty properties because it is a shame.  I know of at least 40 homes in Drogheda that should be occupied tonight, but they are empty because nobody is pushing that agenda locally.  <\/p><p>I refer to the issues of town centres, population pressures and over-the-shop accommodation.  In Drogheda, for example, 40 or 50 years ago there were 300 to 400 people living in the centre of the town, but now there is nobody living there.  The problem is that the accommodation is old and does not necessarily meet today's standards.  However, a grants scheme is available.  Local authority officers should be going around to find out what is available above shops and whether it is usable.  It may be suitable for use by single people or childless couples.  I know and understand that in many cases it is not suitable for use by children, but there is a lack of urgency on the ground.  The political system wants this to happen and money is available, but it is not happening fast enough.  <\/p><p>On the right to a home, I agree that it should be inserted into the Constitution.  It is an essential right.  I am lucky to be a parent and a grandparent and would hate to think my grandchildren or anybody else would be homeless, or living in the type of accommodation to which the delegates have referred.  I was a teacher for many years and worked with disadvantaged children who had educational, social and economic problems.  If such children do not have their own door to close and a room to go into and are stuck with their families in one room, they have no quality of life.  The crime and what is really wrong is that there are children coming to my office with their parents who will be almost ten years old before they have a home of their own.  That is a decade lost to a family and unacceptable.  <\/p><p>I am not apportioning blame, but a lot more could and must be done by local authorities and the political system.  Extra energy is needed.  I hope the contribution of the delegates will be an agent for change.  They should not step back from what they are saying because it is hugely important.  Their words do count and are having an impact.  It is a shame that this is happening in Ireland today.  We know the economic reasons for it - the collapse of the economy - and while things have changed, they have not changed fast enough.

In terms of the impact on schools, I am sure Children's Rights Alliance will speak about that issue.  I note that in Rebuilding Ireland provision is made for extra supports via home-school liaison officers.  While we have come across home-school liaison officers in and outside DEIS schools, according to a presentation made by Focus Ireland yesterday, 91% of families accessing its services do not have the assistance of a child support worker, which is a matter of serious concern.  We are concerned that the supports available are simply not accessible to the most vulnerable families and not made available at the earliest opportunity.  I will give as an example a family who were self-accommodating and who really struggled to get a booking.  They got a booking after living for six months in very precarious accommodation in a hotel near the airport, but they had to make a 90 km round trip to the children's primary school.  During the course of the year the two children missed 80% of their classes.  While the school was very supportive, how could it address that issue?  It requires an holistic, inter-agency approach.  I even had difficulty in linking the family with primary health care services in the area because they were living in precarious and unstable accommodation.  Their booking was simply not for long enough.  The matter is not straightforward; it is complex.  The wraparound supports referred to in Rebuilding Ireland have not materialised for all families.<\/p> <p>  On one-night-only accommodation, the Deputy's use of terms such as \"horrendous\" and \"completely unacceptable\" is most welcome.  We encounter such cases far too frequently and they are horrendous.  There seems to be no logic to it.  I dealt with a number of new mothers who had been discharged from maternity hospitals into one-night-only accommodation.  Just before Christmas, one mother with a baby who was four weeks premature and a 16 month old baby was discharged into one-night-only accommodation.<\/p><p>That mother was spending time in shopping centres trying to prepare bottles but was unable to sterilise them and unable to breastfeed her child and to be somewhere safe and secure during the winter months.  We engaged and were able with legal intervention to change that but that situation should not need a legal intervention.  That simply should not arise.  There is a gap in picking up on such vulnerability.  There is also an element of overload for the housing authorities that engage with individual families' needs, and perhaps with the resources available, such provision is not feasible.  The committee's focus of attention on that area will be most welcome.<br\/><br\/>In terms of prospective solutions, we support the constitutional right to housing and consider it to be as part of a host of measures.  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question, the recommendations we have made are set out in our substantive statement and they are being prioritised.  Looking forward, we support the constitutional right to housing as an enduring and overarching protection to effect a range of statutory provisions that apply with respect to housing.  It is related to not only the homeless area but the private rented sector, housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies and social housing.  We believe that is a measure that would influence all those different areas.<br\/><br\/>To pick up on some of Deputy O'Dowd's points, I share the concern about the there being a lack of urgency on the ground.  I am aware from frequent engagements with housing authorities of their exasperation about the bringing on stream of more suitable emergency accommodation.  There is a will to do that.  I have not identified the exact blockages but certainly there are some because now two years later we are in a situation where the majority of these families in the Dublin region are living in hotels.  We very much focus only within the Dublin area.  It has been good to hear the experiences of groups operating outside Dublin because we would have a number of contacts with people outside Dublin where there is a much more <i>ad hoc<\/i>approach to the provision of homeless accommodation and there would be broad reliance on bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels.  We would have had a number of cases recently where families have had to be separated because they could not be all accommodated in one space.  Obviously, that interferes with family life and compounds the chaos and distress of homelessness.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the Deputy's comments with respect to the right to housing and his support for the constitutional protection of that right.  There is no quality of life when all members of a family are living in one room, be it in a stable booking or otherwise.  I am working with a person currently who was in one night only accommodation and she is now living in one room with her four children, and they simply do not have a good quality of life.<br\/><br\/>The report published yesterday had some hard-hitting findings and some emotive examples of the impact of this on young children, in particular.  We see that frequently in our casework.  We welcome a call for extra focus and energy on this area.  There is an imperative to deal with this issue.  We hope recommendations can be made from this committee to influence policy in this area more broadly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Rebecca Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I will briefly address a number of points.  Deputy Casey asked whether schools with a DEIS status could cater better for children experiencing homelessness.  I attended an Irish Primary Principals Network conference in January.  It had surveyed its membership of 3,000 primary school principals and 39% of them had had interaction with homelessness.  That is a feature of every area of the country.  Teachers are all doing a fantastic job as best they can.  They are the unsung heroes who are catering for many of these children, whether it is bringing in food to help the children at breakfast time or staying on after the school day to help them with their homework.  The education sector is doing a phenomenal job in circumstances where there is not the support that is needed in other areas on the ground, whether it be a childcare support worker or a home, school, community liaison officer.  A great deal of work needs to be done to support these children.  This does not only involve schools with DEIS status.  We need to recognise that is one of the elements that clearly emerged from the report published yesterday.  Dr. Nowicki said it is scary how close we all are to homelessness.  We need to move from thinking that it is only happens in disadvantaged areas.  It happens to people experiencing economic crisis.  Family disruptions are causing people to fall into homelessness in a way that has not happened previously.  Tipperary and Clare are now considering establishing family hubs and there is homelessness in those areas which we would not have associated with them previously.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Casey asked is there anything else that could be done that has not been done.  I am concerned we will go through this crisis and somewhere along the line there will be enough houses but we will not have changed the system.  Therefore, when the next crash comes, children and families will still not be protected.  We must also examine the rental system to ensure there is more security.  In that way, people can consider themselves as lifetime renters if they need to be.  They can stay in the areas in which they want to be.  They would have some level of security in the way that people in every other country in Europe and America have where they can sustain their lifetime living as a family.  That is why I am worried about accommodation not being one of the priorities in housing.  We need to show there is another way to proceed.  When we speak to the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, it says the only tool it has is HAP.  We know in many other parts of the country rental accommodation is not coming on stream.  Rental accommodation is not available in Limerick, Cork or Galway.  There must be a wider sense of what housing options are available to people.  In the short term it will be about providing accommodation but we must use this crisis to make sure this never happens again.  That means widening the breadth of security for families not necessarily only the owners but for those who want to rent for life, whether it be in social housing or in the rental system.  The rental system has not changed that much.  The biggest change has been that we now provide six months' notice to people who are have been renting for five years.  That is a step forward but it does not represent security.  In any other country in Europe there are people who have rented all their lives and lived in the one house.  We also need to provide that option in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":719,"content":"<p>To address Deputy's Casey's point, our Home Works report, which was written by Dr. Geraldine Scanlon and Ms Gr&aacute;inne McKenna of Dublin City University, submitted independent research involving 20 families.  One of the findings they made having talked to the parents about how their children experienced school was that schools are a place of sanctuary for those children.  We need to do everything we can to ensure children can stay in the same school and have that routine and security that they do not have while living in emergency accommodation.  As Dr. Muldoon indicated, quite a number of children in schools that do not have DEIS status do not have the same support as those in schools with DEIS status.  It is not that schools with DEIS status have more resources but that they are more used to dealing with disadvantage so they know about what emerged from the research.  The authors of the report interviewed principals, teachers, special needs assistants and home, school, community liaison officers and they found that those in schools with DEIS status knew where to go whereas those working in schools that did not have DEIS status might not have been as familiar with that.  They found that principals were spending a great deal of time writing letters to advocate on behalf of families but that did not really make a difference and they felt frustrated by that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy McHugh spoke about the Home Works report and its recommendations during a D&aacute;il debate on this area earlier this year and said he would examine them and the way in which they could be implemented.  In that respect he said he would extend the home, school, community liaison scheme to schools that do not have DEIS status for a limited period of perhaps three years so that all schools would have those supports they need and that children in schools that do not have DEIS status would not fall through the cracks.  Some of the other recommendations in that report related to extending the July provision programme which is usually for children with special needs.  That would mean children in homeless accommodation would have somewhere to go in the daytime during the summer months because that is also a major issue for them.  If they live in emergency accommodation, especially in one night only accommodation, they might have to wander the streets for a period of time during the day.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Casey asked what could be done in the shorter term.  Some of the proposals we have presented could help.  He cited the example of families who move to live in accommodation in Wicklow who have to bring their children back to school in Dublin.  It would be helpful if local authorities, when making decisions, could take account of where children are attending school.  They are often operating at the mercy of where accommodation is available, but it would be helpful if a system could be put in place to consider those elements.  Ultimately, if the legislation was changed to place a duty on them to have to consider these elements, that would make a major difference.  Those are some elements we would find.  That report has been forwarded to the committee but we can resubmit it as it contains quite a number of practical recommendations.  It recommended that the Department of Education and Skills would become part of the inter-agency group that is examining these issues.  We are delighted that has happened and we hope it will make a real difference in terms of children&rsquo;s education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Saoirse Brady"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":720,"content":"<p>On the issue of one night only accommodation, I echo the call in that respect made by our colleagues in the Mercy Law Resource Centre.  I will cite the example of one illustrative case study that has come through one of our members, Barnardos.  A mother and her two small children who use our service had to travel two hours into the city every day with one child in a buggy.  They had all of their families&rsquo; belongings in seven plastic bags attached to the buggy.  The small child who was being potty trained was wetting herself because she could not last the entire journey.  We have heard many stories.<\/p><p>It is not right that we are facing this.  The matter has to be prioritised.<\/p><p> Also on Deputy O'Dowd's point on the local level, we have heard that minorities are disproportionately affected in many cases.  In terms of Travellers in particular, we mentioned in our report card the fact that local authorities are not spending funding they have for Traveller accommodation.  For example, in budget 2019, the allocation to local authorities increased and we are seeing that they are not spending it.  In 2017, for example, only half of the budget allocation was spent by local authorities.  What we would suggest there is that they would be sanctioned.  If funding is there, it should be spent, particularly when children are living in really bad accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I was slightly worried by Deputy Casey's question.  I do not want it to be recorded that Focus Ireland said there would be 48,000 new house completions in 2023.  I was quoting what the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government had told the fiscal advisory committee.  Looking at what others have said in terms of the total amount of need, there is a general consensus, including ESRI and IBEC, that if we are not producing 36,000 new housing completions every year we are not meeting the new demand that is coming on.  In the Government's predictions which were in the fiscal advisory committee, it states that by 2022 we would meet that target.  However, the Deputy is absolutely right.  We must not think of this as a case of when we meet that target the figure is gone because each year for the past decade that we failed to meet, all those households - not just families 0 who were seeking a home and could not find one have been waiting to come on to the market.  Obviously, those households who are better resourced, and more wealthy, will get the first additional ones that come, all else being equal, unless we intervene in the market.  If we leave this up to the market, we know who will be at the back of the queue.<\/p> <p>  Clarifying the Deputy's point, our figure, that Ms Lambe talked about yesterday and today, that only 9% of the children who are on the Focus Ireland caseload have a child support worker is worrying.  One hundred per cent of the other families do not have a child support worker.  The 9% is the best in the class.  There are no child support workers, as far as I am aware, in the model that was rolled out in homeless hubs.  Clearly, the families that do not have an adult key worker do not have a child support worker.  For the vast majority of children, there is nothing.  That really needs to be borne in mind.  I absolutely agree with the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Muldoon, that we can solve that more quickly in the hubs but we must not forget it would appear that the most vulnerable families are not in the hubs.<\/p> <p>  On the own-door accommodation, I will give two examples of facilities that Focus Ireland runs - a place in south Dublin that some Deputies would know well and one in Limerick in which Focus Ireland was supporting families.  In one case, in south Dublin, it is a block of apartments and there are other blocks of apartments beside it which are people's homes.  Physically, it is exactly the same as a nearby block of apartments, each of which is somebody's home.  South Dublin County Council is using it as emergency accommodation.  It is a flat or an apartment with a key in the front door, one goes in and that is the person's unit.  It has a kitchen and a bathroom and it is one's own space.  Similarly, the one in Limerick was actually apartments at the back of a hotel for some medium-term accommodation and Limerick County Council took it over, and we are supporting families there.  The family has a key to their own door.  When we started providing support in those, the families were homeless.  When they change the designation they are no longer accounted as homeless but they are still paid out of the homeless budget; they still have support workers because they are homeless; and, the expectations that they need to move out of homelessness are still there.  It is quite clearly a different form of accommodation and it is a better form of accommodation.  We would say that we should be looking at own-door accommodation as the way of providing emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Also, it is clearly homeless accommodation.  If one looks at the atmosphere or the living circumstances, for example, in the block in south Dublin, between the accommodation in which everybody is a tenant, it is their home and the person knows he or she is there either permanently if the person owns it or on a security as compared to the place where it is homeless accommodation where the occupants know that they are not there for long and they must keep on looking; they are completely and utterly different places to live.  No matter how much support we put in to make it a better place to live, it is still homeless emergency accommodation.  I would repeat the point that if the Minister had sat down with us and said that we should be counting families in this own-door accommodation as a separate category to the others because it is different and we recognise where we are doing things better than others, we would have saved a year of rowing.  We would have agreed to that.  However, we did not sit down.  It was not explained.  It was just a change.  Far more collaboration on these issues is needed rather than the current position.<\/p> <p>  On the last set of questions Deputy Casey asked which were about why the figures differ, I am not sure exactly to which figures the Deputy was referring.  Ehat is at play there is flow and stock.  One needs to think of homelessness - I am sorry if people will say that I have been talking about this for a long time but I always find this a useful image - as a river and not as a pond, or as people moving through a room and out of a room.  The figures that we were reporting here are the number of families in Dublin who became homeless and entered formal homelessness.  If a higher number of people leave, then the total number falls and it is possible in a particular month that the number of families becoming newly homeless rises while the total number of families who are currently homeless falls because we - Ms Lambe and her team and others - have been successful in moving people out.<\/p> <p>  That leads me to the Deputy's final question about what we can do better.  I would say if we do not provide more homes, there is no solution.  There is no solution to this problem without more homes.  Some of the homes, as Deputy O'Dowd stated, can come from homes that are currently empty and unused.  It is shocking that we have had this enormous figure out there for so many years that were to be a solution and it is ones and twos that have come through.  We would say that the Irish property owner reacts a bit more to sticks rather than carrots and some form of taxation or pressure to make property owners explain why a place is empty rather than our having to go chasing them would be necessary there.<\/p> <p>  The question becomes how, while we are waiting for the housing should we put it that way, do we better manage the situation.  If one goes back to the metaphor of the people moving through the room and the people moving out of the room, not everybody stays in the room for the same length of time.  One could have exactly the same inflow and exactly the same outflow, and have a completely different mix of people in the room.  What is happening at present is the most vulnerable families are being left in the room for the longest period of time.  Families which are large, families which are Travellers, some families from ethnic minorities - some of them move out very quickly but some of them get trapped - and people with all sorts of vulnerabilities are the ones who get left behind.  That is where one gets more than 160 families who have been left for two years.  At the heart of that is not only the number of social houses we have; it is allocations.  If we do not allocate the social housing to families who will not get into the private rented sector, they will remain homeless.  They will suffer and their children's lives will be made an absolute misery unless we get over the view that we cannot allocate social housing to homeless families because in some way this will encourage people to become homeless.  Is there anybody who could read all these reports and listen to all the examples who could genuinely believe that families are deliberately putting their children in the circumstances that are being described yet our public policy is driven by that belief?<\/p> <p>  What drives public policy on homelessness is a public and political attitude that people are making themselves homeless and we will make them less likely to be homeless if we make life more difficult for them.  All the organisations here, including Focus Ireland, believe families are much more likely to move out of homelessness if they are coping with homelessness and are supported.  Take the pressure off them.  Allow them the right or the possibility to have options and stop treating them as if they are somehow responsible for their circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Allen"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":723,"content":"<p>I thank all the organisations that are represented here and all their representatives who have come in to give their evidence this morning.<\/p> <p>  We have the fastest growing economy in Europe, we are told, and the scandal of growing child homelessness in our midst.

If I understand him correctly, he is arguing that we need approximately 36,000 housing completions per annum to maintain homelessness and child homelessness at their current levels.  If that figure will only be reached in 2022, that indicates that homelessness and child homelessness are set to increase in 2019, 2020, and 2021, and may be stabilised in 2022 before there is a fall in the numbers in 2023.  Perhaps I have taken Mr. Allen up incorrectly in that regard, but if homelessness advocates, campaigners and experts come before the committee and say the figures the Department released yesterday indicate homelessness and child homelessness will increase year on year for the next three years, that needs to be part of the public debate that arises from this meeting.  I ask him to comment on whether I have him right on that.<\/p> <p>  I address my second question to the representatives of the Mercy Law Resource Centre.  If people are in family hub accommodation, and they are part of the cohort who have their own door, am I correct that they are not counted as part of the official homelessness figures released by the Department?  I seek clarification on that.  It was said that children who are homeless in this country are worse off than homeless children in the UK because they have fewer legal protections.  Can the witnesses give us a couple of examples of what those lesser legal protections are?  Where is the gap?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for the representatives of the Children's Rights Alliance.  Family hubs are positive in that they are an improvement over what went before, but the speakers have clearly highlighted the potential negative effects, as well as the dangers of institutionalisation.  When the committee heard about family hubs being taken out on five-year leases, we raised a warning about institutionalisation, because we have seen what that has meant for other vulnerable groups in this State in the past.  Now we are hearing reports of people in accommodation for three and a half years, though that was in hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation rather than family hubs.  Clearly, the danger of institutionalisation in family hubs is growing in the context of the figures we have discussed.  I would like the witnesses to comment further on that.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I have a question for Mr. Muldoon.  He did not make reference to it earlier but he has made a point in previous interviews that caught my attention, and I would like him to comment on it.  Often, when we focus on the damage done to children by homelessness there is a focus on children of schoolgoing age and the type of scenario Deputy Casey mentioned where they are late for school, or are not able to go to school for a day or a week because of the distance and the disruption to family life.  I read an interview Mr. Muldoon did where he speculated on the possibility that the damage done to very young children could be as great or even greater.  I am not a child psychologist, but my understanding of what he said is that children sense what is going on around them, which causes trauma for a young child and the damage done, trauma suffered, and the consequences for both the individual and society might not be known for decades.  I invite him to make further comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#O00900","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":733,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time so I am only going to ask one question and make a few comments.  First, I acknowledge the witnesses' presence and thank all of them because they are advocates who have given voices to many voiceless homeless children and families.  They should not be disheartened.  I have heard all of them speak at different venues in the past few years, and they are constant advocates for homeless people, and children in particular.  It makes a difference, as previous speakers said.  It is a dripping tap, but people eventually cop on, so I salute the witnesses for their work.<\/p> <p>  I have been involved in the establishment of the institutional redress scheme and the early stages of lobbying for it, and I can see this issue becoming our next redress scheme.  Children are exposed to physical, mental, emotional, and sexual abuse, and they are unsafe.  A woman I have been working with for three years, whom we flagged to HIQA, Wicklow County Council, and a number of State agencies, is still in emergency accommodation in a hotel in Bray today.  She rings me every day asking how she can meet someone and get assistance.  She has major mental health issues, which she acknowledges and recognises.  She has sat here in the hall of Leinster House with her daughter, and her daughter has taken her hand and rubbed it and said \"Mummy, stop crying.  I am here for you.\"  A 14 year old girl has sat in this building crying and saying that she is there to support her mother.  When I ring up the particular council, the officials tell me she has a history and is trouble.  We all have a history and we all have troubles, and we need support and assistance.  One thing that is clear from what the witnesses have told us, which I have always believed, is that we need joined-up thinking.  We have HIQA and the Departments of Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs, and Health.  However, every time I contact one of these Departments, I am told that it does not come under its remit, or that the officials cannot meet this particular person because she will not accept a placefinder or meet him or as she has had problems with housing assistance payment, HAP, and does not want to go into it again.  It is all very sad and traumatic for people.  There is not a politician or county councillor in this country who has not been touched by personal experience of people who come to their clinics.  That is an important thing to say.<\/p> <p>  It is not surprising that we have a lack of child support case workers, as was the case in the childcare sector in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.   We saw the redress scheme and what it dealt with - the trauma, trouble, hurt, pain, suffering, mental anguish, anxiety and torture that children are undergoing.  We as a State refer to the Constitution cherishing the children of the nation equally, but it does not.  This State does not cherish its children equally, and it is exceptionally disappointing.  We all value our homes and they are central to our dignity as people.  They are central to our dignity and needs and they define who we are, secure us and give us the capacity to integrate, mix and live in our communities.  They are critically important.  I fully support a constitutional right to housing, and I fully accept that the local authorities are not doing enough in delivering social housing, which is critical.  We had programmes that delivered houses in this country from the 1930s through to the 1960s.  There were people living in those houses who did not come into them because of social need but bought them subsequently.  They are beautiful homes.<\/p><p>Many of them are in south County Dublin, where I live.  The delegates may be aware of these difficulties.  What have I learned from today?  I have learned that we have neither a statutory nor a constitutional right to basic shelter or housing, as Ms Keatinge stated.  There is no constitutional or statutory right to shelter for homeless children or families.  That is a terrible thing.  Legal aid is not available for housing or homeless matters.  That is a big challenge.  The ombudsman raised this issue previously.  I am aware of the limitations of his office, as is he.  There is a serious issue there which must be examined.<\/p><p> As Ms Keatinge stated, local authorities have a discretion to provide emergency accommodation for children and families but are not obliged to so do.  That is a terrible indictment of our system and State.  I do not need to teach the delegates.  I have learned from them today.  The minutes of this meeting will be important.  What the committee does as a result of today's discussion and our consideration of it will be important.  I ask the delegates to keep the pressure on the committee and other people, and we will keep the pressure on the political establishment in the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> There are 81 constitutions which provide special status and protection for children.  I am particularly interested in the Scottish model, about which I have read.  I ask the representatives to share with the committee their knowledge of constitutional provisions in other countries for the protection of homes for children and the constitutional right to housing which we discuss at this committee because it is a very important aspect and a matter to which we need to recommit ourselves.  I ask those who are familiar with the Scottish model to share their understanding or experience in that regard.<\/p><p> I say \"Well done\" to the representatives.  They are advocates who shine a light in many dark places.  The committee also has that task.  We can work together.  We would be failing if we do not go from here, analyse what is being said, paraphrase it, bullet point it and get it to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, as well as the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  In addition to being a housing and homelessness issue, this is about cherishing the children of our State equally, giving them opportunities and safeguards, protecting them for the future and allowing them to grow to their potential.  I have no doubt that these matters will be the subject of an international investigation and that the State will be hauled up to account for its failures.  They will be the subject of a very expensive redress scheme because of the damage the State is inflicting on children and families.

Deputy Barry asked whether own-door accommodation subsumed within a family hub is classified as family hub and counted in the homeless figures.  I do not know the answer to that question but the representatives of Focus Ireland may be able to comment on it.   I am happy to defer to Mr. Allen on that issue.  I note that the report of the Dublin Region Homelessness Executive from April breaks the figure down into hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, private emergency accommodation, supported temporary accommodation and family hubs.  I do not know the answer to the question asked.  We have concerns about the integrity of the data since these categories were taken out and about the categories that were never included, such as rough sleeping or refugees.  That was documented in our statement.  I will defer to Mr. Allen on this issue.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan asked about the differences in approach to child homelessness in Scotland and Ireland.  I will address the difference between the models.  Homeless children in Ireland have no statutory protections.  There is a discretionary obligation on the local authority to provide emergency accommodation.  The local authority must assess people for homelessness.  The legislation clearly states that one may be categorised as homeless if found to be such in the opinion of the local authority, which is a significant challenge.  By way of example, we referred to refusals, although I did not address that full on in response to Deputy Casey.  These are people who repeatedly present as homeless.  Their notice of termination may not have been validated by Threshold, which is the regular agency, or they may not have provided sufficient paperwork - the paperwork that is normally associated with social housing assessment is normally extensive.  They may not have stayed with every family member with whom they could possibly stay to meet their housing need.  Recently, some families presenting to housing authorities have been repeatedly repelled.  I am working on the case of a person who presented approximately 12 times.  Now that there has been an intervention, there is a recognition that there is no alternative.  That case involves young children.  There is no duty on a housing authority to assess that and take into account the best interests of those children.<\/p> <p>  On the differences between the Irish, English and Scottish models, one particularly noteworthy aspect of the English model is that there is a six-week limit on the time vulnerable categories of person, including homeless families, can spend in unsuitable temporary accommodation such as hotels and bed and breakfasts.  In Scotland, that time limit is seven days, reduced from 14 days.  That is starkly different from the situation here for children accessing homeless services.  On the legal framework, there is a best interest consideration which is completely absent here.  The Scottish model is seen as one that has brought about a very different and human rights-led approach to homelessness.  However, the model pertains only to homelessness and is criticised for not dealing with the broader right to housing.  We would very much welcome the adoption of that model here, but we recognise its shortcomings, which highlight the need for broader protection of the right to housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rebecca Keatinge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I will address the question of Deputy Barry regarding the impact on children in the younger age group.  My background is in psychology.  A child's first 1,000 days is now considered far more critical than was previously thought.  It relates to the plasticity of the child's brain and the impact of trauma.  Such trauma may include insecurities or uncertainties.  Children pick up on the tensions and fears of the parents.  It is clear that trauma can have an impact on a young infant's feeding, development of potty training, physical movement, security and sense of who they are as an individual.  On excessive attachment, we know from the consultation we carried out that some parents will not let their child out of their sight for fear of losing the child.  In addition, the system forces them not to allow the child out of their sight, so there is no sense of allowing that independence, even if accompanied by an older brother or sister.  The psychological impact of that is stark.  The research shows that the 1,000 days up to a child's third birthday is the most important period in which the child gets a sense of self.  Problems stemming from this period can be overcome at a later stage, but that is very difficult to achieve.  Such problems have a significant impact.  We are aware of children being born into that situation.  One can imagine the impact on a child born four weeks premature and who is pushed around a shopping centre for that period.  The child will pick up on the feelings, emotions and sense of security of the parent.  There is a significant impact in that regard.  As we move more towards institutional long-term stays in these emerging situations, we will see more such children being impacted on and acting out through challenging behaviours and, perhaps, criminal behaviour in the future.  We do not know what the impacts may be.  It is uncertain.  We have been in this situation for long enough to have children who have spent three or four years in those sorts of circumstances from birth; not just as teenagers.  That will have a huge impact and we, as a society, need to recognise that and change it.  We need to ensure that we can protect children who have gone through such situations into the future.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan raised the issue of responsibility across Departments.  Our public agencies need to start looking at the child as being at the centre, which would take the focus away from the troublesome, tricky or challenging parent.  Mothers have come to me who know they are defined within the public service as a \"psycho mum\".  The problem is that the system makes it necessary for those mothers to work in that way.  If we put the child at the centre of decision making, that should take away the pain and fire around those issues.<\/p><p>It is something we need to work towards in the long term.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":739,"content":"<p>Regarding the point about institutionalisation and what happens when one takes away people's autonomy, some family hubs, which are better than emergency accommodation, may not have cooking facilities or access to the range of things families need.  I know that in the Ombudsman for Children's report, one little girl spoke about how she could not go downstairs to do her homework in the one room that was available to her because she would have had to bring her entire family with her, so children and teenagers are not getting independence and neither they nor their parents are feeling that autonomy, which will cause long-term damage.<\/p> <p>  I will give the committee an example of a number of stories we have heard from members and others.  Our report, entitled Home Works, contained a story about a little boy in an early years setting.  When they went to go for outdoor play every day, he got really upset when he had to go and put his coat on because he did not understand what was happening.  He thought he had to go back to the hotel so he would throw a tantrum and get really upset and it took the childcare workers a bit of time to work out what was happening.  When they got it out of him, he said it was because he was going back to the hotel and they told him he was not.  That same child would not speak or eat in the hotel so, thankfully, a hot meal was provided for him in the cr&egrave;che, they did great work and he was able to socialise with other children.  Another member told us about a child who was having significant difficulty walking.  The child was about three years old and was unable to walk.  They could not understand why and had to go to physiotherapy.  It became apparent that the reason the child could not walk was because the muscles in the child's legs had not developed because the child was in a buggy all day.  This was because the child's mother had to push the child around all day because she had nowhere to go while she was waiting to go back into accommodation that night.  A good news story from the Home Works report involved Angela, one of the mothers who spoke with the researchers.  At an event in DCU, she talked about how she has now been given a home and it is great.  She spoke about how on the first night the family were there, so many people called round because the children could finally say that they had a place to call home and could have their friends round so there were multiple knocks on the door and they were all stampeding towards it.  One of the really heartbreaking things she spoke about was the fact that she made them dinner - mash and sausages - for the first time in two years.  She broke down and started crying because she was able to cook a meal for them.  She has four children, two of whom are under the age of six.  They still crawl into bed with her at night because they are not used to having their own space.  They share a room but their mother is not there any more.  The five of them shared a room for so long that they are not used to this.  She is finding that quite difficult as well.  She finally has her own space and the children are coming into her room.  Those are just some of the ways children and young people are being institutionalised.  If members read the Ombudsman for Children's report, they will hear from children themselves about what is like being in family hubs.  Some described it as a prison while others described it as being like trying to escape so we really need to look at that, listen to the voices of children and see what we can do for them.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the Scottish model, Ms Keatinge has given a very clear overview of the differences there.  One of the things Scotland is looking to do at the moment is to incorporate the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into its law.  That would make a significant difference.  We had a referendum in 2012 that came into effect in 2015 and we have incorporated some of the rights in the convention, for example, the best interests and voice of the child, into some proceedings but we need to do more if we are really to do justice to the rights of children.  The committee could look at what is happening in Scotland and how it is looking to incorporate that further.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Saoirse Brady"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":740,"content":"<p>In the broadest possible general terms, Deputy Barry has correctly understood me.  I have never seen figures that far out with regard to the Government's predictions for how many houses will be built and the 2023 figure.  Perhaps I missed something.  I was just drawing people's attention to the fact that this is where the Government says it is going to go and yet we know each year where the demand is.  That was the first time we got some sort of Government indication of where that might shift.  There are some really serious caveats about it.  The first is whether we believe we will have 48,000 by 2023.  Equally as important is the fact that a mismatch in the amount of housing supply and the people who need it does not necessarily turn into homelessness in the formal measured sense.  It can turn up as doubling up, overcrowding or a range of things.  That is quite divided by social class and resources.  For example, if we were delivering 48,000 homes by 2023 and the majority of those were affordable and social housing, we would probably see a decline in homelessness far earlier but if the majority of that housing was market led and, therefore, at the top of the market, we would probably not see a turnaround in homelessness until significantly after that, so that mix of price, tenure and where will be crucial - not just in the numbers.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the question about own-door accommodation, my understanding is that the most significant change made to the measurement of homelessness by the Department was the fact that it stopped counting within those official figures families accommodated in housing units where people had their own key to the door.  These people are no longer counted in those official homelessness figures.  When the committee discussed this previously, I believe Deputy Barry asked witnesses from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive whether they considered such families to be homeless and they said \"Yes\".  The Deputy asked witnesses from the Department whether they considered these families to be homeless and they said \"No\".  They are not homeless as far as the figures are concerned but they are homeless - even in the own-door accommodation - in terms of getting support from people like us and being paid for, so it is a complicated area.  Obviously, it changes the total number but if people are not impressed by the figure being 10,000, they will not be impressed by it being 11,000, so the more significant difficulty that raises is that it makes it much harder to understand what is happening.  A family becomes homeless and if living in a hotel, is counted as homeless but if it is moved into own-door accommodation, it ceases to be counted as homeless but is not counted as having out of moved out of homelessness.  So it becomes very hard to track what is happening and the direction in which things are going, which makes a significant difference if we want effective policy.  <\/p> <p>  I have two points to make regarding the impact on children.  When we talked to families that had moved out of homelessness and asked parents about the impact of homelessness on the children, the parents tended to say that it had not affected the younger children.  They said it affected the older children but not the younger ones.  I do not think we should take that at face value.  I think it indicates a far more serious problem, in that the parents are not positioned to address the trauma that might have been felt by the younger children because they did not notice it.  Rather than it being reassuring that the parents see it in that way, it is actually a greater cause for concern in terms of the long-term implications for those families.  In the report, we mentioned that we are doing some work collectively with others on the trauma suffered by children and that we are happy to share that with the committee if it is interested.  <\/p> <p>  In Scotland, there is a legal rather than a constitutional right to housing as it does not have a constitution so there is nowhere to put it.  That has an impact.  If we look at the impact of that, we can see the importance not just of the legal right but of political leadership, and I would argue, political consensus.  In the early stages of that, there was a really transformative moment where all the political parties supported it and it was led very clearly.  That drifted away.  There is an attempt to re-establish that with a new strategy, which will be very welcome, but the sense that there was a cross-party, left-right and nationalist-unionist consensus that one of the things they were going to do right in Scotland involved housing and homelessness was really important.  A very useful piece of PhD research written by a great researcher called Beth Watts compares attitudes and responses to homelessness in Scotland and Ireland - direct response in terms of the homeless service - which is well worth working at.  The situation for families in Edinburgh is very different compared to that in Glasgow.  The overarching position is the same but the way it plays out in the two major cities is very different and concerns what they did with their social housing stock.  One city essentially gave all its social housing stock to approved housing bodies, no longer has control over it and is trying to get it back while the other city held on to its social housing.  Responses in those cities are very different so there is a lot to be learned from what Scotland has done.  As it does not have the same scale of family homelessness that we have, there are limitations.  The scale we are seeing here is unique in Europe.  It is similar to what one might see in the US but is not comparable to anything in Europe so to some extent, we must find our own solutions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019061200002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Allen"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":741,"content":"<p>On behalf of members, I thank the witnesses for attending.

I am joined by my officials, Mr. Brendan Eiffe and Mr. James Moloney.  <\/p> <p>  The issue under discussion is whether Ireland should opt in to the new Eurojust regulation and thereby maintain its membership of Eurojust.  It is my view that Ireland should opt in and that the Oireachtas should approve the necessary resolutions to enable this to take place.  Members of the committee need to be aware that a consequence of not opting in to the regulation will be that Ireland will have to withdraw from membership of Eurojust.<\/p> <p>  It may be helpful if I provide some background information on the matter.  Eurojust is the European Union's agency for criminal justice co-operation.  Its role is to provide assistance for members in criminal investigations which involve two or more EU member states.  The structure of Eurojust is centred on a college of prosecutors comprising prosecutors from each of the member states.  The prosecutors are based in The Hague in the Netherlands and the college meets regularly to discuss cases which fall within the remit of the agency.  In Ireland's case, a prosecutor from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Dublin provides full-time representation on behalf of the State.  The college&rsquo;s primary role is assisting in clearing difficulties and logjams in multi-national criminal investigations and dealing with mutual legal assistance requests for evidence and surrenders under the European arrest warrant.  The location of EU prosecutors under one roof at Eurojust facilitates the rapid exchange of information and the addressing of issues of relevance.  The agency has contributed greatly in that regard and membership is highly valued among EU member states.  For example, despite its position on Brexit, the United Kingdom has opted in to the new regulation.<\/p> <p>  As I said, this is not about Ireland joining Eurojust but remaining a member because Ireland is and has been a member since the inception of the agency 17 years ago.  To clarify the position, Eurojust operates under the provisions of Council Decision 2002\/187\/JHA of 28 February 2002 setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious crime.  The new regulation under discussion retains many of the provisions and structures of its predecessor, but it also provides a framework for modernisation of the agency.  Because the new regulation comes within Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, TEU, and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, there is a necessity for the Oireachtas to agree that Ireland should accept the measure.<\/p> <p>  The main features of the new regulation are that, in Chapter II, Articles 6 to 18, inclusive, it revises Eurojust&rsquo;s governance structure by setting up an executive board to deal with administrative matters.  Therefore, Eurojust&rsquo;s college which consists of prosecutors from all EU member states can focus more strongly on operational issues.  The ever-increasing number of Eurojust cases requires a more efficient way of handling cases.  The new regulation will make Eurojust fit for this purpose.  It does not replace the successful core concept of the college of supporting national authorities in their investigations and discovering links between cases; rather, in Articles 2 to 5, inclusive, it confirms the current proactive role of Eurojust in its operational, strategic and tactical work.  In other words, the operational practices in place for the past 17 years and in which Ireland has played a part will not change.  This work involves co-ordinating approaches to the most serious forms of criminality, including murder, people trafficking, child sexual exploitation, drug trafficking and terrorism.<\/p> <p>  Chapter III which includes Articles 19 to 25, inclusive, deals with operational matters and provides details of the operational structure of Eurojust, including a 24\/7 on-call service for member states.  <\/p> <p>  Of major significance, in Chapter IV, Articles 26 to 46, inclusive, is that the new regulation brings Eurojust into line with the data protection rules the European Union adopted last year, the GDPR and associated law enforcement directive, and takes into account Eurojust&rsquo;s specific mandate to process data in the interests of fighting cross-border crime.  Eurojust&rsquo;s operations will also be subject to the scrutiny of the European Data Protection Supervisor as set out in Article 40.<\/p> <p>  In Chapter V the regulation addresses Eurojust co-operation agreements with third states and international organisations, both of which are subject to the aforementioned data protection provisions.  <\/p> <p>  Eurojust's operations and budget are subject to the scrutiny of the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  There is no expectation of a budgetary contribution from Ireland for the running of the agency.  Ireland's national member is remunerated by the State in the same manner as any official of the State who is assigned to duties overseas.  The small cost, when measured against the services made available to Ireland through membership, represents a small price to pay.<\/p> <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I am the central authority for the provision of international mutual legal assistance for and from other states.  In the past five years the volume of cases dealt with has doubled and is set to increase by more than 50% per annum.  These statistics alone illustrate the increasingly transnational nature of serious crime.  In the four years up to the end of 2018 the Irish desk at Eurojust handled more than 800 cases with an Irish dimension.  They included cases involving serious international fraud, sexual offences and the trafficking of vulnerable young women into the State for the purpose of engaging them in prostitution.  Transnational problems require transnational approaches.  As Minister, I must ensure a comprehensive response to this issue and the State&rsquo;s continued membership of Eurojust plays an essential part in this response.<\/p> <p>  Taking into account that the core function of Eurojust is to assist in criminal investigations, the fact that it has a proven track record in this area over 17 years and is subject to the most advanced data privacy protection regime in the world, there are few who would argue that it would not be desirable for Ireland to remain a member.  It seems that there is an issue of principle.  It cannot just be about what Ireland receives.  It is about playing an active part in the European Union and ensuring the welfare of its citizens.  Notwithstanding the negative effect on criminal investigations in the State, our EU colleagues would see an Irish withdrawal from Eurojust as a negative development.  I need not remind committee members that in recent times Ireland has relied heavily on the solidarity and support of other member states.  Membership of the European Union brings with it a responsibility to act collectively to help to solve the problems and threats the Union faces.  Serious crime is certainly one of those threats.  It would be unfortunate if Ireland was perceived, on the one hand, as seeking the support of the other members and, on the other, not being willing to play a part in the advancement and betterment of the European project.<\/p> <p>  As I said recently in response to a parliamentary question on this matter from Deputy Wallace who is a member of the committee, there are few who would argue that Ireland's membership of the European Union has not been of enormous benefit to Ireland's citizens, both economically and in terms of the progressive social development of the State.  The freedoms enjoyed by EU citizens and the real and genuine protections afforded to their fundamental rights are the envy of many throughout the world.  This commitment to protecting fundamental rights is not some empty aspiration but a reality backed up by formal structures such as the European Court of Justice and the European Parliament.  The freedom of movement EU citizens enjoy is one very clear benefit of membership of the European Union.  Unfortunately, there are always those who will seek to exploit privileges such as freedom of movement for their own nefarious ends and much recent EU law in the criminal justice sphere has been aimed at trying to counter the abuse of these freedoms, while also protecting them.  The European arrest warrant is one such example.  Another is Eurojust.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I do not believe it would be desirable to lose membership of Eurojust.  International serious crime is an issue which affects all member states and their citizens and has countless victims.  Co-ordination of measures to disrupt this activity and ongoing communication between states on such measures are not only desirable but essential.  Eurojust provides an efficient and effective way of ensuring this co-operation occurs.  I can think of no rational coherent reason Ireland should not be involved.

Before doing that, I first have to advise on privilege for witnesses who come before an Oireachtas committee.  I draw the attention of our guests to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>By virtue of the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#E00600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":757,"content":"<p>The Children's Rights Alliance is an umbrella group, which brings together more than 100 member organisations with the goal of making Ireland one of the best places in the world to be a child.  We were members of the working group appointed by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  It was our job on the working group to represent the interests of children and young people and a lot of our work was informed by our member organisations, which put significant time and investment into the working group process.  The human rights issues I witnessed during that time were some of the worst I had ever witnessed.  There was huge institutionalisation, not only of the people living in the system but of the people working in the system and managing it.  There was huge overcrowding, hunger and welfare issues, mental health issues and issues of basic human dignity.  One of the only positives I saw was that children were able to go to school and that made a big difference, both to children and families.  By and large, though, they were living in abject poverty, isolation and exclusion.<\/p> <p>  There have been significant changes since the working group process.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs carried out a consultation with children and young people in the direct provision system and, while some of what they found was very disturbing, there has been some action on it by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The direct provision payment for children was &euro;9.60 for a 15-year period but it has now increased to the McMahon recommendation of &euro;29.80.  The first increase was by Deputy Joan Burton when she was Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and another was made by Deputy Leo Varadkar, with the most recent increase being put in place by the current Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty.  The Ombudsman for Children can now take complaints from children in direct provision.  There was no public oversight of the direct provision system at the time and it was allowed to continue with poor procurement procedures, no public oversight by bodies such as Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and no proper complaints mechanisms, meaning that ill treatment and maladministration were allowed to continue.  There have been improvements in cooking facilities and a significant work has gone into the development of national standards for refugee accommodation.  Our view of how to change direct provision is that we need to accommodate families in own-door accommodation in small clusters, with social care from people working on site.<\/p><p>Some of these families are very vulnerable but, at the same time, they were being institutionalised in these institutions by people with no experience of working in direct provision or working with refugees at all.  In our view, the national standards could provide for that.  One key recommendation is that families should be in own-door accommodation.<\/p><p> Another improvement was a reduction of overcrowding over the period.  There was certainly an effort to try to address that because it was inhumane.  While on the working group, one centre I visited had four women living in a hotel room with their beds side by side.  They spoke different languages and had been living like that for four years.  That was the kind of overcrowding we were seeing at that time.  <\/p><p> The last improvement is that people who had been in the system for five years or more had their claims expedited and several thousand refugees got out of direct provision as a result.<\/p><p> In terms of where we go next, I must say that some of these improvements are being overshadowed by the fact that we have more than 500 people seeking asylum, including children, now in these emergency accommodation facilities that are very close to situations where children are living in homeless accommodation.  They and their health needs have not been assessed.  We are concerned that some of the children do not have access to schools, nor do the parents have support to find a school, and we are also concerned about child protection issues in these centres.  Direct provision centres must comply with Children First procedures and have a dedicated liaison person.  We do not know what is happening with these emergency centres and we are concerned about that.<\/p><p> We must implement the national standards that are yet to be published if we are serious about changing the system.  We also must have unannounced public inspections.  It is not good enough for a private operator to look at whether the provider complies with the contract.  We must have a body like HIQA.  That is the only way we will get the assurance that we will never go back to the direct provision of the past.<\/p><p> The last point I want to bring to the attention of the committee is in the area of welfare and child protection.  We know at the moment that, within the Reception and Integration Agency, the role of social worker who has overall responsibility for overseeing the system has been vacant since November.  That is a long time.  At the same time, we have emergency facilities opening.  Who is the watchdog?  Who is keeping an eye on what is happening for these children throughout the system and in these emergency facilities?  <\/p><p> I also want to bring attention to unaccompanied minors within the system.  The working group met many of them and the Children's Rights Alliance has met many since.  Many of our member organisations have been communicating with us and the main issue coming from them is that oftentimes asylum applications for unaccompanied minors are not being lodged by the social worker when they arrive in the country.  They are discovering this at the age of 18, at which stage they are often sent into the direct provision system.<\/p><p> In summary, there have been significant changes since the working group report.  There are also significant challenges which must be dealt with.  I absolutely think those challenges are not insurmountable and can be addressed through good decision making and by using the evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":759,"content":"<p>We have two Fionas before us.

Nasc is an NGO and a charity that works with people seeking protection.  We work with refugees, migrants and their families to realise and fulfil their rights.  Nasc runs a free legal information and drop-in service that supports 1,300 people annually.  We also deliver outreach to the five direct provision centres in Cork city and county.  Nasc was also a member of the working group on direct provision and the protection process and a member of the advisory group established to develop national standards for direct provision.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the fact that the committee are examining both our asylum reception system direct provision and also the protection process, as the two are inextricably linked and cannot be viewed or repaired in isolation.  Given the breadth of the committee's remit, I will focus on a few key issues and recommendations that have emerged based on our 19 years' experience working with protection applicants and other NGOs on these issues.  <br\/><br\/>The journalist Masha Gessen had a piece on direct provision in <i>The New Yorker<\/i>magazine last week, titled, &quot;Ireland's strange, cruel system for asylum seekers&quot;.  Most Irish people would not find it strange that the State's chosen model for reception of people seeking protection is one of institutionalisation.  Historically we have always institutionalised, excluded and contracted out the care of vulnerable adults and children.  It is clear from listening to the powerful testimonies from members of the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI, at the last hearing that our for-profit, institutional model of reception fails to respect the human dignity of asylum seekers in Ireland.  Our current reception system takes an out of sight, out of mind attitude leading to a systematic and structural othering of people seeking protection.  <br\/><br\/>It must also be acknowledged and welcomed that there now exists a real openness within the Department of Justice and Equality and in some political quarters to radically change and overhaul our protection system.  This is building upon a number of important positive changes that have already been made in recent years including opting into the reception conditions directive, which puts our reception system on a statutory footing for the first time and provides additional remedies and protections for applicants including a vulnerability assessment; the granting of open access to the labour market for protection applicants who have not had a first instance decision on their application within nine months; and, the development of national standards, which when implemented will apply to all accommodation centres.  We have had an increase in the weekly allowance of &euro;38.80 for adults and &euro;29.80 for children.  Notwithstanding these improvements, serious structural and systemic issues remain and will continue to prevail for as long as we retain the current institutionalised for-profit model of asylum reception.  <br\/><br\/>Many of the underlying issues caused by for-profit institutionalisation and lack of oversight or accountability remain.  We recognise that dismantling a system that has been embedded for almost two decades is challenging and will not and cannot happen overnight.  However, there are a number of critical steps that urgently need to be taken to begin to move us towards a protection and reception system that addresses and respects the fundamental human rights of protection applicants.  First, delays in the determination process have been a constant feature of our protection process.  The current median wait time for processing of applications now stands at 15 months.  This is a long way off the promised six-month wait time originally cited when the International Protection Act 2015 was enacted.  In our experience, the wait time with no upper limit is one of the primary issues raised to us by applicants.  Additional staff and resources must be allocated to the international protection office to ensure that it can deal with all applications on hand at any one time in a timely and efficient manner.  <br\/><br\/>Secondly, chapter of 3 of the McMahon report which deals with the determination process provides a number of very clear, unanimously agreed but yet to be implemented recommendations aimed at improving the process.  These include consideration of introducing a rolling system whereby all persons in the protection system for five years or more should be granted a protection status or permission to remain if they have co-operated with the process in line with statutory obligations, an annual review of the system with a view to making recommendations to guard against any future backlogs and introducing mechanisms to regularly review the quality of decision making.  The civil Legal Aid Board must also be properly resourced to ensure that applicants have access to effective, early legal advice.  <br\/><br\/>As was demonstrated in the McMahon report, a reduction in processing times and improvements to the decision-making process not only benefit protection applicants, but in the long run will result in cost savings to the State.  These recommendations were made in conjunction with multiple Departments and were unanimously agreed as significant steps to improve the protection process.  They must now be implemented in line with the McMahon report.  <br\/><br\/>In addition to implementing the above recommendations, with regard to short to medium-term improvements to the material conditions for those living in the current system, we call upon the Government to introduce with immediate effect the vulnerability assessment which is provided for under Article 21 of the reception conditions directive.  This obligates member states to take into account the special reception needs of vulnerable applicants.  This is a legal requirement and not an optional extra.  We would also recommend that the national standards are published and implemented and that an appropriate, independent inspectorate body such as HIQA be appointed as the inspectorate to implement the standards.  In line with the McMahon report, all families should have their own private living space and adequate cooking facilities must be installed in all centres.  <br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the longer-term changes that need to be made to create a protection system that is reflective of the key tenets of a modern democracy, a system that respects privacy and human dignity.  We fully agree with the recommendation of the Irish Refugee Council that responsibility for the provision of reception to protection applicants should not be under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality as its expertise does not lie in the provision of housing and social care.<\/p><p>A housing policy approach needs to be employed.  A cross-governmental response is needed as the issues that need to be addressed are multifaceted and cut across a number of Departments.  Similar approaches are commonly employed by other jurisdictions, such as Canada and Australia, when seeking to address critical social issues.<\/p><p> We need to move from our current reliance on private accommodation providers and create the conditions upon which approved housing bodies with expertise in the provision of housing and social care can provide suitable self-contained accommodation for protection applicants.  This will require changes to the tendering process and to social housing funding streams to allow for a variety of accommodation types in the community.  We need to move away from institutional settings.  The State should also build fit-for-purpose self-contained housing units.  The accommodation provided must be a blend of independent and supported living to cater for the needs of all applicants.  Requisite supports should be provided.<\/p><p> It has been four years since the publication of the McMahon report and, like most reports, compromises were made on both sides to achieve a consensus.  While the report is by no means perfect, it contains clear and important recommendations which, if implemented, would greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our determination procedure, and would provide a good starting point for a more fundamental realignment of our protection and reception system.  The lack of implementation of some key recommendations is possibly why, four years later, we are here today.  All the while, the real human casualties of the Government&rsquo;s inaction are the men, women and children living in limbo, waiting in a system that as Gessen cogently noted, &ldquo;boils the process of seeking asylum down to its essence: waiting&rdquo;.<\/p><p> I thank the committee members.  I would be happy to answer any questions they may have on our statement.  Within the bundle of submissions we have provided, there is also a submission from Amach! LGBT, the group that was supporting Sylva Tukula.  As the committee knows, that issue arose in the media last week when it was discovered that Sylva was buried without her LGBT family in Galway and her friends and family in the Great Western Hotel ever having been notified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Finn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":762,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am an associate professor in UCD school of law, and human rights legal obligations and the system of direct provision has been a topic of my published research for some time.  I have provided the committee with a full submission and wish to highlight some of my key recommendations, which I invite the committee to consider.  These include recommendations on better respecting and protecting the right to work for international protection applicants and reducing the length of time before applicants can access the labour market, as well as ensuring this includes all international protection applicants, given many, due to legacy issues, may not be provided with the right to work.  I invite the committee to recognise that direct provision, in and of itself, is a gross violation on the rights of the child and, indeed, all persons who may be subjected to this system.  I echo many of the recommendations based on the detailed expertise of the Children's Rights Alliance and Nasc and would further call for an increase in the direct provision allowance, now called the daily expenses allowance.  In particular, as a first step, we must ensure that all children within direct provision receive the payment of child benefit.  This can be achieved through an amendment to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.<\/p> <p>  I also make a number of recommendations on aged-out separated children, who are children who enter Ireland aged under 18 without a parent or guardian.  Once they reach the age of 18, they are moved into direct provision.  The direct provision system, as an institutionalised system, is absolutely not appropriate for aged-out separated children.  As the committee has heard over previous weeks and again today, the system of direct provision is one that sets human rights at naught and destabilises and impacts negatively on the rights of the child, the rights of families and the rights of individuals subject to this system.  Established as a system that was intended to last no more than six months, as Ms Finn mentioned, we now have a system of institutionalised living which many international protection applicants will be subjected to for many years.<\/p> <p>  The role of law and State administration to date as regards the needs of persons within the international protection system is one that rejects international protection applicants as being holders of human rights.  The State&rsquo;s approach to international protection applicants has sought to justify years of institutionalised living, years of the inability to do something as simple as decide what to eat and when to eat, years of having to live in hostel-style accommodation, with little to no say about who they can or must interact with, and years of children never seeing their parents or guardians prepare a meal except under the watchful eye of accommodation managers.<\/p> <p>  What value is the phrase \"human rights\" where the right to decide such intimate and basic aspects of one&rsquo;s life is withdrawn for years, without any end date?  Convicted of no crime, international protection applicants are segregated from Irish society and condemned to live a half-life.  That so many other countries in the European Union treat persons seeking international protection considerably worse than Ireland is no justification for Ireland refusing to respect, protect, vindicate and fulfil the full array of human rights which all individuals, including international protection applicants, have under the State's freely accepted international human rights legal obligations.<\/p> <p>  Based on my analysis of the law, policy and administration of the system of direct provision, I have concluded that the direct provision system is not fit for purpose and should be abolished.  Alternatives to the system must respect, protect, vindicate and fulfil all human rights - civil, political, economic, social and cultural - while persons within the international protection system have their claims for international protection assessed.  Failures in State administration for timely determination on whether an individual meets the definition of being in need of protection is no defence to the significant rights violations to which international protection applicants have been subjected for almost 20 years.<\/p> <p>  Replacing direct provision may not happen overnight.  There will be cost implications, as protecting human rights is never cost-free.  However, from nearly 20 years of testimony on the lived experience of international protection applicants and human rights-based research, much of it conducted by NASC, the Children's Rights Alliance and the Irish Refugee Council, one thing is very clear: Direct provision was and still is a gross breach of the most fundamental human right we all should have - the right to dignity and respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Thornton"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":764,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Thornton and all of the contributors.

The committee has covered a lot of ground in the last few weeks and will cover more in the next few weeks.  I agree with the witnesses, and I have no doubt, that this is a gross violation of the rights of children and families.  It is truly shocking.  What we have heard over recent weeks has, for me, been really upsetting, shocking and frustrating.<\/p> <p>  I want to highlight certain points.<\/p><p>In the context of housing, I have heard two important messages.  The first of these is that the responsibility for protection should not fall to the Department of Justice and Equality given that its expertise does not lie in the areas of housing or social care.  Second, Ms Finn stated we need to move away from institutionalisation and described the current approach as \"out of sight, out of mind\", where asylum seekers are isolated and kept at a distance.  She suggested that after a short initial period of reception, it would be better to have a form of owned or clustered accommodation embedded in communities.  Will she expand on how that might work in practice while ensuring that support and services are available?<\/p><p> An important point made every week is the need for common standards and oversight to prevent abuse.  All our guests have suggested HIQA as a suitable body.  I have no doubt it is crucial.  It is an important recommendation that we as a committee must follow.  At a minimum, we need common standards for reception and oversight with teeth to investigate and prevent abuse.  If two asylum seekers arrive in Ireland, one may be sent to a centre with cooking facilities, better transport and more space, whereas the other, through no fault of his or her own, may end up in a centre with none of the above.  It does not seem right that pure chance is the decider.  From Dr. Thornton's presentation, it seems that on a human rights basis, we should ensure that every applicant is treated equally as a baseline and that his or her specific needs or challenges are taken into account.  Will Dr. Thornton elaborate on that?  If the Chairman allows, I will follow up with further questions after our guests respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#G00500","speaker":"1408","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":767,"content":"<p>On the alternatives, the Department of Justice and Equality having sole care and responsibility for protection applicants has not worked for the past 20 years, which is a lesson we have learned.  We need to do something more radical.  I agree with our colleagues in the Refugee Council that while it is not a housing issue per se, housing is one of the main components of how we care for international protection applicants.  In our engagement with approved housing bodies, AHBs, which have significant expertise in housing and social care, they have indicated that the structure of the current tendering process does not suit them because it is very much focused on institutional, large, congregated settings.  AHBs have a clear ethos and mission but the process does not match with that.  We need to start doing work and to engage directly with AHBs.  We must move the model away from large, institutional settings, the smallest of which, based on the tenders, houses approximately 50 people.  For AHBs, however, 50 is far too many and does not fit with their ethos.  We are considering small, pepper-potted forms of accommodations and settings, moving away from the larger settings.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality should look to build for-purpose reception centres and units.  The bottom line for any new reception centre is that it would have to be own-door accommodation in self-contained units, where families can live together.  Many have argued asylum seekers should be allowed to live in the community and have access to full housing and social welfare, which is another option.  That has been tried in other jurisdictions but the Scottish model has presented several issues and challenges because many vulnerable protection applicants have been left isolated in communities.  We are examining the system that best suits protection applicants rather than one that creates an institutional setting, places protection applicants into that and expects them somehow to fit in to the system.  We need to change our thinking about the matter and to start considering different models.  It is clear our current model of institutional housing of protection applicants is not working.  Tinkering with it will not change the fundamental, underlying faults of the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Finn"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":768,"content":"<p>If our guests wish to comment on something about which a member may not have directly asked, they are very welcome to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#H00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":769,"content":"<p>I fully support what Ms Finn proposes.  On the wraparound services and the approach that might work, a good example is the area-based childhood initiatives, which are run by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in conjunction with Tusla.  When those programmes were being set up, an area was asked to pitch an initiative or programme.  Many providers came together, formed a steering committee, developed various approaches and ran them in the community.  There are many examples of how services can be provided to vulnerable people and many success stories of how it works.  We could borrow from that as a solution.<\/p> <p>  Under the Scottish model Ms Finn mentioned, I understand that people are placed in housing communities.  A potential solution is that an AHB could lease properties in various parts of the country where density is lower.

I should know, however, because within normal structures of decision-making, if people are to be sent to one centre or another, documents should outline what criteria will be used to make the decision.  If such an internal policy exists in the Reception and Integration Agency, I have never seen it and I am inclined to believe that it does not.  As Ms Finn and Ms Ward outlined, there are significant pressures on the direct provision system, which might mean the system is in crisis-management mode, where people are moved into direct provision if there is space, or into hotels if not.  When there are several applicants, I do not know the rationale for making the decision.  I should know, however, as we all should, the basis for making decisions on dispersal.<br\/><br\/>In the context of standards within institutionalised settings, I would exercise a note of caution.  When one begins by stating that there could be standards to watch over settings which, <i>per se<\/i>, grossly violate human rights, it gives some form of comfort that the system is fine.  While they may be appropriate now, when we are not moving away from direct provision, we should proceed with a note of caution about the standardisation of everything.  We do not have standardisation in our lives, but due to the USA's failure to realise properly the rights of those in the international protection system, we suddenly need such standards.  Where possible and appropriate, human beings need to live free to make decisions such as where and what to cook, and where and with whom to sleep.  When we start outlining standards, such as requiring that a room be a certain size, it begins to decide intimate aspects of people's lives, something I find uncomfortable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Thornton"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":771,"content":"<p>The right to work has arisen frequently and I am passionate about the issue.<\/p><p>We heard a story a couple of weeks ago from a family man, who said: \"All I want to do is work.  Just let me come home to my children and tell them I went to work today.  I do not even want payment.\"  He just wants to get up in the morning, do a day's work and come home to tell his children what he did.  It is for his own pride.  Many asylum seekers said they found the process very limited so far and difficult to access.  Dr. Thornton mentioned that applicants can work after nine months if no first-instance decision has been received.  As I understand it, nine months is the minimum standard allowed under the EU reception conditions directive but there is nothing stopping us setting this at, for example, six months.  Am I correct in saying that?  Will Dr. Thornton comment?<\/p><p> If we say the right to work is fundamental to human dignity and well-being, why is it only available to those without a first instance decision?  Surely if an appeals process is permitted, which can take time, those rightly awaiting an appeal should have just as much of a need to work, provide for their families and use their skills.  I also ask about the likelihood of legal action against the State.  Dr. Thornton's longer submission focuses on the various fundamental rights that are being denied by the system, such as privacy, autonomy and decision-making, as well as the rights of children.  Section D of the submission covers socio-economic rights, which are guaranteed by human rights instruments.  We have already seen a limited right to work extended as a result of legal challenge.  In Dr. Thornton's view, could we see further legal challenges on human rights grounds?  We have a long history in this country of warehousing people, looking back in horror and apologising, and then setting up costly redress schemes.

She is absolutely correct in identifying that Ireland only adopted the minimum standard or obligation with the nine-month period under international human rights law  Ireland may be before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in November or December this year.  With other European Union countries, that UN human rights treaty body has stated, six months may be a more appropriate minimum period.  As I emphasised in my full submission, perhaps we can go beyond that minimum human rights standard.  The EU reception directive does not comply with minimum human rights standards with regard to the delay in accessing work where a first-instance decision is not made.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely concur with the Senator's analysis that work is so fundamental to human dignity and well-being, perhaps we should consider the degree the people with a negative first-instance decision would be permitted to work while they await the outcome of their appeal before the International Protection Appeals Tribunal.  I will not go into the precise details contained in my longer submission but there has been interpretation given to the 2018 reception regulations.  It indicates that once people have waited nine months, regardless of whether this was before the 2018 regulations came into force and whether they got a negative decision afterwards and are be awaiting appeal, they should be permitted to work.  The decision maker for the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, when she was making a later decision, indicated that felt she had got that wrong so she resiled and stated that she did not want to continue with her incorrect interpretation of law which she might have applied.  A significant number of people are still awaiting appeal outcomes having waited for first-instance decisions for well over nine months but they cannot work.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the likelihood of legal action against the State, we have seen attempted legal action before in a case concerning applicants known as CA and TA.  One of the core arguments in the case was that the direct provision system was a violation of the right to private and family life under the Constitution and the European Convention of Human Rights Act 2003.  That case failed because Mr. Justice Colm Mac Eochaidh said the applicants, Ms CA and her child, TA, had not provided the requisite legal standard of proof to demonstrate that in the instance, their right to private and family life had been violated.  The honourable judge outlined his feeling that direct provision is an exceptionally alien environment for any sort of child to be reared in or even in which to go about one's normal life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Thornton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":774,"content":"<p>We made a number of recommendations on the right to work in our longer submission.  We absolutely agree with Dr. Thornton on introducing a grandfather clause in order to allow people who had been waiting nine months prior to the introduction of the regulations to work.  This would not be particularly difficult and it could even be done as a matter in an administrative scheme.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of practical difficulties.  For people with the right to work, that right is relatively broad in comparison with other jurisdictions.  For those who have the right, it is good, but there are some small limitations that make a difference.  Working in the legal clinics we get quite a few phone calls from employers because they do not understand the piece of paper that people have, as it is quite different from what other non-European Economic Area nationals would have.  They ring us for information.  There should be an information campaign run by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, perhaps, to educate employers about asylum seekers' right to work.  The permission is for six months but most employers do not want to invest in an employee for six months; one would not train somebody in a relatively high-skilled job for a six-month period.  If the permission lasted 12 months, it would definitely encourage employers.  We explained that the permission is renewable after six months but the six-month duration feels very limited.<\/p> <p>  There are also practical barriers regarding access to driving licences and bank accounts, and I know these have been mentioned in other hearings as well.  This demonstrates the need for multi-agency and multi-departmental involvement in issues relating to international protection applicants.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport could resolve the driving licence issue.  It was not a problem years ago and it is something that has happened over approximately the past two years.  Many people are living in relatively rural or very small urban settings and there is just no way for them to get to work.  They are living in settings that often have low levels of employment and they are very much limited in what they can access.  It needs to be resolved so people can enjoy the rights they have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Hurley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":775,"content":"<p>Will Ms Ward speak a little more about how children are institutionalised and the long-term impact on their mental health?  I again highlight the case of Sylva Tukula, which was absolutely horrifying.  It was devastating to hear what happened.  She died in direct provision and, as was mentioned, she was buried with no friends or loved ones present.  That is heartbreaking and the fact she was buried alone sums up the cruelty of the system and the indignity to which it gives rise.  This highlights a fundamental problem, which is that the direct provision system is a patchwork, with cracks all over the place with human beings slipping through them.  In this case four or five agencies were involved, including the Garda, the Department, the Reception and Integration Agency, the coroner and centre management but nobody really took responsibility.  It is not good enough to state that there was a breakdown in communication.  Are these types of gaps in the system common?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#J00400","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":776,"content":"<p>I will address the first part of that and then hand over to my colleague.  One of the big things for children living in the direct provision system is the effect of institutionalisation on them and their parents.  Children live through this.  One of the best official insights is the HIQA report of 2015, which considered the social work services that were being provided to people in direct provision.  What those whom compiled the report found was children who were hungry, who did not have enough clothes or who did not have access to toys or play facilities.  These are very basic things that are part of childhood and that are needed for development.  They found a lot of welfare issues.  The big issue that was coming through as impacting on children was the mental health of the parents.  Parents were living through years of a system where they were not cooking for themselves and were reliant on everyone else for everyday decisions without knowing what was going to happen in the future.  When I went around to those centres, I asked people about the child protection issues and the parents would say, \"I am the person my child is most at risk from.  I am breaking down.  I cannot take this any more.\"  The Child Care Law Reporting Project shows that there is a very significant number of cases.  They are over-represented in the numbers of children taken into care.  Children have been taken from parents whose mental health has broken down because of the direct provision system.<\/p> <p>  The other effects of institutionalisation that we see relate to how children are being treated by centre owners and managers.  In one centre, we might find children being treated very well and seeming to have a very good rapport with the people running the system.  In another centre, we could find that the children are completely institutionalised and tell us lots of different accounts of things.  In one instance, a child told me how they were in the kitchen in the catering facility and they saw the staff making smoothies in the kitchen.  The kids got really exciting thinking they were for them; they had never had a smoothie before.  The staff saw the kids and slammed the door.  The kids realised the smoothies were not for them, they were actually for the staff.  That was what was actually taking place.  We hear lots of accounts like that because the staff themselves are institutionalised.  They are subjecting the children to ill treatment and maladministration, essentially.  That is what is happening.<\/p> <p>  The other thing we see a lot is poverty.  Hunger was a massive thing.  Particularly in one centre in Athlone, the food was really appalling.  The children were in school until 3 p.m. or 4 p.m.  The parents had been given a bag of deep-fried food, spring rolls, white rice and so on.  It was inedible for the children by the time they came home from school.  That was not the case with all centres either.  It meant the children did not eat and because they were only on &euro;9.60 a week, the parents did not have any kind of supplementary income to buy other food for the children.  Obesity was also coming up because the kind of food that was being provided for children was so poor.<\/p> <p>  Children also talked to us about how ashamed they were to tell everyone they were living in direct provision.  They would avoid play dates.  If they were asked to go to a birthday party, they would say they were not available because they did not have the money to buy a birthday present.  Parents talked about having to make these really difficult choices, such as, \"I would love to send my kids to the local hurling club.  I know it is only &euro;2 or &euro;3 but the problem is I need to buy a bottle of Calpol.  How do I afford one over the other?\"  The increase in direct provision payments has been very important for those very basic things, so children can participate in everyday life.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that if we are going to mind children and give parents the best opportunity to be parents, they have to be cooking for their own families.  They have to have their own front doors.  The kind of things we were hearing included that a parent was not allowed leave a 14 year old in the main reception room.  Children were not allowed to be left on their own.  That is not good from a child development point of view.  Children need to grow.  They need to play on their own sometimes.  They need to be away from their parents, particularly as they get older and they want to become more independent.  It goes back to the need for own-door accommodation whereby children can have a normal childhood near communities and not in isolation, so they can mix in with Irish children and any other children and just have a normal childhood.<\/p> <p>  I want to return to the issue of unaccompanied minors that I mentioned earlier.  When I was on the working group, we met a lot of children.  \"Aged-out minors\" is the technical term.  I met one young guy who was about 19 and who had arrived in Ireland at the age of 12.  He had a Dublin accent.  I met him in Galway and saw him as another Dub.  He was really angry.  He was in this particular hostel where it is all men.  They eat together in the room while the security guard sits in a glass box.  The conditions are very prison-like.  What he was really angry about was that he had a family in Dublin and a life there.  He said that no one told him an application for protection had not been submitted for him.  He found out about it and then he got sent down there.  He said he had been ripped out of his community and the family he had in Dublin.  He asked why this happened, why no one told him in Tusla that this was going to happen to him.  There is a very particular legal issue pertaining to why that is happening.  I will pass over to my colleague, Ms Ahern, who has been coming across it through our legal advice service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":777,"content":"<p>We have known this was an issue through the members of our legal advice service.  They have been presenting us with anecdotal information about situations they hear of, particularly affecting young people who come into the system aged 16.  They are coming into the system as unaccompanied minors and there is no application put forward for them in the protection process.  We set up our legal information service last year and the issue has been cropping up.  I am hearing that young people have no knowledge that an application has to be made for them.  They have no knowledge of the implications.  It has key implications not only for what happens to them when they turn 18 but actually for their family reunification rights.  If an application is made when they are young, it is far easier for them to start applying for family reunification at that point as well.<\/p> <p>  What we are hearing suggests that there is not necessarily any devious motive behind it or anything.  People in authority are making a decision from the point of view of whether it will further harm the child but without considering what it will do the young person in the long term.  They might decide that they do not want a 16 year old to have to relive the experience but at 18 that young person is going to be put into direct provision.  We must ask if the system is fit for purpose if people are thinking it is going to further harm the child.  We need to look at child-friendly justice measures and different things that could be put in place to make sure that professionals do not have a fear of putting a 16 year old through an application process when it is in his or her best interest to get a status.  They system should be adapted so that this fear is not there.  We are going to continue to document this as part of our work.  We will track the trends but it is an issue that really needs to be highlighted.  It really does harm children who have no one else with them in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Julie Ahern"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I would add one more point on the mental health solution.  The research and best practice models from other countries are useful.  Some children in the refugee population will actually be very resilient and will not need any support, and some will be very damaged by what they have gone through.  It seems that in-school provision is best.  This means a psychologist is present within the school system.  The child can go and have sessions and get that kind of support.  We need to be thinking about what the school is doing in respect of a refugee child and what extra supports are set up.  Generally, when a special refugee mental health service is set up, it always gets defunded in recession times and the expertise is lost in the system.  We really need to equip the National Educational Psychological Service and the existing services to take on the needs of refugee children.  There is a significant gap.

What happened to Sylva Tukula was appalling.  It is emblematic of the institutionalised nature of direct provision.  It is that whole process of othering and the dehumanising impact that direct provision has.  Sadly, when Ms Tukula died, it just became a function.  There were certain procedures that had to be followed so they were going to follow them without ever thinking that she might have a family.  Family is much broader than having immediate next of kin.  That is a direct result of institutionalisation and how we treat protection applicants.<\/p> <p>  On the patchwork nature of the system, I agree with the Senator.  There are a lot of services available in direct provision and there are a lot of agencies involved in the provision of reception.  What is required is oversight, like a refugee advisory body.  It was recommended in McMahon and was also in the original Refugee Act 1996.  The idea is that there would be some level of oversight and co-ordination.<\/p><p>If we go from centre to centre, we see that Tusla is very active in a particular area and the services provided for children are very good but those services do not exist somewhere else.

It might be because of welfare or because they are concerned about the nature of the protection process and do not want to put the child through it.

When the issue arose in the working group, many of the NGOs in the group wanted to obligate the HSE to seek legal advice, but this got watered down in the International Protection Act.

Dr. Muireann N&iacute; Raghallaigh of University College Dublin, in a number of studies dating back to 2013, has pointed out what we are providing.  We have to recognise that, for those who are separated children under 18, Ireland has probably one of the best systems, certainly in Europe if not the world.  It is all about building resilience, independence and capacity.  As Dr. N&iacute; Raghallaigh has noted, once they turn 18, we tell them to go live in an institution where their meals are provided and they are given a few bob for themselves for the week.  The early part of their entry into Ireland is one where there is some form of wraparound care and then, when they are 18, they go into a hostel where every single decision possible is taken away from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Thornton"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":806,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Thornton.

We have had this debate over recent weeks, including with Mr. Justice McMahon.  While there may be points to incremental improvements, fundamentally direct provision is a bad system that continues to fail people's human rights.  I believe that not only has it lost the confidence of those in the system who have to suffer it, it has also lost the confidence of the public.<\/p> <p>  Even aside from the multiple human rights issues that exist in respect of it, it has been very bad value for money as well.  I have instanced that it has cost the taxpayer &euro;12.5 billion since 2001.  To house, if we want to call it that, a parent with two children costs &euro;40,000 a year through the direct provision system.  Much better and more private accommodation with greater dignity could be provided at much less cost than that.  From every perspective, the direct provision system is in urgent need of replacement.  What has been outlined is very much in accordance with my own views in terms of an integrated housing approach.  I advocated such an approach with the Minister in December last.  Even in response to Deputy O'Callaghan's points in terms of justice in housing, it is like any of these matters in that there has to be an intersection.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government cannot be expected to be responsible for making a determination on a person's application for international protection, but in so much as the person is to be provided with accommodation where that is needed immediately, there needs to be a housing approach to that.  Certain approved housing bodies can have a role in that.  I believe the private for-profit model that has underpinned this has been a significant problem.  The Children's Rights Alliance has dwelt a fair bit on this.  Is Dr. Thornton in agreement with that kind of approach that involves either approved housing bodies or some form of initiative led by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or by public housing?  Is that roughly what Dr. Thornton thinks?  I note there are many other issues relating to direct provision but I ask only in terms of bed and board accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#M00500","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":808,"content":"<p>I am not a housing specialist.

Housing needs may be catered for either through - not that there is much - local authority housing or rent allowance, now the housing assistance payment.  I have issues with supports provided to asylum applicants not being mainstreamed.  A significant number of Departments are engaged with various issues, from the Department of Health to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to, obviously, the Department of Justice and Equality in the determination of claims.  Is there a need for absolutely and wholly separated systems while acknowledging there may be a much greater need for engagement and holistic supports for a small number of applicants?  From my limited lens from which I can offer advice to the committee on law, how in law we deal with those who may not have enough income?  We provide payment from social protection.  How do we deal with those who have homelessness imposed upon them or who have to access housing payment supports?  We have housing social protection.  For healthcare, there is the Department of Health.  For child needs, there is the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  My approach is that we have systems in place.

It follows on from a previous point.  Applying for the mainstream system and having specific accommodation for people who are applying for international protection are not mutually exclusive.  The way the system is at present, unfortunately, for the entire population, a single applicant for housing would be in line for 11 or 12 years on a local authority housing list, particularly in the cities.  What makes sense to me is that a person would have own-door accommodation of a standard provided immediately but that he or she would be entitled to apply for local authority housing and, assuming the person could find it, which is difficult at present, he or she could apply for HAP just the same, but that that person would have that minimum standard to be able to work from.

There was a situation, as the Deputy will be aware, with a number of young people at Calais.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla travelled there and offered full refugee protection, full services, accommodation etc., and only a small number of young people opted to come to Ireland.<\/p><p>That is really interesting but it also reflects what we know, namely, that people want to go to a country where they have family members.

We are always told that if we make the direct provision system too good, everyone will want to come here and it will be a pull factor.  The research does not tell us that.  It tells us again and again that people go to a particular country either because a trafficker takes them there and they have no idea where they are going or they have family members there.<\/p><p> There are a small number of unaccompanied minors in the country and the system of reception for them is quite good.

The question is whether responsibility for vulnerability assessment lies squarely with the Department of Justice and Equality or with the Department of Health.  It is somewhere in between.  A vulnerability assessment goes beyond a health screening.  Our sense is that this is a health issue but additional funding has to be provided to the HSE to deliver on the vulnerability assessment.<\/p> <p>  The other key point is that the vulnerability assessment is not just a once-off assessment.  It is not merely a case of someone having an initial assessment on arrival in Balseskin in which the authorities identify whether he or she has special reception needs.  Those special reception needs must be provided.  The authorities may assess someone and conclude he or she is not suitable to reside in a direct provision centre and that alternative accommodation must be provided.  Further to that, however, the vulnerability assessment must be ongoing.  Trauma may emerge six or eight months after people arrive in the country.  There must be sufficient services to detect and respond to that.<\/p> <p>  The standards provide a very good pathway for the delivery of the vulnerability assessment in all the centres on an ongoing basis.

The location of some of the direct provision centres has been touched upon.

Minimum standards must be an interim measure preceding the replacement of the entire direct provision system, although standards certainly have role.  That is my personal view but perhaps the witnesses have a view on the matter.  I imagine that when standards come into force a large number of direct provision centres will fall very far short of them.  What will happen then?  Is it possible that direct provision centres will be closed?  Will people be placed in emergency accommodation?  That thought occurs to me.  The number of asylum seekers in emergency accommodation is already high.  According to a reply I received to a parliamentary question, the figure is approximately 600.

There is no doubt that needs to happen.  The solution is that, first, the State should start developing a national housing policy for people seeking protection.  One of the key powers in the gift of the State is that it can start building.  There are great examples of accommodation provision, not necessarily in the refugee space but in other areas of provision such as for people with disabilities.  The State could build solid and sustainable accommodation which could be handed over to other people with a housing need in a particular area if it is not being used by people seeking protection.  There are many areas where that kind of housing and accommodation could be provided.<\/p> <p>  The second step, as Ms Finn stated, is to bring in not-for-profit housing providers.  All the research shows that when they provide housing it is pretty good and the outcomes are good for the people with whom they are working.  If the State made more money available to the approved housing providers they would be more likely to pitch for this type of accommodation.  There are many such providers.  If given resources and support, even for-profit providers in the disability space could produce own-door accommodation.  They could use the pepper pot model and have care providers on the staff.  This is not an insurmountable problem.  It is possible to do this.<\/p> <p>  The three elements involved are to launch a building programme, place tenders for not-for-profit providers to develop pepper pot type accommodation and then have providers lease housing and accommodation around the country where it is available.  This is possible because we know there are many vacant properties around the country.  The Government must make sure people are provided with the right services and support.  The solutions are all there.  There are plenty of housing providers and practitioners who will be happy to advise the Reception and Integration Agency.  The Government just needs to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#NN00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":818,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raised a question on standards.

Inspection and the ability to have oversight of what is happening in centres were raised.  When the State approves the optional protocol to the convention against torture, will it improve oversight at direct provision centres and all sorts of other locations?<\/p> <p>  When considering the structure and accommodation, do we need to address the culture in some of the institutions?  I believe the culture played a big part in what happened with Sylva Tukula.  I was on the radio about this matter and referred to the contrast with the case of Sean Parker, who was in London.  The local authority there went the extra mile to find somebody in Galway who would be able to give Sean a fitting, dignified burial and to ensure he would be properly remembered.  Nobody went the extra mile in the case of Sylva Tukula.  People can say they were not notified and that nobody told them.  Nobody went the extra mile or inch in that instance.  That, to me, speaks of a culture that extends not only to the RIA but also to the INIS.  The latter is excessively adversarial at times.  One of the most incredible sentences I read in my life was in a report to this committee referring to some of the witnesses who attended and some of the determinations made by INIS.  A determination refusing family reunification questioned the degree of destruction in Syria, saying it was noted that central Damascus had been relatively unscathed by the war in Syria.  I remember reading that and thinking it was just incredible.  Is there a cultural element in the INIS and RIA?  There are many good staff in those organisations doing their best for those fleeing conflict and seeking a better life here but is there an excessively adversarial attitude to applicants seeking international protection?

I recall documents obtained in a freedom of information request in 2008 that refer to a man who had a child with a woman and whose child was considered Irish because the woman was Irish.  The man was in a direct provision centre and he asked whether he could be moved to a direct provision centre closer to his girlfriend and child.  The case was referred to in the body of the email as another brain-teaser on direct provision.  The response was that there was no obligation on the man to remain in direct provision and that it was not the Department's business if he wanted to live near the mother and child, the implication being that he may have had access to his own funds.  That is just one example.  There are more recent examples.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection started to plan for the increases in the direct provision allowance around July of last year.  Quite wisely, it did not inform the Department of Justice and Equality until about 25 September 2018.  An official in the Department of Justice and Equality who was asked to offer a comment or express views began by saying, \"They are all working anyway.\"  These are two of many unfortunate examples I have and will, due to the 20th anniversary of the system of direct provision, be making available towards the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Thornton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I wish to build on Dr. Thornton's point on the cultural aspect.  Partially the issue is because the Department of Justice and Equality controls all the aspects of the life of somebody in international protection, for better or worse.  Its remit is to uphold the security of the State and engage in border control.  That is its mindset rather than one based on human care or a compassionate approach.<\/p> <p>  With regard to moving the accommodation to the housing providers, there are many reasons why that is so important.  Those coming through our clinics and talking to us are aware their accommodation is provided by the Department of Justice and Equality, the same body that is considering their asylum applications.  No matter how many pieces of paper reassure them the two things are separate and that if they make a complaint about one, it will not have an impact on the other, they are not reassured.  Having the Department in charge of all that is very problematic because there are so many areas of control.<\/p> <p>  Disbelief was mentioned.  The Deputy quoted a document referring to Damascus.  I have come across several visa letters with a similar response.  In at least one of the cases, the person was not living in central Damascus, but in the suburbs.  This is something we come across.  Applications such as those Dr. Thornton talked about, for example, the application of someone in direct provision who wanted to move to be closer to family, are routinely refused.  Again, this is because cases are being considered from an immigration and control point of view.

We are talking about a very exceptional set of circumstances in Irish political life in which one organisation was not subject to any scrutiny by any public body.  This is the kind of stuff that happens ultimately.  Organisational cultures set in.  Moreover, institutionalisation is a factor.  The staff in the system become institutionalised and embedded, and committed to the system.  Bearing in mind the findings in the Ryan report and other institutional abuse reports, people working within a system really buy into it, try to reproduce it and hold on to it.  Obviously, change is important within this space.<\/p> <p>  The other thing we came across when we were on the working group was the notion of care.  There was a nearly constant battle.  It was said that the Department does not do care, just accommodation.  One would not get that if one worked in other areas or other Departments because there is an understanding that there is a vulnerable population requiring care.  The change to the national standards is acceptance that care is now part of what should be offered.  That is why we are keen to have the changes implemented as soon as possible.  Whoever provides the service will have to have a care component and social care workers on site who can deal with people's needs.<\/p> <p>  Establishing HIQA's role will be key.  Where HIQA carries out unannounced inspections, it absolutely does change practice.  HIQA involvement is not expensive.  We were trying to work out how much it would cost and went to HIQA to find out.  When it had about 4,000 in the system, it said it would involve four inspectors and two administrators.  This pointed to a cost much cheaper than we thought.  All that would be needed, therefore, is a change to the health Act to give HIQA a role in this area.  It has already dealt with accommodation for vulnerable people.  It could take this on.  It has already been involved in cluster-type accommodation and independent living.  It has the expertise.  It is very simple to do.  If we give the providers a grandfather period, there should be no reason what I propose could not be implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":825,"content":"<p>I have what I hope is a very succinct question to round off.

It was a very good model because there was accountability for decision makers.  The board was to meet four times a year.  We were looking at the advisory board.  Given the fact that there are a number of other agencies involved in the delivery of direct provision, including Tusla to deal with issues arising specifically around children as well as bodies dealing with LGBTQ issues, we may be looking at broadening that advisory board with reference to something like the model of the working group.  For all its faults and failings, the working group worked very well as a cross-departmental body.  A board might meet quarterly with reports being provided by each relevant Department on progress and issues arising and that information might then be made public.  There is a very strong case to be made for looking in particular at the actual protection process for determinations whereby the model set out in the 1996 Act is followed to provide a biannual report to be laid before the Oireachtas.

The United Kingdom's departure date of 29 March 2019 was extended to 12 April and then 31 October.  As a result of Theresa May's resignation as leader of the Conservative Party on 7 June, there will probably be a new UK Prime Minister towards the end of July.  We are also facing the prospect of a hard Brexit, that is, a Brexit without a withdrawal agreement.  Numerous experts agree on the impact of a hard Brexit on the Border region, the North and North-South trade, but politics is the art of the possible.  The committee is preparing a report on Brexit and the Border and the impact on rural communities.  We have heard from many people on both sides of the Border.  We are delighted to hear from the delegates who are outlining a way forward.

With the Chairman's agreement, I will begin by offering a brief overview of the Centre for Cross Border Studies and the project before handing over to Ms Farrell from Longford Women's Link and then Mr. Campbell from the Rural Community Network who will tell the committee a little bit about their organisations and their involvement in the project.  Before I do so, I draw the committee's attention to the New Common Charter for Co-operation Within and Between these Islands which will ultimately be the focus of our conversation today and future conversations and in which rural concerns are particularly evident.  <\/p> <p>  Since its creation in 1999, shortly after the signing of the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement, the Centre for Cross Border Studies has sought to contribute to increased social, economic and territorial cohesion of the island of Ireland by promoting and improving the quality of cross-Border co-operation.  The centre&rsquo;s pursuit of its mission has been framed by two primary public policy imperatives: the European Union&rsquo;s cohesion policy and strand 2 of the Good Friday Agreement.  Throughout its existence, therefore, the centre has been deeply concerned with community, social and economic development and co-operation, particularly on the island of Ireland but also between the island of Ireland, Great Britain and beyond.  From the beginning this concern informed the desire to initiate the Towards a New Common Chapter project which began in late 2014 and has been made possible by the generous support of the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s reconciliation fund.  The project has looked to support and inspire grassroots community commitment to cross-Border co-operation in all of its dimensions, including co-operation at the Border, where rurality is a predominant characteristic; wider North-South co-operation on the island of Ireland; and east-west co-operation between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.  It has worked towards having a bottom-up vision of the importance and role of cross-Border co-operation within and between these islands, while also noting the need for community groups to possess the necessary skills and capacity not only to engage in their own cross-Border initiatives but also to enter into more productive dialogue with relevant local, regional and central Government policies and strategies that may affect them.<\/p> <p>  The New Common Charter for Co-operation Within and Between these Islands which members should have before them is the result of a series of intensive conversations between a range of community groups from Northern Ireland and Ireland and, more recently, with groups from England, Scotland and Wales.  The new common charter represents a shared desire to maintain and strengthen relations between communities across these islands, to work together on issues of common concern and to advocate for the provision of the requisite structures and means to co-operate within and between these islands in whatever circumstances may arise.  The Chairman has alluded to the circumstances that may potentially arise in the political dimension.<\/p><p>In light of this committee&rsquo;s specific interests, and given that the sets of relations envisioned within the New Common Charter for Co-operation Within and Between these Islands are both the product of and supportive of rural communities, we ask members to support it.  We ask them to work with us in ensuring all administrations across these islands put in place policies and funding structures to encourage cross-Border and cross-jurisdictional co-operation at grassroots community level.  We hope that today&rsquo;s meeting will offer an opportunity to discuss in greater detail the work undertaken as part of the project, and how members of this committee and political representatives more generally can champion the objectives of the new common charter for co-operation.<\/p><p> These are outlined in more detail in the series of recommendations within the supporting information provided to the committee.  Those objectives include how capacity-building measures should be introduced to improve how all levels of government and public bodies across these islands engage with community organisations in the development of policies and strategies with a cross-Border or cross-jurisdictional dimension and that such policies and strategies should be rural-proofed.  The charter also calls for a comprehensive assessment of the current funding landscape for cross-Border and cross-jurisdictional co-operation initiatives aimed at community organisations and what that landscape should look like in future.  Crucially, we would also like to see concrete support in advancing the work undertaken in the Towards a New Common Chapter project, bringing it to a wider audience.  It might also, perhaps, look towards a platform for cross-Border, cross-jurisdictional dialogue for community organisations that recalls the structure provided for governments and administrations across these islands through bodies such as the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.  These are issues that we may explore further during today&rsquo;s meeting, but I will hand over now to Tara Farrell of Longford Women&rsquo;s Link.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019061200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony Soares","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":844,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to present today.  I will start with just a few words about Longford's Women's Link.  We are a social enterprise founded in 1995.  We provide services to about 900 women and 130 children in Longford annually.  Those services include education, childcare, entrepreneurship, community employment and domestic violence support.  We do this via our unique model of integrated service delivery.  We engage in widespread regional and national advocacy.  Our chief executive officer is on the board of the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, while I sit on the board of Irish Rural Link.  I am also the current chair of AONTAS, the national adult learning organisation, and I sit on the steering group of The Next Chapter project, an initiative of Irish Rural Link and Politics Plus based in Stormont.<\/p> <p>  One of our flagship programmes at Longford Women's Link, the Women&rsquo;s Manifesto Programme, is a unique model of local democratic engagement which aims to support women in Longford and other counties to play an active and meaningful role in their local decision-making structures.  Just last month we launched the See Her Elected, SHE, project with 50:50 North West, supported by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The project aims to change the face of local government in rural Ireland and support women to play an active role in public life.  The Women&rsquo;s Manifesto Programme was supported by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust from 2012 until the cessation of the trust&rsquo;s operations in the Republic of Ireland in 2016.<\/p> <p>  Longford Women&rsquo;s Link and the Women&rsquo;s Manifesto Programme have been active members of the Towards a New Common Charter initiative since 2015 and see it as a key all-island programme of sustained engagement as we move beyond the Brexit referendum outcome.  We believe that working at the grassroots level, as this programme most definitely does, is critical if we are to see meaningful co-operation and community development alongside an empowered civic society across these islands.  We are already involved in a cross-Border project with WOMEN'STEC in Belfast, and our first cross-Border conference takes place in Monaghan later this month.<\/p> <p>  We have seen with Brexit what happens when civil society is largely excluded from central discussions.   Whatever happens with Brexit, we believe that the voices of grassroots women, especially in rural areas, not only need to be heard but are essential in building inclusive and resilient communities.  There is significant potential within the new common charter to do this.  If we want an effective democratic society that embodies the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement with active and engaged citizens and communities, then we need, first, support for the new common charter and, second, support for civil society organisations.  That means financial support from all the administrations.  We believe, however, that that is an investment in our communities and in the future of these islands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019061200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members very much for inviting us here today.  I will say a little about Rural Community Network, RCN, and what we do, and then I will move on to give some information about the new common charter.  RCN is a regional voluntary organisation established by community groups from rural areas in 1991 to articulate the voice of rural communities on issues relating to poverty, disadvantage and equality.  RCN is a membership organisation with 250 member groups across Northern Ireland, and we adopt a community development approach to our work.  We employ a team of staff with a broad spectrum of skills.<\/p> <p>  Our vision is of vibrant, articulate, inclusive and sustainable rural communities across Northern Ireland which contribute to a prosperous, equitable, peaceful and stable society.  Our mission is to provide an effective voice for and support to rural communities, particularly those who are most disadvantaged.  RCN&rsquo;s work is focused on three broad areas.  These are supporting and developing good practice among rural community groups, articulating the voice of rural communities and promoting reconciliation.  More detail on our work and some of our projects can be found in our written submission.  RCN supports the new common charter and we have been involved over the past year in trying to promote it.  The charter provides a framework to encourage co-operation among civic society groups on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.<\/p> <p>  Many of the challenges rural communities face are similar.  RCN has a long tradition of partnering with like-minded NGOs in Britain, Ireland and further afield.  We delivered the Rural Enabler project in partnership with Irish Rural Link, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in the North and the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in the Republic of Ireland.  This was a PEACE III funded project based in Northern Ireland and the six Border counties of the Republic of Ireland.  We are completing a project with partner networks in the UK and Ireland to develop key asks for future rural development policy post Brexit.  We know and value the importance of engaging with partner organisations across the UK and Ireland and further afield.  We hope to continue to develop and deepen these links in the future, post Brexit, and we believe that the new common charter will support us in doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019061200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

This is one of the big issues facing us where I live in rural County Leitrim.  We are next to the Border with Fermanagh and we are very conscious of the potential of Brexit to heighten the difficulties that already exist for many people living in rural communities.  It can be seen from travelling around the Border region that much of it is rural.  There are some middling-sized towns such as Enniskillen or Monaghan town, but mostly we are talking about vast rural areas.  I take issue sometimes with statements being made that suggest that people in rural areas are disadvantaged.  I would rather call them under-resourced.  This is really an issue of resources and about having people living in a part of the world where they have a tremendous quality of life compared with what we call the really developed parts of the country.  The major concern is about being able to ensure that the people who live in those areas have access to the required employment and services.  That issue centres on resources and how to get those resources in place.  The work that the witnesses have spoken of today is about drawing attention to that and seeing where and how we can put the required resources in place that will produce the maximum impact.<\/p> <p>  Nobody knows what the outcome of Brexit is going to be.  We are, however, just measuring how negative that impact will be.  There is nothing to talk about on the positive side at all.  Everything focuses on the degrees of negativity that may be reached.  One of the key things we need to be considering, and this committee may have a role to play in this, is to explore mechanisms of working with community organisations across the region to leverage funding to get those resources in place where they are most needed.  While Brexit is about Britain, the North, which voted to remain, is being forced to leave as well, and I think the European Union has a responsibility in that regard.  We need to work with every agency we possibly can to put as much pressure as possible on the European Union to meet its responsibility to put the resources in place to assist with what is going to be a transitional period.  That support will be necessary until we get to a stage where some common sense comes back into play.<\/p> <p>  We all know that whether Britain leaves with a deal now or in six months, there will have to be an arrangement at some stage.  It is ridiculous for anyone to imagine that a country the size of Britain would leave the EU and then never have a trade deal with its neighbours.<\/p><p>That arrangement is going to happen.  If it does not happen in the next six months or a year, it will happen in the next few years.  Between now and then, we need to have the funding mechanisms in place to protect communities in the Border region in particular.<\/p><p> There are also the issues in regard to rural Ireland more widely and how we can assist in making rural Ireland a place where more people want to live or are able to live.  One of the projects we have been looking at seeks to enable people to work remotely for big companies while living in rural areas.  We want to enable the infrastructure that is required for that, in particular the infrastructure around communications, but also to ensure adequate health services, education systems and so on are in place so people can access them wherever they live, in any part of the country and regardless of what jurisdiction they are in.<\/p><p> I very much welcome the work that has been done.  I have read through the new common charter for co-operation.  We are talking about putting in place a structure that will be fit for purpose.  One of the problems we have had is that there have been a lot of itty-bitty structures, as it were, all over the place and they have not been co-ordinated properly.  If we can try to do that, and this committee will be up for that challenge and will assist in any way we can to make it happen, we can go with a number of clear asks in regard to what will make a difference and move the position forward.

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  I recognise the work they have done, which is very important.  It is more important now than ever, given the challenges we have heard about in regard to the onset of Brexit.  I have no doubt that existing relationships and partnerships will be tested.  There is a concern that Brexit will bring a great deal of uncertainty as to where all this will end up and how it will impact on our communities.  Even when talking about the Border, it brings uncertainty all round.<\/p> <p>  We need fundamental flagship projects like the common charter that we can latch onto and build on to build collaboration into the future.  We need to be careful that a lot of the good work that has been done in building partnership and collaboration over the years is not undone, and there is certainly a threat to that with the onset of Brexit.  It behoves all of us, whether policymakers or those working in the field, to try to find new ways to strengthen these partnerships, which is what the groups represented today are trying to do.<\/p> <p>  As policymakers, we have an obligation to identify what supports these groups need in their work.  Like Deputy Kenny, I believe this committee can be of some help.  If new areas of partnership or collaboration can be identified that need resources, support or recognition, we need to understand where they are and how we can support them.  Basic community work and starting from the grassroots is preferable, and the best way to work is from the ground up because that is where people are committed.  We have had various voluntary groups before the committee that work with rural communities, and we find the biggest problem nowadays is with volunteerism and people having the time to commit to projects.  I am sure the witnesses have experience of that in their fieldwork.  It is often left to the few.  They are very committed but they are left to paddle the canoes on their own, essentially.  We need to find new ways to involve younger people, to support people who are already involved in projects, to excite them about this, and to show them the benefits of joint partnerships with other communities.<\/p> <p>  I come from County Waterford and my wife comes from County Down, so I am very aware of a lot of the social integrations that happen.  I am a member of the GAA, for example, and I know a lot of clubs from both communities travel up and down, North and South.  That can happen in other communities as well, and whether it is a hockey club or a GAA club, it does not matter to me.  I would like to see more involvement.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kenny is from a more northerly county and many of the partnerships I see happening are in the Border regions, which is understandable.  However, there are people in the southern counties who would also be interested.  For example, I come from a place called Portlaw, an old cotton mill, Quaker town, built by the Malcomsons, which was a planned social village.  I am aware there are such places in Northern Ireland, such as Bessbrook.  There might be social histories there that we can connect, finding new ways of identifying each other's history and culture, and building relationships and partnerships.  There is a lot that can be done in those areas and I would be interested to see how we can help.<\/p> <p>  Ms Farrell mentioned support and resources, which we always hear.  Is there a targeted programme of work outlining where there are resources that match?  If there are deficits of resources and supports, we would like to hear where they might be so we might be able to assist into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019061200002#D00200","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I, too, recognise the work of all the organisations represented.  What is the long-term vision for the new common charter, if there is one, and what are the next steps in its development?  I agree with my colleagues that it is very important the grassroots would be involved.  This is particularly the case in regard to the impact on rural communities, whether in the Border region or elsewhere.  We can foresee the impact Brexit will have there.  We do not want to go back to that vision of the past, which is what Brexit represents to me.  Any policies or collaboration of community groups and grassroots organisations must be listened to.  State organisations, whether north or south of the Border, should be working in collaboration with groups such as those represented here today, and listened to and engaged with.

I will start with the question on the long-term vision for the charter and the next steps.  This relates back to some of the comments made by Deputy Kenny at the outset, where he noted there has to be some sort of arrangement in terms of where we are going with Brexit.  I agree with that.  However, it is vital that, whatever the arrangement is, that arrangement listens to and is shaped by communities on the ground, North and South, east and west, and that we are all involved in coming to whatever the arrangement is.  Otherwise, we will end up with a structure that is not fit for purpose and end up with remedies that are short-term and do not address the needs of communities.  It is vital that, as we move forward, we listen to communities, North and South, close to the Border and away from the Border.<\/p> <p>  In all sorts of sectors, community organisations are already involved in conversations.  The Rural Community Network is involved in conversations in co-operation with similar organisations in England, Wales, Scotland and here in the Republic of Ireland.  It is supporting them and allowing those conversations and that co-operation to continue.  It would be tragic if we were to lose that connectivity and that dialogue.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kenny also mentioned that the European Union has a responsibility in terms of what happens here.  The EU has already made a commitment that it wants to support the Republic of Ireland, in particular, but the island of Ireland as a whole in how it deals with Brexit and how it moves forward.  The Irish Government has also made a similar commitment but we are waiting for one important partner, which is the UK Government, to show its commitment.  It is a commitment that needs to be made because the UK is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, which represents the totality of relations within and between these islands.  The UK Government must live up to that commitment.<\/p> <p>  That returns us to the question of what are the next steps for the common charter.  We want to scale this up, involve more organisations and involve more administrations.  We are in conversations with political representatives from Scotland, Wales and England, and, obviously, although it is a bit more difficult at the moment as there is no Executive or Assembly, with political representatives in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>I hope that will resolve itself.<\/p><p> We also want to highlight the fact this is not just about the Good Friday Agreement.  Relations are not just about those between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland or between Ireland and the UK as a whole or the UK Government.  Scotland and Wales are part of the Good Friday Agreement and strand three binds us all together.  The administrations there also have a responsibility to ensure their communities in Scotland and Wales are given the opportunities, structures and funding to continue these vital relationships in and between these islands.  The next step in the terms of the charter is to ensure those conversations lead to a point whereby a proper structure is in place that is fit for purpose and encourages relations between community groups throughout these islands so they continue their dialogue and co-operate and exploit opportunities.  A potential tragedy is that we will miss out on existing connections to exploit opportunities just because of administrative obstacles or the structures not being there to enable us to exploit those opportunities.  That is where we are going with a common charter.  We want to ensure administrations throughout the islands put in place the structures community groups need to continue the work many of us already do in terms of co-operation at the Border, wider co-operation on an all-island basis, North and South, and co-operation east and west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019061200002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony Soares","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":853,"content":"<p>To follow Dr. Soares's point, from our perspective as a grassroots organisation there has not been any other space of this nature.  When we speak about structures that are fit for purpose, bearing in mind the project started in 2014 and we have been involved since 2015, our concern is if we do not continue to facilitate this grassroots dialogue and all-island co-operation and co-operation between these islands, we will not have an understanding of the issues we all face on these islands.  There is a huge opportunity and we are working at various levels.  We took part in a Northern Ireland European Women's Platform, NIEWP, discussion with the five nations on the economic impact of Brexit for women.  It covered a wide range of issues that perhaps do not always make headlines every day, for example, the issue of domestic violence and barring orders in jurisdictions for women living in Border areas.  This is very important.  We became involved in this because we could see the necessity for it.  At the time, we felt the idea of grassroots co-operation was not necessarily a priority for many of the administrations.  Our participation was driven by these concerns.  To echo Dr. Soares's point on the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish Government is a co-guarantor of it.  While the economic dialogue is absolutely critical, we also have to focus on grassroots communities and the issues they will face whatever happens as a result of Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019061200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":854,"content":"<p>To add what Ms Farrell and Dr. Soares have already said, and to pick up on a couple of points made by Deputy Martin Kenny and Senator Coffey, much of the networking and work we have done with rural partner organisations in the South and in Britain has come from personal contact.  We know individuals in rural networks in England to whom we can lift the phone and speak to about certain issues.  We are a networking organisation.  We employ six staff, which is not a big team.  A total of 90% of our 250 member groups are volunteer-based and do not necessarily have these networks.  If they are working on issues, whether local economic development, women's issues, youth issues or environmental issues, they are not necessarily as networked as organisations that can employ staff.  It is very important that we start to think about how we could be more systematic in ensuring groups have these networks and know who to contact.  The common charter is a way to facilitate this.  If we can get administrations throughout these islands to start promoting it more, and to think about how we promote it more and embed it more, there would be huge power in it to deal with some of the issues Deputy Martin Kenny spoke about with regard to remote working, and how we build sustainable economic development in rural communities.  Looking at what is coming down the line with regard to climate crisis, how do we reduce the number of people in rural areas having to jump in their cars to do a two-hour commute into urban centres to get work?  These are huge issues and there is huge potential.  Our board members were at the Grow Remote conference held in Tubbercurry in Sligo last month.  They see huge potential in trying to extend that model into rural communities in the North.  These are the types of issues that we deal with in rural Northern Ireland.  They are very similar to what is being dealt with here.  That is how the common charter can help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019061200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":855,"content":"<p>Education and tourism are highlighted in the charter.  It has always struck me that in the past 20 years, the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process did something on this island that has not happened in many countries throughout the world.  Some of the peace process was a high-wire act between political parties but an awful lot of it was done on the ground between communities involving people who had not spoken to one another about difficult issues.  They may have met at the mart and spoken about the price of cattle or they may have met somewhere and shared scones but they never spoke about the issues that were affecting their lives.  They began to talk about those issues and this had an impact on the peace process.  This is something we missed.  Throughout the world we have conflict.  We speak about climate change.  If we could end all the wars in the world the problem of climate change would be pretty quickly resolved because an awful lot of it flows from conflict and the inability of governments or structures to be able to work together properly.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, we have an example of how divided communities and societies found a way of working with one another on a way forward.  There is an opportunity in this, from a educational tourism point of view, to bring people to meet these communities, speak to them, share experiences and build a knowledge base among people in the community sector throughout all of the island.<\/p> <p>  Senator Coffey mentioned a Quaker village.  Many of the towns and villages in the country go back 400 or 500 years.  They were the consequence and outflow of plantations and other events that happened.  We are all both victims and products of our histories.  Anywhere in the world the history of people is similar.  It is all about power imbalances and economic imbalances.  We have the history of these imbalances and their impact on the future.  The potential of what we have in Ireland has never been properly realised, in respect of bringing people from all over the world to learn, understand and build on the huge effort made.  The consequence of that effort has never been fully examined.  Some universities have done work and people have come to do studies but that is also a high-wire act.  Getting into communities where the real action happens has the potential to bring different types of tourism and education.  This could be part of it.<\/p> <p>  When I read through the charter, I was interested that two of the issues mentioned were tourism and education.  The idea other countries could learn from Ireland is a no-brainer.  Everyone can see it.  Throughout the world we see political conflict and ideas coming to the fore that are about resentment and one-upmanship rather than the type of co-operation we have managed to develop here.  Not only would it be good for people to come here, it would also be good to sustain and bed down the process we have had for the past 20 years.  Some people speak about the peace process as if it were something that is finished.  It is far from it.  It is a work in progress and it requires continued evaluation, work and resources.  Particularly, it requires continued effort from all of the parties involved to ensure that we bring it to its conclusion.<\/p><p>One way of doing it might be to invite others from outside and develop tourism and education projects around it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019061200002#E00400","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":857,"content":"<p>Following on from Deputy Martin Kenny's observations, we should recognise the achievements in North-South and east-west collaborations.  The Good Friday Agreement was a significant achievement for this island.  It must be continuously protected and worked on to support it.  As Dr. Soares noted, strand 3 and the commitments contained therein were voted on by the people living on the island.  We must recognise that achievement.  However, there is a fear that some of that work could be unwound.  <\/p> <p>  Other things we have achieved include accessing funding through the EU Cohesion Funds under the INTERREG programme.  In the south-east region there was collaboration with Wales to access INTERREG funding in education and other areas.  My concern which I have raised here previously relates to what the future holds and might replace these supports which have been hugely valuable to rural communities.  Education and renewable energy projects, as well as other initiatives, have benefited, both in Wales and the region from which I come.  I am sure the position is the same in the North of Ireland and elsewhere in the South.  As Dr. Soares rightly pointed out, the European Union has a responsibility to continue to provide support for the regions, including rural communities on the island of Ireland, as well as in Wales and Scotland and similar places mentioned by him.  Looking at the successes of funding programmes such as the INTERREG programme, what can we access or where can we go to access similar programmes?  The European Commission and other organisations have a role to play in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Campbell made a good point about networking.  Strong and successful networking was down to strong individuals who knew where to go.  Mr. Campbell is correct in saying we need to be more systematic in that regard.  We cannot just depend on individuals.  In time we could lose some of these good individuals and then what would happen?  Would the network be lost or break down?  We need to tap into new ways to systematically build networks in order that no matter who comes into an organisation, the network will be in place or there will be an axis with which they can identify.  It is already working.  As Mr. Campbell spoke, I recalled how two or three years ago individuals from rural development groups across Northern Ireland visited the LEADER group in Waterford to discuss rural development programmes.  I was invited to meet them.  They shared information, for instance, from a small start-up business in rural Ireland which was making yogurts and cheese.  It struck me that there were more links than we recognised.  That is one example I came across and I hope it will continue.  There are also women's groups North and South, east and west, and opportunities to tap into them.  Farm organisations such as Macra na F&eacute;irme could share their experiences with similar organisations in other regions.  There are structures in place.  We just need to identity them and connect with them systematically.  Energy will come from them in building new partnerships.  Therefore, I am hopeful for the future, although there are great challenges.<\/p> <p>  What level of commitment have the delegates experienced in terms of political engagement?  I know that they must be careful, as they will not want to chastise anyone in public, but among the local authorities, North and South, for instance, what level of commitment have they experienced?  The regional assemblies are very important organisations from which they need a commitment.  Is there commitment or a stand-off approach taken by parliamentarians, North and South and in the United Kingdom, as well as by the UK and Irish Governments?  I hope the Northern Ireland Assembly will soon be back up and running again as there is a vacuum.  We need political leadership to engage with and advocate for communities.  I wish the parties in the North well in order that the Assembly can be re-established.  <\/p> <p>  What is the level of commitment among EU institutions, including the Commission and MEPs?

The reception was extremely good.  There were many comments supportive of the new common chapter and questions about how members could take it forward.  The challenge for us is how to plug in to that goodwill to ensure those parliamentarians will put the good words into action.  We will continue to address that issue.<\/p> <p>  On local authority engagement, we are planning to address the all-Ireland Local Authority Forum which brings together the chief executives of local authorities, North and South, to try to bring them on board.  The Centre for Cross-Border Studies has good relations with the three local authority cross-Border networks, the East Border Region, the Irish Central Border Area Network and the North West Regional Strategic Partnership, which are very important in terms of what the common charter represents.  <\/p> <p>  Up to now, political engagement has been positive, although we have only started in the last month or so.  Turning the positive reception into something more concrete is key.  The common charter talks about all relationships - relationships at the Border, all-island relationships and relationships between the islands; we do not focus on one to the detriment of others.  It allows political representatives to engage in a more positive manner.  <\/p> <p>  I refer to engagement with Brussels and the European Commission, in particular.  I should emphasise that the common charter is not my product but that of the organisation and the community groups that have been involved in the project.  It is their work, not mine, and they might hold a different view.  However, before we go to the Commission to seek its engagement, we must have something solid between these islands.<\/p> <p>  Senator Coffey referred to the Structural Fund and the connections with Wales.  It has been a topic of conversation with the groups in Wales and the Welsh Assembly.  A recent report discussed how Wales wished to have external engagement post Brexit.  They want the relationships which have been facilitated by the EU Structural Fund until now to continue.  On the island of Ireland Northern Ireland is involved in one INTERREG programme which also involves Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.  There is also an INTERREG programme between Wales and the Republic of Ireland.  The EU commitment applies to the island of Ireland and North-South co-operation.  It does not really address the connections we have through the INTERREG programme with Scotland, on the one hand, and Wales, on the other.  It is really important that something be done to ensure there will be structures in place and funds available to enable these relationships to progress after Brexit.  With others, we are involved in following the progress which is somewhat slow of the UK Government's Shared Prosperity Fund, its proposal for what will replace the EU Structural Fund.  Up to now, we have seen no evidence that that programme will enable cross-Border co-operation.  It is to deal with regional disparities in the four nations which make up the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>It does not recognise the fact that Structural Funds are absolutely crucial to cross-Border co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, co-operation with Scotland and between Wales and the Republic of Ireland.  That is something we are attempting to address.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny made the important comment that we are all victims and products of our histories.  That can be seen in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, what it has achieved, all the connections it has created and the ability for us to talk to each other and identify common issues.  We sometimes miss those types of granular things in the entire Brexit debate, which is more concentrated on the big ticket issues of high politics, business and trade.  The small but vital connections that have been enabled and facilitated by the Good Friday Agreement are sometimes missing from the Brexit debate.<\/p><p> The groups involved in the common charter insisted on introducing a section that I had never thought of: a preface within which the community groups wanted to highlight the fact that this charter is not just being dropped from outer space but is building on things that exist.  They made the precise comment about shared histories and languages, cultural and sporting connections that exist within these islands.  They wanted to ensure those things are recognised.<\/p><p> The common charter represents an attempt to ensure we capture the lifeblood of relations within and across these islands.  I do not think that, with Brexit, we will necessarily see the end of the institutions that were created by the Good Friday Agreement.  We should not, and cannot, see the end of those institutions, including the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council which are not, and cannot be, at risk.  However, for those structures to operate properly and to give them added value, that lifeblood must exist underneath them.  There must be community groups working together because there would be no point in having a North-South Ministerial Council or British-Irish Council that brings Ministers or political representatives together for a dialogue if there is little or nothing happening on the ground.  The common charter is an attempt to ensure that, whatever happens with Brexit, those connections and relations will happen post Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019061200002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony Soares","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":861,"content":"<p>I will pick up on a couple of points because I am furiously writing notes.  The first is in response to the reaction we have had.  Within our own networks, the reaction has been very positive and we are referring to that and including it in any submissions we are making, for example, to the Department at this meeting and to the third national action plan on peace and security, because of the role of women in peace building and conflict resolution.<\/p> <p>  I will pick up on the point that Dr. Soares raised about networking and Senator Coffey's query about the impact on volunteering.  The volunteer strategy consultation is starting.  There was local government reform in 2013 and we have done considerable work on the impact of that.  We are losing institutional memory and we are losing volunteers across communities because the new, changed structures are impacting on their time.  It is important to try the new structure of the common charter.  We must bring in new blood, new volunteers, while also holding onto that institutional memory and knowledge because it is important. <\/p> <p>  Going back to the comments made by Deputy Kenny about the product of history is important, as is that idea of learning from the approach we have taken for the new common charter.  We have been involved since 2015 and I do not say that the conversations were always easy.  There were some interesting conversations particularly at a cross-community level.   We brought the first draft of the new common charter - or chapter as it was then - to Scotland first and there were a considerable number of questions about the language in it which we had not anticipated because it was a product of our history.  For example, they were asking why we had so many references to culture and language.  It meant a very different thing to us, from an all-Ireland version of the charter, than it did from a Scottish perspective.  That was interesting and important.  We have a platform and structure in place now after five or six years of work and that is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019061200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":862,"content":"<p>Senator Coffey mentioned the LEADER programme and networking.  That is built into LEADER and the rural development programme across Europe and that is an important lesson that the UK Government needs to take on but it may need prompting from the Irish Government.  Once we get past high politics and whenever a deal emerges, whatever the UK replaces rural development funding with, there must be an external element.  We cannot just do it within our own jurisdiction.  We need to look outwards.  There are many lessons we can learn from each other across the Border and from what countries across Europe are doing in terms of rural development.<\/p> <p>  LEADER invested in the importance of networking and placed it as being very important.   Our organisation is trying to do that when it talks to the UK Government about the UK shared prosperity fund.  There needs to be an external element, it needs to look outwards and that costs money, is valuable and worth investing in.  That is one of the key lessons and learnings from that European rural development programme.<\/p> <p>  The only other point I wanted to pick up on was the idea of peace building and reconciliation.  I agree with Deputy Martin Kenny that much work has been done in local areas and communities.  That is the day job of a colleague of mine, Ms Charmain Jones, who concentrates on local reconciliation and communities and having those difficult conversations.  Significant progress has been made at community level in Northern Ireland.  Our concern, as an organisation, is that Brexit has become an issue that divides people along community lines in Northern Ireland despite the vote in the most recent European election.  Our concern is that Brexit has the potential to be divisive again, especially in rural communities, depending on one's view of the constitutional issue.  We are grappling with that as an organisation.  The Rural Community Network has a diverse membership, some of whom are leavers and some remainers.  We are finding it challenging to plot our way through this stuff.<\/p> <p>  My view is that rural development and these challenges will be there regardless of what deal the UK comes to with the EU.

I am delighted to have been nominated by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, to serve as chairman of the Arts Council.  I very much look forward to starting in the role shortly.  I will be the tenth person to hold this position since the council was established under the Arts Act 1951.  It is fair to say no organisation plays a more important role in supporting the arts in Ireland than the Arts Council.  This position was set out in the original legislation in 1951.  It was reaffirmed in the 1973 Act and again in the 2003 Act.<br\/><br\/>As head of the school of communications at Dublin City University, I currently lead Ireland's largest university centre for media and communications.  It has almost 1,000 students and was recently rated amongst the top 200 globally in the subject areas.  I was previously head of the department of film and media at Institute of Art, Design and Technology, IADT, D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Prior to 2008, I held senior editorial positions with a number of media companies, including RT&Eacute; and <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, during a 14-year career as a political journalist.  More recently, I have added significant experience as an independent non-executive director.  Until 2019, I served two terms on the board of Dublin Bus, where I was also a member of the audit and risk committee.  I have served on the boards of Oxfam Ireland and the Galway International Arts Festival.  The latter produces one of Europe's leading arts festivals as well as developing and producing new work that tours nationally and internationally.  I have experience working in the role of chairman, including as chair of the expert advisory committee of Culture Ireland, which has responsibility for promoting Irish arts worldwide, and as chair of the compliance committee of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  While serving in these roles, I deepened my understanding of governance processes through ongoing training, including at the Law Society of Ireland and the Institute of Directors.  In accepting the position of chair of the Arts Council, I have resigned from a number of the aforementioned roles to remove any possible conflicts of interest.<br\/><br\/>My involvement and interest in the arts sector arises in part from my role in the education sector, my involvement with Culture Ireland and having been a board member of Galway International Arts Festival but also from my long-standing personal interest in the visual arts, theatre, literature and film.  In my previous career in the media, while I primarily worked as a political journalist, I also produced and presented a number of radio documentaries on visual artists.  Going back a little farther, or longer than a little farther, I originally trained as an economist.  My final year undergraduate project was an econometric study of the prices of the paintings of Jack B. Yeats, the findings of which I probably cannot recall.  At that time, I was also a volunteer in a community radio station in Dublin City, Anna Livia, where I worked on the station's arts programme.<br\/><br\/>In preparing for today, I read the Oireachtas debates on the original arts legislation from 1951.  In a Second Stage debate in the Seanad, one Member told the House:<\/p><blockquote>The definition of artist nowadays is a man with long hair or a woman with short hair; they seem to need no other qualifications than that.  When I see pictures exhibited by a lot of modern artists I wish that we had not any modern art.  They are not painting; they are not pictures.  If anything at all, they are a puzzle.<\/blockquote> <p>There is little in this contribution I would agree with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Kevin Rafter"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":877,"content":"<p>We have to go to vote but I want to hear what Professor Rafter has to say.

In a sense, it should be.  Art, be it a painting, a poem, a dance or a musical composition, should puzzle.  It should challenge us as people, make us reflect, think and inspire us.<br\/><br\/>I am a great admirer of the work of Michelle Rogers, a wonderful painter from County Louth who now lives between New York and Rome.  In 2016, she was invited to sketch the signatories of the Paris Agreement on climate change at the United Nations.  In her drawings she sought to capture the hands of the 175 national representatives who signed the climate accord.  Michelle Rogers said of this work:<\/p><blockquote>It was quite painful to do because it took hours, even though each individual signing took two or three seconds.  I wanted to draw every hand that I could.<\/blockquote> <p>The outcome was quick drawings of the signatories' hands.  It has been said they look in a way like a flock of birds.  It is art that captures history.<br\/><br\/>One of the successes of the Arts Council over the past 70 years has been in ensuring recognition for the critical importance of the artist in society, as well as acknowledging the intellectual, creative and imaginative contribution artists make to Irish life.  The Arts Council works tirelessly to ensure artists are supported in all aspects of their artistic practice and at all stages in their careers.  Individual artists are supported through a range of schemes, including bursaries, projects, Aosd&aacute;na and the Next Generation award.  However, the reality is that being an artist is a difficult and precarious life.  Despite the many available supports through the Arts Council, more needs to be done to support the living and working conditions of artists from performing to creative artists.  The Arts Council will have more to say about this in the coming months.<br\/><br\/>In those Oireachtas debates in 1951, it was originally proposed that the amount of money provided for the Arts Council would be limited to &pound;20,000 per annum.  Thankfully, following discussion in the D&aacute;il, the financial provisions in the legislation were changed to ensure no ceiling was put in place to the amount of money that would be granted to the Arts Council.  The council was also to be independent in allocating its funding.  The then Taoiseach, John A. Costello, noted this represented a fundamental principle in the legislation.  He said, &quot;art and all works connected with artistic activities, while being encouraged to the greatest possible extent by the State, should never be controlled by the State&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In the period since those words were uttered, Ireland's international reputation as a creative country has been built on long-standing State investment in both artists and arts organisations overseen by successive Arts Councils.  A small grant to a fledgling theatre company in Galway in the 1970s supported the development of a world-renowned theatre powerhouse that is the Druid Theatre Company.  A bursary in the 1980s to a young emerging novelist named Anne Enright helped to lead to a Booker prize winner and the inaugural laureate for Irish fiction.  Some years ago, Anne Enright wrote about the lessons of being a writer.  She had heard of people taking a year off to write a novel.  She thought: <\/p><blockquote>I worry that a year might not be enough.  You must fail as a writer for much longer than that ... before you know what failure is and what use you might make of it.<\/blockquote> <p>She admitted that she did not realise that when her first book fell apart, every book falls part.  As she put it, that is the gig of the artist.  It is remarkable that from such struggles great work is frequently created.<br\/><br\/>At the Arts Council, novels are not written, poetry is not crafted and dance is not created.  As a State body, the Arts Council, as a body corporate, is imbued with a passionate love for, dedicated commitment to and a deep experience of all the art forms.  It disburses public money, provides expert advice and delivers practical support.  Transparency and accountability are two significantly important values in all this work.<br\/><br\/>Key to the success of the Arts Council in delivering on its role is its capacity to work in partnership across government with other partners and stakeholders, and, in particular, with the local authorities.  Partnership is important.  Paul Durcan is one of my favourite poets.  I was still a university student when he published his collection, <i>Crazy About Women<\/i>, which arose from an invitation from the National Gallery of Ireland to write poetry inspired by the gallery's collections.  On my desert island list of items to bring, the first book would be <i>Crazy About Women<\/i>.  It is a work of considerable beauty which reminds me always of the value of partnership.<\/p><p> I also strongly believe in public access to the arts.  Everyone in society should be able to have the unique personal experience that comes from the arts - of being inspired, challenged and confronted by the work of our artists.  People should be able to enjoy the arts in their local communities.  Public access is central to the remit of the Arts Council, as is a strong commitment to providing experience and practice in different art forms for people across all of Ireland.  That commitment is seen in Arts Council support to over 48 local arts centres all across the country.  The positive impact of this type of activity is evident in Arts Council funding last year for more than 170 festivals attended by 500,000 people.  However, there are still communities for whom access to the arts continues to be a challenge for reasons of socio-economics, location, gender or disability.  Working to eliminate these barriers is and will continue to be a central priority for the Arts Council.  Priority must be given to ensuring that everyone living in Ireland has a sense of ownership of publicly funded art and that the art they encounter is relevant to contemporary society and its people.<\/p><p> As chair designate of the Arts Council, I again thank the committee for inviting me to this meeting.  I look forward to taking up my role formally and to engaging positively with the committee in the future and discussing many of the issues in this space with it again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#E00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Kevin Rafter","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":891,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Uasal Rafter as an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt s&eacute;.

Many artists have appeared before us, starting with a lot of actors from the Abbey Theatre to discuss what was happening there.  Many of those with backgrounds in film and the arts tell us that it is not a full-time job or something that people can take up as a career.

I am chair designate and I wanted to do the committee the courtesy of this being my first public outing.  There will be a number of board meetings later this month, which will be an opportunity for me to get my feet under the table and get a sense of things, but I will not give the committee a long list and say that I will do this, that and the other.  Rather, mine will be a watch, listen and see approach.  I have had the benefit of being on the board of the Galway International Arts Festival and of chairing Creative Ireland, which has given me a good sense of the sector and the various issues.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about the focus.  Culture Ireland held a conference in January attended by individuals from all of the sectoral interests involved.  I will tell the committee about something I have picked up, namely, that this is about the role of the artist, ensuring a fair and equitable working wage for artists - from the performing artist to the creative artist - and supporting them through their careers.  To merge a number of the Senator's questions, doing something in that regard in order that people can have time and space will be one of the issues.  I have had the benefit of reading some of the transcripts of the committee's meetings.  Ms Garry Hynes appeared before it this year while it was preparing its report on arts matters.  She talked about allowing art to be made.  The focus will be in that space.<\/p> <p>  Regarding public access, it is important that publicly funded art be available to all throughout the country.  The Arts Council is a national institution with significant regional reach.  It is involved in funding the education sector, including schools, as well as arts centres and various festivals.<\/p> <p>  On the magic wand question, I will not surprise the committee with my answer - it will be the funding model.  Like all public bodies, the Arts Council suffered significantly post 2008.  That year, its funding was &euro;85 million, but it decreased to &euro;56 million.  There was a generous increase in the last budget, though, and funding is back at &euro;75 million.  Working with my colleagues on the council, its staff and the director, one of my objectives as chair will be to show that this is money well spent.  Ms Hynes referred to the \"act of imagining\" and being challenged and inspired.  That does not come without investment.  If I had a magic wand, I would use it on the budget and ensure that, over the five-year period that I hope to be chair of the Arts Council, the budget increased significantly above its current level.  That would allow us to do everything else the Senator mentioned - recognising the role of the artist and the artist's career; putting art throughout the country; and supporting art centres.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the STEAM and STEM debate, the humanities are very important in terms of the ability to think, inspire and communicate.  We must not lose sight of their value.  It was the late M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabha&iacute;n who said there was no metric for the priceless.  Sometimes, we need to recognise the huge value that the arts provide to Irish society.  That does not come without investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Kevin Rafter"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":898,"content":"<p>It is lovely to see Professor Rafter and Ms McBride, and I thank them for attending to discuss the Arts Council.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Professor Rafter two questions.

One of the issues that has arisen relates to the funding model and the individual artist.  According to the Arts Council, Theatre Forum, the 400 artists or people involved in the arts, the Abbey Theatre and Visual Artists Ireland, the average wage of an artist is between &euro;12,000 and &euro;13,000.  As funding increases, as we might expect it to, we are faced with the choice of whether to continue to support projects that do not raise the living standards, security or income of artists.  Previously, in arts policy or a portfolio relating to the arts, the Arts Council funded theatre companies and projects.  What if we had a conversation about a living wage in circumstances where the council gives the money to an individual artist?  Perhaps the artist has to earn &euro;5,000 to &euro;8,000 per year in his or her own right, but he or she would be compensated up to a living wage.  Whatever income was earned, the lower level of compensation would be paid by the Arts Council and at the guaranteed level, that is, the living wage, no compensation would be paid by the State.  That would essentially recognise and reward the unrecognised time that artists spend on their work and address the poverty levels in the sector.  An income of &euro;12,000 or &euro;13,000 means someone is living in poverty.  We are having a conversation about poverty.

The Arts Council's strategic plan, Making Great Art Work, refers to supporting artists through their careers and to fair and equitable payment for the work they do.  This issue has obviously been in the public domain recently.  It is an issue that I, as chairman of Culture Ireland, heard about and discussed with individual artists.  As already stated, it must be addressed.  Aosd&aacute;na is in place for creative artists and the members receive a stipend of approximately &euro;17,000 per year.  However, there are gaps, particularly in the performing arts area.  Somebody could be working for a number of months and he or she might be on television so one might think the person is doing very well, but then there is no work for the rest of the year.  That is a gap.  It is something that, as incoming chairman of the Arts Council, I would like to discuss.  I have discussed it with the director already.  It is something we should be and will be examining.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is correct - it is about ensuring that in those periods when there is no work people can continue their practice, be that on the stage, on the screen or in the visual arts.  I am aware that a report the Senator published a number of years ago raised some of these issues.  I put two issues in my opening statement.  One is about the role of the artist, from performing artist to creative artist, and the second is about public art so \"Yes\" is the answer.  Obviously, if more money becomes available to the Arts Council, it will be in a position to do more things.

As Professor Rafter will know, I spent 25 years working at Dublin City University.  I know what the community means there and what the arts mean to the community.  I refer also to the arts' relationship with both health and equality.  Something which the Arts Council might like to consider along with the thousand other matters it will have to consider is that there should be a Department of the arts.  It is such a significant area, as I have always said.  The categories include art, drama, theatre, dance, music, language, performance and media.  One can start with puppetry and end with Picasso or the Prokofiev ballet, \"Romeo and Juliet\", that took place the other day.<\/p> <p>  The Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations is in represented here.  While it is not in competition with the Arts Council, it and the natural environment have to vie for attention, whereas language and perhaps the arts are more comfortably placed.  The Arts Council might consider that because it could make more noise in a cultural way.  It will also allow the council's budget to be extended, although it might not lead to a separate Department being created.  There once was a Department with responsibility for the arts, culture and language, which would give independence to all the aspects the Arts Council outlined and allow for extensions.  The Arts Council might consider making more noise in that regard if it believes it is a good idea.  The arts should also be considered in the various Departments because the matter is so integrative.  The Arts Council described it as a partnership but it is so integrative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#H00300","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":920,"content":"<p>I am open to hearing all advice.

It is a mixture of spending spread across the Department.  The Arts Council, on the other hand, is responsible for current expenditure.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is entirely correct about disability and disadvantage.  Some people experience barriers to access and, as demographics change and the population greys in its age profile, we need to be conscious of that.  There will be more people, they will live longer and, one hopes, their ability to enjoy that time will mean they will be able to visit national institutions such as the National Gallery or the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork to see great works of art.

During the 1960s and 1970s Ireland was known throughout the world as the land of milk and honey.  We still produce milk today but not as much honey.  During the years many of our uplands and hedgerows have disappeared and we now seldom see wildflower meadows.  All of these changes have resulted in a reduction in the number of wild native bees at a time when we should be ensuring greater protection for vulnerable insects.  Ireland prides itself on being a green island with wild tourism and green agriculture, but we should be more protective of nature.  Wildlife, including bees, needs all of the help it can get.  It is time for us all to sit down together to discuss concerns about managing uplands and hedgerows.  We must come up with positive solutions to minimise the conflict with nature.<\/p> <p>  I will speak from the heart.  We have a major problem with the decline of habitats, flora and fauna, bees, birds and other wildlife.  As citizens of Ireland and the world, we were given the land by way of a loan from our ancestors and must hand it over to the next generation in the condition in which we got it, without destroying it further.  Ireland prides itself on its green image, yet habitats are disappearing.  Elderly beekeepers all over the country have told me that in the past it was possible to keep 60 or 70 beehives, but it is no longer possible to do so because there is no food available.  Hedgerows are protected, but there is no stipulation on how they are to be cut.  In Ireland it has become habitual for them to be cut right down to the roots and then for mechanical diggers to be used to split the roots, which does not allow the hedgerows to grow back.  Teagasc has been very supportive of the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations.  Together, we produced a very good document last year on how to manage and cut hedgerows, but as there is no legislation in place, mechanical diggers are being used to remove them and they are not growing back.  If we lose the insects, we will lose the birds and our green image.  Canaries were brought down mines years ago and if they died, miners knew that they had to get out.  Bees are now dying.  They are telling us something, but if we do not listen to what it is, we will let down future generations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":927,"content":"<p>I will now invite committee members to ask questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#J00400","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":928,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for coming.

There is an Act that deals with hedgerows and how they are to be cut and managed.  We ask committee members to work to bring forward legislation to provide that hedgerows cannot be cut to within an inch of their lives.  There should be guidelines and documentation, if not law, to ensure hedgerows cannot be cut right down to the roots, which means that they have no chance of growing again.  We need criteria governing how they are to be cut.  Cutting should not be allowed that does not meet the criteria as hedgerows are being destroyed.<\/p> <p>  We also ask the committee to curtail the use of pesticides.  They are being used by gardeners who might only have a couple of dandelions in their gardens.  They are using what they think is the best chemical in the world, namely, Roundup or other neonicocides, but the damage they cause is unbelievable.  We have a good working relationship with the farming community and ask them to notify beekeepers in their area when they are about to undertake spraying.  We know and accept that they have to spray their crops, but if they tell us when they are about to do it, we can keep bees in on that day.  We can close the door and not let them out.  In that way, they will not come in contact with pesticides and die.  However, under legislation there is no onus on the farming community to tell us.  <\/p> <p>  These are little things, but they can make a big difference.  We know that farmers and landowners have to make money.  In the next round of CAP payments it could be stipulated that hedgerows must be protected according to certain criteria and that spraying is notifiable to beekeepers in an area.  There are 63 beekeeper associations in the country and it would take only one e-mail to tell beekeepers in an area that Mr. Browne or Mrs. Browne is going to spray tomorrow morning.  In that way, beekeepers in the locality could protect their bees.  These are simple measures, but farmers will not do them on their own.  They will need a gentle push or encouragement, whichever is the more effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":930,"content":"<p>It is about opening lines of communication locally to explain to farmers that they are also custodians of bees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#J00700","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":931,"content":"<p>Yes, but they need an incentive.

I started beekeeping in 1959, which is a good while ago.  The Chairman asked how bad the situation has become.  From that time until 2000, beekeeping was fairly steady.  I had 24 stocks of bees in my apiary until 2000 and I was doing okay by them.  There was plenty of food and foraging in the area.  I can now only keep six stocks.  That goes to show what has happened.  From keeping 24 stocks, the number has gone down steadily.  It is alright for me, as a beekeeper, to say this area can only cater for six stocks when it was 24 in the past.  I could put the balance in my car and I might get an apiary from the Chairman or the gentleman beside him and I would spread them out.  However, the bumblebee or the solitary bee cannot get into a motor car and drive 20 miles down the road where the area is good.  They will be gone.<\/p> <p>  I am passionate about this issue.  When I was in school in 1957, 1958 and 1959, I was taught by Mr. Doran.  He was the man who founded Macra na Tuaithe, which was the forerunner to the farmers club.  He gave me a project to do on bees.  People with farmer's land might be asked to rear a calf and start them off.  I had no land so he gave me a job counting bumblebees, which I did.  I have been counting bumblebees since.  Where I was getting bees on a certain hedgerow at a particular time - I have photographs - I can see that bumblebee numbers have gone down by about 70%.  We are facing a serious problem.<\/p> <p>  I will tell the committee how valuable bees are and respond to Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's questions on their value.  In the spring of 2016, which is only three years ago, I had a phone call from a gentleman in Kilkenny by the name of Hughes who asked me if I could help him.  I asked him in what way I should help and he asked me to send him some bees.  I told him we had lost up to 70% of our bees because of lack of pollen at the back end of 2015, which was very cold, and the start of 2016.  I asked him what his problem was.  He was a farmer who had sewn 20 acres of pumpkins and he said a man had asked if he had the bees to pollinate them.  He did not know pumpkins had to be pollinated.  I told him I would get him a few hives of bees but that I could not get him many.<\/p><p>I rang him at Christmas when the season was over and asked how he got on.  He said that he got on well but he had 100 acres for next year and needed some bees.  He said that he had to import bumble bees from Northern Ireland and that the bumble bee was ten times better than the ordinary bee that we had for that particular job.  I said that did not surprise me because the bumble bee will pollinate at a lower temperature than our bees, at around 10&deg;C, while our bees have to have a temperature of 15&deg;C or 16&deg;C before they can do any pollinating.  Bumble bees are crucial.  Mr. Doran told me, God be good to him, in 1959, that if anything happened to the bumble bee, we would be in trouble.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked about Kilkenny.  I went into Kilkenny County Council two years ago.  I was the head of the posse.  I asked the council about this pollinator plan.  I asked it to do something to highlight the situation and it adopted the black and amber bumble bee as the insect for Kilkenny.  I stated last year that it is all right for it to adopt the bumble bee but I want to see what the council is doing.  It said it was going to put a plan in place.  I waited until the local elections were over and went to a councillor to ask what the council had done about various verges along motorways and such.  There is much work that could be done there.  If something is not done quickly, we will lose the whole lot.  We have the power to destroy and eliminate but we do not have the power to get them back.  I got a bit frustrated one day when I went to Kilkenny County Council.  I said to myself that I was like a drop in the ocean but that if all the drops make up the ocean, everybody could do a little, such as a person with a hanging basket or people who leave a little bit of their garden to go wild, bringing their children out to look at the bees and the butterflies.  Without bees, we would have no birds or anything else.<\/p><p> I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak here and I hope I answered the question of how valuable those pollinators are to humans.  I am heartened.  I am afraid that people who are 40 or 50 are not taking it seriously, but people younger than that, including those in schools, are taking it very seriously.  Certain schoolmasters come along and ask me to give various talks.  I thank the committee for the opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#L03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Walsh for his passion and understanding of our responsibility.

I was tied up with something else.  My understanding, from looking at the documentation provided and from what was said to me when it became known that our guests would be coming in, is that in parts of the country, the cutting of hedgerows is a major issue.  In large swathes of the west, especially where I live, there is very little hedgerow cutting and any such cutting is quite cursory in nature.  It is done along the roads by the county council, on just the outside hedges, not the inside hedges, in an attempt to make them more vertical than lateral.  Even in the time that I have been in Corr na M&oacute;na, there are many more hedges, including many higher ones, in the west than was the case previously.  These are deciduous, whitethorn or traditional hedges.  This year was a great year for whitethorn.  If one drives along the roads, they are ablaze with whitethorn.  There is more gorse than there ever was.  In fact, more land is used than there was 40, 50 or 60 years ago.<\/p> <p>  Are there areas of the country where the hedgerows and the bees are thriving?  I remember it being pointed out to me many years ago that there was a substantial change in farming balance and patterns from a multicultural approach, with the sowing of oats, potatoes, vegetables, some fruit and so on being popular, to just producing more and more grass because that is what farmers were getting paid to do.  Has that had a negative effect on what our guests were describing?  The hedges are not cut across large swathes of the country and there is much more cover than previously, with many more wild flowers not being cut.  Is the bee population in those areas thriving?  In areas where there is wholesale mechanical cutting by the farmers with sophisticated machines that can cut every side of the hedge - up, down and across - is there a difference in the number of bees?  How much is the change in farm practice having an effect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#M01000","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I was to Inishbofin last weekend.  There has been a significant revival in the corncrake population on the islands off the west coast.  Part of what caused their demise was the lack of farming when the islands became depopulated, as well as changes in farming practices.  Strangely, in some cases it was just pure depopulation.  However, there has been a significant revival.  I was listening to Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and corncrakes appeared in Baile an Fheirt&eacute;araigh recently.  The corncrake is making a comeback and, therefore, that shows that if the circumstances are changed, the game is not over.<\/p> <p>  One of my suggestions is that we should write to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and copy the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I have waited for years for a special measure under GLAS, which used to be the rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  This is up for negotiation because a new plan will come in after 2020.  Instead of it being the case that the best money to be earned from environmentally friendly farming is to put land in grass and do nothing apart from keeping the grass cut, &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 should be paid to people to have kitchen gardens, or to recreate more traditional diverse farming.  With small mechanical devices, much of the hard labour can be taken out of having a half acre of potatoes, vegetables or whatever.  Would that be a help?<\/p> <p>  Environmental schemes such as GLAS have good features in them but they tend to lead to monoculture because it is easier to get money from a scheme if the measures are simple.

I would go in and they would look and they would be horrified when they saw bees.  I always go to the eight year old classes, I do six schools in my district, and, in recent years, when I go in, the kids are not terrified of bees.  They know more about bees than I ever did at their age, they are hugely positive and they contact me when they see a bumblebee or something in difficulty.  The positivity is there with all the youth.  They have it and they understand it.  We see them on the streets protesting about the earth and the climate.  They are ahead of the game and we are only catching up as elderly adults.

We conduct two surveys every year for the Government and that is where most of our money goes.  We do not have any bee health inspectors and we do not have any bee support inspectors.  In England, there are bee supports and instead of going to see the vet, one goes to see the bee support inspector to address a problem.<\/p> <p>  We get free testing from Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Department pays for health inspections on our bees.  We send samples, which we used to pay for but for the last two years it has been free so that is a slightly positive move.  However, a lot of money is coming into the country for research and everything else but we do not get it on the ground.<\/p> <p>  There are 3,200 beekeepers, each one with up to three or four hives.  Each hive has about 60,000 bees so we are doing our bit.  On support for beekeepers, this has been the first opportunity to talk to Government representatives at an equal level and we thank the committee for that.  We would like more media attention but we are volunteers.  We try our best and, to be fair to Mr. Norton, he is running around ragged.  I used to do his job and the members have all met the late Phillip McCabe.  God rest his soul he is gone.  He was an Irishman who was president of Apimondia.  We have done our best but we our hands are tied because we are a voluntary organisation and we are trying to get there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>I will not hold up the meeting any longer.

We can hear the passion.  If the committee members did not understand previously, we understand now how important it is.  Hopefully today's session gets the publicity it deserves.  The witnesses have laid it out quite well and, hopefully, we will be able to impact on the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the councils.  I presume that the next pollination plan is in hand and we will try to encourage whatever help can be given to the federation.  Hopefully, the federation will be able to come back to us in a few years and tell us that it has managed to address the decline at the very least and perhaps encouraged an increase but it will take quite a number of years.  The federation has gone great work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#N01500","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>It would be nice to come back here again next year and see how we have progressed with the committee's help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019061200002#N01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>We would not have a problem with that.
