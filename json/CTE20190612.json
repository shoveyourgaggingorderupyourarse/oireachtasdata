I am joined by Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, at the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.<br\/><br\/>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, was appointed in August 2013 to design, build and equip a new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  A planning application was lodged in August 2015 and An Bord Ple&aacute;nala granted planning permission in April 2016 for the new national children&rsquo;s hospital, the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres at Connolly and Tallaght hospitals and related developments, including the Children&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Centre, CRIC, and a family accommodation unit adjacent to the new national children&rsquo;s hospital. <br\/><br\/>I will start with developments related to the development board.  My last appearance in front of the committee was preliminary to my appointment as the new chairman of the board.  The Minister for Health subsequently confirmed my appointment.  Two board members have since resigned, having given great service for six years.  The appointment of new members is within the remit of the Minister for Health and we are working together to fill the positions.  There have also been resignations by executive personnel, including the project director.  An open competition is under way to find a new chief officer.  An interim chief officer and an interim project director have been appointed in the meantime. <br\/><br\/>On progress, the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital is the most advanced element of the project.  Construction work is substantially complete and the building was handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland in May.  Services will commence in the new building once the usual commissioning activities are completed.  That will be a very significant milestone in the delivery of suitable treatment centres for children. <br\/><br\/>Good progress is also being made at the new paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre at Tallaght Hospital.  The decant works are complete and the new cr&egrave;che, changing facilities and offices are open.  Construction of the foundations for the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre building started earlier this year and the new building has reached first floor level.  The new national children&rsquo;s hospital on the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital site is by far the biggest element of the project. <br\/><br\/>The committee will be very aware that the construction costs of these works, as finally agreed with the main contractor BAM, are considerably higher than the previously estimated costs.  Notwithstanding the difficulties in reaching agreement with BAM, the view of the development board was that it would be better to proceed with BAM rather than stop the project and retender for the main construction work.  We could have retendered the contract, but it would have added years of delay.  Between tendering costs, inflation, increased owner costs and mobilisation costs, the likelihood was that retendering would ultimately result in higher rather than lower project costs.  Accordingly, the board recommended to the relevant stakeholders that construction proceed on the basis agreed with the main contractor, BAM.  At the end of last  year the Government authorised the board to proceed with the main construction works. <br\/><br\/>Another significant development is that it has been decided to procure employer-supplied health technology equipment through traditional procurement means, rather than a managed equipment service.  This decision is timely in that it allows for competitive tendering, procurement and delivery of the equipment in line with the overall programme. <br\/><br\/>The construction focus for the last year or so has been on heavy civil works in excavating the site, pile driving and so on.  The building frame is under construction.  The frame can be seen above ground level in places and as it rises, it will give a real sense of the scale of the works.  The mechanical and electrical installation work has started in the basement.  The next construction milestone will be completion of the new access road loop around the site perimeter, thus allowing the excavation of the strip of road running east-west through the building site.  It will be visible later this year.  Drone footage from the site taken at the end of May can be viewed online at <i> .<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barry and invite Ms Hardiman to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#D00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for inviting Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to attend to update it on the new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  I am joined by Professor Jim Browne, chairman of the board of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to provide the committee with an update on the new national children&rsquo;s hospital project as requested in its invitation.  As Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland is the client of the development board for the project, my update to the committee is in accordance with this remit. <\/p> <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland commenced on 1 January 2019 as the entity that governs and delivers acute paediatric services at Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght hospitals and from July at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown.  The commencement was facilitated with the support of the boards and management of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin and Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, both of which dissolved this month.  I take the opportunity to thank the two former boards and the existing board at Tallaght University Hospital, as well as the previous Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board, for their stewardship of acute paediatric services for many decades and, in some cases, centuries.   I also acknowledge the previous Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board in helping to get Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland commenced.  I point out that all board member positions are voluntary and involve the greatest of dedication and effort.  <\/p> <p>  In the delivery of the physical buildings Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland continues to work closely with the development board on matters related to the build, design and equipping of the new facilities.  A series of management and working groups engage on a monthly basis to progress all matters related to ensuring the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres at Connolly and Tallaght hospital and the new national children&rsquo;s hospitals meet the clinical and operational needs of children, their families and staff.   I take the opportunity to recognise the commitment, work and support of Mr. John Pollock, the former project director of the development board.  Within weeks, we will be delivering a service at the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre at Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Connolly Hospital.  It will be followed next year by the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre at Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Tallaght Hospital.  The new facilities, together with the opening of the new national children&rsquo;s hospital in 2023, will transform how acute paediatric healthcare is delivered to the sickest children in Ireland and local secondary care services are delivered in the greater Dublin area in delivering better healthcare outcomes, as well as ensuring better experiences for children, their families and staff. <\/p> <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown was handed over by the development board to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for clinical commissioning in May.  Equipment installation is near completion and operational.  We hope it will be done next week.  Clinical commissioning is under way in time for opening on 31 July, initially on a phased basis.<\/p><p>I remind the committee that 25% of the population are children under 18 years of age.  The majority are healthy, which is good, but one quarter of three year olds are obese, while 16% of children have a chronic disease, such as diabetes, allergies and asthma.  This figure is increasing and 2% are acutely ill or have very complex care needs.  <\/p><p> There is an over-reliance on hospital based inpatient care, with many services accommodated in facilities in Dublin that are no longer fit for purpose.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will provide national paediatric tertiary services which account for about one quarter of what we do, as well as secondary paediatric care services for children in the greater Dublin area  There are 442 beds and 3,388 whole-time staff equivalents delivering services annually to 25,000 inpatients, 28,700 day cases, more than 145,000 outpatients and 120,000 emergency department attendees at the three children&rsquo;s hospitals.  <\/p><p> All national paediatric services are within the remit of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, some with an all-island remit, for example, the all-island congenital heart disease network.  The plan for children&rsquo;s healthcare is outlined in the integrated programme for child health which includes acute paediatrics, social, community, primary care and child and adolescent mental health services.  This cross-divisional programme, rightly, reflects a population-focused, integrated and interdisciplinary approach to children&rsquo;s healthcare and identifies the resources required to best support parents, guardians, families, children and young people in achieving healthier outcomes.<\/p><p> From the perspective of Children's Health Ireland, we have been focusing on our integration programme.  The programme centres on valuing and aligning the different cultures of the three hospitals, integrating ICT systems, standardising clinical and operational protocols and staff recruitment and training.  Significant work is under way across Children's Health Ireland and I will update the committee on some of these aspects.  We have implemented a single patient administration system.  Part of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland&rsquo;s path to integrating ICT systems is a new patient administration system.  It was implemented and went live in mid-April at Crumlin and Temple Street children's hospitals.  It was done without any disruption to services.  It will allow Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland healthcare professionals working in both hospitals and Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, when it opens to view shared patient details, including inpatient and outpatient history, referrals and waiting list details, transfers and chart tracking.  This means that patients will have a single Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland unique identifier across Crumlin, Temple Street and Connolly hospitals.  It is a tangible and valuable result of the early part of our integration work to support shared and common outpatient waiting lists, starting with general paediatrics.<\/p><p> Turning to staffing, the majority of recruitment for the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital is well advanced, with most doctors, nurses, health and social care professionals and administrative staff recruited and start dates in the forthcoming weeks and months.  We will start to treat patients from 31 July.  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Connolly Hospital will provide a range of services, including urgent care, with a short stay observation unit.  Children will be observed and treated for up to eight hours before being discharged.  A very small number will require admission to one of our hospitals.  The facility will also have outpatient care services, including general paediatrics and orthopaedic fracture clinics.  Other specialties will follow.  At Connolly Hospital Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland will create additional capacity for general paediatrics, which is a welcome development in addressing waiting lists.  It will also contribute to significant reductions in waiting times and make the situation better for children and their families.  <\/p><p> Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Connolly Hospital represents a significant transformation of services for families and children.  It will facilitate a new model of care in paediatric services in north County Dublin and its environs, something it does not have.  It will deliver the right care, at the right time, in the right facility and as close to the child&rsquo;s home as possible, as outlined in Sl&aacute;intecare.  I welcome the opportunity to invite and bring members of the committee to the centre ahead of its opening in order that they can see at first-hand this new state-of-the-art facility and the impact it will have in the delivery of care and services.<\/p><p> Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland is in a period of transition, not just for our staff who transitioned to the new entity in 2019 but in how acute paediatric services are delivered in Ireland.  We believe the changes we are making and the impact they will have can be used as an exemplar for the transformation of services across the system.  The changes we are making will deliver better, safer and more sustainable healthcare for children, young people and their families.<\/p><p> I thank members of the committee for their attention.  I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hardiman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#E00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their updates.

Clinicians I have spoken to are very worried about the fact that this has been dropped.  Their point is that around the world it is best practice to have managed equipment services.  For example, in our children's hospitals in Dublin at the moment, some of the most important diagnostic machines such as MRI machines were meant to be decommissioned years ago.  The magnets, for example, are way beyond their use.  The current position is that when - and I am told is \"when\" rather than \"if\" - these machines go, there will be no replacement for them.  This is a high-risk way of running a health system.  The solution to this in other countries, which was meant to be used in the children's hospital, is a managed equipment contract.  Our children would be diagnosed by our clinicians using the most up-to-date equipment, which is refreshed and renewed so that the best possible technology and medical care can be advanced.  I appreciate that there may be a cost saving in moving back to the old way of working.  Is it not the case that this introduces a significant medical risk and that we will end up in the worst conceivable position because we have paid so much for a fancy building that may be beautiful but due to its design is expensive, and as a result, the medical services provided in the building will be reduced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#F00500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I will pass this over to my colleague but the medical equipment that will be provided through direct purchase will be the equipment that is required.

Medical care in the building is being sacrificed because of the overrun.<\/p> <p>  On the previous occasion Mr. Barry was before the committee he suggested that the best way to manage the risks and costs was to look at minimising further additional overspends.  He was new to the job but when a member of the public, who is ultimately paying for this hospital, looks at the hospital, they will see a beautiful glass doughnut, curved in every conceivable way.

Some of our clinicians will do outreach clinics in the regional hospitals in specific areas that we have all agreed.<\/p><p> It is a ten year plan and currently we are looking at every year over the next five years for the children's hospital to see how we can invest to add to the existing resources in children's healthcare and to work in a more integrated way with our colleagues, between community, mental health and the acute services especially.  We are looking at how to change the delivery of services to get a better outcome.<\/p><p> I am glad to report, and Dr. Curtis will concur, that obesity has started to plateau.  There are some positive signs around that.  Unfortunately, chronic diseases are still on the increase but I am glad we are getting our second allergist starting, along with a dermatologist and a rheumatologist, which is important.  These are areas in which we have new investments this year in Children's Health Ireland that will transform how we address some of those chronic diseases.  The plan is not to get down on the numbers of super specialties - we definitely have a need and requirement for some of those - but we plan to build a very strong bedrock and foundation of general paediatrics and to support them with tertiary specialty services.  We are glad to say that there has been an increase in general paediatricians with six joining us on the whole team at Children's Health Ireland.  Already they are bringing in expertise around adolescent care and transition care and we also have a general paediatrician with a special interest in dermatology.<\/p><p> We are interested in doing things a bit differently whereby the GPs do not have to wait to refer to the specialist who might have a long waiting list.  Our general paediatricians are taking on board those referrals on a single waiting list that is jointly shared across Children's Health Ireland and it goes to whoever has the next available clinic.  It is about more efficient use of our existing services.  We are working with our colleagues to triage to see what could go to the specialist and so better use their time, and to see what can and should be managed with our general paediatricians.  In using them and engaging much more closely with our GPs in the community we aim to manage those chronic diseases in that way.  It is about supporting them to work a bit differently.<\/p><p> All of the elements mentioned in Sl&aacute;intecare are the new ways of working that we are embedding into the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital, for example, with clinical triage of referrals.  Our general paediatricians are doing a triage clinic where they clinically triage the referrals and then phone the GP, which is very important.  They have managed to divert some 30% of the referrals by engaging with the GP and supporting them to care for the child, as opposed to the child having to come in for a referral.  We are also bringing in general nurse specialists in general paediatrics who can deal with some of the chronic elements in paediatrics such as constipation, some of the rashes and so on.  These nurses can work with the families as opposed to the child having to see a consultant.  All of these new ways of working are how we are trying to transform the services.  The new facilities at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown allow for that.  We have not had paediatrics in north county Dublin and its environs previously.  I am glad to report that the GPs and our community colleagues in CHO 9 in that area are looking at this and working collaboratively to try to use this as a new opportunity to transform, not do the same old same old, and to implement new ways of working, especially around managing chronic disease as much as possible in the community.<\/p><p> Perhaps Dr. Curtis would like to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#G03100","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hardiman.  It is probably best to look at chronic disease management in two different categories.  To a certain extent there is an increasing number of children with chronic and complex disease because we have got so much better at managing those conditions.  Conditions might previously have led to the child's demise in early years but that no longer happens.  This is due to great progress in the quality of care delivered and in medical science.  There is an increase in chronic disease because children are living now with chronic disease.  The emphasis now is not only on continued survival but also on improving the quality of care.  This is a community and a hospital function because those children are all over Ireland and they need the support in the community such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.  That is where the national model of care comes in.  It is making sure that children receive the specialist medical care they need and the community clinical care they need in order to enhance quality of life.<\/p> <p>  Another interesting part is that with the advances in understanding in genetics we can see that conditions such as diabetes, rheumatoid disorders and many of the epilepsies appear to be genetically determined.  We are now understanding where the chronic conditions of a large cohort of children come from.  This gives us a lever in improving treatment.  These conditions are inherent to the person and therefore are not related to lifestyle or anything like that.  There is a medical component.  I believe that we now understand why there is an increase in the number of children with chronic and complex conditions: it is because care has improved.  We do, however, have to continue to improve it.  We really have to make sure we improve quality of life.  Living with poor quality of life is not a huge improvement.<\/p> <p>  Obesity is a mixture - while there is a clinical medical component there is also a huge multi-agency, community and multidisciplinary aspect to obesity.  Within the HSE, for example, the role of the national programmes has made a huge difference.  The paediatric national programme gave us an understanding of paediatric services around the State that we really never had before.  It has enabled Children's Hospital Ireland to have a national co-ordinator for this national network.  The other piece that is of value from the clinical programme perspective is that it brings all of those programmes in the HSE together into a super group looking at important public health issues.  Childhood obesity and well-being is one of those issues.  It will involve education, facilities for sport and recreation and basic nutritional advice for every mother of a young child.  It is a huge programme but it is encouraging to see that it is more of an issue now and people understand that it needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  We will continue to see a growth in complex and chronic health conditions, and hopefully through a multi-agency involvement we might begin to address a more complicated issue such as obesity, which is a health issue because of its consequences but the origins of which are much more complicated.  That requires everybody to be involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emma Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Curtis.

It was explained to us that when it comes to a certain stage, the numbers working on the site will have to increase substantially as regards fit-out and all the necessary specialists who need to go in from electricians to plumbers and so on.  My understanding is that in any major project a time chart is made out on which there are targets to be met by certain dates.  What is the position in terms of meeting those targets?  Are we ahead or behind in terms of those targets for reaching a certain scale by the end of each month?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to accessing people to do the work.  Due to the scale of this project and because it is competing with a huge number of other large commercial projects in Dublin city as regards availability of people to do the work, where are we with making sure that we have the people to carry out the work as the project progresses?  Is there any aspect of the project about which concerns have arisen regarding shortage of supply for any part, whether it is in regard to labour skills, materials or the timescale for accessing the site, because with heavy traffic in that area it is not always possible to deliver to the site when it is needed?

The frame of the building is beginning to rise above ground level so it can be seen from the outside.  Some of the work is behind the original programme.  Some of it is not.  There probably is not a single reason for that.  It is a very big job and even for a very large international contractor such as BAM, getting up and running efficiently on the scale required is always difficult and can take a little longer than anticipated.  Sub-contracts have to be finalised and even though everybody knew the contract would be awarded and so on, the further negotiations with sub-contractors sometimes take a bit longer than might be the case.  Design details have to be agreed in support of the construction.  The construction industry is very busy and resourcing skilled tradesmen and construction management staff as well is difficult because they are hard to come by at the moment.  Those are all the challenges.<\/p> <p>  The site itself is very congested.  Access onto the site from the outside is very difficult.  It is a busy part of town.  There is a lot of traffic.

There may also be changes in medical practice too, or in technology which may need to be introduced in the project at this stage.  They may lead to increased costs or a view may be taken that it is better to defer changes until after the hospital is completed.  That will be a matter of judgment as we go forward.

In the same vein, as soon as this was spoken about there was a raft of people rushing in to explain that the money for any private medicine would be recouped.  I have asked the Minister and I am asking our guests now if that is worked out in any structured way.  Is there a calculation for what the private facility is going to cost?  If we do not know how much it is going to cost, we cannot know how much we are going to recoup.  We cannot say with any confidence that we are going to recoup the money that will be spent on any private section of the hospital without knowing how much it is going to cost.  If our guests know how much it is going to cost, I am interested in hearing what they have to say.  I am also interested in the structured arrangements that will be put in place to ensure that the money is returned to the Exchequer.  Clearly, notwithstanding the attempts by some on the committee to reframe this as something other than a massive overspend or underestimation - whichever way we put it, ultimately it is going to cost significantly more - the idea that contrary to the spirit and the letter of Sl&aacute;intecare we are now going to be stacking private care into a public hospital is very disturbing for many people.

That was a new departure and an area it never went into previously, primarily because it was not much of a feature.  It was starting to become a feature more and more.  That the INMO counts waiting times now is a clear indication that there are issues regarding staffing.  One can talk about backfilling as staff progressively move out but if one is only backfilling to the current level, one is still going to be understaffed in the original hospitals before people start to move.  There is genuine concern among staff that the push to open the urgent care facility will leave already hard-pressed staff in the main hospitals under even greater pressure as personnel move out.  While we are told the plan is to backfill rapidly, if the staff are there to backfill, why are they not there to fill the roster and ensure staffing levels are maintained at the required level?  There is no group or category of workers in the hospital outside, possibly, of administration where people are operating with a full staff complement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#O00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I concur completely.  In fact, we have a staffing plan that has identified increased staffing, which needs to be funded every year through the Estimates process, as an investment in paediatrics.  We have based that on evidence from comparable international services.  Nobody disagrees with us on whether we have identified deficits.  Within Children's Health Ireland, we have identified where our priority areas for investment are.  We know we cannot do it all in one year.  We have clearly worked across all three hospitals with clinical directors, nurses, managers and the head of the health and social care professionals and identified and prioritised our areas for investment.  I am happy to say we have had the largest investment in paediatrics in 2018 with an additional 173 posts coming into Children's Health Ireland.  The vast majority of those are clinical posts and we are working hard there.  However, we are cognisant of the need for further investment and will identify that as part of that annual investment process.  All of that has been identified in our future workforce plans.<\/p> <p>  We have a challenge in that there is only so much capacity within the existing hospitals.  We are in a very challenging area at the moment.  If one walks around Temple Street Hospital, one will see that we cannot squeeze anything else in.  That is why people welcome the investment in the new facilities.  They are not seen as being in competition.  We are seeing it as taking some of the pressure out of Temple Street in particular so that we can concentrate on tertiary, high-end services within the hospitals and get general paediatrics, orthopaedics and other services out to Connolly Hospital, which will help greatly.  We are looking at strategic alliances through the National Treatment Purchase Fund and others over the next few years as we will have to increase our workforce.  We cannot leave it all to 2023 to do a sudden leap.<\/p> <p>  We have an evidence base with our waiting list whereby there is a requirement for further investment.  With the HSE and the commissioning team around children's health, we have mapped out what we think we need, including identifying the pipeline and whether we can realistically fill these posts.  Some of that means we have set up a whole workforce planning group with the HSE.  We have established specific sub-committees on nursing because of the quantum of the numbers involved.  We have identified a clear action plan for the supply and demand in nursing.  We have worked up something with our colleagues in the doctor training unit on the future, in particular for specialist registrars and having a pipeline there.  We have sought to identify colleagues who have left the country and would return if they saw the investment taking place.  We are making some progress although it is slow and takes time.  There are niche areas in which it is particularly challenging to fill posts.  We want to work also with health and social care professionals.  While they are not among the cohorts with the highest numbers, there are still a lot of them.  There is, therefore, a need to ensure we have a pipeline and, when they come to us, that they have somewhere to work.  It is complex but while the board continues to engage with colleagues on the build project, we have very much moved from the building to issues around staffing and ICT.

He made some quite extraordinary statements earlier which, from what I can see, fit very neatly with Orwellian doublespeak.  He seems to have recast a &euro;650 million budget going to &euro;1.7 billion as not being an overspend.  According to Deputy Durkan, there has been no overspend or overrun, there was simply an underestimation.  That is extraordinary.  It is a bit like agreeing a price of &euro;200,000 for a house with a builder who comes back 18 months later and states that more pipes and wiring are needed and that the new cost will be &euro;600,000 but that the good news is that this is not an overspend or an overrun, it was just caused by an underestimation.  On a serious point, the Deputy's recategorisation of the amount of taxpayer's money that is being used is an insult to everyone who uses the healthcare system and to those who pay taxes.  The idea that we would dismiss an increase from &euro;650 million to &euro;1.7 billion and counting - because it seems like it will go a lot higher - as not being an overspend or an overrun is an insulting re-spin in the context of what we all know to have happened.<\/p> <p>  I would like to go into the issue of private practice with Ms Hardiman.

There are multiple factors that would help us both in recruiting and retaining staff.  Restoration of pay parity is one such factor, as the Deputy mentioned.  Helping staff to find affordable accommodation in Dublin is one of the priority issues we have identified.  To that end, we would like to work with Dublin City Council and others.  We are working on policies on affordable housing to ensure our staff have a sustainable commute to and from work, as opposed to having to drive many miles.<\/p> <p>  Another issue we have identified is that digitisation of the system would help because people are coming from a system that is digitised and want to work in that way.  They are coming to us with lots of ideas on how to connect with patients, patients' families and other clinicians.  It is not just about new electronic healthcare worker records but also using apps and so on and looking at new ways of doing things.  The most important aspect is that when staff come back and talk to us about this, it is clear they really want to make a difference.  They are here because they want to care for children and make a difference.  The new buildings and new ways of working attract them and they are up for the change and willing to be rostered until midnight if it makes services better for children.  We must find ways to support them as much as possible in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We have seven new emergency department consultants, but some of them are on maternity leave.  That is just the reality of the challenge we face, that there are often temporary reasons we do not have every position filled.  We have two people in promotional posts.  We seem to be able to fill the permanent posts, but the challenge lies in filling locum positions.  These are some of the issues we are looking to address, especially accommodation, pay and, in addition, ensuring the team we are putting in place is an interdisciplinary one.  Our staff want to work in new roles and with new people.  The general paediatricians, for example, are being assigned clinical nurse specialists which they never had before.  That type of change is making a great difference to how they deliver their services.  In general, we are concerned not just to keep doing the same old thing but, instead, to use digitisation, new roles and other things that deliver better value to patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#Q02200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I have a question about Holles Street hospital.

That is entirely reasonable because of the difficulties the project has faced over the time.  One of the consequences has been that for the staff in the three children's hospitals, and paediatric services, children and families who will avail of it nationwide, there has been doubt and confusion about whether it will ever happen.  It is seen as a poisoned chalice.  We have done good work on planning and design and we have great staff.  In paediatrics, almost all our staff have been trained outside the country or else trained by the best people here.  Obviously, it is not the building that makes for excellent care but an inadequate building can make excellent care more difficult to deliver, whereas a good environment and resources can enhance the ability to deliver excellent care.  I would like a positive perception of the project to emerge but that is not how people see it.  I know the design inside out, I work closely with the CHI and, therefore, I am familiar with its work on integration.<\/p> <p>  The hospital will be excellent.  It will be a very good place for children who have illnesses and conditions and who need medical input, which is a shame because, ideally, childhood is not marred by such problems.  In some way, it is important that it is seen for what it is, namely, a fantastic investment, long overdue, in the health and well-being of children and young people.  That is not the responsibility solely of the Oireachtas but we are all part of ensuring that the hospital is seen in that way rather than as something terribly negative, which is sometimes how it feels.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hardiman outlined the difficulties in staffing and the genuine challenges in merging three hospitals, doing everything together and commissioning three new buildings.

Perhaps we can refrain from mentioning there is a global shortage as we all know that.  What we specifically want to know is what is being done here.  With regard to nursing recruitment, I presume if there is to be an expansion of service, we are going to need more qualified nurses than we have now.  Given the likely timeline, those nurses are either doing their leaving certificate now or are just finished their first year in nursing.  In terms of how they are to be phased in, can Children's Health Ireland give us an idea of the numbers and whether it has sourced these nurses?  I met some of the student nurses.  A recent survey from the INMO indicates those nurses have no intention of waiting here and working within the health service, and they have every intention of emigrating.  From my previous work, I know that cohort of workers very well.  Traditionally, they would go away for a year and come back, but they are not coming back.  Is there a specific plan in place?  Is there any incentivisation?  Is anything being done with the universities?  Have any of the nurses given anything like a commitment that they are going to stay?  Without the staff, we just have a massively expensive building in which no services can be delivered.  It is the aspiration of the Oireachtas Members to work with the people in this room because we all want to see the hospital built.

It is of assurance to us that we have oversubscribing among students coming out of the leaving certificate who want to undertake nursing, which is helpful.  Paediatric nursing has the highest points in the whole of the nursing system, sometimes very high points, yet we are oversubscribed.  What we have managed to do is demonstrate that we have increased the undergraduate places for paediatric nursing by ten places, which is good, so we have ten more every year cumulatively going through since two years ago.  Increasing that again is part of the plan we are talking about in regard to the supply and demand of nursing.<\/p> <p>  We have also assessed and discussed this with the nurses who graduate.  The vast majority, up to 90%, are offered a contract and they accept it on graduation, and we will be doing that again.  We have to work very creatively, within a system that is currently very strong on headcount and budget, to try to address that.   We have 90 graduates coming out from September to December of next year and we know we need them because we are in expansion mode.  It is a question of how to do that and that is a challenge we are trying to work through at the moment.<\/p> <p>  From evaluating our existing nurses, we know that postgraduate nurses - those that are qualified in general nursing and then do a postgraduate course in, for example, paediatrics - stay longer with us and those courses do not take as long.  In our plan for supply, we are looking at how we can increase the number on postgraduate courses.  That requires funding and investment because those nurses are not full-time on pay but are 0.5, which means somebody else has to pay for the other 0.5.  That is part of the plan we have identified to see how we can increase the numbers. <\/p> <p>  With regard to accommodation, we have exit interviews when people are leaving the services.  Some of them have had to travel long distances and it just becomes too hard to continue doing that from a long-term perspective.

We have a work plan mapped out in regard to how to progress with that.  Nursing has been a bit ahead of the others because it is a bigger number and a bigger challenge, and the other is with regard to doctors in training.  We have identified what the requirements are.  Within Children's Health Ireland, we are then looking at how we get the clinical placements and we are all doing all of that planning.  The directors of nursing are working actively on that.<\/p> <p>  We are also doing what we are calling \"healthcare in a box\".

Yesterday, the Canal Way Educate Together kids came back into our offices and we awarded them some nice certificates relating to their understanding of where their future roles could be.  We agree that we have a broader remit than just looking at what is coming out of the universities.  We believe that we have to work with primary schools and the education system.  What we have pulled together, with the development board, is a community benefits group that includes the education boards and authorities in Dublin 12 and Dublin 8, Tusla, the Garda, the HSE and Dublin City Council, working with us to see how we can leverage this investment in an area that is socially deprived so that the whole area would benefit from that.

I have attended many meetings at which this project has been discussed.  Most of the issues have been exhausted.  It is important to reiterate Dr. Curtis's point about the positive role of those who are delivering the hospital.  I have made this point on many occasions.  Perhaps the Chairman and the other members of the committee are aware of the state of Temple Street Hospital and Crumlin hospital.  The witnesses are definitely aware of it.  When I was in the car park of Crumlin hospital nine years ago, I saw cranes lifting prefabricated theatres into the hospital.  I thought it was a waste of money because a new hospital was being built.  I am sure children are being served as well as possible in these prefabricated units, which have been in existence for nine years.  They represent an example of the facilities being given to our children.  I acknowledge that the negativity around this must be very difficult.  Dr. Curtis mentioned that a very good job has been done with planning and designing.  Our job as public representatives is to try to get value for money.  I never had a problem with the location when I studied it.  I have never had a problem with providing the best care for our children.  This is long overdue.  I am a big supporter of trilocation and would like a planning master plan to be delivered for the site.  I understand that the money is not there in the national development plan.  I understand the cascade of priority when it comes to the national maternity hospital being first on the list.  Many people who are looking at this project as it unfolds are losing the will to support it at times.  Many people support it because of the trilocation model and as the best provider of healthcare.  To my mind, the public anger has been about the money element.  It is just so much money.  That is where our job comes in.  We have to take money from elsewhere to pay for it.  It will be a fantastic hospital.  None of this criticism is personal.  We put ourselves in the public eye and take what we are given most of the time, much of which is deserved.  Many of the witnesses have received undue public criticism, but that is just the way it goes.  I will support them in any way I can as they continue their challenging job of delivering the new hospital.  Many of us would sleep easier at night if we could see a maternity hospital happening in the near future, perhaps if we have a few pounds to spend on another hospital in the next plan.  I thank the witnesses for their work and for their time this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#U01000","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I will give Deputy Durkan the final word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061200002#U01100","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I apologise to my colleague whom I lampooned when he was unavoidably absent.

I am joined by my officials, Mr. Brendan Eiffe and Mr. James Moloney.  <\/p> <p>  The issue under discussion is whether Ireland should opt in to the new Eurojust regulation and thereby maintain its membership of Eurojust.  It is my view that Ireland should opt in and that the Oireachtas should approve the necessary resolutions to enable this to take place.  Members of the committee need to be aware that a consequence of not opting in to the regulation will be that Ireland will have to withdraw from membership of Eurojust.<\/p> <p>  It may be helpful if I provide some background information on the matter.  Eurojust is the European Union's agency for criminal justice co-operation.  Its role is to provide assistance for members in criminal investigations which involve two or more EU member states.  The structure of Eurojust is centred on a college of prosecutors comprising prosecutors from each of the member states.  The prosecutors are based in The Hague in the Netherlands and the college meets regularly to discuss cases which fall within the remit of the agency.  In Ireland's case, a prosecutor from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Dublin provides full-time representation on behalf of the State.  The college&rsquo;s primary role is assisting in clearing difficulties and logjams in multi-national criminal investigations and dealing with mutual legal assistance requests for evidence and surrenders under the European arrest warrant.  The location of EU prosecutors under one roof at Eurojust facilitates the rapid exchange of information and the addressing of issues of relevance.  The agency has contributed greatly in that regard and membership is highly valued among EU member states.  For example, despite its position on Brexit, the United Kingdom has opted in to the new regulation.<\/p> <p>  As I said, this is not about Ireland joining Eurojust but remaining a member because Ireland is and has been a member since the inception of the agency 17 years ago.  To clarify the position, Eurojust operates under the provisions of Council Decision 2002\/187\/JHA of 28 February 2002 setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious crime.  The new regulation under discussion retains many of the provisions and structures of its predecessor, but it also provides a framework for modernisation of the agency.  Because the new regulation comes within Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, TEU, and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, there is a necessity for the Oireachtas to agree that Ireland should accept the measure.<\/p> <p>  The main features of the new regulation are that, in Chapter II, Articles 6 to 18, inclusive, it revises Eurojust&rsquo;s governance structure by setting up an executive board to deal with administrative matters.  Therefore, Eurojust&rsquo;s college which consists of prosecutors from all EU member states can focus more strongly on operational issues.  The ever-increasing number of Eurojust cases requires a more efficient way of handling cases.  The new regulation will make Eurojust fit for this purpose.  It does not replace the successful core concept of the college of supporting national authorities in their investigations and discovering links between cases; rather, in Articles 2 to 5, inclusive, it confirms the current proactive role of Eurojust in its operational, strategic and tactical work.  In other words, the operational practices in place for the past 17 years and in which Ireland has played a part will not change.  This work involves co-ordinating approaches to the most serious forms of criminality, including murder, people trafficking, child sexual exploitation, drug trafficking and terrorism.<\/p> <p>  Chapter III which includes Articles 19 to 25, inclusive, deals with operational matters and provides details of the operational structure of Eurojust, including a 24\/7 on-call service for member states.  <\/p> <p>  Of major significance, in Chapter IV, Articles 26 to 46, inclusive, is that the new regulation brings Eurojust into line with the data protection rules the European Union adopted last year, the GDPR and associated law enforcement directive, and takes into account Eurojust&rsquo;s specific mandate to process data in the interests of fighting cross-border crime.  Eurojust&rsquo;s operations will also be subject to the scrutiny of the European Data Protection Supervisor as set out in Article 40.<\/p> <p>  In Chapter V the regulation addresses Eurojust co-operation agreements with third states and international organisations, both of which are subject to the aforementioned data protection provisions.  <\/p> <p>  Eurojust's operations and budget are subject to the scrutiny of the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  There is no expectation of a budgetary contribution from Ireland for the running of the agency.  Ireland's national member is remunerated by the State in the same manner as any official of the State who is assigned to duties overseas.  The small cost, when measured against the services made available to Ireland through membership, represents a small price to pay.<\/p> <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I am the central authority for the provision of international mutual legal assistance for and from other states.  In the past five years the volume of cases dealt with has doubled and is set to increase by more than 50% per annum.  These statistics alone illustrate the increasingly transnational nature of serious crime.  In the four years up to the end of 2018 the Irish desk at Eurojust handled more than 800 cases with an Irish dimension.  They included cases involving serious international fraud, sexual offences and the trafficking of vulnerable young women into the State for the purpose of engaging them in prostitution.  Transnational problems require transnational approaches.  As Minister, I must ensure a comprehensive response to this issue and the State&rsquo;s continued membership of Eurojust plays an essential part in this response.<\/p> <p>  Taking into account that the core function of Eurojust is to assist in criminal investigations, the fact that it has a proven track record in this area over 17 years and is subject to the most advanced data privacy protection regime in the world, there are few who would argue that it would not be desirable for Ireland to remain a member.  It seems that there is an issue of principle.  It cannot just be about what Ireland receives.  It is about playing an active part in the European Union and ensuring the welfare of its citizens.  Notwithstanding the negative effect on criminal investigations in the State, our EU colleagues would see an Irish withdrawal from Eurojust as a negative development.  I need not remind committee members that in recent times Ireland has relied heavily on the solidarity and support of other member states.  Membership of the European Union brings with it a responsibility to act collectively to help to solve the problems and threats the Union faces.  Serious crime is certainly one of those threats.  It would be unfortunate if Ireland was perceived, on the one hand, as seeking the support of the other members and, on the other, not being willing to play a part in the advancement and betterment of the European project.<\/p> <p>  As I said recently in response to a parliamentary question on this matter from Deputy Wallace who is a member of the committee, there are few who would argue that Ireland's membership of the European Union has not been of enormous benefit to Ireland's citizens, both economically and in terms of the progressive social development of the State.  The freedoms enjoyed by EU citizens and the real and genuine protections afforded to their fundamental rights are the envy of many throughout the world.  This commitment to protecting fundamental rights is not some empty aspiration but a reality backed up by formal structures such as the European Court of Justice and the European Parliament.  The freedom of movement EU citizens enjoy is one very clear benefit of membership of the European Union.  Unfortunately, there are always those who will seek to exploit privileges such as freedom of movement for their own nefarious ends and much recent EU law in the criminal justice sphere has been aimed at trying to counter the abuse of these freedoms, while also protecting them.  The European arrest warrant is one such example.  Another is Eurojust.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I do not believe it would be desirable to lose membership of Eurojust.  International serious crime is an issue which affects all member states and their citizens and has countless victims.  Co-ordination of measures to disrupt this activity and ongoing communication between states on such measures are not only desirable but essential.  Eurojust provides an efficient and effective way of ensuring this co-operation occurs.  I can think of no rational coherent reason Ireland should not be involved.  Therefore, I commend the motions to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#D00100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for coming.

We were members of the working group appointed by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  It was our job on the working group to represent the interests of children and young people and a lot of our work was informed by our member organisations, which put significant time and investment into the working group process.  The human rights issues I witnessed during that time were some of the worst I had ever witnessed.  There was huge institutionalisation, not only of the people living in the system but of the people working in the system and managing it.  There was huge overcrowding, hunger and welfare issues, mental health issues and issues of basic human dignity.  One of the only positives I saw was that children were able to go to school and that made a big difference, both to children and families.  By and large, though, they were living in abject poverty, isolation and exclusion.<\/p> <p>  There have been significant changes since the working group process.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs carried out a consultation with children and young people in the direct provision system and, while some of what they found was very disturbing, there has been some action on it by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The direct provision payment for children was &euro;9.60 for a 15-year period but it has now increased to the McMahon recommendation of &euro;29.80.  The first increase was by Deputy Joan Burton when she was Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and another was made by Deputy Leo Varadkar, with the most recent increase being put in place by the current Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty.  The Ombudsman for Children can now take complaints from children in direct provision.  There was no public oversight of the direct provision system at the time and it was allowed to continue with poor procurement procedures, no public oversight by bodies such as Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and no proper complaints mechanisms, meaning that ill treatment and maladministration were allowed to continue.  There have been improvements in cooking facilities and a significant work has gone into the development of national standards for refugee accommodation.  Our view of how to change direct provision is that we need to accommodate families in own-door accommodation in small clusters, with social care from people working on site.<\/p><p>Some of these families are very vulnerable but, at the same time, they were being institutionalised in these institutions by people with no experience of working in direct provision or working with refugees at all.  In our view, the national standards could provide for that.  One key recommendation is that families should be in own-door accommodation.<\/p><p> Another improvement was a reduction of overcrowding over the period.  There was certainly an effort to try to address that because it was inhumane.  While on the working group, one centre I visited had four women living in a hotel room with their beds side by side.  They spoke different languages and had been living like that for four years.  That was the kind of overcrowding we were seeing at that time.  <\/p><p> The last improvement is that people who had been in the system for five years or more had their claims expedited and several thousand refugees got out of direct provision as a result.<\/p><p> In terms of where we go next, I must say that some of these improvements are being overshadowed by the fact that we have more than 500 people seeking asylum, including children, now in these emergency accommodation facilities that are very close to situations where children are living in homeless accommodation.  They and their health needs have not been assessed.  We are concerned that some of the children do not have access to schools, nor do the parents have support to find a school, and we are also concerned about child protection issues in these centres.  Direct provision centres must comply with Children First procedures and have a dedicated liaison person.  We do not know what is happening with these emergency centres and we are concerned about that.<\/p><p> We must implement the national standards that are yet to be published if we are serious about changing the system.  We also must have unannounced public inspections.  It is not good enough for a private operator to look at whether the provider complies with the contract.  We must have a body like HIQA.  That is the only way we will get the assurance that we will never go back to the direct provision of the past.<\/p><p> The last point I want to bring to the attention of the committee is in the area of welfare and child protection.  We know at the moment that, within the Reception and Integration Agency, the role of social worker who has overall responsibility for overseeing the system has been vacant since November.  That is a long time.  At the same time, we have emergency facilities opening.  Who is the watchdog?  Who is keeping an eye on what is happening for these children throughout the system and in these emergency facilities?  <\/p><p> I also want to bring attention to unaccompanied minors within the system.  The working group met many of them and the Children's Rights Alliance has met many since.  Many of our member organisations have been communicating with us and the main issue coming from them is that oftentimes asylum applications for unaccompanied minors are not being lodged by the social worker when they arrive in the country.  They are discovering this at the age of 18, at which stage they are often sent into the direct provision system.<\/p><p> In summary, there have been significant changes since the working group report.  There are also significant challenges which must be dealt with.  I absolutely think those challenges are not insurmountable and can be addressed through good decision making and by using the evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>We have two Fionas before us.

Nasc is an NGO and a charity that works with people seeking protection.  We work with refugees, migrants and their families to realise and fulfil their rights.  Nasc runs a free legal information and drop-in service that supports 1,300 people annually.  We also deliver outreach to the five direct provision centres in Cork city and county.  Nasc was also a member of the working group on direct provision and the protection process and a member of the advisory group established to develop national standards for direct provision.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the fact that the committee are examining both our asylum reception system direct provision and also the protection process, as the two are inextricably linked and cannot be viewed or repaired in isolation.  Given the breadth of the committee's remit, I will focus on a few key issues and recommendations that have emerged based on our 19 years' experience working with protection applicants and other NGOs on these issues.  <br\/><br\/>The journalist Masha Gessen had a piece on direct provision in <i>The New Yorker<\/i>magazine last week, titled, &quot;Ireland's strange, cruel system for asylum seekers&quot;.  Most Irish people would not find it strange that the State's chosen model for reception of people seeking protection is one of institutionalisation.  Historically we have always institutionalised, excluded and contracted out the care of vulnerable adults and children.  It is clear from listening to the powerful testimonies from members of the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI, at the last hearing that our for-profit, institutional model of reception fails to respect the human dignity of asylum seekers in Ireland.  Our current reception system takes an out of sight, out of mind attitude leading to a systematic and structural othering of people seeking protection.  <br\/><br\/>It must also be acknowledged and welcomed that there now exists a real openness within the Department of Justice and Equality and in some political quarters to radically change and overhaul our protection system.  This is building upon a number of important positive changes that have already been made in recent years including opting into the reception conditions directive, which puts our reception system on a statutory footing for the first time and provides additional remedies and protections for applicants including a vulnerability assessment; the granting of open access to the labour market for protection applicants who have not had a first instance decision on their application within nine months; and, the development of national standards, which when implemented will apply to all accommodation centres.  We have had an increase in the weekly allowance of &euro;38.80 for adults and &euro;29.80 for children.  Notwithstanding these improvements, serious structural and systemic issues remain and will continue to prevail for as long as we retain the current institutionalised for-profit model of asylum reception.  <br\/><br\/>Many of the underlying issues caused by for-profit institutionalisation and lack of oversight or accountability remain.  We recognise that dismantling a system that has been embedded for almost two decades is challenging and will not and cannot happen overnight.  However, there are a number of critical steps that urgently need to be taken to begin to move us towards a protection and reception system that addresses and respects the fundamental human rights of protection applicants.  First, delays in the determination process have been a constant feature of our protection process.  The current median wait time for processing of applications now stands at 15 months.  This is a long way off the promised six-month wait time originally cited when the International Protection Act 2015 was enacted.  In our experience, the wait time with no upper limit is one of the primary issues raised to us by applicants.  Additional staff and resources must be allocated to the international protection office to ensure that it can deal with all applications on hand at any one time in a timely and efficient manner.  <br\/><br\/>Secondly, chapter of 3 of the McMahon report which deals with the determination process provides a number of very clear, unanimously agreed but yet to be implemented recommendations aimed at improving the process.  These include consideration of introducing a rolling system whereby all persons in the protection system for five years or more should be granted a protection status or permission to remain if they have co-operated with the process in line with statutory obligations, an annual review of the system with a view to making recommendations to guard against any future backlogs and introducing mechanisms to regularly review the quality of decision making.  The civil Legal Aid Board must also be properly resourced to ensure that applicants have access to effective, early legal advice.  <br\/><br\/>As was demonstrated in the McMahon report, a reduction in processing times and improvements to the decision-making process not only benefit protection applicants, but in the long run will result in cost savings to the State.  These recommendations were made in conjunction with multiple Departments and were unanimously agreed as significant steps to improve the protection process.  They must now be implemented in line with the McMahon report.  <br\/><br\/>In addition to implementing the above recommendations, with regard to short to medium-term improvements to the material conditions for those living in the current system, we call upon the Government to introduce with immediate effect the vulnerability assessment which is provided for under Article 21 of the reception conditions directive.  This obligates member states to take into account the special reception needs of vulnerable applicants.  This is a legal requirement and not an optional extra.  We would also recommend that the national standards are published and implemented and that an appropriate, independent inspectorate body such as HIQA be appointed as the inspectorate to implement the standards.  In line with the McMahon report, all families should have their own private living space and adequate cooking facilities must be installed in all centres.  <br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the longer-term changes that need to be made to create a protection system that is reflective of the key tenets of a modern democracy, a system that respects privacy and human dignity.  We fully agree with the recommendation of the Irish Refugee Council that responsibility for the provision of reception to protection applicants should not be under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality as its expertise does not lie in the provision of housing and social care.<\/p><p>A housing policy approach needs to be employed.  A cross-governmental response is needed as the issues that need to be addressed are multifaceted and cut across a number of Departments.  Similar approaches are commonly employed by other jurisdictions, such as Canada and Australia, when seeking to address critical social issues.<\/p><p> We need to move from our current reliance on private accommodation providers and create the conditions upon which approved housing bodies with expertise in the provision of housing and social care can provide suitable self-contained accommodation for protection applicants.  This will require changes to the tendering process and to social housing funding streams to allow for a variety of accommodation types in the community.  We need to move away from institutional settings.  The State should also build fit-for-purpose self-contained housing units.  The accommodation provided must be a blend of independent and supported living to cater for the needs of all applicants.  Requisite supports should be provided.<\/p><p> It has been four years since the publication of the McMahon report and, like most reports, compromises were made on both sides to achieve a consensus.  While the report is by no means perfect, it contains clear and important recommendations which, if implemented, would greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our determination procedure, and would provide a good starting point for a more fundamental realignment of our protection and reception system.  The lack of implementation of some key recommendations is possibly why, four years later, we are here today.  All the while, the real human casualties of the Government&rsquo;s inaction are the men, women and children living in limbo, waiting in a system that as Gessen cogently noted, &ldquo;boils the process of seeking asylum down to its essence: waiting&rdquo;.<\/p><p> I thank the committee members.  I would be happy to answer any questions they may have on our statement.  Within the bundle of submissions we have provided, there is also a submission from Amach! LGBT, the group that was supporting Sylva Tukula.  As the committee knows, that issue arose in the media last week when it was discovered that Sylva was buried without her LGBT family in Galway and her friends and family in the Great Western Hotel ever having been notified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Finn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am an associate professor in UCD school of law, and human rights legal obligations and the system of direct provision has been a topic of my published research for some time.  I have provided the committee with a full submission and wish to highlight some of my key recommendations, which I invite the committee to consider.  These include recommendations on better respecting and protecting the right to work for international protection applicants and reducing the length of time before applicants can access the labour market, as well as ensuring this includes all international protection applicants, given many, due to legacy issues, may not be provided with the right to work.  I invite the committee to recognise that direct provision, in and of itself, is a gross violation on the rights of the child and, indeed, all persons who may be subjected to this system.  I echo many of the recommendations based on the detailed expertise of the Children's Rights Alliance and Nasc and would further call for an increase in the direct provision allowance, now called the daily expenses allowance.  In particular, as a first step, we must ensure that all children within direct provision receive the payment of child benefit.  This can be achieved through an amendment to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.<\/p> <p>  I also make a number of recommendations on aged-out separated children, who are children who enter Ireland aged under 18 without a parent or guardian.  Once they reach the age of 18, they are moved into direct provision.  The direct provision system, as an institutionalised system, is absolutely not appropriate for aged-out separated children.  As the committee has heard over previous weeks and again today, the system of direct provision is one that sets human rights at naught and destabilises and impacts negatively on the rights of the child, the rights of families and the rights of individuals subject to this system.  Established as a system that was intended to last no more than six months, as Ms Finn mentioned, we now have a system of institutionalised living which many international protection applicants will be subjected to for many years.<\/p> <p>  The role of law and State administration to date as regards the needs of persons within the international protection system is one that rejects international protection applicants as being holders of human rights.  The State&rsquo;s approach to international protection applicants has sought to justify years of institutionalised living, years of the inability to do something as simple as decide what to eat and when to eat, years of having to live in hostel-style accommodation, with little to no say about who they can or must interact with, and years of children never seeing their parents or guardians prepare a meal except under the watchful eye of accommodation managers.<\/p> <p>  What value is the phrase \"human rights\" where the right to decide such intimate and basic aspects of one&rsquo;s life is withdrawn for years, without any end date?  Convicted of no crime, international protection applicants are segregated from Irish society and condemned to live a half-life.  That so many other countries in the European Union treat persons seeking international protection considerably worse than Ireland is no justification for Ireland refusing to respect, protect, vindicate and fulfil the full array of human rights which all individuals, including international protection applicants, have under the State's freely accepted international human rights legal obligations.<\/p> <p>  Based on my analysis of the law, policy and administration of the system of direct provision, I have concluded that the direct provision system is not fit for purpose and should be abolished.  Alternatives to the system must respect, protect, vindicate and fulfil all human rights - civil, political, economic, social and cultural - while persons within the international protection system have their claims for international protection assessed.  Failures in State administration for timely determination on whether an individual meets the definition of being in need of protection is no defence to the significant rights violations to which international protection applicants have been subjected for almost 20 years.<\/p> <p>  Replacing direct provision may not happen overnight.  There will be cost implications, as protecting human rights is never cost-free.  However, from nearly 20 years of testimony on the lived experience of international protection applicants and human rights-based research, much of it conducted by NASC, the Children's Rights Alliance and the Irish Refugee Council, one thing is very clear: Direct provision was and still is a gross breach of the most fundamental human right we all should have - the right to dignity and respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Thornton"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Thornton and all of the contributors.

The committee has covered a lot of ground in the last few weeks and will cover more in the next few weeks.  I agree with the witnesses, and I have no doubt, that this is a gross violation of the rights of children and families.  It is truly shocking.  What we have heard over recent weeks has, for me, been really upsetting, shocking and frustrating.<\/p> <p>  I want to highlight certain points.<\/p><p>In the context of housing, I have heard two important messages.  The first of these is that the responsibility for protection should not fall to the Department of Justice and Equality given that its expertise does not lie in the areas of housing or social care.  Second, Ms Finn stated we need to move away from institutionalisation and described the current approach as \"out of sight, out of mind\", where asylum seekers are isolated and kept at a distance.  She suggested that after a short initial period of reception, it would be better to have a form of owned or clustered accommodation embedded in communities.  Will she expand on how that might work in practice while ensuring that support and services are available?<\/p><p> An important point made every week is the need for common standards and oversight to prevent abuse.  All our guests have suggested HIQA as a suitable body.  I have no doubt it is crucial.  It is an important recommendation that we as a committee must follow.  At a minimum, we need common standards for reception and oversight with teeth to investigate and prevent abuse.  If two asylum seekers arrive in Ireland, one may be sent to a centre with cooking facilities, better transport and more space, whereas the other, through no fault of his or her own, may end up in a centre with none of the above.  It does not seem right that pure chance is the decider.  From Dr. Thornton's presentation, it seems that on a human rights basis, we should ensure that every applicant is treated equally as a baseline and that his or her specific needs or challenges are taken into account.  Will Dr. Thornton elaborate on that?  If the Chairman allows, I will follow up with further questions after our guests respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#G00500","speaker":"1408","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":404,"content":"<p>On the alternatives, the Department of Justice and Equality having sole care and responsibility for protection applicants has not worked for the past 20 years, which is a lesson we have learned.  We need to do something more radical.  I agree with our colleagues in the Refugee Council that while it is not a housing issue per se, housing is one of the main components of how we care for international protection applicants.  In our engagement with approved housing bodies, AHBs, which have significant expertise in housing and social care, they have indicated that the structure of the current tendering process does not suit them because it is very much focused on institutional, large, congregated settings.  AHBs have a clear ethos and mission but the process does not match with that.  We need to start doing work and to engage directly with AHBs.  We must move the model away from large, institutional settings, the smallest of which, based on the tenders, houses approximately 50 people.  For AHBs, however, 50 is far too many and does not fit with their ethos.  We are considering small, pepper-potted forms of accommodations and settings, moving away from the larger settings.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality should look to build for-purpose reception centres and units.  The bottom line for any new reception centre is that it would have to be own-door accommodation in self-contained units, where families can live together.  Many have argued asylum seekers should be allowed to live in the community and have access to full housing and social welfare, which is another option.  That has been tried in other jurisdictions but the Scottish model has presented several issues and challenges because many vulnerable protection applicants have been left isolated in communities.  We are examining the system that best suits protection applicants rather than one that creates an institutional setting, places protection applicants into that and expects them somehow to fit in to the system.  We need to change our thinking about the matter and to start considering different models.  It is clear our current model of institutional housing of protection applicants is not working.  Tinkering with it will not change the fundamental, underlying faults of the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Finn"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>If our guests wish to comment on something about which a member may not have directly asked, they are very welcome to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#H00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I fully support what Ms Finn proposes.  On the wraparound services and the approach that might work, a good example is the area-based childhood initiatives, which are run by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in conjunction with Tusla.  When those programmes were being set up, an area was asked to pitch an initiative or programme.  Many providers came together, formed a steering committee, developed various approaches and ran them in the community.  There are many examples of how services can be provided to vulnerable people and many success stories of how it works.  We could borrow from that as a solution.<\/p> <p>  Under the Scottish model Ms Finn mentioned, I understand that people are placed in housing communities.  A potential solution is that an AHB could lease properties in various parts of the country where density is lower.  If that is done, however, there must be wraparound services for the people in question.<\/p> <p>  There are many solutions.  It is a matter of thinking big and not reproducing the same results.

I should know, however, because within normal structures of decision-making, if people are to be sent to one centre or another, documents should outline what criteria will be used to make the decision.  If such an internal policy exists in the Reception and Integration Agency, I have never seen it and I am inclined to believe that it does not.  As Ms Finn and Ms Ward outlined, there are significant pressures on the direct provision system, which might mean the system is in crisis-management mode, where people are moved into direct provision if there is space, or into hotels if not.  When there are several applicants, I do not know the rationale for making the decision.  I should know, however, as we all should, the basis for making decisions on dispersal.<br\/><br\/>In the context of standards within institutionalised settings, I would exercise a note of caution.  When one begins by stating that there could be standards to watch over settings which, <i>per se<\/i>, grossly violate human rights, it gives some form of comfort that the system is fine.  While they may be appropriate now, when we are not moving away from direct provision, we should proceed with a note of caution about the standardisation of everything.  We do not have standardisation in our lives, but due to the USA's failure to realise properly the rights of those in the international protection system, we suddenly need such standards.  Where possible and appropriate, human beings need to live free to make decisions such as where and what to cook, and where and with whom to sleep.  When we start outlining standards, such as requiring that a room be a certain size, it begins to decide intimate aspects of people's lives, something I find uncomfortable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Thornton"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":408,"content":"<p>The right to work has arisen frequently and I am passionate about the issue.<\/p><p>We heard a story a couple of weeks ago from a family man, who said: \"All I want to do is work.  Just let me come home to my children and tell them I went to work today.  I do not even want payment.\"  He just wants to get up in the morning, do a day's work and come home to tell his children what he did.  It is for his own pride.  Many asylum seekers said they found the process very limited so far and difficult to access.  Dr. Thornton mentioned that applicants can work after nine months if no first-instance decision has been received.  As I understand it, nine months is the minimum standard allowed under the EU reception conditions directive but there is nothing stopping us setting this at, for example, six months.  Am I correct in saying that?  Will Dr. Thornton comment?<\/p><p> If we say the right to work is fundamental to human dignity and well-being, why is it only available to those without a first instance decision?  Surely if an appeals process is permitted, which can take time, those rightly awaiting an appeal should have just as much of a need to work, provide for their families and use their skills.  I also ask about the likelihood of legal action against the State.  Dr. Thornton's longer submission focuses on the various fundamental rights that are being denied by the system, such as privacy, autonomy and decision-making, as well as the rights of children.  Section D of the submission covers socio-economic rights, which are guaranteed by human rights instruments.  We have already seen a limited right to work extended as a result of legal challenge.  In Dr. Thornton's view, could we see further legal challenges on human rights grounds?

She is absolutely correct in identifying that Ireland only adopted the minimum standard or obligation with the nine-month period under international human rights law  Ireland may be before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in November or December this year.  With other European Union countries, that UN human rights treaty body has stated, six months may be a more appropriate minimum period.  As I emphasised in my full submission, perhaps we can go beyond that minimum human rights standard.  The EU reception directive does not comply with minimum human rights standards with regard to the delay in accessing work where a first-instance decision is not made.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely concur with the Senator's analysis that work is so fundamental to human dignity and well-being, perhaps we should consider the degree the people with a negative first-instance decision would be permitted to work while they await the outcome of their appeal before the International Protection Appeals Tribunal.  I will not go into the precise details contained in my longer submission but there has been interpretation given to the 2018 reception regulations.  It indicates that once people have waited nine months, regardless of whether this was before the 2018 regulations came into force and whether they got a negative decision afterwards and are be awaiting appeal, they should be permitted to work.  The decision maker for the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, when she was making a later decision, indicated that felt she had got that wrong so she resiled and stated that she did not want to continue with her incorrect interpretation of law which she might have applied.  A significant number of people are still awaiting appeal outcomes having waited for first-instance decisions for well over nine months but they cannot work.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the likelihood of legal action against the State, we have seen attempted legal action before in a case concerning applicants known as CA and TA.  One of the core arguments in the case was that the direct provision system was a violation of the right to private and family life under the Constitution and the European Convention of Human Rights Act 2003.  That case failed because Mr. Justice Colm Mac Eochaidh said the applicants, Ms CA and her child, TA, had not provided the requisite legal standard of proof to demonstrate that in the instance, their right to private and family life had been violated.  The honourable judge outlined his feeling that direct provision is an exceptionally alien environment for any sort of child to be reared in or even in which to go about one's normal life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Thornton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>We made a number of recommendations on the right to work in our longer submission.

This would not be particularly difficult and it could even be done as a matter in an administrative scheme.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of practical difficulties.  For people with the right to work, that right is relatively broad in comparison with other jurisdictions.  For those who have the right, it is good, but there are some small limitations that make a difference.  Working in the legal clinics we get quite a few phone calls from employers because they do not understand the piece of paper that people have, as it is quite different from what other non-European Economic Area nationals would have.  They ring us for information.  There should be an information campaign run by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, perhaps, to educate employers about asylum seekers' right to work.  The permission is for six months but most employers do not want to invest in an employee for six months; one would not train somebody in a relatively high-skilled job for a six-month period.  If the permission lasted 12 months, it would definitely encourage employers.  We explained that the permission is renewable after six months but the six-month duration feels very limited.<\/p> <p>  There are also practical barriers regarding access to driving licences and bank accounts, and I know these have been mentioned in other hearings as well.  This demonstrates the need for multi-agency and multi-departmental involvement in issues relating to international protection applicants.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport could resolve the driving licence issue.  It was not a problem years ago and it is something that has happened over approximately the past two years.  Many people are living in relatively rural or very small urban settings and there is just no way for them to get to work.  They are living in settings that often have low levels of employment and they are very much limited in what they can access.  It needs to be resolved so people can enjoy the rights they have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Hurley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>Will Ms Ward speak a little more about how children are institutionalised and the long-term impact on their mental health?  I again highlight the case of Sylva Tukula, which was absolutely horrifying.  It was devastating to hear what happened.  She died in direct provision and, as was mentioned, she was buried with no friends or loved ones present.  That is heartbreaking and the fact she was buried alone sums up the cruelty of the system and the indignity to which it gives rise.  This highlights a fundamental problem, which is that the direct provision system is a patchwork, with cracks all over the place with human beings slipping through them.  In this case four or five agencies were involved, including the Garda, the Department, the Reception and Integration Agency, the coroner and centre management but nobody really took responsibility.  It is not good enough to state that there was a breakdown in communication.  Are these types of gaps in the system common?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#J00400","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I will address the first part of that and then hand over to my colleague.  One of the big things for children living in the direct provision system is the effect of institutionalisation on them and their parents.  Children live through this.  One of the best official insights is the HIQA report of 2015, which considered the social work services that were being provided to people in direct provision.  What those whom compiled the report found was children who were hungry, who did not have enough clothes or who did not have access to toys or play facilities.  These are very basic things that are part of childhood and that are needed for development.  They found a lot of welfare issues.  The big issue that was coming through as impacting on children was the mental health of the parents.  Parents were living through years of a system where they were not cooking for themselves and were reliant on everyone else for everyday decisions without knowing what was going to happen in the future.  When I went around to those centres, I asked people about the child protection issues and the parents would say, \"I am the person my child is most at risk from.  I am breaking down.  I cannot take this any more.\"  The Child Care Law Reporting Project shows that there is a very significant number of cases.  They are over-represented in the numbers of children taken into care.  Children have been taken from parents whose mental health has broken down because of the direct provision system.<\/p> <p>  The other effects of institutionalisation that we see relate to how children are being treated by centre owners and managers.  In one centre, we might find children being treated very well and seeming to have a very good rapport with the people running the system.  In another centre, we could find that the children are completely institutionalised and tell us lots of different accounts of things.  In one instance, a child told me how they were in the kitchen in the catering facility and they saw the staff making smoothies in the kitchen.  The kids got really exciting thinking they were for them; they had never had a smoothie before.  The staff saw the kids and slammed the door.  The kids realised the smoothies were not for them, they were actually for the staff.  That was what was actually taking place.  We hear lots of accounts like that because the staff themselves are institutionalised.  They are subjecting the children to ill treatment and maladministration, essentially.  That is what is happening.<\/p> <p>  The other thing we see a lot is poverty.  Hunger was a massive thing.  Particularly in one centre in Athlone, the food was really appalling.  The children were in school until 3 p.m. or 4 p.m.  The parents had been given a bag of deep-fried food, spring rolls, white rice and so on.  It was inedible for the children by the time they came home from school.  That was not the case with all centres either.  It meant the children did not eat and because they were only on &euro;9.60 a week, the parents did not have any kind of supplementary income to buy other food for the children.  Obesity was also coming up because the kind of food that was being provided for children was so poor.<\/p> <p>  Children also talked to us about how ashamed they were to tell everyone they were living in direct provision.  They would avoid play dates.  If they were asked to go to a birthday party, they would say they were not available because they did not have the money to buy a birthday present.  Parents talked about having to make these really difficult choices, such as, \"I would love to send my kids to the local hurling club.  I know it is only &euro;2 or &euro;3 but the problem is I need to buy a bottle of Calpol.  How do I afford one over the other?\"  The increase in direct provision payments has been very important for those very basic things, so children can participate in everyday life.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that if we are going to mind children and give parents the best opportunity to be parents, they have to be cooking for their own families.  They have to have their own front doors.  The kind of things we were hearing included that a parent was not allowed leave a 14 year old in the main reception room.  Children were not allowed to be left on their own.  That is not good from a child development point of view.  Children need to grow.  They need to play on their own sometimes.  They need to be away from their parents, particularly as they get older and they want to become more independent.  It goes back to the need for own-door accommodation whereby children can have a normal childhood near communities and not in isolation, so they can mix in with Irish children and any other children and just have a normal childhood.<\/p> <p>  I want to return to the issue of unaccompanied minors that I mentioned earlier.  When I was on the working group, we met a lot of children.  \"Aged-out minors\" is the technical term.  I met one young guy who was about 19 and who had arrived in Ireland at the age of 12.  He had a Dublin accent.  I met him in Galway and saw him as another Dub.  He was really angry.  He was in this particular hostel where it is all men.  They eat together in the room while the security guard sits in a glass box.  The conditions are very prison-like.  What he was really angry about was that he had a family in Dublin and a life there.  He said that no one told him an application for protection had not been submitted for him.  He found out about it and then he got sent down there.  He said he had been ripped out of his community and the family he had in Dublin.  He asked why this happened, why no one told him in Tusla that this was going to happen to him.  There is a very particular legal issue pertaining to why that is happening.  I will pass over to my colleague, Ms Ahern, who has been coming across it through our legal advice service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":414,"content":"<p>We have known this was an issue through the members of our legal advice service.  They have been presenting us with anecdotal information about situations they hear of, particularly affecting young people who come into the system aged 16.  They are coming into the system as unaccompanied minors and there is no application put forward for them in the protection process.  We set up our legal information service last year and the issue has been cropping up.  I am hearing that young people have no knowledge that an application has to be made for them.  They have no knowledge of the implications.  It has key implications not only for what happens to them when they turn 18 but actually for their family reunification rights.  If an application is made when they are young, it is far easier for them to start applying for family reunification at that point as well.<\/p> <p>  What we are hearing suggests that there is not necessarily any devious motive behind it or anything.  People in authority are making a decision from the point of view of whether it will further harm the child but without considering what it will do the young person in the long term.  They might decide that they do not want a 16 year old to have to relive the experience but at 18 that young person is going to be put into direct provision.  We must ask if the system is fit for purpose if people are thinking it is going to further harm the child.  We need to look at child-friendly justice measures and different things that could be put in place to make sure that professionals do not have a fear of putting a 16 year old through an application process when it is in his or her best interest to get a status.  They system should be adapted so that this fear is not there.  We are going to continue to document this as part of our work.  We will track the trends but it is an issue that really needs to be highlighted.  It really does harm children who have no one else with them in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Julie Ahern"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I would add one more point on the mental health solution.  The research and best practice models from other countries are useful.  Some children in the refugee population will actually be very resilient and will not need any support, and some will be very damaged by what they have gone through.  It seems that in-school provision is best.  This means a psychologist is present within the school system.  The child can go and have sessions and get that kind of support.  We need to be thinking about what the school is doing in respect of a refugee child and what extra supports are set up.  Generally, when a special refugee mental health service is set up, it always gets defunded in recession times and the expertise is lost in the system.  We really need to equip the National Educational Psychological Service and the existing services to take on the needs of refugee children.  There is a significant gap.

There were certain procedures that had to be followed so they were going to follow them without ever thinking that she might have a family.  Family is much broader than having immediate next of kin.  That is a direct result of institutionalisation and how we treat protection applicants.<\/p> <p>  On the patchwork nature of the system, I agree with the Senator.  There are a lot of services available in direct provision and there are a lot of agencies involved in the provision of reception.  What is required is oversight, like a refugee advisory body.  It was recommended in McMahon and was also in the original Refugee Act 1996.

It might be because of welfare or because they are concerned about the nature of the protection process and do not want to put the child through it.

It is in the child's best interest to have the application made as early as possible and it is up to the State to adapt its system to ensure it is as child friendly as possible.

It is all about building resilience, independence and capacity.  As Dr. N&iacute; Raghallaigh has noted, once they turn 18, we tell them to go live in an institution where their meals are provided and they are given a few bob for themselves for the week.  The early part of their entry into Ireland is one where there is some form of wraparound care and then, when they are 18, they go into a hostel where every single decision possible is taken away from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Thornton"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Thornton.

We have had this debate over recent weeks, including with Mr. Justice McMahon.  While there may be points to incremental improvements, fundamentally direct provision is a bad system that continues to fail people's human rights.  I believe that not only has it lost the confidence of those in the system who have to suffer it, it has also lost the confidence of the public.<\/p> <p>  Even aside from the multiple human rights issues that exist in respect of it, it has been very bad value for money as well.  I have instanced that it has cost the taxpayer &euro;12.5 billion since 2001.  To house, if we want to call it that, a parent with two children costs &euro;40,000 a year through the direct provision system.  Much better and more private accommodation with greater dignity could be provided at much less cost than that.  From every perspective, the direct provision system is in urgent need of replacement.  What has been outlined is very much in accordance with my own views in terms of an integrated housing approach.  I advocated such an approach with the Minister in December last.  Even in response to Deputy O'Callaghan's points in terms of justice in housing, it is like any of these matters in that there has to be an intersection.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government cannot be expected to be responsible for making a determination on a person's application for international protection, but in so much as the person is to be provided with accommodation where that is needed immediately, there needs to be a housing approach to that.  Certain approved housing bodies can have a role in that.  I believe the private for-profit model that has underpinned this has been a significant problem.  The Children's Rights Alliance has dwelt a fair bit on this.  Is Dr. Thornton in agreement with that kind of approach that involves either approved housing bodies or some form of initiative led by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or by public housing?  Is that roughly what Dr. Thornton thinks?  I note there are many other issues relating to direct provision but I ask only in terms of bed and board accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#M00500","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I am not a housing specialist.  I do not have any expertise in housing policy.  However, how do we engage with others within the State who are not within the international protection system and who need support?  Welfare needs will be catered for by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Housing needs may be catered for either through - not that there is much - local authority housing or rent allowance, now the housing assistance payment.  I have issues with supports provided to asylum applicants not being mainstreamed.  A significant number of Departments are engaged with various issues, from the Department of Health to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to, obviously, the Department of Justice and Equality in the determination of claims.  Is there a need for absolutely and wholly separated systems while acknowledging there may be a much greater need for engagement and holistic supports for a small number of applicants?  From my limited lens from which I can offer advice to the committee on law, how in law we deal with those who may not have enough income?  We provide payment from social protection.  How do we deal with those who have homelessness imposed upon them or who have to access housing payment supports?  We have housing social protection.  For healthcare, there is the Department of Health.  For child needs, there is the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  My approach is that we have systems in place.  Let us utilise those systems, regardless of the legal status of international protection applicants, while acknowledging there will be a small number who will need a more interventionist approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Thornton"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I agree with much of what Dr. Thornton said.  It follows on from a previous point.  Applying for the mainstream system and having specific accommodation for people who are applying for international protection are not mutually exclusive.  The way the system is at present, unfortunately, for the entire population, a single applicant for housing would be in line for 11 or 12 years on a local authority housing list, particularly in the cities.  What makes sense to me is that a person would have own-door accommodation of a standard provided immediately but that he or she would be entitled to apply for local authority housing and, assuming the person could find it, which is difficult at present, he or she could apply for HAP just the same, but that that person would have that minimum standard to be able to work from.  If people are forced to wait for their applications to be processed and status to be granted, that could take three, four or five years or maybe more, and then another nine, ten, 11 or 12 years on top of that before they get accommodated.<\/p> <p>  Earlier, there was a fair bit of discussion on the unaccompanied minors.

It is quite difficult to get here.  There has been an issue with unaccompanied minors in Europe.  Many travelled to Europe.  Ireland has, by far, not taken the lion's share of them.  There was a situation, as the Deputy will be aware, with a number of young people at Calais.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla travelled there and offered full refugee protection, full services, accommodation etc., and only a small number of young people opted to come to Ireland.<\/p><p>That is really interesting but it also reflects what we know, namely, that people want to go to a country where they have family members.  They do not want to go to a country where they do not have anyone.  We are always told that if we make the direct provision system too good, everyone will want to come here and it will be a pull factor.  The research does not tell us that.  It tells us again and again that people go to a particular country either because a trafficker takes them there and they have no idea where they are going or they have family members there.<\/p><p> There are a small number of unaccompanied minors in the country and the system of reception for them is quite good.  The real issue is that their legal protection needs are not being effectively addressed.

That is the result of the silo approach being taken towards dealing with reception and international protection.  I am not sure what the Departments have concluded.  The question is whether responsibility for vulnerability assessment lies squarely with the Department of Justice and Equality or with the Department of Health.  It is somewhere in between.  A vulnerability assessment goes beyond a health screening.  Our sense is that this is a health issue but additional funding has to be provided to the HSE to deliver on the vulnerability assessment.<\/p> <p>  The other key point is that the vulnerability assessment is not just a once-off assessment.  It is not merely a case of someone having an initial assessment on arrival in Balseskin in which the authorities identify whether he or she has special reception needs.  Those special reception needs must be provided.  The authorities may assess someone and conclude he or she is not suitable to reside in a direct provision centre and that alternative accommodation must be provided.  Further to that, however, the vulnerability assessment must be ongoing.  Trauma may emerge six or eight months after people arrive in the country.  There must be sufficient services to detect and respond to that.<\/p> <p>  The standards provide a very good pathway for the delivery of the vulnerability assessment in all the centres on an ongoing basis.  The foundation blocks are in place and the standards have been agreed.  The vulnerability assessment is a legal obligation.  It has been in place for more than a year but has still not been implemented.  It is a critical element.

The location of some of the direct provision centres has been touched upon.  While I am certainly not of the view that all of those locations should be in Dublin, the location of some centres makes it impossible to attend appointments in Dublin using public transport.

Minimum standards must be an interim measure preceding the replacement of the entire direct provision system, although standards certainly have role.  That is my personal view but perhaps the witnesses have a view on the matter.  I imagine that when standards come into force a large number of direct provision centres will fall very far short of them.  What will happen then?  Is it possible that direct provision centres will be closed?  Will people be placed in emergency accommodation?  That thought occurs to me.  The number of asylum seekers in emergency accommodation is already high.  According to a reply I received to a parliamentary question, the figure is approximately 600.

There is no doubt that needs to happen.  The solution is that, first, the State should start developing a national housing policy for people seeking protection.  One of the key powers in the gift of the State is that it can start building.  There are great examples of accommodation provision, not necessarily in the refugee space but in other areas of provision such as for people with disabilities.  The State could build solid and sustainable accommodation which could be handed over to other people with a housing need in a particular area if it is not being used by people seeking protection.  There are many areas where that kind of housing and accommodation could be provided.<\/p> <p>  The second step, as Ms Finn stated, is to bring in not-for-profit housing providers.  All the research shows that when they provide housing it is pretty good and the outcomes are good for the people with whom they are working.  If the State made more money available to the approved housing providers they would be more likely to pitch for this type of accommodation.  There are many such providers.  If given resources and support, even for-profit providers in the disability space could produce own-door accommodation.  They could use the pepper pot model and have care providers on the staff.  This is not an insurmountable problem.  It is possible to do this.<\/p> <p>  The three elements involved are to launch a building programme, place tenders for not-for-profit providers to develop pepper pot type accommodation and then have providers lease housing and accommodation around the country where it is available.  This is possible because we know there are many vacant properties around the country.  The Government must make sure people are provided with the right services and support.  The solutions are all there.  There are plenty of housing providers and practitioners who will be happy to advise the Reception and Integration Agency.  The Government just needs to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#NN00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raised a question on standards.

It is very important that the committee visit several centres to get a true sense of the variety of conditions in them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the standards, current providers will have a two-year lead-in period.

However, we do not know what is happening in these emergency centres.  Do they have a designated liaison person?  Are child protection systems in place?  Do they have their statement?

The scale is becoming quite large.  It is an emerging issue and potentially an emerging scandal.<\/p> <p>  I have two more questions, related partly to what we are talking about and partly to direct provision generally.  Inspection and the ability to have oversight of what is happening in centres were raised.  When the State approves the optional protocol to the convention against torture, will it improve oversight at direct provision centres and all sorts of other locations?<\/p> <p>  When considering the structure and accommodation, do we need to address the culture in some of the institutions?  I believe the culture played a big part in what happened with Sylva Tukula.  I was on the radio about this matter and referred to the contrast with the case of Sean Parker, who was in London.  The local authority there went the extra mile to find somebody in Galway who would be able to give Sean a fitting, dignified burial and to ensure he would be properly remembered.  Nobody went the extra mile in the case of Sylva Tukula.  People can say they were not notified and that nobody told them.  Nobody went the extra mile or inch in that instance.  That, to me, speaks of a culture that extends not only to the RIA but also to the INIS.  The latter is excessively adversarial at times.  One of the most incredible sentences I read in my life was in a report to this committee referring to some of the witnesses who attended and some of the determinations made by INIS.  A determination refusing family reunification questioned the degree of destruction in Syria, saying it was noted that central Damascus had been relatively unscathed by the war in Syria.  I remember reading that and thinking it was just incredible.  Is there a cultural element in the INIS and RIA?  There are many good staff in those organisations doing their best for those fleeing conflict and seeking a better life here but is there an excessively adversarial attitude to applicants seeking international protection?

I would put it more strongly but I am not going to right now.  I fear it is much worse.  A culture of disbelief has been documented in several reports.  I recall documents obtained in a freedom of information request in 2008 that refer to a man who had a child with a woman and whose child was considered Irish because the woman was Irish.  The man was in a direct provision centre and he asked whether he could be moved to a direct provision centre closer to his girlfriend and child.  The case was referred to in the body of the email as another brain-teaser on direct provision.  The response was that there was no obligation on the man to remain in direct provision and that it was not the Department's business if he wanted to live near the mother and child, the implication being that he may have had access to his own funds.  That is just one example.  There are more recent examples.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection started to plan for the increases in the direct provision allowance around July of last year.  Quite wisely, it did not inform the Department of Justice and Equality until about 25 September 2018.  An official in the Department of Justice and Equality who was asked to offer a comment or express views began by saying, \"They are all working anyway.\"  These are two of many unfortunate examples I have and will, due to the 20th anniversary of the system of direct provision, be making available towards the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Thornton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I wish to build on Dr. Thornton's point on the cultural aspect.  Partially the issue is because the Department of Justice and Equality controls all the aspects of the life of somebody in international protection, for better or worse.  Its remit is to uphold the security of the State and engage in border control.  That is its mindset rather than one based on human care or a compassionate approach.<\/p> <p>  With regard to moving the accommodation to the housing providers, there are many reasons why that is so important.  Those coming through our clinics and talking to us are aware their accommodation is provided by the Department of Justice and Equality, the same body that is considering their asylum applications.  No matter how many pieces of paper reassure them the two things are separate and that if they make a complaint about one, it will not have an impact on the other, they are not reassured.  Having the Department in charge of all that is very problematic because there are so many areas of control.<\/p> <p>  Disbelief was mentioned.  The Deputy quoted a document referring to Damascus.  I have come across several visa letters with a similar response.  In at least one of the cases, the person was not living in central Damascus, but in the suburbs.  This is something we come across.  Applications such as those Dr. Thornton talked about, for example, the application of someone in direct provision who wanted to move to be closer to family, are routinely refused.  Again, this is because cases are being considered from an immigration and control point of view.  Moving responsibility away from the Department of Justice and Equality to another provider would definitely be very helpful in shifting the culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Hurley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560294000,"counter":461,"content":"<p>As has been said, there are many good staff working in the system.  That is my experience but the kinds of examples Dr. Thornton is describing point to a system in which staff have not been held accountable for their treatment of people.  We are talking about a very exceptional set of circumstances in Irish political life in which one organisation was not subject to any scrutiny by any public body.  This is the kind of stuff that happens ultimately.  Organisational cultures set in.  Moreover, institutionalisation is a factor.  The staff in the system become institutionalised and embedded, and committed to the system.  Bearing in mind the findings in the Ryan report and other institutional abuse reports, people working within a system really buy into it, try to reproduce it and hold on to it.  Obviously, change is important within this space.<\/p> <p>  The other thing we came across when we were on the working group was the notion of care.  There was a nearly constant battle.  It was said that the Department does not do care, just accommodation.  One would not get that if one worked in other areas or other Departments because there is an understanding that there is a vulnerable population requiring care.  The change to the national standards is acceptance that care is now part of what should be offered.  That is why we are keen to have the changes implemented as soon as possible.  Whoever provides the service will have to have a care component and social care workers on site who can deal with people's needs.<\/p> <p>  Establishing HIQA's role will be key.  Where HIQA carries out unannounced inspections, it absolutely does change practice.  HIQA involvement is not expensive.  We were trying to work out how much it would cost and went to HIQA to find out.  When it had about 4,000 in the system, it said it would involve four inspectors and two administrators.  This pointed to a cost much cheaper than we thought.  All that would be needed, therefore, is a change to the health Act to give HIQA a role in this area.  It has already dealt with accommodation for vulnerable people.  It could take this on.  It has already been involved in cluster-type accommodation and independent living.  It has the expertise.  It is very simple to do.

In general, its function was just to oversee the determinations process and consider asylum policy.  The board was to meet every two years and to lay a report before the Oireachtas.  It was a very good model because there was accountability for decision makers.  The board was to meet four times a year.  We were looking at the advisory board.  Given the fact that there are a number of other agencies involved in the delivery of direct provision, including Tusla to deal with issues arising specifically around children as well as bodies dealing with LGBTQ issues, we may be looking at broadening that advisory board with reference to something like the model of the working group.  For all its faults and failings, the working group worked very well as a cross-departmental body.  A board might meet quarterly with reports being provided by each relevant Department on progress and issues arising and that information might then be made public.  There is a very strong case to be made for looking in particular at the actual protection process for determinations whereby the model set out in the 1996 Act is followed to provide a biannual report to be laid before the Oireachtas.  That would provide a strong degree of oversight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Finn"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I am happy enough with that response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#P00700","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1560294000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Ms Ward's comment on HIQA and the impact of unannounced visits was interesting.

The committee feels the visits are an important part of the address of the issue, especially for members who have not visited either centre before.  I have been to both.  We will also be in the land of emergency accommodation as there are many so-called clusters in that part of the country I am honoured to represent.  Unfortunately, it is not something of which the people there are most proud.<\/p> <p>  I thank all of our guests very much indeed.  They are the last representatives of the NGO sector to come before us.  We are dealing with officials at our final hearing next week.  On behalf of the committee, I thank Ms Ward and Ms Ahern, who have attended previously.  It was lovely to have them back and I thank them for their contributions.  I thank the two Fionas, Ms Finn and Ms Hurley, who have travelled from Cork.  I had expected Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire to start off there as he has a tendency to relate to home base first.  However, he did not and put Dr. Liam Thornton in that position.  I thank Dr. Thornton also, who had perhaps the shortest journey to be with us today.  I wish the witnesses the very best.  We invite them to join us for a photograph at the conclusion of the meeting.  Further, I put them on notice that we will extend an invitation to them when we publish our report in the autumn.  We hope that our deliberations over the remaining period will lead to a report with which our guests will find satisfaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061200002#P01000","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560294000,"counter":474,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 11.25 a.m. until 9 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 June 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
