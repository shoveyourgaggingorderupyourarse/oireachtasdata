campaigns for the each of the four regional experience brands, as well as media publicity, digital channels, and online sales platforms.\u00a0 All four regional brands are being promoted across a mix of TV, press, radio, digital and social and there is a new press campaign also showcasing the regions.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, through its &lsquo;Keep Discovering&rsquo; campaign, F&aacute;ilte Ireland promotes individual destinations from Donegal to Wexford and Cork to Louth.\u00a0 Many of these destinations have been featured on their new Weather broadcast sponsorship, as well as in the national press.<\/p>  <p>  Looking forward to 2023, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to focus on building the regional brand.\u00a0 It will encourage domestic travellers to visit destinations across the country and, through online booking and sales and marketing supports, work with local industry to help them convert this interest into increased sales for their business.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland's priorities for 2023 in terms of domestic marketing (and supporting the international marketing effort) include:<\/p>  <p>  - RT&Eacute; Weather Sponsorship<\/p>  <p>  - Year-round marketing campaign &lsquo;Keep Discovering&rsquo;<\/p>  <p>  - Media partnerships to showcase Ireland and drive domestic demand to take short breaks across Irish media<\/p>  <p>  - Further investment in marketing websites including the launch of new VisitDublin.com and ongoing optimisation of DiscoverIreland.ie website to drive domestic bookings<\/p>  <p>  - Strong domestic sales promotion campaigns across multiple distribution partners&rsquo; platforms, supporting regions and key festivals and events<\/p>  <p>  - Hosting International Media to showcase all that Ireland has to offer.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the development of specific other tourism product offerings, such as the proposed Irish Sea Way or Wild Atlantic Walkway, these are operational matters for F&aacute;ilte Ireland in line with its tourism development functions. My Department's role in relation to tourism lies primarily in the area of national tourism policy and implementation of that policy is a matter for the tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, as well as certain other bodies.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has commenced work on the Irish Sea Way and the Wild Atlantic Way Coast Path projects.  After an initial review by F&aacute;ilte Ireland of trail development along the East Coast and in particular the geography from Carlingford to Cobh, the optimal proposition for the Irish Seaway initiative is to link current and planned Greenway and Cycle Trails to deliver a contiguous cycle route from Carlingford to Cobh.\u00a0 The progression of this work, which will be developed in partnership with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, will be a key part of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s operational plans for 2023.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The development of the Wild Atlantic Way Coast Path remains a priority for F&aacute;ilte Ireland. In 2018, F&aacute;ilte Ireland conducted research into a variety of visitor attraction concepts and found that the highest performing experience was the Wild Atlantic Way coastal path.\u00a0 The procurement process to tender for consultants for the Wild Atlantic Way Coast Path to develop a framework for delivery is due to commence in October 2022. The objective of this process is to have consultants on board by end of this year, with a 12 to 18 month timeframe for the delivery of such a framework.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific regional brand, Ireland's Hidden Heartland, since the launch of the brand in 2018 F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been working in association with the Local Authorities, other State agencies, such as Tourism Ireland, and the wider tourism industry to raise awareness of the new Hidden Heartlands brand and to grow the visitor economy therein. Tourism Ireland promotes the Hidden Heartlands directly to overseas visitors, and the region now features prominently on the Ireland.com website.<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been building partnerships with the local authorities, Waterways Ireland, Coillte, Bord na Mona and the Office of Public Works, in order to optimise the tourism potential of their natural and heritage assets in a sustainable manner. Recent highlights include the launch of the Shannon Tourism Masterplan, which has already seen &euro;2.3 million invested by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in new projects last year alone, and &euro;3.9 million invested in the revamped National Famine Museum at Strokestown Park.<\/p>  <p>  At F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s flagship tradeshow, Meitheal, in 2022, the number of tourism businesses who signed up from Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartland&rsquo;s increased from 8 to almost 40 during the period from 2018 &ndash; 2022. This means that more and more tour operators are aware of the region and are including it on their tours.<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has established a Steering Group for the region comprising eleven relevant Local Authorities together with State Agencies and industry members, which advises on the future strategic direction for tourism in the region.<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also established three Destination Recovery Task Forces throughout the region in response to the crisis in tourism caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. These Task Forces ensured businesses in the region could be sustained and primed for continued growth as tourism recovers.<\/p>  <p>  Later this year, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will publish a Regional Tourism Strategy for Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands 2023-2027.\u00a0 While this will be a five-year strategy, it will set out an exciting 10-year vision for the sustainable development of tourism in the region. The strategy will focus on regenerative tourism and sustainability, ensuring that tourism works to create sustainable jobs in local communities and protects the\u00a0environment.<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in conjunction with all its partners, is working to transform what is a non-traditional tourism region into a destination with a unique identity and distinctive reasons to visit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900044#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 6 to 13, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sport and Recreational Development","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900044#WRA01000"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[47523\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900044#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the way the sports action plan is delivering on greater participation for disadvantaged communities and women; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>The Sports Action Plan is based on a \"Sport for All\" approach that is aimed at ensuring that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity, regardless of gender, social-economic status, age, disability, or membership of minorities.<\/p>  <p>  Increased participation in sport is a key objective of my Department. In pursuit of that objective, at the end of November 2021, I launched the Sports Action Plan, which specifically includes a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. <\/p>  <p>  The plan's emphasis is heavily orientated towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport, an emphasis that is reflected in the\u00a0specific commitment to establish an Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Fund to promote increased and sustainable participation in sport among children, adolescents and young adults, those from lower socio-economic groups, persons with a disability, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community and other ethnic minorities. <\/p>  <p>  The total amount of funding allocated from Dormant Accounts for such disadvantage-related projects this year is &euro;12 million, more than twice the amount available a number of years ago.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to participation in sport by women and girls, in 2021 Sport Ireland launched the Girls Get Active Research Report.

Prior to Covid, the sector had registered consistent increases in the numbers employed in Ireland&rsquo;s regions and was an important driver of greater regional balance and dispersed economic activity. A sustained, and sustainable, rebuild is essential as tourism supports communities and drives regional development in a manner unlike other sectors.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, the sector faces a range of challenges, in common with the wider economy, such as sizable increases in the costs of key inputs and, as the Deputy has raised, difficulty in recruiting and retaining key skills. These challenges are not unique to Ireland; indeed, they are shared by many countries around the world.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have worked with colleagues across Government to secure funding supports to keep the tourism sector alive during Covid-19 and then to support this initial rebuild phase in 2022 and beyond.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Hospitality and Tourism Forum, which was established during the pandemic and is co-chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and myself, provides a valuable opportunity for the sectors to communicate their priorities. The Forum met as recently as 12 September to discuss key priorities in the context of Budget 2023.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department also participates on the Tourism and Hospitality Careers Oversight Group which brings together industry representatives, state agencies, Government Departments and the education sector. The Group has pivoted to focus on supporting the industry to address some of its immediate recruitment challenges this year. My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are also working with industry and across Government Departments to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages in the sector across all roles.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Earlier in the year delays in the processing of work permits for chefs was a particular challenge for the sector. My\u00a0Department\u00a0and F&aacute;ilte Ireland worked closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE) to seek to have those employment permit applications for chef positions that were already in the system processed as quickly as possible given the pressure that existed to recruit staff for the season.\u00a0All flexible resources were redeployed by DETE to address processing times for General Employment permit applications in this context and this has resulted in 1,345 permit applications for chefs being processed since May with processing times reduced significantly to 5 weeks. My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are currently working with DETE to increase work permit application success rates via training.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department also continues to engage with the Department of Further Education, Research, Innovation and Science regarding the Tourism Recovery Taskforce&rsquo;s recommendations which were to:<\/p>  <p>  (a)\u00a0Strengthen F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Careers Oversight Group and formalise a relationship with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to ensure programme development and coordination of tourism education and training; <\/p>  <p>  (b)\u00a0Develop a National Tourism Education Gateway as a one-stop education access shop for all tourism employees; and, <\/p>  <p>  (c)\u00a0ensure consistency in terms of quality and content of education and training provided by education providers in the tourism sector in consultation with industry to meet adapting needs and trends.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to working conditions in the sector, F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s research indicates that 70% of people within the sector see tourism as a long-term career option. While this is a good proportion, to improve on this, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has developed a range of programmes to build skills and capability for businesses and individual employees including a suite of online self-directed professional development courses.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Latest F&aacute;ilte Ireland research shows that while recruitment is still a significant challenge for businesses, the situation is improving and employers are making positive strides. Around 70% of businesses that are recruiting are increasing their pay and offering flexible work patterns, more stable work schedules and other perks. However, it is clear from an employee&rsquo;s perspective that more still needs to be done to make working in the industry as appealing as possible.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As part of the drive to promote tourism as an attractive sector within which to work, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has launched a new &ldquo;Employer Excellence&rdquo; programme to help all participating businesses to improve their employer practices, and enhance their reputation as excellent employers. This will help employers to drive great employee engagement, build the appeal of their workplace and unlock greater levels of performance across their business. This new programme should lead to greater retention of staff and improve the view of the industry as career of choice.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A Transition Year Work Placement Programme to give TY students a high-quality work placement to motivate them to consider a course or career in the industry has also been launched, along with a major recruitment awareness campaign called &ldquo;Works For Me&rdquo; to encourage more people of all ages to consider a career in the industry.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  When we look at the wider economy and the particular set of challenges facing the tourism industry it is clear that a collective and concerted multi-stakeholder approach to tackling these challenges is required and that is the approach that I and my Department will continue to pursue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900044#WRA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Oifig&iacute; Roinne","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900044#WRA04100"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[47576\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900044#WRA04200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"maidir le Ceist Pharlaiminte Uimhir 5 den 21 Meitheamh 2022, cad &eacute; st&aacute;das an ghr&uacute;pa idir-rannaigh at&aacute; ag obair chun c&uacute;rsa&iacute; plean&aacute;la i gceantair Ghaeltachta a chur chun cinn; cad &eacute; l&iacute;on na n-uaireanta a bhuail an gr&uacute;pa idir-rannach le ch&eacute;ile go dt&iacute; seo; an fhoilseofar na miontuairisc&iacute;; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1577","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>Mar a chuir m&eacute; in i&uacute;l i gCeist D&aacute;la 32569\/22, is ar an Aire Tith&iacute;ochta, Rialtais &Aacute;iti&uacute;il agus Oidhreachta\u00a0at&aacute; an fhreagracht maidir leis an Acht um Plean&aacute;il agus Forbairt 2000 - faoina dtagann gn&oacute;tha&iacute; i nd&aacute;il le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; plean&aacute;la agus tith&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeltacht.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Faoi r&eacute;ir alt 10(2)m den\u00a0Acht Um Plean&aacute;il agus Forbairt 2000 is g&aacute; go nd&eacute;anfadh\u00a0plean forbartha c&uacute;ram do chosaint oidhreacht teanga agus cult&uacute;rtha na Gaeltachta lena n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar theanga an phobail, i gc&aacute;s ina mbeidh limist&eacute;ar Gaeltachta i limist&eacute;ar\u00a0an phlean forbartha.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; mo Roinn, an Roinn Tith&iacute;ochta, Rialtais &Aacute;iti&uacute;la agus Oidhreachta agus &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta ag glacadh p&aacute;irt i ngr&uacute;pa oibre idir-rannach faoi l&aacute;thair ar mhaithe le ceist na Gaeilge sa phr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la a phl&eacute; agus chun c&uacute;rsa&iacute; plean&aacute;la i gceantair Ghaeltachta a chur chun cinn.<\/p>  <p>  Is ceann de na pr&iacute;omhaidhmeanna at&aacute; ag an ngr&uacute;pa idir-rannach n&aacute; c&oacute;rais a chur i bhfeidhm, de r&eacute;ir mar is cu&iacute;, chun cur chuige &eacute;ifeachtach agus comhsheasmhach a choth&uacute; do na h&Uacute;dar&aacute;is &Aacute;iti&uacute;la mar a bhaineann s&eacute; leis an gc&oacute;ras plean&aacute;la sa Ghaeltacht a bhainisti&uacute;. <\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; an gr&uacute;pa idir-rannach ag scr&uacute;d&uacute; conas a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; cleachtais reatha maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na bhfor&aacute;lacha seo a neart&uacute; ar mhaithe le leas ioml&aacute;n na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus ar mhaithe le forbairt inbhuanaithe agus polasa&iacute; plean&aacute;la cu&iacute; a bheith i bhfeidhm sa Ghaeltacht.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist go nd&eacute;anfar leis an bpolasa&iacute; seo soil&eacute;iri&uacute; agus treoir a chur ar f&aacute;il maidir le conas gur fearr comhsheasmhacht agus cothroma&iacute;ocht an c&oacute;ras plean&aacute;la a fheabhs&uacute;, st&aacute;das na Gaeilge a chosaint sa Ghaeltacht agus c&uacute;namh a shol&aacute;thar do na h&Uacute;dar&aacute;is &Aacute;iti&uacute;la &aacute;bhartha.<\/p>  <p>  Tion&oacute;ladh an cruinni&uacute; is d&eacute;ana&iacute; den ghr&uacute;pa idir-rannach ar 25 I&uacute;il 2022.

Last year, Sport Ireland announced an investment of &euro;4 million in the Women in Sport Programme for the 2021 - 2022 period.\u00a0 45 National Governing Bodies (NGBs) are receiving funding under this investment.\u00a0 A further &euro;265,000 was invested last year in the Local Sports Partnerships under the Programme. <\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland continues to promote women&rsquo;s participation in sport. For example, recognising the importance that campaigns can play in encouraging and supporting women and girls to be active, the first ever HER Outdoors Week was held in August 2021. Due to the success of the campaign, Sport Ireland ran the event again this August. \u00a0Over 350 events took place nationwide with over 7000 females participating across the 7 days. HER Outdoors week aims to celebrate and encourage more females to get out and enjoy the benefits of being in the outdoors while bringing visibility to the opportunities for females to get involved in outdoor physical activity. The campaign targets all females including females with a disability, females from diverse ethnic groups, older females, teenage girls, and females from disadvantaged areas, etc.<\/p>  <p>  The Sports Action Plan sets a target for all NGBs to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023. It is a particular priority for me to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation. The most recent Board Composition Snapshot, which was published by Sport Ireland in December 2021, shows that the overall percentage of women on boards of NGBs has increased from 24% in 2019 to 32% in 2021. The Snapshot also highlights that 39 NGBs have now achieved representation of 30% or more women on their board, up from 19 NGBs in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland recently outlined their funding priorities for NGBs for 2023 onwards. From next year, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s grant funding to sporting organisations will be more closely aligned to the Government&rsquo;s key policies for sport with four specific funding priorities being included as an important element of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s grant funding criteria. One of these priority funding areas for 2023 is the achievement of 40% gender balance on Boards of NGBs. This will ensure that the State&rsquo;s investment in sport is delivering on this key policy objective. Failure by sporting organisations to achieve 40% gender balance on their boards will impact on future funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900045#WRB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Industry","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900045#WRB03400"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[46891\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900045#WRB03500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the details of her engagements with the hospitality sector with regard to pricing and its impacts on tourism; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>Businesses are facing cost inflation and other economic stresses including rising costs in food and energy, increased wages in a competitive recruitment market and the cost of insurance.

In respect of goods coming through the postal system, the data required to complete the electronic import declaration is normally supplied by the postal operator in the country of export and the Irish postal operator submits an electronic import declaration on behalf of the relevant Irish importer, in each instance. The postal operator in the country of export does not have to register in Ireland and does not have to lodge customs declarations in Ireland. Their role is to gather the necessary data about each package or parcel and provide this electronically to the Irish postal operator.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that where the Irish postal operator does not have the necessary information to complete an electronic import declaration, it may contact the exporting party in the relevant third country or the importer in Ireland for the necessary information to complete the declaration. Alternatively, where sufficient information to complete the customs declaration in not available, the Irish postal operator may choose to return the goods to the sender.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).<\/p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact that insurance costs can have on many groups &ndash; including homeowners - and has therefore prioritised insurance reform via the Action Plan for Insurance Reform, applying a whole-of-Government approach to its implementation. Work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with the focus now on implementing the outstanding actions to increase both the affordability and availability of insurance for all groups, including consumers.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of delivering the Action Plan, the Central Bank&rsquo;s ban on price-walking in July has been a key development in terms of helping to tackle consumer insurance costs, including those for the home market. This is a form of dual pricing whereby customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs the longer they remain with a provider. This pro-consumer ban is a balanced approach that will now protect customers who prefer to stay with their current home insurer from being subject to a &lsquo;loyalty penalty&rsquo;, while still allowing others to benefit from &lsquo;switcher&rsquo; discounts from providers who may also seek to compete on price.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I am aware that home insurance costs may be rising for some consumers. Data from the CSO for August 2022 shows that the price of &lsquo;insurance connected with the dwelling&rsquo; rose 4.2 per cent month-on-month and 9.8 per cent year-on-year. This compares with an annual decline of 11 per cent for motor insurance over the same period.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A key driver of home insurance is the property rebuild cost (or reinstatement value), which is based on the total cost to reconstruct the property. Based on the July 2022 &lsquo;Tender Price Index&rsquo; from Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland &ndash; the rate of construction price inflation?was 14.0 per cent in the 12 months to June 2022. In addition to increasing labour costs, over the past year the cost of construction has risen substantially, driven primarily by a confluence of external factors impacting upon the supply and cost of input materials including: Brexit; COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine. As construction costs generally increase, rising rebuild and repair costs can also be expected to impact upon home insurance premiums.<\/p>  <p>  According to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, many insurance companies automatically index the amount of buildings and contents cover when they renew a home insurance policy each year, thus helping a policyholder to avoid being under-insured. Linked to this, the Central Bank of Ireland last week published the findings of a Thematic Review into the issue of under-insurance in the home insurance market. It noted that under-insurance in this area has increased from 6.5 per cent in 2017 up to 16.5 per cent in 2022. The Central Bank has issues a \"Dear CEO\" letter to the industry and will be engaging with providers to ensure consumers are well informed and protected in this regard. The advice is policyholders should regularly check the amount of cover they have to make sure they are adequately insured.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, even though home insurance prices may currently be impacted by construction inflation, it is still important for policy holders to compare with other provider to ascertain if they can get a better consumer-focused deal by switching.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":251,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE03100"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[47771\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the VAT rates that apply to solar equipment, including rooftop solar photovoltaic; the amount of revenue raised arising from such in 2017 to 2021 and to date in 2022; the allowable VAT rates under European Union directives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":253,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the amount of VAT raised from the supply of solar equipment.<\/p>  <p>Under the EU VAT directive, a Member State may decide to apply a reduced or zero-rate of VAT to certain activities, including the supply and installation of solar panels on and adjacent to private dwellings, housing, and public and other buildings used for activities in the public interest.\u00a0   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration Tax","counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE03400"},{"type":"question","counter":255,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[47822\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners have adequate internal risk management and audit controls in place to detect and prevent abuse of their seize and release vehicle registration tax enforcement procedure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[47823\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is satisfied the Revenue Commissioners' seize and release vehicle registration tax enforcement procedure has not been disproportionately targeting women; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[47824\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners is satisfied the use of the seize and release vehicle registration tax enforcement procedure, which sees on-the-spot roadside cash payment of compromise penalties, is lawful; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[47825\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners set annual seizure vehicle registration tax enforcement performance targets across the regions for vehicle registration tax enforcement officers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[47826\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the Revenue Commissioners' vehicle registration tax manual section 5 enforcement will be updated and available on their website once again; the procedure that has been in place while the manual has been unavailable online in respect of the use of seize and release; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[47827\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners have commenced any investigations into evidence  or concerns of potential abuse of their vehicle registration tax enforcement powers; if any report on such an investigation will be made public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":261,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 to 123, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I am assured by Revenue that it serves the community by fairly and efficiently collecting taxes and duties and implementing Customs controls and that it fosters a positive culture of ethical behaviour and effective governance to deliver this mission. <\/p><p>I am advised that governance in Revenue<b><\/b>is underpinned by Revenue&rsquo;s Corporate Governance Framework which is based on a system of rules, practices and processes which sets out principles and structures that govern and guide the way that Revenue conducts its business. The purpose of the Framework is to ensure the correct alignment of structures with business strategies and direction, mitigate risk, and provide accountability and assurance that the organisation is operating efficiently and effectively. A number of core elements underpin Revenue&rsquo;s strategies, processes, and structures and are designed, for example: <\/p><p>- to seek to collect no more than the correct amount of tax or duty at the right time; <\/p><p>- to act with integrity, honesty and consistency, and within the law, in all Revenue&rsquo;s dealings;<\/p><p>- to ensure impartiality, equality, fairness and respect. <\/p><p>Further, Revenue&rsquo;s Code of Ethics is an important part of this Framework and applies to all management and staff in the exercise of their functions.<\/p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s approach to enforcement of the law relating to Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is that in each instance where a failure to comply with the relevant legal requirements is detected, the matter is dealt with in a manner that is fair and proportionate to the circumstances of the particular case. Further, Revenue complies and conforms with its public sector equality and human rights duty pursuant to Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, 2014.<\/p><p>Revenue Officers authorised to carry out customs and excise functions carry out their duties in accordance with law. When an Officer forms the view that a person is a resident of the State, and in possession of an unregistered vehicle contrary to section 139 of the Finance Act 1992, and further that the person has had the vehicle in the State after a 30-day period, this entitles the Officer to lawfully seize the vehicle under Section 141 of the Finance Act 2001.\u00a0 Depending on the circumstances of the particular case, Officers may offer release of the vehicle on payment, whether by cash or card, of the compromised sum. <\/p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s VRT Section 5 Enforcement Manual has recently been reviewed and is available on its website. It provides clear guidelines and protocols in relation to the payment of a compromise sum in local release situations, including: <\/p><p>- the presence of at least two Revenue officers in any instance where terms are being offered or payments are accepted for the local release of a vehicle for a breach of VRT<\/p><p>- checking procedures to ensure amounts calculated are correct and in line with Revenue&rsquo;s guidelines which are publicly available<\/p><p>- the issuing of receipts in respect of payments received<\/p><p>- the requirement for a second Revenue officer to countersign the Receipt Book to certify <\/p><p>- the receipt of payment and <\/p><p>- the issue of a receipt for that payment.<\/p><p>In addition to the above, I am advised that Revenue has a robust audit procedure in place for line managers responsible for officers engaged in VRT enforcement work. This procedure is outlined in detail in the VRT Enforcement Manual previously referred to. I think it is important that the Deputy is aware that these procedures continued to be in place while the manual was offline.<\/p><p>I am aware that Revenue&rsquo;s approach to confronting non-compliance, including in relation to VRT, is informed by risk. Each year Revenue focuses its compliance resources on areas that pose risk to the tax system as determined by Revenue&rsquo;s data holdings, data analytics and risk assessment systems. In confronting non-compliance including non-compliance with VRT obligations, Revenue takes actions in response to the level of risk and tax behaviour at any given time including the compliance behaviour displayed either generally or by specific taxpayers. The focus is to support maximum voluntary tax compliance and to provide an effective and appropriate response to non-compliance. <\/p><p>I am assured by Revenue that in line with its strong focus on effective performance and the proper and effective discharge of its functions and responsibilities, including proper governance, Revenue carefully considers any allegations of abuse of its statutory powers on a case-by-case basis. Any party may invoke Revenue&rsquo;s complaints procedures, internal appeals mechanisms, statutory rights of appeal, and have access to the Courts as is appropriate to the particular issue that arises or claim that is made. Revenue engages fully with whichever process a party chooses to avail of to vindicate his or her rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":262,"content":"<p>Question No. 119 answered with Question No. 118.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":263,"content":"<p>Question No. 120 answered with Question No. 118.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":264,"content":"<p>Question No. 121 answered with Question No. 118.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":265,"content":"<p>Question No. 122 answered with Question No. 118.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":266,"content":"<p>Question No. 123 answered with Question No. 118.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE04800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE04700"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[47807\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900047#WRE04800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the way in which a pension entitlement is calculated for a person who becomes a PRSI worker in the private sector following 35 years of pensionable State service in the Department of Defence, and subsequently An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and who chooses to retire at 55 years; and if the matter will be clarified in cases in which that person becomes self-employed, following an example provided (details supplied).","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":269,"content":"<p>Based on the information provided the individual previously served as a member of the Permanent Defence Forces (PDF) and subsequently became a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS).\u00a0 As I understand it, the individual exercised an option to transfer their pensionable service in the PDF pension scheme into the AGS pension scheme.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Where an individual transfers their service from one public service pension scheme (the 1<sup>st<\/sup>pension scheme) into another public service pension scheme (the 2<sup>nd<\/sup>pension scheme) the following process occurs:<\/p><p>1.

On the back of new skills opportunities on Section 481 productions in the regions, many regional Higher Education and Further Education and Training providers have developed new courses aimed at the screen industry including new Springboard and Traineeship programmes at institutions like Technological University of the Shannon, Atlantic Technological University, Limerick\/Clare ETB and Kilkenny\/Carlow ETB. <\/p><p>  To build on this growth within the regions, Screen Ireland announced an investment of over &euro;2,000,000 towards the establishment of five new National Talent Academies across Ireland in Wicklow, Limerick, Galway and Dublin for film and TV drama, animation and production crew. These Talent Academies will build on the success of the Section 481 skills model to develop and drive opportunities for diverse and regional talent on a national level. This along with the allocation of an additional &euro;1m for Screen Ireland in 2023 will encourage the growth of and further development of the film industry, both indigenous and international.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900048#WRF05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[47844\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900049#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which opportunities continue to exist for philanthropists to engage in and support the arts nationally and locally; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>The Arts Council, which is funded by\u00a0my Department, is the body responsible for delivering primary support for the arts in Ireland.\u00a0 The Arts Council supports and develops the arts in Ireland through grant funding, project awards, support to individual artists, and support to venues, publications and resource organisations.\u00a0\u00a0The Council is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Arts Council operates the RAISE programme, which seeks to enhance fund-raising skills in arts organisations with a view to diversifying the sector's sources of funding.\u00a0 It is designed to assist the sector in securing\u00a0philanthropic contributions to the arts in Ireland.\u00a0 Many arts organisations have benefited from and continue to benefit as a result of the RAISE initiative.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Funding for the Arts Council was increased to &euro;130 million in 2021,\u00a0 again in 2022 and I am now delighted to state that I have secured this level again for 2023.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Private support for the arts is an important funding source and the Government continues to support this through tax incentives and other initiatives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to encourage strong, mutually beneficial links between the business community and the arts community to assist arts organisations to capitalise on sponsorship opportunities and to develop business partnerships and fundraising skills.\u00a0\u00a0I also recognise the important work carried out by Business to Arts, which my Department also supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900049#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900049#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":335,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[47845\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900049#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she can facilitate those who have previously been awarded capital sports grants and have not been in a position to complete the projects due to Covid-19 or other related issues; if arrangements will be made to ensure they be given an extension of time to meet their requirements; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":336,"content":"<p>While the priority in the short term is to advance the successful applications, which number almost 2,900, under the 2020 round of the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme to \"formal approval\" and grant drawdown stage, my Department continues to support and guide grantees from past rounds as they manage the grants awarded.

Many areas of cities, towns and villages of all sizes face the blight of vacant properties, which, if brought back into use, could add real vibrancy and provide new accommodation in those areas.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund is a key initiative which underpins these policy objectives set out in Pathway Four of Housing for All. <\/p><p>  Schemes under the Fund, which are delivered by local authorities, will provide new choices for people to live in towns and villages in Ireland, through the provision of a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties and by providing serviced sites in towns and villages to people in order to build their own homes. <\/p><p>  On the 14 July, I launched the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant as part of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund. The grant will benefit those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence. A grant of up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence, including the conversion of a property which has not previously been used as residential. Where the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the standard grant of up to &euro;30,000, a maximum top-up grant amount of up to &euro;20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict, bringing the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of &euro;50,000. <\/p><p>  On 21 September, I launched the Ready to Build Scheme, also funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund.  Under the Ready to Build Scheme, local authorities will make serviced sites in towns and villages available to potential individual purchasers to build their homes. These sites will be available at a discount on the market value of the site for the building of a property for occupation as the principal private residence of the purchaser.  <\/p><p>  When the Fund was launched, I committed to ongoing review of the schemes under it. I am pleased to see that the feedback on the Vacant Property Refurbishment Scheme to date has been overwhelmingly positive, with 169 applications submitted by the start of September. <\/p><p>  Given that a key objective of Pathway 4 of Housing for All is to ensure that the houses we already have are being fully used, I have decided to extend the eligibility for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant to vacant properties in both our cities and rural areas. <\/p><p>Both schemes under the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund will continue to be only for those who intend to occupy the property as their principal private residence.

This extensive packages includes measures in relation to the Working Family Payment.<\/p>  <p>  The Working Family Payment (WFP) is an in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings. The WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependents, and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment. There are approximately 47,000 families with 103,000 children who are currently in receipt of the WFP. The estimated spend on the WFP in 2022 is &euro;349 million.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for payment of WFP a person must be engaged as an employee in full time paid employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria. The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is part of a family supported by them. These criteria have not been changed in Budget 2023.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Budget package includes a range of measures that will assist people with the cost of living in one-off payments this Autumn. This includes a once-off payment of &euro;500 to recipients of the Working Family Payment. This payment will be made in November at an estimated cost of &euro;23 million.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have also provided for a &euro;40 per week increase in the Working Family Payment thresholds for all family sizes. This is the highest ever increase in the Working Family Payment thresholds. This will ensure that families on low incomes will receive more weekly income from the scheme - up to &euro;24 euro per week.

The objective of the progression policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study. To satisfy the terms and conditions of the FFI in relation to progression, a student must be moving from year to year within a course having successfully completed the previous year or, having successfully completed a course, is progressing to another related course where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course (for example added years to attain a level 8 having completed a level 7 course).<\/p>  <p>  A free fees eligible students that completed year one or year two of a free fees eligible course in 20\/21 or 21\/22, and departs the course of study without securing a qualification, is not normally eligible for free fees funding in year one of a new free fees course at the same qualification level in 22\/23.

I acknowledge the vital role that community pharmacy will play in the development and implementation of future healthcare reform, especially in regard to the aims and vision of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>  <p>  The Submission referred to in your question has been received by my Department and the content will be given due consideration in the context of wider health priorities during the current budget discussions. Notwithstanding this however certain of the matters raised have been previously drawn to my attention and work is ongoing on examining particular issues. <\/p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 pandemic the Health Service Executive established a Community Pharmacy Contingency Planning working group with relevant stakeholders, including the IPU and the PSI, to support the implementation of all COVID-19 support measures in the context of pharmacy services and the contribution this sector could make. This group &ndash; now called the Community Pharmacy Planning Forum &ndash; had examined the operational and clinical challenges confronting community pharmacists during the COVID-19 emergency and played a key role in resolving them to the benefit of the people of Ireland. The work of the Forum has now transitioned to discussing the strategic direction of the community pharmacy profession. This will prove invaluable in the context of future contractual reform. Of course, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services, and provide better value for money.<\/p>  <p>  In the interest of clarity, I would also point out that the regulations governing the pharmacy fee structure that were made under section 9 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 expired at the end of 2019. Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, these regulations had to be replaced by 1 January 2020 in order to maintain a statutory basis for contractor payments and to prescribe the fees payable from that date.\u00a0 The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 (Payments to Community Pharmacy Contractors) Regulations 2019 &ndash; S.I. No. 639 of 2019 &ndash; gave effect to the current pharmacy fees. Any future changes to the pharmacy fee structure will need to be made by regulations under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017.<\/p>  <p>  I was delighted to announce the commencement of the free contraception scheme for women aged 17&ndash;25, which is a big milestone in the delivery of our commitments, under the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022 &ndash; 2023 to improve all areas of women healthcare. Pharmacies who sign up to provide services under the scheme, are now further empowered to support women&rsquo;s health with the provision of prescription contraception free to 17&ndash;25-year-olds.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the continued gathering of and analysis of up-to-date, robust and relevant data, will be a basis for recommendations that can be proposed to address Ireland&rsquo;s needs as our integrated healthcare system evolves, and in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation. <\/p>  <p>  I will engage as necessary with government colleagues in addressing relevant issues as they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900054#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes","counter":668,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900054#WRM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":669,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[47800\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900054#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will investigate a matter (details supplied) as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":670,"content":"<p>I am acutely aware of the specific challenges faced by the nursing homes sector related to price inflation and increased energy costs. It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with their regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining their quality of care so that residents&rsquo; lived experience and comfort is not affected.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government has provided substantial supports to the nursing homes sector over the course of the pandemic. Over &euro;144 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the Temporary Assistance Payments Scheme (TAPS) since spring 2020.\u00a0TAPS continues in effect and the Government has now agreed to extend the scheme to the end of the year. The scheme will be refocused on addressing this year's inflationary pressures related to energy and heating.

Many of these supports continue.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).
