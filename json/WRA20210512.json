The centralised approach adopted is helping to ensure effectiveness of advertising spend and consistency and amplification of the public health messaging across the various public awareness campaigns and to those hard to reach audiences.<\/p><p>The public information campaigns play a vital role in communicating the various strands of the pandemic. All platforms are utilised with some campaigns tailored for different audiences using specific channels. There have been 48 campaigns to date, and each campaign was advertised using a combination of National Press, Regional Press, Radio, Digital Display, Social Media, TV and Online Video.

It was given regulatory responsibility for the <i>.ie <\/i>namespace in 2007. The Communications Regulation Act 2007 sets out the terms for the registration of <i>.ie<\/i>domain names and they enable ComReg to make regulations and to &ldquo;<i>specify an entity as the authority authorised to register &lsquo;.ie&rsquo; domain names&rdquo;. <\/i>In 2009, ComReg appointed <i>.ie Domain  Registry<\/i>(IEDR) as the authority authorised to register <i>.ie<\/i>domain names in accordance with Section 32(4)(a) of the Act of 2007. The decision also stated that IEDR would set up and maintain a Policy Advisory Committee (PAC) which would be the representative group of all stakeholders.  <\/p><p>IEDR published its policy on Registration and Naming in the .IE, in which it set out the requirements for new registrants, including that they must provide evidence of their real and substantive connection to the island of Ireland. The requirements are set out in Section 2 of the policy document and it states that <i>.ie<\/i>names are only available to those either based on the island of Ireland, or those who have a real connection to the island of Ireland. Evidence of being based in Ireland can include: a CRO number, Revenue VAT number, registered business number, an Irish VAT number, proof of Irish income tax registration (sole traders), a trademark that is enforceable in Ireland or for individuals it might be a digital copy of an Irish driver&rsquo;s license or Irish passport. If they are based outside of the island of Ireland, a connection to Ireland must be proven. Applicants must show that they trade with, or clearly intend to trade with, consumers or businesses on the island of Ireland. Acceptable evidence of this connection to the island of Ireland includes invoices, press releases, promotional material, or even a screenshot of the registrant&rsquo;s e-commerce store that shows that consumers or businesses can select anywhere on the island of Ireland as their location for delivery. <\/p><p>IEDR has a process whereby stakeholders can suggest policy changes to IEDR&rsquo;s Policy Advisory Committee (PAC). The PAC was set up in 2014 and it considers and provides advice on policy issues concerning Ireland&rsquo;s Internet top-level domain, <i>.ie<\/i>to its Board. <\/p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has no role in relation to the policies and procedures which are used by IEDR. However, the CCPC does have a role in providing information to consumers about online shopping and in January of this year the CCPC published &ldquo;Online shopping post-Brexit: A CCPC consumer guide to shopping online&rdquo;, in which they advised  consumers that a &lsquo;<i>.ie<\/i>&rsquo; domain does not guarantee that consumers are dealing with an Irish-based business. The CCPC advised consumers that the most important step to take is to check where a business is based before they buy. It advised consumers to check the business&rsquo;s registered address in the terms and conditions (T&amp;amp;Cs) section of the website to find out where the business is registered. The document went on to inform consumers that from 1 January last, all online shopping orders received from the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) are subject to Irish VAT and customs charges, depending on the value and the type of items concerned. Before ordering from outside the EU, consumers are reminded to check the T&amp;amp;Cs to find out what VAT and import charges that they may have to pay. The CCPC also published guidance for businesses selling online emphasising the importance of disclosing the geographic location of their business, as required by the Consumer Rights Directive. Since 1 January, the CCPC have received 25 contacts from consumers on scenarios which would fall within the type of situation outlined here. These cases would include scenarios where consumers have advised the CCPC that they made a purchase for goods from <i>.ie<\/i>sites and subsequently found out that the traders were actually based in the UK or outside the EU. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200073#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1596"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Policy","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200073#WRB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[24854\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200073#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if his Department will actively investigate the possibility of establishing Ireland as the events hub of the EU post-Brexit (details supplied); if a fund will be made available for same; if he will liaise with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in relation to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>The impact of COVID-19 has not been uniform across areas of economic activity and affected sectors such as the events sector will continue to face challenges due to ongoing distancing requirements, changed consumer behaviour and lower demand.

As part of the delivery of the plan the company was split into two distinct business units, An Post Mails and Parcels and An Post Retail.<\/p><p>An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats. This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched.

The scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided to a household under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was &euro;14,800 in 2020.As indicated in the table below, there are currently 779 homes in Cork on the Warmer Homes work programme. The scheme operates nationally on a first come first served basis. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months in Cork and nationally.\u00a0The average wait times\u00a0are expected to increase significantly in 2021 due to the\u00a0extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between March and June of last year as well as between January and 12 April of this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government\u00a0guidelines.\u00a0\u00a0Works under the scheme\u00a0has now recommenced in line with activity in\u00a0the residential construction sector.\u00a0<\/p><p>The\u00a0SEAI\u00a0has advised me that the average wait times\u00a0should only ever be used as a general guide and that wait times vary, based on the demand for the\u00a0scheme\u00a0at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.\u00a0<\/p><p>It is important to note that funding for the\u00a0SEAI\u00a0energy poverty retrofit\u00a0schemes has increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total\u00a0SEAI\u00a0residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. This funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency\u00a0upgrades\u00a0making their\u00a0homes\u00a0warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the\u00a0Programme for Government.<\/p><p>In addition to the increased budget, capacity by the industry to deliver more activity has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel to provide works which commenced at the end of 2020. I also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the\u00a0SEAI\u00a0to allow it drive the various grant programmes that it operates, including the\u00a0Warmer\u00a0Homes\u00a0Scheme, and to ensure that level of activity envisaged under the Programme for Government is delivered.\u00a0<\/p><p>This table shows a breakdown by county of the total national Warmer Homes work programme.<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>County<\/th>       <th>No. on warmer homes work programme <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow<\/td>       <td>93<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan<\/td>       <td>102<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare<\/td>       <td>147<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork<\/td>       <td>779<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal<\/td>       <td>390<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin<\/td>       <td>2404<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway<\/td>       <td>391<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry<\/td>       <td>238<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare<\/td>       <td>256<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny<\/td>       <td>104<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois<\/td>       <td>96<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim<\/td>       <td>93<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick<\/td>       <td>263<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford<\/td>       <td>74<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth<\/td>       <td>157<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo<\/td>       <td>391<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath<\/td>       <td>271<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan<\/td>       <td>79<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly<\/td>       <td>138<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon<\/td>       <td>144<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo<\/td>       <td>123<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary<\/td>       <td>292<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford<\/td>       <td>213<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath<\/td>       <td>184<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford<\/td>       <td>287<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow<\/td>       <td>236<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total<\/td>       <td>7945<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200074#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200074#WRC00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":67,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200074#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[24724\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200074#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) in relation to a tax saver annual ticket; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":69,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

This provision was particularly necessary when waiting times for driving tests were particularly long. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there are a number of people driving on our roads on their 4th, 5th, 6th or subsequent learner permit.  A learner permit is not a licence, but a permit to allow a person to drive while learning. <\/p>  <p>  In October 2019, the Road Safety Authority sent proposals to my Department in relation to this issue. These proposals were examined and a submission was prepared for Ministerial approval. The measures set out in the submission took account of the shorter wait times for tests and the increased tester resources available at the end of 2019 as the opportune time to tackle the issue. Due to the restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, a review of the draft submission is now required. With the current backlog pending due to the halting of driving tests, it is prudent to delay any changes to regulations for long term permit holders in the short term, or until the driving test service is stabilised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200074#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":100,"content":"<p>Question No. 70 answered with Question No. 66.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[24804\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200074#WRC04000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 162 of 10 February 2021, if he will provide additional details relating to the grounds on which he plans to provide for the power to revoke a driving licence; if he now plans to include a proposal to include the revocation of learner permits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>The intention is to differentiate between the revoking of a licence and the disqualification of a person from holding a driving licence.

The objective of the mortgage measures is to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households and to reduce the risk of credit-house price spirals from developing. <\/p>  <p>  The macroprudential measures apply loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) restrictions to residential mortgage lending by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank. The LTI limit is 3.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income. For second and subsequent buyers, the LTV limit is 80% of the value of the residential property (i.e. a deposit of 20% is required from the house purchaser). A mortgage deposit can help households to absorb a certain reduction of house prices before the borrower falls into negative equity. <\/p>  <p>  Allowances to exceed the LTI limit and LTV limit have been central to the framework of the mortgage measures since their introduction. The allowances acknowledge that higher LTI and LTV mortgages can be appropriate in certain circumstances. Mortgage lenders are allowed to issue up to 20 per cent of the value of new mortgage lending to second and subsequent buyers at LTVs above 80 per cent. This could include borrowers in the specific circumstance referenced by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The allocation of allowances is a matter for individual lenders, based on an evaluation of each specific borrower and the lender&rsquo;s own credit policies.

It focuses primarily on business eligibility, delivering a per-head subsidy on a flat rate basis to the employer. The objective of the EWSS is to support businesses, encourage employment and help to maintain the link between employers and employees. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;3 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;500 million have been granted to 48,900 employers in respect of 558,000 workers.<\/p>  <p>  The EWSS &ldquo;turnover test&rdquo; has been specifically designed so as to target the subsidy at otherwise viable employers whose businesses continue to be adversely impacted by Covid-19 by requiring a comparison of the firm&rsquo;s pre-pandemic operations with their current operations. The primary employer qualification for the EWSS is based on the employer's turnover in the current six-month period being less, compared with the same pre-pandemic position period in 2019. The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that it is operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from 1 January to 30 June 2021 compared with the equivalent period in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  To answer the specific point raised in the Deputy's question, the turnover qualification requirement for EWSS applies regardless of whether the business is required to close fully or partially due to public health restrictions, or indeed if the business could remain open throughout the pandemic. The &ldquo;turnover test&rdquo; is the determining factor as regards eligibility for the EWSS and accordingly, the business must have suffered at least a 30% decrease in its turnover and this disruption is due to the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The EWSS is designed to be flexible for the employer and take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover so if there is a reduction in turnover in the future because of a change in circumstance the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that later period.   <\/p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s position remains that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS.  Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[24821\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a payment system (details supplied) being proposed by Ireland's main financial institutions; his views on whether it may affect competition within the sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":179,"content":"<p>Firstly, it should be noted that this proposed joint venture is subject to approval by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and as such it is not appropriate for me to comment on this proposed joint venture in more detail.

Their implementation will be instrumental in identifying, measuring and helping remove barriers to the advancement of our common sustainable goals in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[24933\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount expended by his Department on advertising and awareness raising initiatives related to Covid-19 from March 2020 to date in 2021; the print, online and broadcasting media organisations contracted to provide this service; the amount provided to each in the timeframe concerned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":188,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has had no expenditure of this nature.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Closed-Circuit Television Systems","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE02000"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[24970\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the Office of Public Works has advanced proposals to install CCTV cameras at Clare Abbey, County Clare to curb ongoing vandalism and destruction of the site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>The Commissioners of Public Works have advised that there are a number of  issues at Clare Abbey which renders the installation of a full CCTV system at the site impractical ; these include a lack of land ownership at the site, the lack of a power supply and possible threat to archaeology if cabling were to be installed.<\/p>  <p>  While wires-free options are available, there are a number of logistical issues associated with them, not least, compliance with GDPR legislation, which need to be overcome and these are actively under review at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[25140\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps he is taking to fulfil the programme for Government commitment to direct a proportion of the proceeds of the carbon tax towards climate-focused measures in the agri-food sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government recognises the special economic and social role that agriculture plays in Ireland, but also commits to the creation of schemes that will encourage and incentivise farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way.

The recommendations included a proposal to pilot a basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audiovisual and live performance and events sectors. The Taskforce was of the view that a pilot basic income would keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits: social and economic, local and national. <\/p>  <p>  I believe the arts sector represents an appropriate area for a pilot basic income scheme for many reasons. It is characterised by low, precarious and often seasonal income.  Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society; it includes a broad mix of employment types.

We can now work to see how it can be enhanced.  <\/p>  <p>  I have established an Oversight Group with the remit of addressing the outstanding recommendations of Life Worth Living.

The government has decided to move ahead with this <i>The Path Ahead <\/i>plan. We are now in the early stages of the Recovery phase of the pandemic. The decision is based on advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), that a cautious and gradual phased reopening over May and June, with an emphasis on outdoor activity and a moderate increase in social contact, can be considered low to medium risk. NPHET has advised that there is scope to ease a range of public health measures in this manner with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This allows us to continue through the Recovery phase, focusing on what is safest and generates the most benefit and with a focus on outdoors activities &ndash; both social and economic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE05700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reviews","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE05600"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[25271\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE05700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if information will be provided on his Department's review of siting and size conditions for rooftop solar panels on homes and review of exemptions for educational and community buildings as part of the current development of interim planning regulations; if further information will be provided on the stated need to consider environmental assessment reporting before finalisation; when the interim planning regulations will be submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[24987\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE05800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will provide information on his Department's review of siting and size conditions for rooftop solar panels on homes and review of exemptions for educational and community buildings as part of the current development of interim planning regulations; if he will provide further information on the stated need to consider environmental assessment reporting before finalisation; when the interim planning regulations will be submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 123 together.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended (the Act), all development, unless specifically exempted under the Act or associated Regulations, requires planning permission.  Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Climate Action Plan 2019, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the solar panel exemptions, and is actively engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as other key stakeholders, with a view to finalising a proposal for draft amending Regulations to reflect, inter alia, technical developments in the sector. One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, thereby facilitating more widespread generation of renewable energy for self-consumption. Also included in this review are solar panel exemptions for educational and community buildings.<\/p>  <p>  The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for \"glint and glare\" impacts for aircraft and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly, my Department has been engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. The Department has begun the tendering process for this project, which will involve the development of aviation safeguarding maps for each airport\/aerodrome in the country, and has received feedback from potential tenderers estimating a timeline of up to 9 months for its completion. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the length of time that it is expected to take to complete the aviation safeguarding maps, my Department has decided to adopt an interim measure which would allow revised regulations to be introduced prior to the completion of these maps, but with defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes for solar installations. My Department has consulted with the Irish Aviation Authority on this matter, and has developed draft interim regulations in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  These draft regulations have now been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001\/42\/EC, and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals, which will include public consultation as part of the process. This process is expected to take between four and five months to complete. <\/p>  <p>  Following the public consultation and consideration of any submissions received, and as required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. <\/p>  <p>  The process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in Q4 2021. These interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.<\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed by Q4 2021. The final supplementary set of regulations will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200076#WRE05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200077#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[24736\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200077#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a guarantee from a company (details supplied) will suffice in lieu of a HB47 homebond or premier guarantee under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme (RIHL) is designed to enable credit worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties or self-builds. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to self-builds, the RIHL requires that construction is covered by latent defect insurance policies and is underwritten by Insurance Companies.

Initial Vaccination priority is for Defence Force personnel who are providing front line support to the HSE and National Ambulance Service in the national effort to combat COVID 19. <\/p>  <p>  Personnel selected for deployment to overseas missions fall into a prioritised grouping and they are vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to deployment, subject to availability of the vaccine which is coordinated through the HSE.

The contract commenced on 1st July 2012 for a period of 10 years, with an option to extend for a further 3 years.

The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies, experience supportive relationships within the school setting, be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe, in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported. Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  This approach to supporting wellbeing has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements in mental health.  Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience.  The services support schools to provide strong universal support at the level of whole school and classroom, more targeted support for some children and young people who may be at risk, and more individualised support for those with greatest need.  Support is provided to primary and post-primary school staff through the following services and supports:<\/p>  <p>  -  The National Educational Psychological  Service (NEPS)  Guidance  Counselling service\/provision  <\/p>  <p>  -  National Council for Special Education (NCSE)   <\/p>  <p>  -  Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Wellbeing Team <\/p>  <p>  -  Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) Support Service<\/p>  <p>  -  Education Support Centres Ireland (ESCI)<\/p>  <p>  At post primary level, a Student Support Team is a student-focused mechanism put in place by a school in order to co-ordinate the support available for students in the school and to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services. NEPS provides support to post primary schools in the setting up or review of Student Support Teams. Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. Guidance allocations for all schools were increased in the 2020\/21 school year. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.   The total number of guidance counsellor posts in the school year 2020\/21 is 852. <\/p>  <p>   Separately, the Department of Health has responsibility for the provision of counselling services in Ireland, and through HSE Primary Care Psychology and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provides clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs.  In addition, the HSE and its funded providers, provide e-mental health services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include services provided by the Samaritans, Pieta House, MyMind, Turn2Me, Aware, Crisis Text Ireland, Shine, BeLongTo, LGBT Ireland, Jigsaw, spunout, Bodywhys and Childline. <\/p>  <p>  My Department &ndash; through NEPS, Student Support Teams, Guidance Counsellors and other services - will continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE\/HSE-funded e-mental health services. The Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  We will continue to collectively explore ways of improving supports for children and young people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200079#WRH04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200079#WRH05100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Development Companies","counter":381,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200079#WRH05000"},{"type":"question","counter":382,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[24716\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200079#WRH05100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans for local development companies that unlike private entities provide a complete wrap-around service for their communities and work on an non for profit basis (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1621","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":383,"content":"<p>As part of the July jobs stimulus, the Government committed to increase resources dedicated to the delivery of employment services and to expand the coverage of the local employment type services to areas not currently covered by existing providers.
