In terms of product to sawmills, Coillte which is the main provider is fully licensed on felling licences for the year albeit not all their output is immediately available.   <\/p>  <p>  I established Project Woodland, to work with stakeholders to examine all aspects of forestry, including a review of processes with a view to reducing the licensing backlog. This process is being implemented intensively and the Working Groups are meeting regularly, and I understand are shortly due to come forward with recommendations in some cases. The Working Group dealing with the backlog is working on publishing a process and targets for its reduction and other improvements to the system and structure are being examined.   <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has asked for a month-by-month list of tree felling licence applications received decided and appealed which I will arrange to be submitted to the Deputy directly. However, the total applications received in the last 12 months was 3,607 but of those some 1,800 were received in March  of this year from Coillte. The number decided in the last year was 1,741 and  the number appealed was 271.  I would note that the number of appeals has fallen significantly since the introduction of the new legislation in October 2020, going from a high of 62% of licence decisions appealed last September to an average now of 5% per month.   <\/p>  <p>  I remain confident that the framework now in place under Project Woodland will address our current difficulties and will result in a licensing system which meets the needs of forest owners, with attendant benefits for all those involved in the sector. I can assure Deputies that no effort is being spared to resolve these difficulties and the issue remains a top political priority for me and my Department.<\/p>  <p>   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000068#WRB06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000068#WRB06200"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[27013\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000068#WRB06300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his Department plans to conduct consultations with farmers, farming communities and relevant environmental stakeholder groups in relation to the sector&rsquo;s role and contribution to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets under the EU Green Deal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>My Department is fully supportive of stakeholder engagement and actively consults with various groups including with farmers, farming communities and environmental groups on a wide range of issues.

The new Office, whose remit will include the beef sector, when established will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland and will also  incorporate the UTP Enforcement Authority functions  In addition to establishing the new Office, the primary legislation may introduce rules that go beyond those included in the UTP Directive.

I raised the matter of inequitable burden sharing directly at this meeting. <\/p>  <p>  I also raised this matter at EU Fisheries Councils in both January and February. At the February meeting, I put forward a practical proposal to seek an exchange from the UK of mackerel for North Sea whitefish on the basis of a proposal from the Irish industry. However, this was not accepted by all relevant Member States as it involved loss of shares of whitefish for them in the North Sea.   This emphasises that proposals to adjust shares of quotas within the EU will always be challenging and are only likely to work when they offer  advantage to other Member States as well as Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission, on behalf of the EU, has been engaged in consultations with the UK on setting fishing opportunities for shared stocks for 2021 since early February.  While progress is being made in these consultations, an agreement with the UK has not to date been reached.  In March, I attended the  EU Fisheries Council, where provisional TACs and quotas were set for seven months will provide certainty and continuity for the fishing industry for the coming period.  I again made Council aware of Ireland's concerns regarding  the matter of inequitable burden sharing within the TCA both formally at Council.   <\/p>  <p>  At a VC meeting earlier this week with Commissioner Sinkevicius and Ministers of most impacted Member States regarding the issues arising in the EU-UK Fisheries Consultations, I made clear that Ireland, both at sectoral and Government level, is dissatisfied with the inequitable and disproportionate burden imposed on Ireland in terms of our contribution to the quota transfers to the UK. <\/p>  <p>  As I have said, I  am pursuing every opportunity at EU level to increase the available quotas for our fishing fleet.

The Act contained provisions designed to ensure that students residing in both private and university-owned student-specific accommodation in Rent Pressure Zones will see rent increase of no more than 4% per annum. As the vast majority of student-specific accommodation is situated in Rent Pressure Zones, these protections apply to almost all of those residing in student accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation also granted access to registered student and licensors to the dispute resolution facilities provided by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). Student accommodation license terms including cost, duration, refund and cancellation policies should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year. If these terms are breached, a student has recourse to the RTB to ensure that the terms of their contract are upheld. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that since March 2020, the university sector has actively engaged with students on the issue of accommodation refunds. As a result of the decision to minimise on-site teaching, all universities have confirmed that students who opted to leave their university-owned student accommodation as a result of reduced on-campus activity will be offered refunds or rental credits. The processing of these refunds is a matter for the universities themselves, and any student who wishes to receive a refund for their on-campus accommodation should engage directly with their university&rsquo;s accommodation office.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that the past year has posed very specific challenges in relation to privately-owned student accommodation, and that students and their families have suffered financially as a result. I am urging providers to be flexible in finding solutions given the circumstances in which students find themselves. <\/p>  <p>  My position on student accommodation is well known at this stage and we are working across Government on how we can build more on-campus student accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also actively engaging with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on how protections for those residing in student accommodation can be strengthened and I expect Minister O'Brien to make an announcement on this very shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000071#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":207,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 89 and 90 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Education","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000071#WRE01500"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[25560\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000071#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress on ensuring broader access to third-level education for persons with intellectual disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>Inclusion is one of the core strategic goals for my Department, and my ambition is to ensure that we provide supports and opportunities for learning to all.

This package included funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs) which was in addition to the &euro;2m funding that was allocated in Budget 2020 and funding that institutions already provide for these services. <\/p>  <p>  The Higher Education Authority (HEA) requested that the HEIs distribute this funding in support of specific student engagement such as the recruitment of additional student counsellors, and implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, which I launched last year. <\/p>  <p>  This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention.

This exacerbated the pressure on craft apprentice off-the-job training facilities as a result of the 90% increase in apprentice population over the past 6 years, a situation which has impacted on waiting lists for electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery and motor mechanics in particular.  End April figures indicate that over 3,500 craft apprentices had been waiting over 12 months for access to Phase 2, 4 and 6 off-the-job training.  <\/p>  <p>  To ensure that apprentices are facilitated in progressing in their programmes insofar as possible, the theory aspects of off-the-job training for craft apprenticeship has been delivered remotely since early January.

Completion of practical training and assessment is required to allow apprentices to progress to their next phase of training and to complete their apprenticeship in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  A phased return to face to face training commenced during April for those apprentices who had been undertaking remote teaching and learning or who were close to completion of phase 2, 4 or 6 when training was suspended in January 2021.

The Inclusion goal is one of the six strategic goals in the strategy for the coming period. In this regard, one of my priorities is to support learning for all in the tertiary education system and to develop and grow its supports for vulnerable learners, learners with disabilities, under-represented groups and the most marginalised. <\/p>  <p>  The main support available to students is the Student Grant Scheme managed by SUSI. The scheme provides maintenance and fee grant support for qualifying students who meet the criteria regarding means, nationality, residency and progression. In 2020\/21 over 101,000 students applied for grant support with almost 80,000 students assessed as eligible for support. It is anticipated that a similar number will apply in 2021\/22. A review of the SUSI scheme is currently underway. It is anticipated that this review will be published later this year and will inform future policy decisions regarding grant supports.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 (NAP) is another key policy lever for promoting access to higher education. The vision of the NAP is to ensure that the student body entering, participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population. The plan set out goals and actions with the aim of supporting increased access and participation in higher education by six main target groups, include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the five priority goals for the current NAP is &ldquo;to gather accurate data and evidence on access and participation and to base policy on what that data tells us&rdquo;. In this regard we have developed and published &ldquo;A Data Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education&rdquo; and recently commenced publishing Deprivation Index Score (DIS) data on higher education institutions (HEIs).  <\/p>  <p>  The availability of new Deprivation Index Score (DIS) data which identifies those areas with low higher education participation rates will be of significant benefit to HEIs in helping them to implement more targeted approaches in their access strategies. The data is also important in informing priorities for the development of the next NAP which will cover the 2022-2026 period. A public consultation process is currently underway for the new NAP and will remain open for submissions until June 18th. It is anticipated that the next NAP will be published by the end of 2021.   <\/p>  <p>  In terms of direct supports for vulnerable students, the Government has approved a number of additional supports for students in the last year. These include: a &euro;10m assess support package for higher education; improved postgraduate supports and funding for SUSI grants worth circa &euro;26m; up to &euro;50m in supports to provide funding of &euro;250 to qualifying tertiary students; an additional &euro;1.5m for the 1916 Bursary scheme which is targeted a disadvantaged students; a &euro;15m laptop scheme for further and higher education students; an &euro;8m mitigating educational disadvantage fund for the further education and training sector; and an additional &euro;3m to support mental health and wellbeing. <\/p>  <p>  Inclusion will remain a strategic priority for my department.

In addition to contributing to knowledge, postgraduate researcher education drives participants to develop their own research and innovation skills that can be applied in a range of environments, in academia or industry, at home or abroad. <\/p>  <p>  At postgraduate level, the Irish Research Council funds graduates across all disciplines and is an important component in the wider national strategic pursuit of a strong talent pipeline of research graduates. <\/p>  <p>  Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) has commenced a programme to support advanced PhD skills and training, in collaboration with industry, for the new economy. There is a number of SFI Centres for Research Training (CRT) linked to the higher education institutions and there is an ambition to do more. The six we have currently are supporting over 700 PhD students in ICT and data analytics. The first 120 students commenced in September 2019. Through the CRTs, students will be equipped with transversal skills including entrepreneurship and innovation to enable them to adapt and react to rapidly evolving workplaces and making them a very attractive skills pipeline for industry.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to align our further and higher education policies with what is required in the workplace to meet the needs of the economy. We will do this by working with industry to address current needs and, looking beyond the current world of work, by equipping individuals with the skills they need to succeed in the changing labour market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000073#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":330,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000073#WRG02700"},{"type":"question","counter":331,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[26971\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000073#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the commitments in the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 to promote access in apprenticeship for traditionally under-represented groups; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":332,"content":"<p>The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 sets out a number of structural reforms to ensure that the apprenticeship system of the future is enabled to deliver a more responsive and visible offering to  learners and employers.  A National Apprenticeship Alliance (NAA) will be established to provide stakeholder oversight of the delivery of the Action Plan for Apprenticeship in collaboration with a new National Apprenticeship office (NAO).  Central to the NAA will be an Equity of Access Subcommittee which will include representation that ensures that links with second level, community education, youth justice programmes, broader FET provision and higher education are represented. Targets for participation by under-represented groups, and additional specific actions to support those target groups will be set in conjunction with the Equity of Access Subcommittee and will be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that interventions are effective in supporting increased diversity of the apprentice population.  <\/p>  <p>  Existing actions set out in the plan include:-<\/p>  <p>  - The current female craft apprenticeship bursary will be expanded to all programmes with greater than 80% representation of a single gender.<\/p>  <p>  - An apprentice bursary\/support scheme will be established to fund up to 100 apprentices per year who are experiencing severe socioeconomic disadvantage and who are from target groups, including lone parents, people with disabilities, Travellers and Roma.  <\/p>  <p>  - Access to apprenticeship programmes and pre-apprenticeship courses will be clearly labelled as such, with progression routes into apprenticeship clearly identified and information on these courses will be published on www. apprenticeship.ie.    <\/p>  <p>  - An employer survey will determine baseline employer attitude and extent of knowledge of supports available to employers for supporting employees with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 Review of Pathways to Participation in Apprenticeship has already resulted in a significant widening of measures to support increased visibility of apprenticeships.

On completion of the programmes, learners may progress to apprenticeships, further education, or employment.  It is expected that over 800 learners will participate in pre-apprenticeship programmes in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  - Over 1,200 employers have registered with www.apprenticejobs.ie which is designed to increase visibility of opportunities for all potential apprentices.<\/p>  <p>  - A user-friendly and interactive website to provide information on, and increase awareness of, apprenticeship was launched in October 2020 (www.apprenticeship.ie).  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000073#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":333,"content":"<p>Question No. 131 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Payments","counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000073#WRG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":335,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[26933\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000073#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will review the criteria and income thresholds for SUSI grants to ensure that each family qualifying for the working family payment is deemed eligible for a fee and maintenance SUSI grant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1488","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":336,"content":"<p>Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, Family Income Supplement (also known as the Working Family Payment) is treated as an income disregard and is therefore not included in the calculation of reckonable income. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, unlike other social protection payments which are paid to individuals, the Working Family Payment is a payment deemed to be paid to a family.

For example, UCC has a bio-diversity action plan 2018-2023, taking a comprehensive approach to managing biodiversity on its campuses, DCU&rsquo;s community garden initiative is working with the Irish Beekeeping Association to help bees and promote biodiversity on campus; and Trinity College Dublin has planted a wildflower meadow on College Green. Higher education institutions are also embedding biodiversity in programmes and as a focus of research. For example, GMIT has a number of research projects focused on marine bio-diversity in Galway Bay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000074#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":364,"content":"<p>Question No. 143 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further and Higher Education","counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000074#WRH00900"},{"type":"question","counter":366,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[26999\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000074#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the analysis his Department has carried out or commissioned into the impact of Covid-19 restrictions on the further education sector particularly with regard to the reduction in participation across the sector since the onset of the pandemic; his plans to develop a strategy to address the impact of Covid-19 on engagement, retention and progression in the further education sector as recommended in a report (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":367,"content":"<p>A series of measures and initiatives have been taken or are underway in relation to the impact of Covid-19 restrictions on the further education and training (FET) sector.

This will continue, in line with the ongoing response to Covid-19, and will be underpinned by the national FET Strategy 2020-2024: Future FET Transforming Learning. <\/p>  <p>  The FET Strategy includes a commitment to ensure the impact of Covid-19 can be explored, including through a national learner engagement survey, as well as supported, through the Skills to Compete initiative. The Skills to Compete initiative, which is the national FET response to the upskilling and reskilling needs of people who may have been displaced from their employment as a result of the impact of Covid-19, and has been underway since July 2020, initially supported through the July Jobs Stimulus package.

Last year I announced that this fund, provided for through Budget 2021, would be administered by SOLAS, the further education and training authority, and the 16 local Education and Training Boards (ETBs). The aim of the fund is to support community education for adult learners, who have the highest level of need, with a strong focus on building the digital infrastructure of community education providers to increase the capacity to deliver online learning. The projects benefitting from funding vary from projects to help support online learning, connect communities, providing essential travel, and providing social support to vulnerable people. <\/p>  <p>  A fund of &euro;5m for student devices was part of &euro;168 million package for further and higher Education sectors to deal with the impacts of Covid-19 in the FET, which was provided to ETBs in accordance with allocation models agreed with SOLAS.   <\/p>  <p>  A Working Group for Student and Learner Wellbeing and Engagement (SLWE) was established in January 2021, chaired by the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), and comprising representatives from across the further and higher education sectors. The purpose of the SLWE group has been to reflect on the challenges facing student and learner wellbeing and engagement as a result of Covid-19 and to identify existing and further measures to address these. <\/p>  <p>  The new FET Strategy has increased its references to Learner Voice and reasserted its commitment to keep Learner Voice at the heart of FET Provision. This helps to ensure that FET remains learner-centred and that learner voice is valued as critical evidence that can inform the future of FET provision and this is especially relevant when considering the impacts of Covid-19 on the FET sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000074#WRH01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Higher Education Institutions","counter":368,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000074#WRH01200"},{"type":"question","counter":369,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[26935\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000074#WRH01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he has met with UCC or MTU to discuss the possibility of locating a campus on the northside of Cork city.","asker":"1453","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":370,"content":"<p>I have not met with either UCC or MTU to discuss a new campus on the northside of Cork city and my Department has not been made aware of any plans by either institution in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  However, my Department continues to work collaboratively with MTU and UCC on the development of capital projects in line with their established masterplans. <\/p>  <p>  Higher education building projects in Cork supported by my Department include the planned new Learning Resource building at CIT's Bishopstown campus, which will be delivered as part of the Higher Education PPP Programme; a major upgrade of the main 1970s building at CIT's Bishopstown campus;  the planned new building for Cork University Business School, which will be delivered as a co-funded project with UCC; and the decarbonisation of the heating system in UCC&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Rahilly Building, one of eight energy efficiency and decarbonisation pathfinder projects being supported in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000074#WRH01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":371,"content":"<p>Question No. 146 answered with Question No. 103.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Payments","counter":372,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000074#WRH01600"},{"type":"question","counter":373,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[26993\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000074#WRH01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way the distances for adjacent and non-adjacent third-level SUSI grants are set; his plans for a review of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":374,"content":"<p>The Student Grant Scheme, administered by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI), provides grant assistance to eligible students attending an approved course at an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. <\/p>  <p>  Student maintenance grants are payable at either the adjacent or non-adjacent rate.

However, it was not possible to formalise these discussions, as at that stage, the UK had not communicated any decision in respect of its continued participation in the Erasmus programme.   <\/p>  <p>  As part of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), which was concluded last December, provision was made for the UK to continue in the programme, subject to a fair and transparent financial contribution.  The UK announced very soon afterwards that it did not wish to continue in Erasmus programme, and that it would develop its own mobility programme.  This decision, of course, impacts on education institutions and their students in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Once the UK decision was confirmed, my officials began a series of meetings with representatives from NI institutions engaged in the delivery of higher education programmes.  This includes the 6 Regional Colleges along with the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise, where up to 20% of higher education is undertaken in NI.   Overall, there is a positive reaction from the NI HEIs to the proposal, with the early indications of student interest to pursue the Erasmus option.  <\/p>  <p>  In parallel with this, officials in my Department were also in touch with their counterparts in the Department of the Economy in Northern Ireland, and kept them informed of their engagement with NI institutions.  <\/p>  <p>  The engagement process also included key officers from Irish HEIs, with the objective of developing operational guidelines for the scheme.  Again, I am heartened by their response to support my Department in developing a robust process implement this measure.  <\/p>  <p>  In March 2021 my Department was advised by the Northern Ireland institutions that there was unspent Erasmus grant funding due to the restrictions on travel arising from the public health guidelines.

My Department has stated to all stakeholders, and specifically, NI HEI representatives that the Irish Government initiative is designed to offer choice to NI students - should a student wish to pursue a Turing mobility, it is a matter of choice for him\/ her.

In recognition of this, the Climate Action Plan contains commitments to significantly increase electrification within the national fleet, including an ambitious target of 936,000 electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. Meeting this target will be extremely challenging; however, it represents the scale of transformation needed in the transport sector if emissions are to be reduced to the extent required.    <\/p>  <p>  The State has an important role to play in normalising EVs and promoting their uptake. A positive policy environment has been fostered with a generous suite of financial and taxation incentives in place for those buying an EV as well as an extensive publicly accessible recharging infrastructure network. Presently, there are approximately 32,000 EVs on Irish roads; a significant step-up is required if Ireland is to achieve its Climate Action Plan EV target.   <\/p>  <p>  To assist in this aim, the former Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport established the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway Working Group to consider the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies available to Government to significantly accelerate electric vehicle sales. This Group focused on mechanisms to achieve an immediate increase in EV uptake to attain over 180,000 EVs by 2025 in the line with the Climate Action Plan trajectory and, thereafter, to be well placed to reach full electrification by 2030. In its report, to be published shortly, the Group considered supplementary measures to further incentivise EVs other than the existing generous suite of EV supports. <\/p>  <p>  I am supportive of all appropriate and proportionate supports for the EV industry, particularly where those supports provide momentum towards achieving the Government&rsquo;s emission reduction commitment.  The Deputy will be aware that the benefit in kind regime is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000076#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":471,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000076#WRL02600"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[27605\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000076#WRL02700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of civil servant posts that were filled through open and internal panels, since April 2020, in his Department and the bodies under the aegis of his Department, by county and by month in tabular form.","asker":"1451","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":473,"content":"<p>The table below sets out the number of civil servant posts filled through open, internal and interdepartmental panels in the Department of Transport from April 2020 to date.  <\/p><p>This includes 1 post which transferred to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media as part of the transfer of the Tourism and Sport functions in 2020.  <table>    <tr>       <th>MONTH<\/th>       <th>OPEN<\/th>       <th>INTERNAL<\/th>       <th>INTERDEPARTMENTAL<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>April 2020<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>May 2020<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>June 2020<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>July 2020<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>August 2020<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>September   2020<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>October 2020<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>November 2020<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>December 2020<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>January 2021<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>February 2021<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>March 2021<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>April 2021<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>May 2021<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL<\/td>       <td>31<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Of the total posts, one is in Co.

In May 2020, HBFI established a temporary step-in product called the &ldquo;Momentum Fund&rdquo;. <\/p><p>The purpose of this product was to fund large scale developments that would ordinarily have been funded elsewhere but due to COVID-19 and the constrained lending market funding was not available at the time.

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website.<\/p>  <p>  The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The D&aacute;il has approved the extension of both the EWSS and the CRSS until the end of June 2021. <\/p>  <p>  With easing of restrictions in the coming weeks, the CRSS will remain available to any business still closed\/restricted under public health guidelines.  Any business which can reopen but chooses not to will not be eligible for the CRSS.<\/p>  <p>  It will not be sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises.<\/p>  <p>  Any business currently availing of CRSS and that can now reopen as restrictions are eased will be able to avail of double restart week payments for two weeks subject to the statutory maximum of &euro;5,000 per week to support them in meeting the costs of reopening as they exit the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions. Businesses not falling within the scope of the CRSS may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).

The services provided by the OGCIO are compliant with GDPR. In reference to your question about Article 29 of the GDPR in particular, as a data processor OGCIO has taken all reasonable measures to prevent unauthorised access to personal data through the use of appropriate security processes and controls. These processes and controls include: the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, compliance, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; and the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a cybersecurity, physical or technical incident.<\/p>  <p>  The OGCIO has adopted a defence-in-depth security strategy which is achieved by utilisation of people, processes, and technology to support the implementation of ICT security services. The threat landscape is constantly evolving and significant effort is expended to continually enhance and strengthen ICT security to mitigate against emerging threats, risks, vulnerabilities and cybersecurity issues. In addition to deploying perimeter security measures, such as intrusion protection systems, software vulnerabilities are managed by maintaining up-to-date versions and aggressively deploying updates and patches to endpoints and applications as they become available. <\/p>  <p>  The OGCIO has employed a policy of least privilege security principle. IT staff are only assigned security roles with levels of access which are essential to perform the tasks and duties associated with their functions. The allocation and usage of privileged user accounts is reviewed and monitored.<\/p>  <p>  The OGCIO has developed an Information Security Management System (ISMS) aligned with the industry security standard ISO27001. This ISMS provides an overall governance framework for information security and sets out security policies, objectives, management oversight, practices and governance and ensures continual improvement of information security management. In addition are advanced in their programme for ISO 270001 certification and are on track to getting ISO 27001 certified in Q4 of 2021\/Q1 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the State bodies under the aegis of my Department, the Central Bank, Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have advised that they are fully compliant with all the regulations cited.<\/p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has confirmed that it is fully compliant with GDPR, including Article 29 requirements. The NTMA provides business and support services and systems to the National Asset Management Agency, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and Home Building Finance Ireland, which are also bodies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis, and which are also fully compliant with GDPR, including article 29 requirements. The NTMA further advises that, while it is not ISO27001 accredited, NTMA policies are aligned with ISO27001 Annex 9 standards on privileged access.<\/p>  <p>  The Investor Compensation Company has a comprehensive Data Protection Framework in place which includes a Data Protection policy and associated procedures and controls. This Framework complies with GDPR EU requirements, including Article 29. It has contracted an external IT services provider to ensure that it meets information security standards while also employing internal access controls as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) is fully compliant with GDPR EU requirements and the EU network and Information Security Directive and standards with respect to its IT infrastructure including article 29 of GDPR.

It is important at the outset to state that the provision of cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies. This is based on an assessment of the risks providers are willing to accept. Consequently, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive).  Furthermore, it is not appropriate for me to comment on individual cases.<\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that it&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code states that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customer it acts honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market. In the event that an insurance undertaking refuses to quote a consumer for property insurance, the insurance undertaking must, within five business days of the refusal, inform the consumer of its refusal and its reasons for declining cover. However, an underwriter cannot change the terms and conditions of a policy mid-term without the consent of the policyholder.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Deputy should be aware that Section 15 of the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019, specifically outlines that an insurer who intends to exclude certain areas from cover under the insurance contract shall do so explicitly in writing before the commencement of the contract.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.

From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles.  The 0% BIK rate forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of electric vehicles, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees and 0% BIK on electric charging. The BIK exemption was intended as a temporary measure and is set to end at year end 2022, coinciding with the onset of the new BIK regime on 1\/1\/2023. <\/p>  <p>  The reduction in mileage bands from five to four bands serves to weaken any perverse incentives of increasing mileage to reduce tax liability, while still seeking to tax the person in proportion to the quantum of benefit derived from the car. Electric vehicles will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges provides a broad structure which will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000077#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":522,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000077#WRM02600"},{"type":"question","counter":523,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[27598\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000077#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of civil servant posts that were filled through open and internal panels, since April 2020, in his Department and the bodies under the aegis of his Department, by county and by month in tabular form.","asker":"1451","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":524,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that since 1 April 2020, the number of civil servant posts in my Department filled through open and internal panels were as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>Month <\/th>       <th>Open - Dublin<\/th>       <th>Internal - Dublin<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>April <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>May <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>June <\/td>       <td>4 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>July <\/td>       <td>3 <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>August <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>September <\/td>       <td>6 <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>October <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>November <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>December <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 <\/td>       <td>January <\/td>       <td>6 <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 <\/td>       <td>February <\/td>       <td>3 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 <\/td>       <td>March <\/td>       <td>4 <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 <\/td>       <td>April <\/td>       <td>5 <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Three bodies under the aegis of my Department employ civil servants, namely the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Tax Appeals Commission. <\/p><p>Details of civil servant posts that were filled in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Tax Appeals Commission through open and internal panels since April 2020 are attached.

The threat landscape is constantly evolving and significant effort is expended to continually enhance and strengthen ICT security to mitigate against emerging threats, risks, vulnerabilities and cybersecurity issues. In addition to deploying perimeter security measures, such as intrusion protection systems, software vulnerabilities are managed by maintaining up-to-date versions and aggressively deploying updates and patches to endpoints and applications as they become available. <\/p>  <p>  The OGCIO has employed a policy of least privilege security principle.

A Data Protection Officer (DPO) was appointed in 2018, in line with the requirements of Article 37 of the Regulation.  The DPO is supported by a dedicated Data Protection Unit, which monitors all data protection activity and provides ongoing advice and support to staff on any issues that arise.  <\/p>  <p>  Responsibilities of the DPO included the oversight of arrangements for transition to the new regulatory regime, updating of the Department&rsquo;s Data Protection Policy, promotion of awareness of the requirements of the GDPR among staff and identification of training needs across the Department.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed to protecting the rights and privacy of individuals in accordance with the GDPR and the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2018 and continues to implement measures to meet its obligations in respect of this legislation.  These include regular review of the Department's policies and procedures such as Data Processing Agreements, the Record of Processing Activities (ROPA), and retention schedules while also ensuring that staff have access to data protection training, and support materials and are provided with regular notifications of legal developments.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Department's IT infrastructure, systems and procedures, these are operated in accordance with data protection requirements.   With regard to the EU Network and Information Security Directive, the Department's technical staff continue to operate and monitor all relevant systems to the highest levels, and are closely engaged with experts in the OGCIO and the NCSC to ensure that it follows best practice as it relates to all aspects of cybersecurity.  For operational and security reasons, my Department does not comment on operational security matters. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to those bodies under the aegis of my Department I am advised that each body has a similarly comprehensive range of processes in place to meet the compliance requirements of the GDPR and data protection laws. These include the appointment of a dedicated Data Protection Officer, general and specifically tailored training courses for staff and regular reviews of data protection compliance.

In particular, the 2011 Regulations transpose two key pieces of EU nature legislation: the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. The 2011 Regulations specifically give effect to the protection of a range of species listed in Annex IV and Annex V of the Habitats Directive and species referred to in the Birds Directive. <\/p>  <p>  Under Article 12 of the Birds Directive, Member States are required to report to the EU Commission on the implementation of national provisions taken under this Directive. In 2019, as part of this reporting obligation, Ireland submitted 209 season specific assessments, including assessments for all of Ireland&rsquo;s regularly occurring breeding species and a large proportion of those species&rsquo; populations that occur here during the non-breeding period. <\/p>  <p>  The 209 &lsquo;species-seasons&rsquo; are comprised of:<\/p>  <p>  - 142 assessments of breeding birds (including a short report on one species,  Corn Bunting, that went extinct after the Birds Directive came into  force);<\/p>  <p>  - 63 wintering accounts with the vast majority related to wintering waterbird populations; and <\/p>  <p>  - 4 accounts of birds using Ireland&rsquo;s coastlines or offshore waters on passage (i.e. three tern species and one shearwater).<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 30% of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird species assessed are estimated to have remained stable or increased in abundance over the long-term. This cohort includes those relatively recent colonists with strong population growth including Little Egret, Great Skua, Mediterranean Gull, Little Ringed Plover, Bearded Tit and Great Spotted Woodpecker. However these recent additions to Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird community need to be viewed in the context that almost 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird species, for which we have data, are considered to be in long term decline. <\/p>  <p>  Some of our breeding farmland songbirds have been flagged in recent decades as being particularly vulnerable to the modernisation and intensification of agricultural practices. This ongoing change in agricultural practices has led to the extinction of Corn Bunting as a breeding bird in Ireland and has been a primary driver of long term declines in species such as Corncrake, Yellowhammer, Whinchat and Twite for example. The latter two species&rsquo; estimated populations are now considered to be both less than 100 pairs.<\/p>  <p>  Countryside Bird Survey data for two ground nesting songbird species which are still relatively abundant and widespread, namely Meadow Pipit and Skylark, were used for this reporting round. Their preferred breeding habitats include peatlands and unimproved grasslands, and both populations are in decline with the estimated short term abundance of Meadow Pipit declining by over 12% and for Skylark by almost 11%. Over the last 40 years or so the estimated breeding range of the latter has decreased by almost one quarter. Such estimated declines are of particular concern as both Meadow Pipit and Skylark make up significant proportions of the prey base of some of Ireland&rsquo;s raptors of conservation concern including Merlin, Kestrel and Hen Harrier. The short term declines for the latter two raptors are estimated to be circa 28% and 10% respectively.<\/p>  <p>  Breeding waders as a group continue to suffer significant declines in both population and breeding range, in both the short- and long-term. Species such as Curlew, Lapwing, Redshank and Dunlin, all of which nest on the ground, have declined by 93% or more in the long term. Certain breeding duck populations are also of concern with numbers of breeding Common Scoter continuing to decline to critically low levels. While this species&rsquo; range is stable, the population has declined 21-54% in the short-term and 61% in the long-term. The latest assessment of breeding Red-breasted Merganser (which was reproduced from the 2008-2012 reporting period due to a lack of contemporary data) estimates that this breeding population has declined 62% in the short-term.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding seabird species&rsquo; long term population trends are now reckoned to be either stable or increasing. It is possible that the increased level of breeding seabird survey effort undertaken by my Department over recent years may be partially responsible for some of these recorded gains. Kittiwake stands out among the seabird cohort where there is now a strong evidence base to conclude that the population is under a sustained and significant decline. Further work on understanding the drivers of this decline is required but indications that a lack of available forage fish may play a role.<\/p>  <p>  Of particular note are the very strong population increases with several of our breeding tern species (e.g. Roseate Tern, Sandwich Tern, Little Tern and Common Tern). At the site level it is evident that targeted conservation measures in the form of wardened tern colonies is resulting in direct and effective conservation positives.  <\/p>  <p>  However several of these particular species&rsquo; estimated long-term breeding range trends are in decline or stagnant which not only reinforces the need for such conservation management interventions but also clearly sets out the on-going obligation that such conservation initiatives are to be maintained or where necessary improved.<\/p>  <p>  Robust and contemporary population estimates have been produced for approximately 85% of our breeding seabird species. Work is on-going in my Department with further surveys targeting seabirds such as Puffin, Manx Shearwater and Storm Petrel. These species whose colonies are located on offshore islands are particularly vulnerable to invasive mammals. Such survey work is needed to provide context and further targeting of the on-going bio-security conservation measures currently being carried out by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of those wintering populations assessed as part of the Article 12 Reporting process relate to wintering waterbirds. This group includes ducks, geese, swans and waders among others. Due to its geographical location, climate and wetland habitats, Ireland is an important host for hundreds of thousands of visiting waterbirds during the non-breeding\/wintering seasons. Due to the relative sizes of their respective biogeographic populations, Ireland is of international importance for several waterbird species including Whooper Swan, Greenland White-fronted Goose, Brent Goose, and Black-tailed Godwit among others. The population trends for wintering birds varies by group and species. Wintering wader populations, for example, are largely showing continued population declines. While the trends for geese vary, with Greenland White-fronted Geese showing a continued recent decline, and others such as the Barnacle goose showing a positive long term trend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000078#WRN04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":573,"content":"<p>Question No. 231 answered with Question No. 230.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":574,"content":"<p>Question No. 232 answered with Question No. 230.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":576,"content":"<p>Question No. 233 answered with Question No. 230.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":577,"content":"<p>Question No. 234 answered with Question No. 230.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[27399\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000079#WRO00500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the extent to which efforts are being made to protect the yellow hammer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":580,"content":"<p>Yellowhammer is a Red-listed species in Ireland due to significant range declines (-57% since 1968-72) with the species now largely restricted to eastern and southern counties.

It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a derelict sites register, which includes the name and address of each owner and occupier, where these can be ascertained by reasonable enquiry, of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site.  Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours. Members of the public can engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites in their local areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, both the Derelict Site Levy and the Vacant Site Levy increased from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020. These levies are applied annually for as long as relevant sites remain derelict or vacant. This change in the rate of the levies is intended to ensure that the levies have more meaningful impact and that the powers of local authorities in tackling dereliction and vacancy are strengthened for the purpose of bringing relevant sites into productive use, thereby facilitating urban regeneration and development in designated areas while also combatting land hoarding.<\/p>  <p>  To address the potential impacts of COVID-19 on the effective operation of the planning system, all planning timelines were extended for a period of eight weeks from 29th March 2020 to 23rd May 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In this connection, section 9 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020 inserted a new provision (section 251A) into the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended, (the Act) which allowed for planning timeframes to be disregarded for a period specified by order.

Work has commenced on the construction tender process, with construction anticipated to start in the second half of 2021.<\/p><p>In conjunction with Dublin City Council, the LDA has recently opened an early stage consultation on a site at St. Teresa's Gardens with potential for 700 housing units.  <\/p><p>The LDA&rsquo;s role will increasingly expand beyond the initial focus on these public lands, to also encompass important work in master-planning critical urban sites and leading out in partnerships with local authorities on the development of quality urban areas.  <\/p><p>Examples of this type of active land management is demonstrated in their engagement with Limerick City and County Council and other public bodies in relation to Colbert Station, and with Galway County Council in relation to Sandy Row, Galway. A Cork Docklands Delivery Office was also established by Cork City Council in partnership with the LDA. The focus of this office is on supporting and catalysing the Cork Docklands area. <\/p><p>At present, funding is provided to the LDA through my Department's Vote to meet their day to day running costs as well as any capital expenditure they may encounter prior the enactment of the LDA Bill. A breakdown of funding provided for the years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 (to date) is set out in the table below.

SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. <\/p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022\/23 school year. <\/p><p>The disruption prevented the delivery of the necessary training and information workshops to support the roll out of the new allocation model which had been planned for earlier this year.<\/p><p>The frontloading of SNAs for mainstream classes is a key part of the School Inclusion Model.  The Department and NCSE are committed to its introduction as part of the development of that Model.<\/p><p>The training and workshops are designed to help school leaders and teachers in their in-school planning for the new model and their engagement with parents. These sessions will now be rescheduled to take place during the 2021\/22 school year. Further information will be issued by the NCSE in due course.<\/p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion and the Minister of State for Education have agreed on the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021\/22 school year: <\/p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021\/22 school year. <\/p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021. <\/p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.  <\/p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021\/22 school year. In particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.<\/p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021\/22 school year that  materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that  the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.

This process involved a subject development group comprising representatives with suitable expertise, nominated by their respective stakeholder organisations, to deliberate and make decisions about what young people should learn in school. The work of this specialist group was monitored and discussed regularly by the Boards and Council of the NCCA to ensure that young people in Ireland receive an appropriate and relevant education. In addition, there were several opportunities during the process where the work of the development group was informed by public consultation. <\/p>  <p>  Farm safety is an integral part of the curriculum specification for Leaving Certificate Agricultural Science that was developed through the rigorous process outlined above.

This is essential in ensuring that our higher education institutions can effectively meet high standards of quality and performance, and achieve critical outcomes for our economy and society.<\/p>  <p>  A comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options contained in the Cassells Review was commissioned by the European Commission and undertaken by independent expert consultants. This review is currently being finalised.<\/p>  <p>  This review will provide a detailed analysis of the options presented in the expert group report, Investing in National Ambition: A Strategy for Funding Higher Education&rdquo; (Cassell&rsquo;s Report 2016). As the Deputy may be aware the Cassell&rsquo;s Report confirmed that higher education makes a hugely positive contribution to the development of individuals, employers, society and the state. The report also concluded that the approach to funding was unsustainable, and that substantial increases in investment in higher education must be made to ensure that the sector can remain viable and provide the capacity to meet the major increase in student demand projected up to 2030. This is being carefully examined in the current DG Reform review.<\/p>  <p>  Since the publication of the 2016 report my Department has been working hard to deliver a significant programme of re-investment in higher education. Currently, Government provides significant financial support to the higher education sector through direct recurrent grants, and indirectly through a number of measures including free fees, funded policy initiatives, Apprenticeships, Springboard, Human Capital Initiative and student grant fee supports. Funding and policy developments taken in recent Budgets have taken significant steps to address the funding needs of the sector resulting in annual additional investment of nearly &euro;550m in 2020 (including covid provision).<\/p>  <p>  Most notably, and in line with the recommendation of the Cassells report, a new stream of employer funding was introduced upon a review of the National Training Fund. This level of investment responded to demographic pressures and underpinned a range of initiatives in the higher education sector, including a new research initiative, a substantial investment in the evolution of Technological Universities,  significant skills-enhancing opportunities for individuals, sectors and regions most vulnerable to Brexit as well as updating skills more generally to prepare Ireland&rsquo;s society and economy for a future world of work transformed by technology and automation.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, exclusive of research provision the total planned Departmental and NTF current expenditure funding of the HE sector for 2021 is in the order of &euro;1.98 billion.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to the completion of the funding review which will provide the basis for determining how best additional investment in higher education can meet future requirements, in particular in supporting access to higher education in terms of the totality of the costs of participation.

National and local initiatives have included those focused on topics such as enhancing digital teaching and learning, entrepreneurship, curriculum innovation, simulation-based learning, and enterprise-academic partnerships.

Robust and relevant knowledge and experience had been developed which was transferred, re-purposed and re-imagined as necessary when the context of teaching and learning was suddenly transformed. The sector was in a far more advanced state with respect to assessment and technology-enhanced learning than it would have been had the crisis taken place some years previously. Local and national knowledge and understanding on these key topics had been built, informed by research and by the sharing of practice and expertise. Teaching and learning staff became the frontline workers of higher education.<\/p><p>The pandemic has taught us how quickly circumstances can change and the need for those who teach and those who learn to be confident in their knowledge and skills and supported in adapting their abilities to a variety of circumstances. With this in mind, the 2020 SATLE Fund focused on providing an opportunity for institutions to reflect on what they had learned in 2020 and consider what this meant for the future of education across face-to-face, blended, online and remote teaching and learning contexts. Funding allocated to institutions aligned with local needs and empowered institutions to take a strategic and cooperative step forward, focusing on topics such as innovative assessment practices, micro-credentials, learning analytics, and digital futures.  <\/p><p>The Human Capital Initiative, which was announced by the Government in Budget 2019, is an initiative that provides a &euro;300m investment of National Training Fund monies to enable our Higher Education system to respond more rapidly to the changes and challenges we face. <\/p><p>Pillar 3 of the initiative is focused on the core principle of embedding innovation and agility across a wide spectrum of undergraduate and postgraduate provision. A total budget of &euro;206 million over a 5-year period has been provided to higher education institutions or groups of institutions to develop projects with potential application and impact across the full higher education system. <\/p><p>Twenty-two projects developing innovative, and responsive models of programme delivery, are underway. These projects will boost the higher education systems ability to respond rapidly to changes in both skills requirements and technology.

The expansion of higher education has been a key enabling factor in the growth of the Irish economy over the past four decades. The availability and quality of graduates is essential if we are to maintain our attractiveness as a location for investment and grow our reputation as a knowledge based economy.. Equally, increased participation in higher education has resulted in significant contributions to society and has played a critical role in enriching our cultural life.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure we meet existing and future skills demands. These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified science and technical graduates, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands. These strategies and initiatives include: the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+; the Human Capital Initiative and the July Stimulus package.  <\/p>  <p>  As international competition for talent, investment and innovation grows more intense as nations strive to improve their standing as knowledge based economies, the establishment of a new Department focused on talent and knowledge is an indication of the Government&rsquo;s intent to position human capital and research as key enablers for our future economy and society.<\/p>  <p>  Postgraduate education delivered by higher education institutions is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s research system. In addition to contributing to knowledge, postgraduate researcher education drives participants to develop their own research and innovation skills that can be applied in a range of environments, in academia or industry, at home or abroad. <\/p>  <p>  Launched in 2015, the National Framework for Doctoral Education underpins the drive for quality and consistency in the doctoral education experience across Ireland. It has four main objectives:<\/p>  <p>  -  Facilitate consistent excellence in the quality of postgraduate education and training, including research undertaken at Master&rsquo;s and doctoral levels;<\/p>  <p>  -  Enable and encourage higher education institutions to work more closely in the delivery of an improved learner-experience and outcome;<\/p>  <p>  -  Maximise the employability of doctoral graduates across a broad range of employment sectors by ensuring that the acquisition of discipline-specific knowledge is complemented by the development of transferable skills; <\/p>  <p>  -  Underpin the international standing of the Irish doctoral award.<\/p>  <p>  Advancement of the Framework is supported by the National Advisory Forum that is co-chaired by the HEA and QQI and whose membership includes all HEIs and research funders. The Framework sets out nine principles underpinning doctoral education in Ireland, to which the Forum members have all committed.<\/p>  <p>  A priority for this Government is to support business, invest in the development of people and to enhance skills and develop and attract talent to ensure our education and training system is responsive to enterprise needs. We must ensure that we have accessible upskilling options and that our education and training providers offer relevant and up-to-date courses which meet the needs of enterprises and workers.<\/p>  <p>  Higher Education institutions are constantly reviewing and updating their course curriculum in collaboration with enterprise to ensure that undergraduate and taught postgraduate course content is reflecting emerging trends in the future world of work and industry.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Research Council funds postgraduates across all disciplines and is an important component in the wider national strategic pursuit of a strong talent pipeline of research graduates. Science Foundation Ireland has commenced a programme to support advanced PhD skills and training, in collaboration with industry, for the new economy. There are currently six of these SFI Centres for Research Training supporting over 700 PhD students in ICT and data analytics. Through the CRTs, students will be equipped with transversal skills including entrepreneurship and innovation to enable them to adapt and react to rapidly evolving workplaces and making them a very attractive skills pipeline for industry. In addition, I recently announced a &euro;23m joint investment between SFI and the IRC in Ireland&rsquo;s top post-doctoral researchers, contributing to my department&rsquo;s objective of fostering enhanced collaboration across our research ecosystem. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to align our further and higher education and research policies with what is required in the workplace. We will do this by working with industry to address current needs and, looking beyond the current world of work, by equipping individuals with the skills they need to succeed in the changing labour market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000085#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":842,"content":"<p>Question No. 325 answered with Question No. 324.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further and Higher Education","counter":843,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000085#WRU00700"},{"type":"question","counter":844,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[27413\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000085#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which he expects third and fourth-level student numbers to increase at academic and technical level in the future in line with demand; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":845,"content":"<p>The further and higher education sectors have a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure we meet existing and future skills demands.

The Strategy provided for the establishment of the skills architecture that we have today, the National Skills Council and the nine Regional Skills Fora. Underpinning both the skills agenda and architecture are the skills forecasting and intelligence systems, made up of the contribution of a number of public bodies including, at present, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in Solas and the statistical analysis and assessment carried out by the HEA.

According to the CSO, 2020 was a prosperous year for Ireland's overseas sheepmeat trade, with 64,000 tonnes exported to 38 international markets at a value of nearly &euro;356 million. This represents an increase of 12% in value terms on 2019. Tighter supplies of sheepmeat globally and an improvement in demand in key EU markets drove this increase. A decline in UK sheepmeat exports to EU member state markets also created opportunities for Irish produce during 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  Of the four major meat species exported from Ireland, the sheepmeat trade is the least reliant on the UK market. Bord Bia analysis suggests that retail demand for sheepmeat increased over the last year, as consumers invested more time in preparing home-cooked meals. In 2020, according to CSO data, 73% of sheepmeat products in value terms were exported to the EU, 12% to the UK and 15% to other third country markets. The value of sheepmeat exports to international markets increased significantly in  2020, but France remains the single most important export destination, accounting for a third of Irish sheepmeat exports in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  As with other meat commodities, my officials continue to work towards opening new outlets for sheepmeat and enhancing existing access to as many markets as possible for Irish sheepmeat. The Irish food industry is well positioned to gain from the opportunities presented by expanding global demand for high-quality Irish lamb, underpinned by the market development efforts of the Department, Bord Bia, the Irish embassy network, and the food industry. The Department will continue to engage with stakeholders on maximising potential opportunities for Irish sheepmeat exports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000089#WRY04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Data","counter":1018,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000089#WRY04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1019,"qnumday":388,"qnumall":"[27388\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000089#WRY04250","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied regarding the adequacy of the checking and authentication of the background of all food and food products with particular reference to the meat sector with a view to ensuring that all such imports are of the highest standard in terms of production, husbandry and hygiene; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1020,"qnumday":389,"qnumall":"[27389\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052000089#WRY04300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent of various meat products, beef, lamb, pig meat and poultry imported in each of the past three years to date; if the countries of origin have standards on par with the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1021,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 388 and 389 together.<\/p><p>The table below shows the level of imports of the meats according to CSO trade statistics, which are available up to Feb 2021<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Meat Imports Jan and Feb 2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>Category<\/th>       <th>&euro;000<\/th>       <th>Tonnes<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Beef<\/td>       <td>16,094<\/td>       <td>3,555<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Pigmeat<\/td>       <td>38,639<\/td>       <td>9,624<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Poultry<\/td>       <td>45,549<\/td>       <td>14,191<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sheepmeat<\/td>       <td>2,896<\/td>       <td>467<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total<\/td>       <td>103,178<\/td>       <td>27,838<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Food products placed on the European marketplace are covered by a range of legislation designed to ensure that products supplied to consumers are of the highest safety standards.
