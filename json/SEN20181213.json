I am delighted to propose this motion as chairperson of the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 committee, which was set up in the Oireachtas to mark that centenary and organise events noting the event.

One of the significant changes on the day was that women were allowed to vote for the first time and the other was that a woman was elected for the first time.  What would those who fought for female suffrage think of present-day Ireland?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I think they would be pleased about some aspects and not so much with others.  They would see a very different country.  The role of women has changed over that 100 years and there have been huge improvements of the involvement of women in law, medicine, education and commerce and many other areas that used to be male dominated.<\/p><p>The report from the World Economic Forum shows that there is parity between the genders in Ireland in areas of educational attainment.  The health and survival index shows that only a small gap remains to be made up by women.  When we look at the economic participation and opportunity index, however, a more significant gap is apparent and we rank 65th in the world.  While the participation of women in politics is improving, as Senator Bacik has said, there is still quite a bit of ground to make up.  In the 2016 general election, 123 men were elected.  In the full 100 years since women gained the right to stand for election, there have only ever been 114 women TDs.<\/p><p>However, the biggest problem that faced women in 1918 remains their biggest problem today, namely, that one in four women will experience physical or sexual violence from a partner and one in three experiences severe psychological abuse.  Domestic sexual and gender-based violence are crimes that occur in all social classes among people of every background, from all ethnic groups and cultures, and are violations of human rights.  They are crimes perpetrated on women because they are women and have their foundations in gender inequality.  If the suffragettes were here today with us, they would be at the forefront of the campaign for gender equality.  They would be arguing loudly that we as a society should see gender equality not as a gift to be bestowed upon women by men but as a fundamental human right.  This paradigm shift would be the finest tribute of all to those brave pioneers, and Ireland where these values were at the heart of all our actions would be the truest demonstration that their campaign was a success. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#A00600","speaker":"1375","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>It is a great privilege to be in this House on the centenary of the 1918 election.  It was rightly a seismic event.  After seven years without a general election, the changes which had taken place in Irish society were laid bare in one important event which shook the foundations.<\/p><p>In remembering the 1918 election, the single greatest theme which emerges is democratisation across a host of areas in the participation of women, both within the electorate and as candidates and the participation of young working-class men.  In early 1918, the Representation of the People Act had granted the right to vote to women aged over 30 years, which was discriminatory, who met a certain property requirement, and all men aged over 21 years.  They were not even generous enough to give the vote to women on the same terms as men.<\/p><p>This saw Ireland&rsquo;s electorate grow from 700,000 to more than 1.9 million.  These newly franchised groups spoke out against the militarism and conscription which threatened to absorb even more of the youth of Ireland.  They spoke out in democratic acceptance of the need for the establishment of the first D&aacute;il and indeed independence.  They spoke out in electing a woman for the first time.  With regard to women&rsquo;s suffrage, it is accepted, 100 years on from that moment, that we have still not completed the journey which saw its first major milestone achieved in 1918.<\/p><p>It is correct that we should use this milestone to reflect on the road ahead, but we should see the achievements of 1918, and indeed 1922 for what they were, which was a step forward.  One hundred years ago &Eacute;amon de Valera secured a democratic mandate which was heard throughout the world.  In the 1918 general election, the party he led won a victory so dramatic and so overwhelming that it changed the direction of history.<\/p><p>His was a towering personality which won for the cause of Irish independence a profile and a respect never before shown for a revolutionary movement in a small country.  The victory in 1918 is the moment when the momentum towards the establishment of an independent Irish State started building.  We in Ireland were the first colony and we were the beginning of the end of the British Empire.  This was a major achievement.<\/p><p>There is no political figure in Irish history before or since de Valera who overcame so many obstacles on his way to becoming a national leader.  I should add that Count Plunkett, who was elected in the 1917 by-election in the winter and snow, was the first republican to be elected, from County Roscommon, but that was prior to the new voting arrangements.<\/p><p>It is important to recognise, honour and show our gratitude for the pioneering work of the suffrage movement that secured women&rsquo;s right to vote.  It involved women like Margaret Cousins from Boyle, County Roscommon, and Hannah Sheehy Skeffington, who founded the Irish Women&rsquo;s Franchise League, and Countess Markievicz, the first woman elected to parliament in a general election in 1918.  She was appointed as a Minister and we had to wait until Charles J. Haughey to appoint M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn as a Minister in 1979, which was a major step by a very progressive Taoiseach.  No Taoiseach before him had appointed a woman as Minister since Countess Markievicz.  M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn was a great Minister, and Mary O&rsquo;Rourke was appointed after her.<\/p><p>I regret that the Fine Gael-Labour Government tried to abolish this Seanad which has had more women representatives than the D&aacute;il.  It would have been a major loss to women in this country had this House been abolished because women are making a major contribution in this House and will continue to do so.  Had Enda Kenny had his way, this House would have been abolished and there would have been no women Senators here today had the unprogressive Fine Gael-Labour Government, which never did anything for women in this country-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#B00200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>This is supposed to be about women, not about Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#B00300","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I will tell Members something that is degrading to today's debate.

There were many events during the year, including visiting England with the portrait of Countess Markievicz and visiting Eva Gore-Booth's grave.  There was a very powerful transition year debate in which young people from across Ireland participated.  In that, we looked back at the past century to the radicalism and the struggle to achieve suffrage then, but we also looked forward to what we hope for in equality and equal participation in politics in the future.  It was a very important moment for us.  Looking to the past and the diverse traditions from which the women, and men, who fought for suffrage came, and then looking to the future and seeing the young people today all acknowledge that we have not achieved equality, but that they all want it and that the momentum is there, it was clear, hearing them speak, that we are at a particular moment which is also part of history.<\/p><p>In 2018, we are at a moment when women's equality has moved from issues of potential access or representation or being able to enter systems to a point where women across politics, the arts, science and every area of public and collective endeavour are saying they do not want merely to participate but to shape these areas and determine them.  We are looking for systemic change for a politics that is deeply equal and not just equal participation in politics.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That momentum is there and that is the sea-change we are looking at.

It is very important that we do not now say that is the part of our centenary celebrations where we celebrate women because it is not over.  There were women such as Winnie Kearney who put an incredible socialist vision of what the nation might be into her manifesto when she ran in Belfast and Constance Markievicz who was a Minister for Labour and sat in the First D&aacute;il .  It is very important that we keep a focus on the contribution, actions and ideas of women in shaping the First D&aacute;il and its programme and the rest of our history.  I look forward to ensuring that remains part of our discussion on this centenary.  It has been an absolute honour to work with my colleagues in these Houses in this year and I look forward to working with them in further commemoration and further transformation of our country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#B01500","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I too commend the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 committee under the chairmanship of Senator Bacik.  We had a very successful year and it was great that the committee crossed parties and everybody made a contribution.  I also commend the individuals and the organisations throughout the country and beyond who organised events to mark the anniversary of 100 years since women got the vote, the suffrage movement, Countess Markievicz and the 1918 elections.<\/p> <p>Last Saturday was a poignant and memorable day as our Sinn F&eacute;in Ard Chomhairle was held at Lissadell House, the home of Constance Markievicz and Eva Gore Booth.  Countess Markievicz was a Sinn F&eacute;in Member of Parliament, MP, who, like the other 72 Sinn F&eacute;in MPs elected at the time, refused to take her seat in Westminster.  The next woman MP to be elected was Sinn F&eacute;in's Michelle Gildernew in Fermanagh South Tyrone in 2001.  They were among the women and men who came together from every class, creed and background and from rural communities, the slums of Dublin city and everywhere in between.  These women rejected the confines of class and privilege to join the combination of the national women's movement and the labour movement declaring that they stood for the Republic.<\/p> <p>The campaign for women's suffrage had started years earlier and women refused to participate in the 1911 census on the basis that if women do not count, they did not want to be counted.  We should remember Winifred Kearney who stood in East Belfast.  She was a socialist, trade unionist, feminist and republican.  I commend the 1916 relatives association and National Graves Association on the wonderful tribute they organised in Milltown Cemetery earlier this year.  I also commend Deirdre Hargey, the Lord Mayor of Belfast, for the portrait unveiling last month.  Dr. Kathleen Lynn, a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, was another revolutionary, patriot, suffragette and proud Mayo woman.  She gave her entire life to health care.  I ask that all Members of this House join the campaign to name the national children's hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn.  The aim of these women was the same as that of Wolfe Tone, to break the connection with England and to assert the independence of our country.  Their story is one of determination, independence, idealism and self-sacrifice in pursuit of the freedom of the Irish people.  We continue to be inspired by them today as we continue the struggle for an Ireland based on equality, freedom, peace and prosperity.<\/p> <p>A century on, it is timely to reflect on the progress which has been made in breaking the glass ceiling.  While these were the most unmanageable of revolutionaries, they forged the road on which we still have far to go.  Women are still something of a novelty in political life.  There are things we need to do, including closing the gender gap, creating lives free from violence, providing affordable childcare, ending economic inequality and bringing more women into political life.  There can be no liberation without women's liberation so the struggle for equality will continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#C00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I commend everybody who has been involved in V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100.

We are very grateful for people like that.<\/p> <p>We have great Irish women here now.  Some of them are in the Seanad Chamber today, playing their role.  Politics is a difficult place for women.  There are some great women councillors but we could have more if politics was a more forgiving career path and it is not always that way.  I agree with Senator Mullen that, even in the Houses of the Oireachtas, it is very difficult for a woman, for instance, from a rural part of the country to have to commute to Dublin.  We have to be more forgiving.  That is an area that needs to be addressed, as does the pay equality issue for women.  Maybe women can provide even better for society than we can.

Good laws are made when we are clear on their implications.  For instance, I have looked at some of the figures in the United States where the carrying out of abortions is widespread.  The taxpayer covers roughly 24% of abortion costs, which is in stark contrast with what is being proposed here.  It has been proposed that the taxpayer cover all of the cost.  There are arguments that can be made in that regard.  For instance, the vast majority of services available within the health service are based on ability to pay.  The medical card system protects those who are not able to access services by allowing them to access care when they cannot afford to pay for it.  The Minister is proposing a universal service to be funded by the taxpayer, irrespective of a person's income or financial status.<\/p> <p>According to the information I could find, in the United States the cost of an abortion in the first trimester is about $400.  In the second trimester it is around $850.  Interestingly, the American taxpayer has the protection of legislation.  The Hyde amendment which was adopted in 1997 allows the federal government to fund abortion services through Medicaid but only in cases of rape, incest and life endangerment.  It tightens the life endangerment exception to permit payment only when a woman's life is threatened by a physical disorder, physical injury or physical illness, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy.  It is quite restrictive and not universally available.  In short, the Hyde amendment has never imposed an absolute ban on the provision of federal government funding for abortion services.  However, without the amendment, Medicaid would be liable for the cost of an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 additional abortions every year.  Only a small fraction of the cost of the 15.6% of abortions financed by Medicaid is paid with federal dollars.  In 2010 the federal Government paid for 331 abortions through Medicaid, while states funded 113,000. <\/p> <p>The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion institute in the United States, has provided research.

Its conclusion was that the vast majority of abortions in the United States, or more than 95%, would not meet the stringent Hyde amendment standards.

The reality here is that, unfortunately, we do not know how many abortions there will be given that abortion will be unrestricted up to 12 weeks.  We are dealing with scarce resources and competing demands.  The taxpayer is not left liable for all of the services under the American model.  Even if we look at the care provided, as I mentioned, and was outlined by the doctor's letter which I read, it appears that the funding provided for abortion services is much greater than the funding provided for the care the State extends to children who are born.  That raises grave questions and would lead us to believe the Government is funding the termination of children to a greater extent than who are born. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#F01100","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>The Senator is strongly off topic now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#F01200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>That is the essence of the amendment.

The amendment arises out of a discussion on Committee Stage but it was not the subject of an amendment on Committee Stage.  I raised the issue of the funding of abortion from taxpayers' funds on Second Stage.  It is one of the many aspects of the Bill which has very little support among the electorate, with 60% opposing this proposal according to recent research.  The amendment provides: \"No public moneys shall be provided by the Oireachtas to pay for the carrying out of a termination of pregnancy, other than a termination of pregnancy in accordance with section 9 or 10 in a case where there is a risk to the life of the pregnant woman.\"<\/p> <p>The amendment would provide funding in situations where the procedure is carried out to save the life of the woman in line with what has always been best medical practice in this country and in line with the basic principle that, where life is at risk, the State and the health service should do everything possible to avert that risk.  I remind the House that Dr. Mary Holohan and others stated before the referendum that doctors were in no way impeded from addressing physical conditions of women arising from the eighth amendment.  This amendment only prohibits State funding of elective abortions, that is, those carried out arising out of a choice as opposed to bona fide medical treatment.<\/p> <p>When we say abortion is an elective procedure in all cases, it is to say that, other than in cases of emergency situations not covered by this amendment, it is a procedure which is optional and not medically indicated.  There are only a very small number of situations where abortion is an acute procedure, in other words, where intervention is required in an emergency situation to save the life of the mother.  There were just 13 such terminations in Ireland in 2017 compared with an estimated total of at least 4,000 abortions in 2017, either from those travelling abroad or importing abortion pills.  Statistically speaking, about 99.97% of abortions performed on Irish women every year have been elective procedures carried out as a matter of choice.<\/p> <p>In future, each of these procedures is to be entirely funded by the State.  What other elective procedures are performed entirely at the expense of the taxpayer and the State in all cases?  Perhaps the Minister can answer that question.  I cannot claim to be familiar with the full range of procedures available in our public hospitals but I certainly cannot think of any.  Representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and the Institute of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians were asked the same question at the Joint Committee on Health on 19 December.  I think they said they could not identify another elective procedure which is funded entirely by the taxpayer.  Will the Minister please address this point?  Why is abortion to be the only elective procedure funded entirely by the State?  Is the termination of pregnancy a more important procedure in his view than acute, life-saving procedures which are in need of public funding?  This is why I do not believe the Minister when he says that he wants abortion to be rare.  He is making an exception of abortion in wanting all abortions to be fully funded by the State.  How can this be justified when other elective procedures will still be paid for by the person receiving the treatment, provided he or she can endure lengthy waiting lists?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As abortion is being rolled out as quickly as possible and free of charge, according to the HSE, the number of other elective procedures being carried out in our hospitals has fallen from 187,000 in 2012 to 86,000 in 2017 due to mass cancellations as a result of the chaos in our health system.  Apparently, no elective orthopaedic procedures have been performed in Tralee General Hospital for much of the past six months.  Meanwhile the Seanad sat until 2 a.m. on Wednesday, not to allocate funding to remedy that situation but to bring in a procedure for which funding will be fully allocated even while funding is not available for the situations about which I am talking.  Members of Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party, who stand up in this House and the other House every day to complain about the lack of funding in the health system, have no objection to public money being spent on abortions at a time of dire funding needs for treatments that will save lives rather than end them.<br\/><br\/>When the Oireachtas Committee on Health discussed this matter on 19 September, Deputy O'Connell objected to the description of abortion as an elective procedure and launched into what has now become a trademark personalised attack when she said that to class women seeking an abortion as attempting to access elective services is to try to diminish women and is totally disrespectful of them.  She attacked the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Harty, saying that the Chairman is a medical doctor and did not pull the member up on the usage of the phrase &quot;elective services&quot;.  If she had done any research on the point beforehand, she would have found that <i>mariestopes.ie<\/i>, the Irish website of the largest and most profitable abortion business in the UK, describes abortion as &quot;an elective procedure&quot;.

In fact, the exact intention of the provisions of section 25 of this Bill, which directly prohibits profit in this area, when taken with the universal access provisions, is to ensure this service is provided on the basis of need and no inappropriate incentive is attached to it for any company.  It is very important that these services are publicly delivered.  The many people who campaigned in favour of the repeal of the eighth amendment made it very clear that they were doing so on the basis that there would be free, safe and legal access to these services.  I believe most people share those aspirations for all aspects of our health service.  They believe it should be free, legal and safe.  In light of the deep and cruel inequities in the American system, where people are having contraception removed from their cover, it is extraordinary to hear similar measures being proposed as some kind of alternative here.  Such proposals are disrespectful to a country which has a national health service, and where people know the value of having a national health service which is a national health service.<\/p><p>I remind those who have spoken about the taxpayers of Ireland that it is clear from all surveys of Irish taxpayers that people want public services.  They want a health service that is delivered publicly.  I applaud this positive aspect of the Bill.  We should not be challenging it in any way.  In that context, I would like to note briefly that there is a rebranding attempt in section 12.  It is not a matter of what is elective.  Senator Mullen has used the word \"elective\" in respect of section 12, which relates to the period of early pregnancy when people access these services on the basis of need, for example following rape or incest.  We are trusting the woman to know it is necessary.  The committee found that it is neither possible nor feasible to determine rape or incest within the applicable time period, and therefore we are not seeking to provide for that.  I remind those who are concerned about safety - again, the phrase \"free, safe and legal\" comes to mind - that this approach is being taken because these matters are time-sensitive.  We do not want to move into a time period that might cause people to unnecessarily have procedures or surgical interventions that are less safe.  An attempt has been made to add a layer of extraordinarily expensive, medically unnecessary and deeply distressing procedures to the proposed regime.  This proposal is somewhat hypocritical because it would add not only to the cost involved, but also to the difficulty and distress of these procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#G02100","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Does Senator Ruane wish to contribute at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#H00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>No, I am okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#H00300","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Does Senator Humphreys wish to contribute at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#H00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I want to make it clear that throughout the referendum campaign, Senator Bacik and I were among the many people who argued that these services should be free, legal and safe.

Certain Senators who campaigned on the \"No\" side constantly told the electorate that if the referendum were passed, the Minister would try to make these services free in this country.  I saw the billboards with my name on them that were erected around the country as part of very personal attacks and said I would ensure this service would be funded by the taxpayer.  Op-eds were written in newspapers.  Press releases were issued.  Those who campaigned for a \"No\" vote made it very clear what my intentions were.  I thank them for doing so.  In bringing forward this service in my role as Minister for Health, I have always been very clear that it should be free, safe and legal, as Senator Humphreys has correctly said.

If we want people to be able to access new services that are safe and legal, it makes sense to make those services available on a universal basis.  Those of us who are in favour of caring for women in our own country in terms of abortion care and healthcare find the word \"elective\" offensive because, as Senator Higgins has said, those who use it are judging women's reasons for accessing these services and pretending they know those reasons.  There is always a reason.  No woman gets up in the morning and decides she would like an abortion.  The connotation that accompanies the word \"elective\" suggests that a kind of light-hearted decision is being made.  That is why it is constantly used.  Senator Mullen might not use it in that way, but that is the way many women to whom I have spoken consider that it is being used.  There is always a reason for an abortion - it is just that the woman involved does not need to tell the Senator that reason.  We trust each woman to engage with her doctor.  We do not need anyone to judge their decisions.  If we are going to continue to quote other countries' legislation as fact in this country, it will be a very interesting day.

I am sure some of the &euro;12 million that has been mentioned will be spent on some of the things that Senators Mullen and &Oacute; Domhnaill do not seem to have a problem with.  I acknowledge that they do not have a problem with providing funding where there is a risk to a woman's life.  That is the first point.  The second point I would make is that &euro;12 million out of a budget of &euro;17 billion works out at 0.0007% of the 2019 health budget, by my calculations.  I am not sure about what Senator Norris said about filling a pothole in County Mayo, but he is certainly correct when he suggests that it is a very small sum of money.  It grates on every bone in my body when people point to other challenges in the health service as a reason not to do this.  They seem to be suggesting that when everyone in Ireland has had a cataract operation or a hip operation, maybe we can come back and talk about women's reproductive health.  They seem to think that a woman must wait until that point has been reached.  I heard the debate that the Seanad had to celebrate 100 years of women's suffrage in this country.  The suggestion that we might get around to women's sexual health in another 100 years, after we have sorted out cataracts, is a terrible sort of backdrop against which to be celebrating and commemorating that anniversary.  Of course we are going to sort out cataracts.  Senator Mullen rightly pointed out that it is a cause of great frustration to me as Minister and to citizens in this country that our citizens sometimes travel for healthcare.  I remind him that this Bill is addressing that.  It is stopping women having to travel for healthcare.  The Senator has a difficulty with a man getting a bus from Cork to Belfast for a cataract procedure - I am not happy that this needs to happen - but he has no difficulty with a woman and perhaps her partner having to get the plane or the boat to Liverpool.  There is an irony in that situation.<\/p> <p>In this country, we already provide free healthcare for pregnant women.  I think that is one of the successes of past Governments.  It is something that enjoys widespread support across the political spectrum and across society.  We provide free healthcare for pregnant women.  The Senator is suggesting we should provide free healthcare for certain pregnant women only.  He is saying that free healthcare should not be provided to a pregnant woman unless we like the decision she has made.  Under his approach, two women sitting in a GP surgery would be treated differently.  The woman who decides to continue with her pregnancy would be told that it is no problem and the State will meet the cost of her healthcare.  The woman who decides for her own reasons - there is always a reason - that she cannot continue with her pregnancy would be sent a bill.  The particularly offensive aspect of these amendments is that they exclude fatal foetal abnormalities.  I am sure that is not accidental.  The Senator has gone through the legislation and chosen certain sections that he is happy to exempt from his non-universal provision of service.  Unless he tells me otherwise, he has made a conscious decision to exclude fatal foetal abnormalities.  Maybe he is saying that after a family has gone through the most horrific situation - we have all heard these stories from the Termination for Medical Reasons Ireland group - we should send them a very hefty bill for the use of the hospital bed and for all they have gone through.  I do not believe that is something the citizens of this country support.<\/p> <p>I would like to make a final point.  I have heard continuous references in this House and in the other House to an opinion poll.  I am not going to go back through what I heard in the other House.  God almighty, are we going to start quoting opinion polls?  If opinion polls were always right, Brexit would not have happened and Hillary Clinton would be the American President.  By the way, we had a referendum and not an opinion poll.  Senators keep quoting opinion polls.  I thought that as politicians, we do not pay any attention to opinion polls.  We had a poll.  Lots and lots of people voted.  More than 1.4 million people voted for us to get on with this.  Today, we are going to get on with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#H01000","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I will start on the last point around opinion polls.

That is what happens within Departments and Government.  We saw how the Taoiseach had to calm down his spin unit, which was effectively a polling spin unit carrying out polls to find out what people think and basing policy around it.<\/p><p>The Minister should not be disingenuous.  He should at least acknowledge this is the only credible poll, with plus or minus 3% accuracy, that has taken place since the referendum.  The question in the poll relating to taxpayer funding was whether people were in favour of or opposed to taxpayers funding unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks.  The results found that 88% of \"No\" voters did not favour taxpayer funding with the same view held by 44% of \"Yes\" voters.  Overall 59% of all adults who were surveyed opposed the taxpayer funding model of abortion.  That is in line with our amendment.<\/p><p>According to the World Health Organization every year in the world there are 125,000 abortions.  It is a lucrative industry worldwide, whether people want to acknowledge that.  It would be wrong and complicit of the Government to enter into the policy in this Bill that would allow that industry to flourish in future.  That is essentially what is happening here.  Taxpayers are entitled to conscientious objection on a moral issue of life or death.  This is a life-or-death Bill.  The amendment does not include sections 9 or 10.<\/p><p>The World Health Organization document on technical and policy guidelines for health systems makes it absolutely clear in the recommendations that financing of abortion services should take into account costs to the health system while ensuring that services are affordable.  However, \"affordable\" is far from being universal.  That is the point I am making.<\/p><p>I would not like to fall into a pothole that would cost &euro;12 million to repair - that is for sure.  The Minister's argument that &euro;12 million is only small change in the overall expenditure of the Department and that it represents only a small percentage simply does not wash.  A total of &euro;12 million is not small change.  We live in the real world and &euro;12 million is a great deal of money.  We are setting out with &euro;12 million but, based on this Bill, if passed, the figure will increase substantially.<\/p><p>Reference was made to the campaign issues around billboards and people who campaigned to say that it should be universally available.  That may be so for campaigners on the pro-choice side but the Government position was clear.  It has since changed or the truth has been revealed.  On 31 January this year, the Taoiseach attended the launch of the referendum campaign.  He said that abortions would be safe, legal and rare.  That is not what is in this Bill.  There is nothing about rarity in this Bill.  The taxpayer is going to fund universal abortions up to 12 weeks irrespective.  The dishonest language, the spinning of this issue and the tactics being used are disingenuous.  The perception that it is only a small amount of money adds to the vacuum that has been created around this area and the dishonesty that has been attached to it.  Unfortunately, what will happen is that, as Deputy MacSharry, a good colleague of mine, said in the other House, abortion up to 12 weeks will become the contraception of choice for some people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#H01100","speaker":"1382","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill should take that back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#J00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>That is absolutely disgraceful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#J00300","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>That is so insulting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#J00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>That is a grotesque comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#J00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, do not use issues that attract attention.

The logic was that the word \"examined\" had a degree of legal and medical clarity that variations did not have.  Even in our exchanges yesterday, it became apparent that sticking additional words into the legislation would have placed, for entirely unintended reasons, additional barriers and tests in the way of a doctor trying to provide a service to a woman.  Based on the very strong legal advice I have received and the reasons outlined by medical professionals, including the Chief Medical Officer, to Members of the Seanad, including a number of sponsors of this amendment, I strongly urge the House to reflect on the matter.

From talking to people in the medical profession after the referendum, I know the important point, which is related to the central point that was confused and clouded for a long time, is that we must bring clarity and certainty to the matter.

Once the 12-week protective period has passed, lawful abortion will be available only for reasons related to a serious health risk.  This is unlikely to serve the needs of pregnant people in Ireland, some of whom will seek abortion after 12 weeks for other reasons.  These are serious considerations.

I am, however, very cognisant that this was the framework on which we campaigned for repeal and on which there was a general consensus in the repeal movement that we should campaign.  Doctors have told us it is an operable framework that does not pose a barrier that is too inaccessible in the provision of safe and legal abortion.

I understand the value of teasing out, as we did in the other House, what is harm, serious harm and risk.  My first point is similar to Senator Bacik's.  This wording has not changed since the publication of the draft wording and this is very much the framework on which we campaigned.  As the Senators know, it is something I am holding to as we take the legislation through the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>Senator Kelleher is entirely right and it is appropriate that these matters are teased out in guidelines written by clinicians who will be operating under the law, as opposed to people like me being overly prescriptive.  I do not mean to be pejorative but we, as legislators, may accidentally interfere in the work of clinicians getting that right.  I fully agree with Senator Kelleher that it is very important we have good guidelines.  There is much work being done by many really dedicated clinicians to ensure that is the case.  I have consciously taken the decision, as has the Government, not to define the word \"serious\" in the legislation.  If we did so, we would tie the hands of doctors.  This must be about clinical judgment, which is important.  I imagine the concerns of the people would be more heightened if the word \"serious\" was defined.  I would not have brought in legislation in that regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik made the important point that we need to read section 9(1) in totality as all the words matter.  If we pick just one word, such as \"serious\", but do not consider the likes of the word \"appropriate\", we might miss the context.

An action may have been clinically shown to be likely to reduce a risk from 60% to 20% but not to fully avert that risk.  My amendment is not in perfect English but it is an attempt to respond to the Minister's point on Committee Stage that it was the word he had put to the public.  I have suggested \"avert or substantially avert\" to indicate there is scope in the word \"avert\".  In yesterday's briefing, we were told that \"avert\" related to the increased risk and not to serious harm.  It would be impossible to say we can avert serious harm.  We can diminish the risk of serious harm or mitigate it but, if an action results in harm, could there be a vulnerability in its interpretation in this context?  In the expected implementation of this provision, did the Minister say this was to avert an increase in risk, but not serious harm?

Like Senator Higgins, I would like the Minister to clarify, as we heard yesterday at the briefing, the nature of that clinical decision-making test.  It is important that we do not just take one word in the test out of context and that we consider how the test will operate in clinical practice and how it will be operated by doctors.  It was very useful to hear the practical illustrations given to us by doctors yesterday to explain how this would work in practice, and how it will work to enable women to access abortion in the sort of life-saving or serious harm-averting circumstances envisaged in section 9.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#O00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I have heard from the Attorney General and the chief medical officer and from our clinical adviser, Dr. Peter Boylan, that their preference is for the wording to remain as it is, legally and clinically.  Several Senators had an opportunity to hear from clinicians yesterday in that regard too.<\/p> <p>I really welcome Senator Higgins's amendment, not because I am in a position to support it but for the exact reason that she outlines, because it does provide me with an opportunity to correct what had been a misinterpretation or a discussion that has not been formed in fact, in terms of what the words in the legislation say.  Senator Bacik is right; we should read all of the words.  To take this sentence as an example, it states \"it is appropriate to carry out the termination of pregnancy in order to avert the risk\".  The phrase, \"serious harm\" is not even in that sentence.  We have been having a discussion in the other House about whether it is better to avert or mitigate the serious harm but that is not in the legislation.  The question is does it \"avert the risk\".  I want to be crystal clear, and it is easy to be because it is there in black and white, that this legislation talks about averting \"the risk\", not about the test being to avert the serious harm.  They are substantially different and are legally and clinically understood to be substantially different. <\/p> <p>In response to the amendments tabled by Senator Devine and her Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, I would make the same point and add one more.  We need to be very careful about putting additional words into legislation, particularly on Report Stage, rather than reading the section of the Bill in its totality, which has been so robustly legally tested and scrutinised by the Attorney General.  I worry when we start sticking in the word, or anything, that we are applying another test or another thing a doctor has to consider.  We saw yesterday that there is great clarity among those working to roll out this service on what \"avert\" and \"avert the risk\" mean.  This is very much also in line with the draft general scheme published in advance of the referendum.  I propose not to accept these amendments but to welcome the opportunity to provide that clarity, that it is a question of averting the risk not about averting serious harm.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#O00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"vote","time":1544697000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 9; N\u00edl, 20.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators M\u00e1ire Devine and Paul Gavan; N\u00edl, Senators Gabrielle McFadden and Catherine Noone.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#O00400","aye":["1408","1378","1388","1389","1405","1400","1413","1404","1372"],"nay":["1402","1409","1423","1391","1384","1376","1422","1416","1424","1438","1386","1375","1425","1398","1406","1392","1374","1427","1426","1399"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, line 25, after &ldquo;avert&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or mitigate&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#P00100","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#P00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544697000,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, line 25, after &ldquo;avert&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or substantially avert&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>The Minister indicated that this was to avert risk.

It states the following. <\/p><blockquote>This section is intended to enable access to abortion for those people who find themselves in the distressing circumstances of having received a diagnosis that their pregnancy is not likely to lead to a positive birth outcome.  In contrast to the wording of the General Scheme published in March 2018, the section now specifies that the foetus must have a condition likely to lead to death within 28 days of birth.  While diagnosis of foetal anomaly involves high levels of certainty, prognosis does not.  While it may be possible to predict that death soon after birth is likely, it is not usually possible to set out the exact time frame within which it will occur.  Timelines of this sort are not currently used in clinical practice as part of the prognosis for a particular condition.  The legislation clearly excludes cases where life expectancy after birth is short, and potentially burdensome and painful for the recently delivered foetus.  This means that parents who receive diagnoses of serious and fatal anomalies, but where a life expectancy of less than 28 days cannot confidently be predicted, will still be required to travel abroad for abortion care if they decide they cannot continue with the pregnancy.<br \/><br \/>There is nothing to suggest that the 28-day time limit excludes invasive and intrusive measures to keep the newly born foetus artificially alive, but possibly in great pain and with little or no prospect of independent, pain-free survival.  The 28-day time limit has not been scrutinised ...  There is no need to specify a timeline for foetal death in the legislation; instead the wording as proposed in the March 2018 General Scheme [should] be restored.  This clearly limits access to lawful abortion to situations of fatal diagnosis for the foetus, but better supports parents who decide it would best to access abortion care in Ireland where an exact life expectancy cannot be clinically predicted.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#R00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Norris for tabling this amendment.

We opted for the 28-day period.<\/p> <p>I will make two points in direct response to Senator Norris's amendment.  First, what about protection for a doctor?  Sometimes things are not an exact science.  I contend, as would the Attorney General, that the phrases \"of the reasonable opinion\" and \"formed in good faith\" provide a clinical protection because what we are asking our clinicians to do is to arrive at a viewpoint in their reasonable opinion and in good faith.  I think this gives our clinicians protection in that we are trusting them to make the appropriate decisions.<\/p> <p>The Senator also raised a very important issue about viability when he asked whether there would have to be very intrusive measures.

Clearly, what we have seen in this legislation is the elevation of a certain ideology of choice over the welfare of unborn children and, at the same time, a medicalisation of claims for abortion that are not in keeping with time-honoured bona fide medical healthcare for women, including where such bona fide medical care would adversely affect the unborn child, which has never been opposed.<\/p><p>That was the reason the amendment on taxpayers' money was so important.  Although the Minister in his analysis of our amendment sought to confine the issue to cases he could speak about in emotive terms, the reality is that the vast majority of cases of abortion, and I gave the figure of 99.97% in Britain, do not have anything to do with what one could call medical grounds.  That is why it is such a corruption of medicine and is so wrong and unjust.<\/p><p>It is worth quoting from O'Flaherty J, in the case of McKenna <i>v.<\/i>An Taoiseach, where he stated: &quot;The public purse must not be expended to espouse a point of view which may be anathema to certain citizens who, of necessity, have contributed to it.&quot;  This Bill goes much further than that by expanding the public purse to take countless innocent lives, something that is clearly anathema to at least hundreds of thousands of citizens.  The taxpayer funding scheme is contrary to the will of the majority of adults in Ireland, as we pointed out was correctly shown in an Am&aacute;rach poll.  With so much polling taking place, sometimes at taxpayers' expense, to test the waters on what can be successfully promoted and pushed, I found it interesting that when serious opinion poll evidence emerged, including in the exit poll after the referendum, which was a very professional affair, this Government, which is so reliant on polls, cast doubt on the information we were deriving from polls.  This is another example of the politics of rhetoric over substance.<\/p><p>I might say in passing that it was interesting that I was criticised earlier by both Senator Higgins and the Minister for pointing out that the Minister was not truthful or forthcoming before the referendum about his intention that abortion would be made available freely and paid for by the taxpayer.  It is interesting also that while Senator Higgins said that several of my comments were inaccurate, she did not manage to point to one.  The one she attempted to point to was that there were billboards attacking the issue and making this claim.  The Minister then said that we should almost be glad that he was following through on his promise.

I welcome the few hours we spent with the Minister and doctors yesterday.  This is one of the areas on which I have been persuaded a little, whereas I was not convinced by the argument against deleting the word \"serious\".  It is important that these important points are not debated in rooms elsewhere.  It is better to have them on the record of the House.  Amendment No. 17 deals with how a threat to a woman's life or health might arise from her living circumstances and the possibility that she may have to see a doctor on two or more occasions to access the healthcare she needs.  We got to a point yesterday where there was an acknowledgement that some women do not believe they have the ability to advocate for themselves, their healthcare and their rights, perhaps because they are members of a minority group or another group or for reasons of low educational attainment.  It is all well and good talking about a public campaign and helplines but these do not always reach everyone.  The important point for me was how these women would know that they would come under an emergency provision or even that they could inquire of their doctors about an emergency provision.  What became apparent to me is that in regard to all health inequity, a certain amount of awareness training is needed for doctors who work in areas of deprivation to ensure they understand the social context in which they work.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is about being able to understand the situation of a woman in poor living circumstances and, in a primary care setting, to be able to make that woman aware that there are provisions available to her, rather than expecting that she would already know about them and be able to advocate for access to them.  We had some discussions on this yesterday.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on that in respect of amendment No. 17.  Programmes exist to train GPs to work in areas of deprivation and it would be helpful to know whether the provision of terminations and the related services will also be included in this training for that group of women.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 18, it is something on which we have never had a clear answer.  Where a woman's first access to a doctor results in a conscientious objection, having waited for an appointment and visited the doctor only to be told that an abortion would not be provided for her, I want to ensure that once she had subsequently found a provider who would give her the service she needed, that she did not have to wait a further three days.  Awareness campaigns do not always reach every community.

As Senator Ruane said, we did discuss this at length with the Minister yesterday and we debated it at length on Committee Stage.  It is critical that section 12's three-day waiting period does not become an insurmountable barrier to some women.  It is critical that in guidelines, doctors are given great clarity as to the linkage between section 12, the early pregnancy section, and section 10, that of the risk to life or health in an emergency.  As Senator Ruane noted, the question of how this will work in practice with doctors is crucial.  We must ensure that doctors, and everyone else, understand that section 10 applies at any point in the pregnancy before the end of the 12-week period, so that it will work in parallel with section 12.  That is very important for those of us with concerns about the three-day waiting period.  We would prefer if it was not in the legislation but we are trying to do the best we can to ensure that it does not become an insurmountable barrier to some women in the sort of circumstances that Senator Ruane so eloquently described.<\/p> <p>When we come to amendment No. 14, Senator Norris has asked that I withdraw it on his behalf.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#T00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>This is one area where we have effectively been asked to put our trust in the training that might be provided for doctors, in terms of clinical guidelines and how things unfold.  I want to mark the real concerns in this area.  It is not merely the case that the guidelines are there but there must be engagement on how the practice unfolds.  We must ensure that, for instance, the word \"serious\" is not interpreted in such a way that it does have a chilling effect in practice.  We must ensure we monitor what happens and that we listen, because it took a long time as a nation to listen to the stories of women, and doctors, as to how things tend to unfold in reality.  Either these will go forward and be successful or we will have to revisit these issues.  If \"serious\" is interpreted in a way that it was in symphysiotomy, and I hope that never happens, whereby something would be regarded as not serious so long as a woman could continue reproducing, it will be an issue.  That has happened in Ireland and many of these issues are almost cultural.  I accept that we may not want to deal with all of these in legislation but they are matters of practice.<\/p> <p>We should be watchful of a pattern emerging in which people attend a first appointment but do not follow up three days later.  There is concern that visiting the doctor can be a great effort for people in difficult living situations, particularly in situations of violence, insecurity or in which their attendance anywhere is attached to the care of many other vulnerable persons of whom they may be the carer.  We should be careful that people need not look to alternative routes because this serves as an obstacle.  I accept that the emergency provision in section 12 may serve in that regard but we may need to revisit it.  There may be measures such as time-delay prescriptions or phone consultations.  We may need to examine this in different ways to see that it is working.  While I might not wish for a three-day delay, I understand that the principle is being enshrined in the legislation but we must monitor it carefully so that it does not block access to the most vulnerable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#T00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I support amendment No. 13, which is a consequential amendment.

I know and very much respect that there are different views on the three-day waiting period but it is sensible that people are discussing how it will operate and work in practice.  <\/p> <p>It may seem obvious but something that should not be lost in this debate is that this is not the only ground on which someone can access a termination legally in our country under this legislation.  It is one ground - a wide ground - to support women in early pregnancy without them being obliged to give their reason and that trusts the woman to make the decision that is best for her and for her family at that stage of early pregnancy.  There are obviously other grounds beyond that.  The one that has come most into focus in discussions on groups living in disadvantaged areas, vulnerable groups and so on, as Senator Ruane so eloquently made the point, is the emergency head, which is an important provision in that regard.  I take very seriously, as do the clinicians who met the Senator and her colleague yesterday, the importance of ensuring that GPs and medical professionals more broadly are trained in the advocacy to which Senator Ruane referred and of how women know of the emergency provision and how it operates.  I will raise it in my engagements with the medical colleges as they prepare both their training programme and clinical guidelines.  I very much welcome Senator Ruane's ongoing support and engagement on this issue.  <\/p> <p>I cannot accept the amendment regarding conscientious objection for several reasons but primarily because the legislation states clearly that the certification needs to take place before the three-day period commences.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I worry about the consequences it would have, therefore, throughout the legislation beyond this amendment.  We have taken every effort to minimise conscientious objection being a barrier, while respecting the right of people to hold it.  Let me be clear on that on the record of the House.We know, however, that women do not operate in the way in which some people have tried to characterise them during this debate.  Women will not be going around from doctor to doctor in the hope of finding medical assistance.  There will be the 24-7 helpline, the<i>www.myoptions.ie<\/i>website and advocacy groups will have to be informed of these new provisions.  That is to minimise the possibility of a woman ever having to come across the awfully undesirable situation for her where she is asking for help and the doctor states that he or she is not in a position to do so or is not willing to do so.  I believe we can significantly overcome the issues, from an access point of view, in respect of conscientious objection through the measures we have taken and the measures our medical community and clinical leaders are actively taking.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#T00500","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 13 being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#U00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#U00300","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544697000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 14 arises out of Committee proceedings.

We did, however, discuss the issue at some considerable length on Committee Stage.  Again, it refers to the grounds for abortion in section 9 and the use of the word \"appropriate\".  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the word is not to be found in the relevant Medical Council language.  It is to be contrasted with the use of the word \"necessary\" in section 10.  I have spoken a good deal about the corruption of medicine.  I have also said part of the corruption of medicine is an attempt to cloak access to abortion services on an elective basis in medical terms, thereby seeking to undermine opposition to it.  This fudging between what is elective, on the one hand, and what is necessary medically, on the other, is unique to the story of campaigning for access to abortion.  It is highly irresponsible to see the Government bend to that political tendency by choosing language that masks the distinction between procedures one could reasonably contemplate on legitimate medical grounds, on the one hand, and, on the other, the importation of an unusual level of subjectivity into assessment to allow abortions which, by definition, are harmful and fatal for the unborn baby to take place, even though there is no bona fide medical basis for them.  That is part of the corruption of language and politics for which the Government is responsible, as exemplified by this legislation.  On Committee Stage I pointed to the absence of the word \"appropriate\" in other medical circumstances.  It is clear that there is a desire to introduce abortion here, ostensibly on medical grounds but, in fact, where it is not judged to be necessary.<\/p> <p>It also departs from what I believe are the wishes of the people.  Apart from the 34% who opposed repeal completely because they wanted to protect both mothers and babies, many were reluctant \"Yes\" voters who did not want to see clever masking of access to abortion services by inappropriate medicalisation of the subject.  That is harmful and not the way to do politics.  It does a disservice to the women and unborn children in question.  It also does a disservice to the medical profession and all those who see a clear distinction between authentic care for mothers and babies, on the one hand, and decisions that are choice-based to avail of an elective procedure, on the other.<\/p> <p>I do not expect the Minister to accept the amendment.  It would not make sense for him to do so in the context of the substantial amendment not included for discussion today.  On that basis, I am not pressing the amendment, but I highlight the injustice, the dishonesty and sheer wrongness of departing from the legitimate and effective term of \"necessity\" and it does not have to be 100% or absolute, as the Minister claimed previously.  Again, it is an example of the use of political language.  The simple word \"necessary\" has always been effective and doctors have used it.  They are in a position to make reasonable judgments on necessity without having their hands tied.  \"Necessary\" is the word that should be used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#X00200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Without this amendment, an abortion can and will be performed right up to the point of viability on the basis of risks that can be averted in other ways.

The word \"necessary\" brings objectivity rather than subjectivity to this element of the legislation under the review committee in section 16.  That is why the amendment is so important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#X00300","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I have nothing to add.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#X00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544697000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544697000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 23 and 26 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#X01100","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<\/p><blockquote>In page 13, line 36, to delete &ldquo;or <i>section 12<\/i>certification&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, <i>section 12<\/i>certification or <i>section 22<\/i>&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#X01200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#X01300","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Amendment no. 23 is consequential, although it precedes amendment No. 26 which relates to parental notification.  In moving amendment No. 23 I am addressing both issues.  This amendment was discussed thoroughly on Committee Stage, although it was not put to a vote.  Colleagues may recall that I said I would prefer not to press the amendment on Committee Stage because I wanted to adjust the wording of subsections (6) and (7).  The key point is that the amendment would recognise the life-changing event that abortion certainly is for the unborn baby &ndash; it is a life-ending event.  As we know, the legislation provides for this life-ending event to take place without time limits in some cases and, potentially, late term in several cases.  I have pointed to the dangers of this legislation and my distress in recognising that some abortions could conceivably be late term or take place at an advanced stage of pregnancy.  Moreover, there is no provision for proper care in terms of pain relief, etc. or any requirement, where needed, where a baby is born alive, to sustain his or her life in a context where he or she is subjected to a procedure intended to end his or her life under the law.  It is clear that this is a grave matter from the perspective of the welfare of the unborn baby who is never spoken about by the Government.<\/p> <p>Of course, abortion can also be a life-changing event for women.  I have said that while no one should ever try to claim that all cases are the same, it is a fact that in some cases abortion regret is a reality for women.  This is often denied by abortion supporters as if it would somehow lessen their campaigning strength to admit the truth.  Also, I have pointed to the dangerous lack of clarity in the definition of \"health\".  The legislation exposes women to situations where procedures could take place, although there is no medical evidence that they would be therapeutic.  I also have pointed out how the science in this area shows that while there is no evidence to show abortion is therapeutic in the context of a mental health challenge, there is some evidence, albeit conflicting, to show when and how it might have negative or adverse sequelae or negative mental health effects.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One has to careful to be honest and honourable in pointing out what the best available research shows.  What the research shows is that abortion is more likely to be associated with elevated risks to mental health where women are young and unsupported.  It seems to me that it is precisely in situations where women are young and unsupported that the issue of whether and how parents are notified comes to be a relevant consideration.<\/p><p>I have made it clear already and will make it clear again that this is not about seeking parental consent.  It is about recognising the horrendous and extensive nature of this legislation and these amendments simply seek to make a bad and evil situation better and more humane.  I have pointed out that it is appropriate that parents would be notified where it is intended to carry out an abortion procedure on their child who is a minor.<\/p><p>I have also pointed out, and this amendment makes clear in subsection (6), that where one could be dealing with a situation where the parents are abusers and where it would not be in order to notify them, upon application being made to the High Court by an interested party, the court may make an order dispensing with any requirement for service of notice to the parents if it is satisfied that this is in the best interests of the minor concerned.  While an application of that nature should be made on notice to the parents, given that it is normally the case that an application sought in court would be made on notice to the other side, as it were, in other situations I referred to, this amendment allows for the possibility that the High Court, where satisfied in the particular circumstances of the case, may justly proceed to hear and determine the application without notice to the parents of the minor concerned.  Therefore, please let there be no talk of this amendment being burdensome on a child who might be subject to abuse or in situations where the pregnancy may have resulted from abuse in the home.<\/p><p>It was interesting that during the discussion on Committee Stage about situations where the pregnancy resulted from a situation of abuse, or perhaps a situation of a criminal nature, it was also acknowledged implicitly that in some cases it might not be criminal activity that led to the pregnancy of the minor involved.  We spoke about how challenging it can be, even for parents who would regard themselves as very attentive and vigilant, to know everything that is going on.  We hear every day about situations going on that are not in a child's best interests and of which their parents, who consider themselves to be responsible parents, are really unaware.  Parents need support in carrying out their primary duty under the Constitution, which the Constitution acknowledges that they have.  It is not acceptable, in legislation of such far-reaching significance, simply to rely, as the Minister and others have said, on other guidelines without setting out what ought to happen as a general principle.<\/p><p>My friend and colleague, Senator McDowell, and perhaps Senator Norris to a lesser extent if I recall correctly, spoke in terms of how onerous it would be to notify parents in this situation where it is sought to carry out an abortion procedure on a minor.  I did not recall it at the time, and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong - and I will happily accept correction if I am wrong - but I understand that, under the Children First guidelines, the child protection guidelines, if a child becomes pregnant and if Tusla is involved, it is mandatory that parents are told.  That did not occur to any of us the other evening, it must be said, neither to Senators McDowell and Norris nor to myself.  It puts my amendment in a much better light than my colleagues might have thought it deserved.  There is only one exception to that, which is if it is thought the child would be in further danger as a result of telling the parents.  As the Minister can see, that context is also recognised in my amendment.<\/p><p>Why would Senators or Government go against the spirit of the Tusla child protection guidelines?  This is legislation that for the first time permits the direct and intentional taking of innocent human life outside of it occurring in the context of bona fide medical necessity.  It is simply not acceptable to resort to guidelines and to say that, generally speaking, there will be a discussion about whether parents know and all of that soft law when what is needed in legislation that is far-reaching enough to permit the direct and intentional taking of innocent human life is the recognition of the particular and primary responsibility that parents have for their child's welfare in all but exceptional circumstances, and it should require that they at least be notified of this life-changing event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#X01400","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I formally second the amendment.

That is why Senator Mullen outlined the Tusla rationale.  That is important and it establishes the State's recognition of our amendment.<\/p><p>In addition to that, we outlined in some detail on Committee Stage that other European countries also recognise this in the area of abortion.  I understand that according to the World Health Organization, 21 other European countries which responded to a 2016 World Health Organization survey confirmed that legal access to abortion is only available to minors under 18 with parental consent.  Across the Atlantic in the United States, 40 state parental involvement laws are in effect.  I understand that 26 states require parental consent for minors seeking abortions and that ten states require parental notice for minors seeking abortions.<\/p><p>Our amendment is grounded in best international practice and we feel that it is important.  There are obviously difficulties with the issue, as mentioned by Senator Mullen, in cases where a child may have been abused by a parent and that is dealt with in the amendment.  This amendment is considered, it is important and I encourage the Minister again to accept it.  So much of the abortion debate in this country on the pro-abortion side was fuelled from international practice, but it seems that same international practice is being ignored when it provides for more humane elements to be brought into the law.  That is regrettable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#Y00400","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators.  As Senator Mullen said, we had a lengthy discussion on this on Committee Stage, although not a vote.  I want to be clear that the normal medical principles on consent will and must apply in relation to termination of pregnancy.  Consent to medical treatment by minors over the age of 16 is governed in the Statute Book, so this idea that we are entirely leaving it to guidelines is not actually correct.  It is governed by section 23 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Furthermore, consent to medical treatment for minors is also governed by significant case law.  The issue of parental notification is comprehensively dealt with in the HSE's guide to consent for young people and in the national consent policy, part 2 of which is wholly concerned with issues around consent for children and minors, including detailed sections on the age of consent and the role of parents and guardians.  Page 54 of the national consent policy specifically states: \"It is only in exceptional circumstances that, having regard to the need to take account of an objective assessment of both the rights and the best interests of the person under 16, health and social care interventions would be provided for those under 16 without the knowledge or consent of parent(s) or legal guardian(s).\"  The policy then goes on to set out the details of what an assessment in such circumstances should cover, including the need to assess the maturity of the minor and any welfare, protection or other considerations, such as the Children First guidelines to which Senator Mullen rightly refers. <\/p><p>The provision on consent in section 23 of the Bill does not include any special provisions or requirements around consent for any particular group, and I do not intend for this to change as I do not believe it needs to change for the legislative and guideline reasons I have already outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#Y00500","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I certainly did not mean to suggest that the guidelines in question are not based in statute.

My point has been that we are in a new situation here.  We are in a situation where the direct and intentional taking of innocent life is contemplated.  This is such a life-changing event, a life-ending event for the unborn child and potentially a life-changing event for the young mother in question, that it is not enough to rely on the porous provisions of section 23 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 and the consent guidelines.

We are left with amendments that are consequential on an amendment that was pressed on Committee Stage but which has not been included for discussion here today.  Therefore, I wish to reiterate first of all that what was sought on Committee Stage was something very reasonable, something that is essential for good health policy formulation, namely, information.  The phrase &quot;knowledge is power&quot; is familiar to most of us.  &quot;Power&quot; is a harsh word to use when one is talking about the welfare of women and their unborn children.  Knowledge is competence.  Knowledge is foresight.  Knowledge is good planning.  Knowledge is good citizenship.  Knowledge is good patient welfare.<\/p><p>We argued, as colleagues may recall, that the information which must be gathered under section 20 is paltry.  It refers to the Medical Council registration number, which is important, but far from exhaustive of what is necessary: the section of the legislation under which the deliberate and intentional ending of the life of the foetus takes place; the county of residence, which I do not find to be of particular relevance or importance, though I am open to being found mistaken; and the date on which the termination of pregnancy is carried out.<\/p><p>None of the other data which are required under the British abortion regime is included.  We demonstrated briefly the other night just why some of that data could be very relevant.  For example, an issue was made about the inclusion of the ethnicity of the woman.  The attempt has been made to suggest that somehow there was racist intent.  That did not happen so much in the Seanad as the D&aacute;il.  It was actually the equality people in Britain who sought the gathering of that data so as to ensure that women from different minority groups were able to access abortion at the same level as others. <\/p><p>There are all sorts of other reasons.  One does not have to be able to foresee exactly why specific data could be helpful for health policy and legislative formulation.  It should be enough to follow normal practice in this area, which is to gather information that researchers, medical experts and statisticians will need.  I have pointed out that I believe, regretfully, that the deliberate exclusion, the deliberate opting for ignorance that characterises the Government's failure to include the categories of information that are sought in Britain, is ideologically motivated.  The fear that underlines it is that if people knew more about what goes on with abortion they might be less likely to support it.  That is to put the welfare of unborn children and the welfare of mothers in this situation beneath the ideological push of the abortion industry and abortion activists in priority.  This industry has come to the heart of Government in this country.  That is very irresponsible.  It is very unjust.  It is in breach of human rights.  It is an abandonment of responsible policy formulation.<\/p><p>I greatly regret that the Government has not accepted it to date, but I foresee a time in the future when legislation will be brought forward to require the gathering of information of the same kind that is gathered in Britain.  The Minister is bringing about a situation where his worst fears do not have to be realised.  He was never willing to talk about whether abortion rates would go up as a result of the introduction of abortion in this country.  The cat was never let out of the bag even though the figures were there.  Between 4,000 and 5,000 Irish women travel for abortions every year.  Scotland, with a similar population, has at least 11,000 abortions every year.  There was no talk though, no willingness to explore the consequence of legalising abortion; future lives lost, for which the Minister will be very directly responsible and which would not have been lost otherwise.  That also applies to his colleagues and all of those who worked with him to push for this unjust law.  <\/p><p>Of course, one way to avoid publicly taking responsibility is to say that we do not have the information.  In fairness, the information about how many abortions take place will be available.  I have to correct myself on that and I willingly do so.  However, we will not be able to look at how our situation has evolved by comparison with Britain, because a strategic and very cynical option of ignorance has been taken.  In light of that, I foresee a day when legislation will seek to re-establish British-style gathering of statistics, no more and no less.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is interesting the Government did not even do this much.  Perhaps I should have tabled a more conservative amendment to this effect, although it would have been rejected anyway.  Even if there were a category (e) to include such other information as the Minister may from time to time prescribe, it would have been a better and more responsible policy choice.  It is a hell of a wonder with all of the people working with the Minister on bringing abortion into Ireland that there was not even that open-ended possibility of the identification of future categories of information that could responsibly and reasonably need to be gathered.  That is very disappointing and an example of bad policy formulation in the name of ideology.  It makes no sense, therefore, for me to press the consequential amendment No. 24.<\/p><p>I intend to press amendment No. 25 because this creates consequences for those who would certify the operation but not notify the appropriate information as is their duty.  It would be easier to see why such offences need to be created for the full range of necessary and responsible categories of information to be provided for, as per the amendment proposed on Committee Stage.  It remains the case, however, that it should be an offence not to notify information on foot of something as life-changing and destructive as abortion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#Z00900","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544697000,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 25:<\/p><blockquote>In page 14, after line 36, to insert the following:&quot;(7) A medical practitioner who wilfully or recklessly contravenes <i>subsection (1)<\/i>of this section shall be guilty of an offence.<br \/><br \/>(8) A person who is guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable&mdash;<blockquote>(a) on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both,<br \/><br \/>(b) on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both.&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#AA00300","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#AA00350","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544697000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>V&oacute;t&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#BB00100","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Will the Senators claiming a division please rise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#BB00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544697000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Senators R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and Diarmuid Wilson rose.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544697000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>As fewer than five Members have risen I declare the question carried.

This amendment could be characterised as obliging the doctor but offering to the woman.  The active ultrasound image referred to would have to be of a quality consistent with standard medical practice, should contain the dimensions of the foetus, and should accurately portray the presence of external members, body parts and internal organs of the foetus, if present or viewable.  Likewise, the auscultation of foetal heart tone would have to be of a quality consistent with standard medical practice.  The requirement in subsection (4) is that, before or during the imaging and auscultation services, the relevant medical practitioner would offer the woman, orally and in person, the opportunity to view the active ultrasound of the foetus and hear the heartbeat of the foetus, if the heartbeat is audible.<br\/><br\/>Other amendments on informed consent were not accepted on Committee Stage, to my sorrow.  If there was a sincere desire on the part of the Minister or the Government that abortions would be rare, as with the question of notification dealt with earlier this afternoon, there would be a desire to see women not manipulatively or coercively informed but fully informed, respectfully and sensitively, of the surrounding facts of their pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>On the hiding away of ultrasound, I highlighted on Committee Stage how abortion counsellors - I criticised the Irish Family Planning Association, Marie Stopes and others - have had the practice of telling women to turn away while they carry out their routine ultrasound.  That is a disservice to women.  I do not see how that could be in any way seen as respectful of women's agency.  It is paternalistic and goes against the idea that what one should be trying to do here is to give the full informed consent in the way that is normally done with patients for their welfare so that they can have the information they need.  As I pointed out earlier, it often occurs that women say: &quot;If only I'd been told.  If only I knew that this was what a baby looked like at the stage of pregnancy I was at.  If only I knew that there would be support for me if I decided to keep my baby.  If only my parents had been notified when I was a minor.&quot;  Those are all the &quot;if onlys&quot; this legislation leaves us with because, once the request for an abortion is made, the desire is to put the person seeking an abortion on an express train and not to allow the requiring of information that might help them make a life-affirming decision for their own future happiness and certainly for the welfare of their unborn child.<br\/><br\/>This amendment is about offering women in a respectful way information that may be relevant to the decision.  I would be happy were it to be the case that it might cause them to change their decision.  Anybody who says they believe abortion should be rare should be happy.  Anyone with a scrap of humanity would be happy that a decision would be changed in favour of giving life, but this legislation is a stranger to such feelings, a stranger to such sensitivity and a stranger to such humanity.  The amendment, however, was criticised on the grounds that, by definition, if we were to offer a woman a chance to see an ultrasound image, that was somehow requiring an ultrasound and was therefore intrusive.  I would have thought that the balance of good could surely be served, as I said, in the provision of information respectfully.  These criticisms, which surprised me, caused me to look a little bit deeper at ultrasound.  I still have questions because I am not a medical person, some of which I hope the Minister can answer.<br\/><br\/>It was Dr. Peter Boylan - no friend to the unborn in this context - who talked about the need for ultrasound before the Joint Committee on Health in September.  Speaking in advance of that, and this quote is from <i>The Irish Times<\/i>of Wednesday, 19 September, he stated: &quot;The operation of abortion services in the State without adequate ultrasound availability will be fraught with risk&quot;.  If that is the case, that begs the question whether it is known with certainty when ultrasound is needed and when it is not.  If a major abortion proponent says the absence of ultrasound availability means that the operation of abortion services will be fraught with risk, is somebody criticising the requirement of ultrasound in each case, saying that we can know with certainty that there is no risk in the absence of ultrasound?  I would like a very specific answer to that question from the Minister.<br\/><br\/>I also want to know whether it can be disputed that there could be a risk to the health of the mother in circumstances where an ultrasound is not used.  I would like information.  I am not making statements on it because I am not a medical person, but if a woman has an ectopic pregnancy, can that be clinically diagnosed without an ultrasound?  I understand how most ectopic pregnancies present, but could it happen that abortions would be sought by women before the presenting symptoms have occurred?  I understand that ectopic pregnancies can happen from six weeks or they can be later.  Is it possible that an ectopic pregnancy could be involved even though the presenting symptoms have not occurred?  Is it possible, therefore, that there could be a danger in that situation because of the non-recourse to ultrasound?  I am concerned about women's health as well as the health of the unborn child and, regardless of whether an abortion takes place, I am concerned about women's health.  I want a very specific answer to that question.  If a woman has been told she could have pain from having had an abortion but, in reality, that pain could be from an ectopic pregnancy rupturing, they might not seek appropriate help.  Is there any basis for what I am saying to arise?<br\/><br\/>I would also like to know whether this question and these related questions have been brought up with medical insurers.  Has the Government had contact with the Medical Protection Society or with medical insurers about the question of what arises where abortions might take place in the absence of the use of ultrasound?  I raise all these questions because it has been suggested that ultrasound is unnecessarily onerous and intrusive, and I would not want that, but I want the good of the potential saving of the unborn baby's life and the good of leaving absolutely no risk to the mother's life.  Has the question of the consequences of not using ultrasound in the case of an ectopic pregnancy that might not yet have presented but does exist, or indeed any other situation, been raised with medical insurers?<br\/><br\/>Can a pregnancy be accurately dated without an ultrasound?  Is there another way of clinically dating a pregnancy aside from asking the woman to clarify the dates?  The Minister suggested there was but I understand an ultrasound is needed for accurate dating and that if the doctor wants to know dates accurately, it is good medical practice to do an ultrasound to ensure the pregnancy is not at 14 or 16 weeks, for example, instead of under 12 weeks.<br\/><br\/>A related question to that, which I would be grateful if the Minister answered, and I will listen carefully for the answer, is that if a pregnancy is later than a woman says and an abortion pill is administered, could that be detrimental to the woman's health?  I understand it could be and that she should be under medical supervision if her pregnancy is more than 12 weeks and that she should be in a hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121300002#BB01600","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544697000,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
