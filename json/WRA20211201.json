This includes the expansion of the National Claims Information Database (NCID) to include information on employer and public liability insurance claims &ndash; the first report of which was published in July this year.  The enhanced transparency this provides\u00a0is key to further developing our understanding of how claims costs are impacting premiums, and in particular, the relationship between the price paid by a customer for a policy and the cost to insurance undertakings.<\/p>  <p>  Other actions that have been taken by my Department include the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, which is chaired by Minister of State Fleming. Since its establishment, the Office has held meetings with wide range of stakeholders including insurance bodies, civil society and other state regulators on the issues of competition and switching, which are key for lowering insurance premiums. Furthermore, the Department is also working closely with IDA Ireland to target firms to enter the Irish market and\u00a0leverage the ongoing reforms to the insurance environment here, with the aim of increasing competition. In addition, Department is collaborating with the Central Bank to create an insurance databank, which will assist new providers seeking to enter the Irish insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  The adoption of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines by the Judicial Council was another key measure in the reform agenda. As the Deputy will appreciate, consistent implementation of these Guidelines by insurers, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) and the judiciary will be vital in achieving an improved claims environment.\u00a0 These are early days in relation to assessing the impact of the Guidelines. However as the insurance reform agenda progresses, we will continue to hold the industry to account on its commitment to reflect savings from the Guidelines, and other elements of the reforms, to customers.\u00a0 Minister of State Fleming, in his ongoing engagement with the sector, has emphasised the need for insurance providers to reduce premiums and increase their risk appetite to provide cover in new areas.\u00a0 The Minister recently met with the main insurers to assess their response to the Guidelines, and to emphasise the importance of insurers when settling claims, to not undermine the Guidelines by settling for amounts that are inconsistent with them.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that work remains ongoing across Government to deliver further elements of the Action Plan, including measures to reform the PIAB, reduce fraud, and make changes to the duty of care, which is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice.\u00a0 It is my hope that the implementation of these key actions in particular should have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100091#WRC05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[59174\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100091#WRC05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the level of profit from the insurance sector; the average insurance premium per type of insurance; and the level of payouts for insurance claims from 2016 to 2020 and to date in 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1504","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":124,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.\u00a0Neither I, nor my Department, collect the type of information being sought by the Deputy.

The first &euro;1,270 of chargeable gains of an individual in any year are exempt from CGT.<\/p>  <p>  Section 604 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides relief from CGT on the disposal of one&rsquo;s principal private residence, being a dwelling house together with land occupied as its gardens or grounds up to an area (exclusive of the site of the residence) of one acre. If a property was occupied by an individual as his or her principal private residence for all or part of his or her period of ownership, then full or partial relief from CGT will be available where a chargeable gain arises on the disposal of that property. The last 12 months of ownership of the property by the individual is treated as a period of occupation for the purpose of this relief. For the purpose of the relief, an individual cannot have more than one principal private residence at any one time.<\/p>  <p>  If an individual occupied the property as his or her principal private residence throughout their period of ownership, then full relief is available in respect of any gain which arises on the disposal of the property.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Where, as would be the case in the circumstances outlined, the property has been occupied by the individual as his or her principal private residence for part of the period of ownership, only a proportion of the gain on the disposal is exempt. This proportion is the same proportion that the length of the period of owner-occupation (inclusive of the last 12 months of ownership) bears to the length of the period of ownership. The balance of the gain is chargeable to CGT in the normal manner.<\/p>  <p>  The following example illustrates the application of partial principal private residence relief. An individual purchases a house in 2021.\u00a0 The house remains unoccupied until 2022 when the individual moves into the house and it becomes their principal private residence and remains so until the house is sold in 2026.\u00a0 For approximately 4 out of the 5 years of ownership, the house was the individual&rsquo;s principal private residence.\u00a0 As such, approximately 4\/5ths of the gain arising on the disposal of the house may be exempt from CGT, should all other conditions of the relief be met. The balance of the gain will be subject to CGT in the normal manner. <\/p>  <p>  Where the property was never occupied by the individual as his or her only or main residence at any time throughout the period of ownership, the relief will not be available and the entire gain arising on the disposal will be subject to CGT in the normal manner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100091#WRC05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100092#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[59487\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100092#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the new measures he will now introduce given reports (details supplied) to support the play and leisure industry which includes all indoor activity centres such as play centres, bowling alleys and other activities that have experienced an overnight devastating cancellation of bookings; the assurances that he can give to help maintain viability in the industry as it attempts to trade through the pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[59488\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100092#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures he will now take to maintain and extend support measures which are currently operational given the reports (details supplied) to support the play and leisure industry which includes all indoor activity centres such as play centres, bowling alleys and other activities that have experienced an overnight devastating cancellation of bookings; the assurances that he can give to help maintain viability in the industry as it attempts to trade through the pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":132,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.<\/p>  <p>The Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS) is a targeted support for companies, self -employed individuals, partnerships as well as certain charities and sporting bodies that carry on a trade that was significantly impacted by COVID-19 public health restrictions, including where the impact has continued after the easing of the restrictions. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is available to businesses that were actively trading on 1 September 2021 and intend to continue doing so. To qualify for the BRSS, a business must be able to demonstrate that the turnover from its trade in the period from 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 is no more than 25% of a &lsquo;reference turnover amount&rsquo;, which is based on when the business commenced. \u00a0A qualifying person may, since early September, make a claim under BRSS for a single payment which will be equal to three times the average weekly turnover of the relevant business activity in a reference period, subject to a maximum payment under the scheme of &euro;15,000. The closing date for applications was 30 November 2021. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Eligible businesses may make a claim for a once-off support payment under BRSS irrespective of whether they have previously qualified for other COVID-19 related Government schemes and detailed operational guidelines on the scheme are available on the Revenue website.<\/p>  <p>  Registration for BRSS opened on 6 September 2021. Up to 25 November, 1,670 businesses with 1,790 trades have availed of BRSS and claims of &euro;5.7 million have been made under the Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Companies and self-employed individuals, including those in the sectors mentioned by the Deputy\u00a0may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse certain tax liabilities. In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, I provided for a reduction in the VAT rate to supplies of certain goods and services which primarily relate to the hospitality and tourism sector from 13.5% to 9% in Budget 2021 and the reduced rate was extended until 1 September, 2022 in the Finance (COVID-19 and Miscellaneous provisions) Act 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme\u00a0(CRSS) is provided for in section 11 of the Finance Act 2020.\u00a0 To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. A business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the relevant business activity during the period of restrictions will be no more than 25% of the average weekly turnover of the business in a reference period, which in most cases is 2019. Eligibility for the scheme depends on the particular circumstances of the individual business. <\/p>  <p>  CRSS remains available to qualifying businesses until 31 December 2021. A total of &euro;704m has already been paid out under the CRSS in respect of 25,500 premises.<\/p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) provides a subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the EWSS is to support\u00a0employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. <\/p>  <p>  The cost to date (as at 25th November)\u00a0is almost &euro;6.5 billion, comprising of direct subsidy payments of &euro;5.58 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;877 million to 51,700 employers in respect of over 690,300 employees. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is widely acknowledged that the EWSS has played a central role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees during this pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  Government policy has been that there will be no cliff edge to the support, at the same time, it is necessary to unwind and phase out this temporary, emergency support measure. That is why, on Budget Day, I announced the extension of EWSS in a graduated form until 30 April 2022. This ensures there will be no sudden end to the EWSS and also provides clarity and certainty to business. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0purpose of these schemes is to give viable businesses the opportunity to survive the economic shock of the pandemic and to help as many as possible to recover and seek to ensure their future.<\/p>  <p>  Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government has adopted a proactive and dynamic approach to supporting businesses and individuals insofar as possible during this challenging time.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the EWSS and the current circumstances referenced by the Deputy in his questions, the Government continues to monitor developments closely and will consider if any response is required\u00a0at an appropriate time.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100092#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":133,"content":"<p>Question No. 80 answered with Question No. 79.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100092#WRD00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100092#WRD00700"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[59164\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100092#WRD00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his attention has been drawn to instances in which premiums (details supplied) for having contracted Covid-19 in the workplace were not paid to HSE staff; and if this has affected their basic pay and pension contributions.","asker":"1579","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":136,"content":"<p>Special leave with pay for COVID-19\u00a0only\u00a0applies when a Public Service employee is required to self-isolate as they are displaying symptoms of COVID-19\u00a0and\/or had a positive PCR\u00a0test for COVID-19.\u00a0Certain employees may be eligible for premium payments whilst availing of Special Leave with Pay, providing they satisfy the specific conditions for inclusion of these payments.

We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in candidate countries. It was welcome that the Declaration adopted at the EU-Western Balkans Summit this year contained a clear signal of the continuing priority afforded by the EU to the Enlargement dossier and to achieving early progress in advancing the accession process. <\/p>  <p>  There are five recognised candidates for membership of the European Union: Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, and Serbia. Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina are recognised as potential candidates by the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina has formally submitted an application for membership, while Kosovo has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission presented Member States with the main findings and recommendations of the seven country reports on 19 October in this year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Enlargement Package&rsquo;. While situations vary from country to country, the report noted limited progress in the enlargement process overall due to both the impact of the pandemic and ongoing delays and blockages in the enlargement process. It also notes a general stagnation in progress in the crucial areas of fundamental rights and rule of law. <\/p>  <p>  While technically remaining the two front-runners in terms of EU accession, there is general agreement within both Council and Commission that \u00a0both Serbia and Montenegro need to increase the dynamism in their reform agenda. Serbia needs to accelerate its reforms regarding fundamental rights and the rule of law, and make significant progress in the normalisation of relations with Kosovo. In Montenegro, more intensive efforts in relation to freedom of expression, media freedom and the fight against corruption and organised crime are required. We also urge intensified dialogue among all parties in Montenegro to address those issues currently giving rise to tensions within the country<\/p>  <p>  Both North Macedonia and Albania have clearly fulfilled the conditions necessary to commence accession negotiations. In our view, shared almost unanimously within the Council, the negotiating frameworks for both countries should be agreed and Intergovernmental Conferences held as soon as possible to start the accession process. <\/p>  <p>  Kosovo is a potential candidate for Membership of the EU. The Commission&rsquo;s report on Kosovo in 2021 noted that the political situation there remains challenging. Rule of law, judicial reform, public administration reform, organised crime and normalisation of the relationship with Serbia are just some of the areas that must be comprehensively addressed in order for Kosovo to advance on its European path.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has clearly set out the fourteen priority areas for reform which need to be progressed, if Bosnia and Herzegovina is to advance on its European path. We call on all parties and leaders within Bosnia and Herzegovina to avoid further delay in progressing this urgent reform agenda, including in the areas of electoral and constitutional law.<\/p>  <p>  Turkey remains a candidate country for EU membership. However, given recent concerns regarding the rule of law and respect for human rights within the country, there are no proposals at present to open or close further chapters and the accession process effectively remains frozen.\u00a0 Ireland has been clear that if Turkey wants to make real progress in its relationship with the EU it will need to show a readiness over a longer period to promote a genuine partnership with the EU and to resolve differences through dialogue and in accordance with international law.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support strongly the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100093#WRE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100093#WRE02800"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[59413\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100093#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason it took the Passport Office 65 working days after the receipt of a passport application from a person (details supplied) to request additional documentation; if this passport will be dispatched in time for travel on 23 December 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the application was submitted online on 23 August 2021.

These initiatives include Permanent Structured Cooperation &ndash; PESCO, the Coordinated Annual Review of Defence (CARD), the establishment of the European Defence Fund (EDF) and the European Peace Facility (EPF).  <\/p>  <p>  Crisis management missions and operations are the most visible and tangible expression of the CSDP. Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed to three UN-mandated EU military missions and operations.\u00a0 As an active participant in CSDP missions and operations, it is important that we uphold Ireland&rsquo;s key values and objectives regarding the direction of travel and the role of CSDP Missions and Operations (civilian and military) and our participation in these CSDP missions complements our long-standing tradition of participating in UN peacekeeping operations. With more complex mandates, and often with fewer resources, missions are expected to perform multiple, simultaneous, interdependent tasks in harsh and remote operating environments. The peacekeeping partnership between the UN Secretariat and Member States demands focused and coordinated efforts to provide adequate support to our peacekeepers in the field and generate the appropriate resources for the efficient delivery of UN mandates.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The event to which the Deputy refers took place as a webinar on Thursday last.

The event also involved a number of European enterprises sharing their experience of the wide-ranging opportunities that there are for Irish research institutions and industrial entities in the security and defence domain, particularly for exploitation of dual use technologies.\u00a0 Associations representing Defence and Security research and enterprise also participated in the event. <\/p>  <p>  The funding opportunities outlined at the seminar are about a wide range of technology, research and development and, in particular, dual use technologies.\u00a0 During negotiations for the EDF regulations and the first two work programmes for 2021 and 2022 as well as for the forerunner programmes for the EDF, my officials in the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs, with support from across government, joined with colleagues from other smaller member states and those without traditional defence industries to maximise the possibilities for engagement by small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to minimise direct awards to the traditional defence industry, to maximise transparency and open up supply.<\/p>  <p>  The seminar \u00a0follows on from the publication last year by my Department and the Defence Forces of a Feasibility Study which, identified the value of having a research technology and innovation capability within the Defence Organisation.\u00a0 The feasibility study identifies that this RTI capability should \u00a0focus on technologies at lower technology readiness levels (TRL) that have broad potential utilisation in both the civil and security and defence spheres and on leveraging innovations from the civilian sector in a manner that offers potential benefits for our Defence forces as well as for industry and academia. <\/p>  <p>  The recent establishment of the RTI Unit in Defence has the potential to set a new strategic direction for Defence innovation and collaboration, to drive internal innovation in the Defence Organisation and to contribute to the development of a security and defence dual-use innovation eco-system.\u00a0\u00a0 The Defence RTI Unit will also support Irish enterprise and research bodies in accessing EU funding streams, including through the European Defence Fund, the EDA and their engagement with European networks and SMEs across the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100093#WRE03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100093#WRE03800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100093#WRE03700"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[59163\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100093#WRE03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that there are no special educational needs organisers (SENO) covering south County Tipperary (details supplied);

A lack of information about their origins is deeply troubling to many survivors and the remedy to address this is making sure that they have access to this information.\u00a0Therefore, I have prioritised work on legislation that is going to achieve that aim, in the form of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill. <\/p><p>In the case of children who were boarded out, the State Apology delivered by the Taoiseach in January of this year includes the following acknowledgement: <\/p><p>&quot;Children\u00a0born outside of marriage were stigmatised and were treated as outcasts in\u00a0school and wider society.\u00a0 Some children who were subsequently boarded-out experienced heartbreaking exploitation, neglect and abuse within the families and communities in which they were placed.\u00a0 This was unforgiveable.\u00a0 The sense of abandonment felt by many of these children is palpable in the witness accounts.\u00a0 The circumstances of their birth, the arrangements for their early care, the stigma they experienced and the continuing lack of birth information, is a terrible burden in their lives.&quot;<\/p><p>The proposals for the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme are designed to be non-adversarial and will not require applicants to bring forward evidence of abuse or harm suffered. The\u00a0 Scheme will consist of a general payment rising based on time spent in one of the institutions, so that those who suffered most from the harsh institutional conditions will receive the highest level of payment. Children were boarded out in a range of circumstances, in some instances from their own home when a family no longer had the means to care for them and from institutions other than a Mother and Baby or County Home Institutions. In addition, the abuses suffered were not experienced by all people who were boarded out as children and, so, could only be fully considered on a case by case basis.\u00a0 The payment approach in this Scheme does not cater for such individualised assessments. However,\u00a0if a person was boarded out as a child and also spent time in a Mother and Baby or County Home Institution, they may be eligible for the Scheme in respect of the time spent in one of these institutions.<\/p><p>Other aspects of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan\u00a0that provides support and assistance to those who were boarded out as children, include:<\/p><p>- Access to birth and early life information as part of the Birth Information and Tracing Legislation which is being advanced.<\/p><p>- Inclusion in the memorialisation initiatives being developed which will afford an opportunity for people to tell their story.<\/p><p>- The provision of an ex-gratia payment to reimburse anyone who was boarded out and had to pay inheritance taxes for farms which they inherited from their foster parents.<\/p><p>Furthermore, I intend to make arrangements for the provision of access to dedicated counselling supports through Tusla to those who were boarded out as children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100094#WRF04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Resource Centres","counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100094#WRF04200"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[59404\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100094#WRF04300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he plans to increase core funding for family resource centres; if funding can be increased by a centre (details supplied) in County Galway to allow it to recruit a third-staff member given the complex needs of the local community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":287,"content":"<p>Tusla administers the Family Resource Centre (FRC) Programme which provides funding support to 121 FRCs across the country.

the plans in place to tackle these extensive waiting list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":472,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that waiting times for many hospital procedures and appointments are unacceptably long. It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets.<\/p><p>Children with a range of needs rely on the orthopaedic service of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, for example children with Spina Bifida, hip deformity, and other orthopaedic needs. Scoliosis activity accounts for approximately 17% of inpatient orthopaedic activity. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision.<\/p><p>My Department has been working with the HSE and Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to deliver improved paediatric orthopaedic services. In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively.<\/p><p>Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland continue to examine new and innovative ways to improve access to orthopaedic services. &ldquo;Cappagh Kids&rdquo; at the National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional theatre capacity for non-complex, age appropriate, orthopaedic procedures, freeing up much needed space at central CHI sites for children with complex, multi-disciplinary needs. Additional orthopaedic outpatient sessions are also now held at Cappagh, providing additional capacity to see and assess children on the outpatient waiting list.<\/p><p>In addition, a new fast-track orthopaedic pathway has been developed as part of outpatient reduction plans. Paediatric Active Clinical Triage has already been introduced for the longest waiters (over 12 months) on the paediatric outpatient list. This has reduced the number of long waiters from 987 to 403 since it started in October 2020.<\/p><p>Improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached document. The information set out in the document shows the number of children on Outpatient and Inpatient waiting lists for orthopaedic treatment by hospital group at the end of October 2021.

This is about 2.2 million more hours compared to the same period last year. <\/p><p>The funding secured in Budget 2021 to provide these additional 5 million hours has been maintained for 2022.  <\/p><p>Significant inroads have been achieved in reducing waiting lists for funding approval for new or additional service from over 7,800 in January 2020 to just under 400 last September. This has been achieved through a combination of validation of the waiting list and availability of funding to address those waiting. <\/p><p>However, there is a delay between the approval of funding and the delivery of home support hours and the numbers of people in this category have increased steadily this year. At the end of September 2021, there were 4,933 people assessed and waiting for a carer to become available, in January 2020 there was about 1,300 people in this category. Certain areas that are experiencing increased pressures, due to workforce availability, are particularly affected. Despite the increase, it is important to note that the total number of people waiting for home support across both categories has reduced from over 9,000 at the start of 2020 to approximately 5,300 at the end of September. <\/p><p>The HSE is aware that there are increasing capacity issues across both direct and indirect provision, and it continues to advertise on an ongoing basis for Health Care Assistants and recruits as many suitable candidates, where possible. The HSE conducts its recruitment through a variety of channels both locally and nationally. <\/p><p>Due to the nature of Healthcare Support Assistants posts, this recruitment is normally conducted at a very local level and is on-going continually across the HSE. Approved Home Support Providers also continue to recruit home support workers.<\/p><p>I have engaged with industry stakeholders to discuss issues surrounding recruitment and retention of workforce to meet the ongoing demands caused by the pandemic and the longer-term health care requirements of our population.<\/p><p>In addition to this engagement, I am committed to establishing a Cross Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group. The role of the group will be to facilitate the views of stakeholders and examine workforce challenges in home support and nursing homes. Potential areas to be considered include recruitment, retention, training, and the career development of home support and nursing home workers into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100098#WRK02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":503,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100098#WRK02500"},{"type":"question","counter":504,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[59485\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100098#WRK02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the implementation of the new public health model; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":505,"content":"<p>My Department and the Health Service Executive (HSE) are committed to delivering on the recommendations that were made for Public Health in the Crowe Horwath report.
