Before I start, I want to speak about the Ukrainian people and, in particular, Ukrainian farmers.  I want to pass on our sympathies to them on what is happening out there at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Again, I thank the committee for its invitation to discuss the issues facing the pig, poultry and horticulture sectors.  I am joined by IFA poultry chair, Mr. Nigel Sweetnam, IFA senior policy executive for retail, Mr. Robert Malone, and IFA policy executive for horticulture, potatoes and organics, Ms. Niamh Brennan.  <\/p> <p>  The challenges facing the sectors we are representing here, namely horticulture, poultry and pig farmers, are multifactorial but centre around the increasing costs of production and the dominant position of a small number of retail buyers, resulting in ever tightening margins.  These three sectors are going through a very difficult time.  Energy, feed and fertiliser bills are overwhelming for farm families trying to run their businesses.  These same farmers are being squeezed from all sides with the added actions of retailers who are relentlessly pushing down the retail price of their products and embarking on unsustainable discounting to encourage store footfall.<\/p> <p>  Produce from these sectors is dependent on the Irish retail sector for routes to market.  Apart from mushrooms, virtually all horticultural produce is for the home market.  Poultry production is centred around servicing the home market, with some low-value offcuts exported.  The Irish pig sector, while generating significant export value of close to &euro;1 billion per annum, is reliant on the home market, predominantly the retail trade, for 50% of all sales.<\/p> <p>  Retail food price deflation from 2010 to 2020 is putting huge downward pressure on farmers&rsquo; margins.  The falling price of food, and of fresh produce from the horticulture sector in particular, has resulted in squeezed margins for primary food producers and it now poses a significant threat to the viability of primary food production in Ireland in these sectors.  The horticulture sector, similar to the pigs and poultry sectors, depends on getting a viable return direct from the marketplace as farmers in this sector generally do not receive direct payments under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  While there have been some moderate increases in food prices on the shelves in recent months, the reality is that between January 2010 and December 2021, the average price of all food declined by 9 %.  Over the same period, the average level of overall consumer prices increased by 12.5%, according to the CSO.  As a consequence, only a small number of horticulture growers have survived.  They have been forced to scale up and all are extremely vulnerable today.  This situation is replicated in the pig farming and poultry sectors.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine published a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, SWOT,  analysis of the Irish agrifood sector in 2021 and clearly identified that the primary producers&rsquo; share in the value chain is very low and is well below the EU average of the total value-added share which is being passed back to farmers.<\/p> <p>  Today&rsquo;s retail environment is dominated by five players, Dunnes Stores, SuperValu, Tesco and the two discounters, Aldi and Lidl.  Together, these five retailers constitute 90% of the total grocery market in Ireland.  It is the latter two, Lidl and Aldi, that have fundamentally had the biggest negative impact on the price that primary producers receive for their produce.  These retailers have used fresh produce in particular as marketing tools to attract consumers into their stories, offering fresh fruit and vegetables at discount prices that do not relate to the production costs.  Retailers may claim that the cost of special promotions is funded by them and while this may be accurate on a short-term basis, the cost of such promotions is built into procurement prices over time.  The reality is that the price farmers get paid each year has consistently declined up until this year.  Many primary producers in these sectors have been forced out of business and many more will follow unless strong intervention in the market occurs.<\/p> <p>  Retail discounters Lidl and Aldi, in particular, use local-sounding brand names and fake farms and creameries to market many of their products.  The IFA called out this practice in summer 2021, only to be hauled into the courts by Lidl seeking a court injunction to stop IFA from highlighting this potentially misleading practice.  However, the court rejected the application by Lidl and awarded costs against it.  <\/p> <p>  The average price of food increased by 1.3% in 2021, the first year that food has increased in over a decade.  The price of food will have to increase further in order for the producers to be paid for their work.  The massive increase in energy and fertiliser costs in recent weeks are well documented.  These costs cannot be borne by farmers without significant increases in the food chain being passed back to the farmer.  While there has been some recognition by the retail sector of these cost increases in recent weeks, it is not nearly enough.  We need the food regulator that has been long-promised by this Government and that regulator needs to be given real statuary powers of investigation and enforcement to ensure that there is equality in the food chain.<\/p> <p>  The EU directive on unfair trading practices, UTP, was transposed into Irish law in April 2021.  This is a step in the right direction, but on their own, the UTP regulations will have minimal effect.  There is no recognition of the price required to produce a head of cabbage, a kilogram of carrots, a dozen eggs, a whole chicken or a pound of rashers in the UTP regulations.  <\/p> <p>  We are bombarded with talk about sustainability.<\/p><p>There are three pillars to sustainability: environmental, social and economic.  Today in Ireland we have legislation underpinning two of these pillars, environmental and social sustainability.  There is no legal protection for the economic sustainability of food producers.  This has to change.<\/p><p> The Government has the opportunity today and must give the new food regulator office legal powers that go beyond the UTP regulations.  It must have the authority to investigate and properly sanction those who breach the regulations.  It must ensure the farmer&rsquo;s position at the bottom of the food chain is not abused as it has been for many years.  The Department has set up the UTP enforcement authority as required under the EU directive on UTPs.  The Government has committed to setting up and funding a food regulator, or food ombudsperson, to ensure the implementation of the UTP directive and, going further, to provide greater transparency and reporting of where the value is being distributed in the food chain.  Budget 2022 committed &euro;4 million to the establishment of a food ombudsman office.<\/p><p> There were an estimated 350 commercial vegetable growers in Ireland in 2010.  The IFA now puts this number at fewer than 100, only one third of what we had.  This can be almost exclusively attributed to the reducing price being paid by the big retail buyers to their suppliers, forcing more and more of them out of business.  The result is what we see on the shelves today: imported broccoli from Spain, imported tomatoes from Holland, strawberries from Egypt and raspberries from Morocco.  All these crops can be grown and produced almost ten months of the year in Ireland, but only if the retailers pay the cost of local sustainable production.<\/p><p> Below-cost selling must be prohibited.  The IFA is calling for this to be enshrined into Irish law and regulated by the new food regulator office.  The discounting and degrading of food must be stopped.  Retail buyers must be held accountable for the declining number of farmers in these vulnerable sectors of Irish food production that depend on the Irish domestic retail market.  It is a sad state of affairs when farmers who are producing beef and dairy products, where over 90% is exported, are doing better in world markets than farmers suppling fresh fruit, vegetables, pork and poultry to be consumed here in Ireland.<\/p><p> I am calling on every Deputy and Senator here today to ensure legal protection is given to food producers.  Legislation on the office of the food regulator must be prioritised and must be underpinned with statutory powers of enforcement.  Below-cost selling must be banned.  Fairness must be is returned to a fundamentally unfair food supply chain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Cullinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cullinan and the rest of the IFA delegation.

It is about protecting a sector that is very vulnerable at the moment.  I described where a number of vulnerable sectors are at the moment.  We have seen a massive decline in the horticulture sector.  We want to ensure we protect the pig sector going forward.  Overall, there are 8,000 people involved or employed in the sector in Ireland.  We have exports of almost &euro;1 billion a year.  It is very important as well that we have 50% of our produce sold here on the home market.  That goes right back to the practice within the retail sector of using fresh pork as a loss leader and driving down the price.

If the sub-30 ha plot of land was part of a larger-scale bog that had already been exploited for horticulture for the production of peat, it would be beneficial to the sector because one would be using a bog that had already been utilised and the machinery, etc., would be in place.  This would be better than starting on a virgin 30 ha bog, as they outline it to be, where one is unsure of the quality of the peat that would there, whether any infrastructure would be available in the locality or whether there would be any expertise to go into that.  Therefore, we are in agreement with that.  If the sub-30 ha plot of land was taken as part of a larger-scale bog, historically, that would be beneficial to the position at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030200002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I am greatly heartened by the emphasis on retail in Mr. Cullinan&rsquo;s presentation.  I take great heart when I see the IFA taking on the retailers and, particularly, the discount multiples.  Everybody in the Government and everybody in every political party wants to see cheaper food prices and it is very important.  However, it is set out there very succinctly in the consumer price index, CPI, over the past ten years that there is only one loser in cheaper food prices and, unfortunately, that is the producer at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions on this.  Clearly, we need to do more legislatively to support farmers, and the IFA has certainly set out some of that.  The Government and the political parties need to stand shoulder to shoulder with the IFA on this issue.  We need to take on the supermarkets and multiples.  They have to be accountable.  They have been very adept and successful at their marketing and they have certainly presented an image that they are a friend and are putting a warm embrace around rural Ireland.  However, when one looks at the stark figures, that is certainly not the case.  They need to be challenged.  I am very supportive of any effort by the IFA to take the fight to them.  I am interested to tease out where the IFA sees we need to go in terms of legislative support.  Certainly, the food regulator is very important.  The UTP has its shortcomings, and I suppose for Mr. Malone in particular, we would have seen the legislation on alcohol pricing recently.  From my own discussions with small retailers, they would say that while it was not necessarily the aim of that legislation, it has levelled the playing field and the multiples cannot do the huge discounts that they were able to do.  Suddenly, the corner shop off-licence is able to compete head-to-head with Dunnes Stores on the price of a bottle of whiskey.  Do we need to get to a model like that?  Is that where we need to get to in terms of food production and food retailing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030200002#C00700","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Exactly.  If one looks at a large retailer today, they have 18,000 lines in that shop.  Therefore, one line will not make or break them, whereas everything that a small local retailer sells is important.  Therefore, legislation is required.  It does not necessarily have to mean that the consumer has to pay more for a particular product.<\/p><p>However, the cost of production for the farmer must be recognised in whatever is paid back with the wholesale price.  That is not happening now and it is why we continuously see fresh produce in particular with fewer growers.  It is evident right across the sectors we represent today because they are more closely linked to the retail market.  It is evident with 50% of all pig meat sold by retailers and virtually all poultry product sold in domestic retail and some food service.  Retail is the biggest part of it.  All of our horticulture, except for mushrooms, is sold in the retail trade as our president has outlined.<\/p><p> The commodities dealing with the export market are in beef.  They are open to those markets and they are up and down; we are in a high period now.  We can see today with high commodity input prices, we have not the response from the retail trade.  That is the ultimate issue.  We need transparency so we can see clearly who is taking what from the value chain.  At least if there is transparency people will have to stand up and be accountable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030200002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Malone","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Is any retailer proactively engaging and putting its hand up as having identified an issue for the producer?

They can all say they are engaging and we see many Irish flags and farmers' pictures in all retailers.  Ultimately, it is where the man is buying the product and setting the price that we need to tackle this.  Legislation is required to open up this process so we can get accountability.  Below-cost selling is an issue but tackling it on its own is not the answer.  We must have transparency and somebody to call out these retailers.

I know suppliers at the scale where they deal directly with a retailer.  They have sought 10%, 15% or 20% of an increase and have got back half of it.  That is the reality and they have not got full costs recovery.  People can take some price volatility but these producers are looking at facing into 2022 at not recovering their costs; they will be producing below the cost of production.

Teagasc has done a nexus analysis of where the sector is now.  Farmers are losing anything between &euro;35 to &euro;40 per pig currently, and that put in the context of a 500 to 600 sow unit means it is in the region of &euro;50,000 per month.  There are multiple reasons why it happens.  There are pressures from the input side and on the back of Covid-19, there is the matter of transporting Irish pork, much of which is exported to China.  We have an excellent export market but the cost of transporting that pork increases because of factors such a lack of availability of containers and the increasing price of energy.  It has put substantial pressure on the market.  The import of grain into the country has been substantially affected by the cost of shipping.<br\/><br\/>The practices we see retailers using when it comes to fresh produce, whether it is meat or vegetables, continues to drive down the price.  We employed Mr. Jim Power in 2019 to look in particular at the retail beef sector, as that was struggling at the time.  I will quote a paragraph from the report at the time, as it is relevant to this evening's discussion.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe growing market share of the discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl, has fundamentally altered the retail grocery landscape and retail food prices.  The market share of Aldi and Lidl has expanded from 9.5% in October 2010 to 24.5% in November 2019.  This is not unique to Ireland.  The growth of discounters is altering the pricing behaviour of the rest of the retail grocery sector. <\/blockquote> <p>What has happened over the past number of years is that as discounters have moved into Ireland, there is what we might call a habit of using food as a loss leader.

In itself, that will lead to less food produced in Europe.  That is very worrying, given where the world is now.  We have seen that over the past two years people have been trying to produce food in very difficult times during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Now we see what is happening in Ukraine, which is known as the breadbasket of Europe because it produces grain in particular for the feeding of animals right across Europe and the world.  I am very concerned about the farm to fork strategy.<\/p> <p>  We all acknowledge there are many challenges around climate change.  We are working to meet those challenges but we must be very careful not to legislate ourselves into a position where we end up with a food scarcity, which may well happen.<\/p><p>If we continue on this journey, we may end up with a shortage of food.  At that point, food will be at a price that the consumer will not be able to afford.  We are clearly saying that the price of food has to go up.

In the pig sector specifically, the Deputy is referencing the &euro;7 million direct aid package that the Minister has announced.  That is a first step but it will take more for any sector that has the potential to lose somewhere in the region of &euro;130 million, to quote Teagasc figures again, in a 12-month period.

We have been to the processors looking for money but the intermediaries are already battling with the increase in the price of feed, which is astronomical and going up to &euro;250,000 per week extra just to feed the birds.

Some 50% of pigmeat is sold in the Irish market, which is an excellent market to have.  It is the best market we have.  The vast majority of poultry and horticultural products are sold in the Irish market as well.  We engaged with a number of retailers but we protested outside the premises of the retailers that did not engage with us.

The food chain, as it stands, is broken.  If farmers are protesting outside a retailer with which they do not deal directly, they are doing that because their costs are not recognised through that food chain.  That is why we are here.  We need legislation to make this food chain transparent, to open it up to see who gets what and to make sure there is fairness right through the food chain.  If somebody is dealing directly with a processor and is not on the ground producing pigs or chickens, he or she is a step removed from the reality facing the farmer.  The Deputy is right in what he said.  In normal circumstances Mr. Sweetnam would go into his processor to supply chickens, outline his costs and negotiate a price increase and that would be it.  However, it has gone to a stage where that provision is not in the food chain.  We need somebody with legal powers to do a legal overview of the food chain, to request the books to see who is getting what out of the food chain and where the value is going.  Ultimately, that is why we are here today.  We need to establish the office of a food regulator, fully fund it, have it up and running in order that, on foot of a complaint, I or anybody else can get the regulator to investigate it and call out malpractice.

He asked how can we get a solution to this problem.  The establishment of the office of a food ombudsman was part of the unfair trading practices directive.  The Deputy will recall we had a beef task force.  The Department commissioned Grant Thornton to carry out an investigation into the margins along the supply chain, to ascertain what margin the retailer had and what margin the processor had.  We all know the result of that was that we did not get an answer.  The Deputy rightly probed that also.  I was a member the beef task force for the final year of its term.  When we were not able to get that information, the Minister came before the task force and committed to introducing primary legislation to establish a food regulator to strengthen the powers of the ombudsman.<\/p> <p>  I would like to hear from this committee that we would get its support to ensure that when the legislation comes on to the floor of the D&aacute;il, the regulator would get proper powers.  There is no point in introducing legislation if it is not targeted in the right direction.  By that I mean the person appointed must have the power to ascertain where the margin is at.  We know one thing for certain, the margin is not with the farmer at present.  We are open and transparent.  We are willing to show our margin.  I ask the committee for its support in bringing forward that request to the Minister to ensure when this legislation comes on to the floor of the D&aacute;il it will be effective and the person appointed will be able to check the margin along the food supply chain.

The peat issue has been overshadowed by the retail issue and the crisis in the horticultural sector in the last weeks.  The issue is still to the fore.  We are losing growers from the industry because they cannot continue to endure the measures.  In the 1999 census, there were nearly 400 horticulture bed growers.  In 2014, there were 150.  It is now estimated that there are fewer than 100.  Our critical mass has been eroded.  It is feared that if we go below that, we will not have a core base to be able to re-establish the horticulture industry.  There is no point in talking about any policy or specific strategy that is in place to try to expand or redevelop the sector if we do not have that core mass.<\/p> <p>  The availability and subsequently the cost of peat is a significant issue.  We estimated before Christmas that the cost would have increased by over 40% because of the imports.  There are also issues of the quality and availability of that peat.  We are continuing to bang the drum about that.  We recently engaged with the Department on this, especially with regard to the proposed action plan that was published alongside the final report.  We did the final report.  Members of the IFA were involved with it.  There were 14 meetings to try to find alternatives to peat.  It is evident that they are not available at the minute and it will take some years for them to be in place.  Our main issue was the contradiction in that action plan, whereby it focuses on bogs smaller than 30 ha.  That will not be sufficient in the short term for peat for the commercial horticultural sector.  We need peat in substantial quantities for commercial matters, not just for the hobby market.  A certain quality and quantity need to be available, especially in the current market.  We will come back to that.  I welcomed the Deputy's earlier comment about ministerial engagement.<\/p> <p>  The two main positive points in the action plan are that two experts are to be appointed.  One is to address legal aspects for anyone wishing to be involved with the bogs smaller than 30 ha, while the other is to find out the actual requirements of the Irish horticultural peat industry.  We welcome that.  We want those people to be appointed as soon as possible.  There cannot be more delays.  We have been waiting for this final report for more than a year, with many meetings.  If there is to be the same scenario, waiting for those two experts to be appointed, we might as well put that to bed.<\/p> <p>  We will take the peat issue further in the next weeks.  The issue of retailers and margins is to the fore.  Import substitution is mentioned in various policies.  In 2020, we imported more than &euro;1.3 billion worth of fresh fruit and vegetables.  Import substitution erodes the critical core mass of growers.  Where is the opportunity?  They will not be allowed an opportunity, not to mention the issues of peat and labour.  We will not mention that today, but all of the issues that existed last year are still there.  It is becoming more critical because the margins are eroding and we are losing growers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I have to run to another meeting, but I will try to come back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030200002#G00400","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>It is great to see the president and members of the IFA.

In this scenario, farmers are very vulnerable when it comes to the retailer.  Other members have mentioned where the processor fits into this sector.  They are not co-operatives, but private industries in many ways themselves and they must make a buck too.  Tying the farmer, the processor and the retailer in together to make sure that farming at the primary level can be supported is a significant issue.  Do the witnesses believe the food ombudsman is the silver bullet to solve this?  We need to progress legislation to have the capability to tie all three together.<\/p> <p>  The UK model has worked to a degree.  It is not the success story that we have talked about here.  I am concerned that the silver bullet that we have talked about, which is the ombudsman, and that person tying all three entities together within years will require a huge amount of work.  We need a template of how that can help.  I am interested in the witnesses' views.  Is the ombudsman the silver bullet for the industry?  Can it be legislated for appropriately and financed appropriately?  What membership and workforce will the ombudsman's office have to deal with these substantial, complex issues?  We have seen success with ombudsmen.  Ms Dixon is in charge of data protection and is undoubtedly one of the most competent and capable people in Europe.  There are issues with ombudsmen around Ireland.  They have not been the success story that we have talked about before.<\/p> <p>  Will the president tell me his vision of what power the ombudsman would have?  How would the ombudsman deal directly with all three entities that are being talked about?  How does he believe that body can be funded appropriately?  Who should fund it, so that it can deliver for farmers at the farm gate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030200002#G00500","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>That is an excellent question.

They are in a similar situation to the one being discussed here.  Last year, our concern was about liquid milk.  It also relies on the retail sector.  The Senator is right that the system is broken.  We have to find a solution to that.<\/p><p>The UTP directive in itself will not resolve this issue.  I have been clear from the start that a number of things need to happen and the Minister bringing forward primary legislation relating to a regulator is one part of it.  The UTP is a softer approach but we need the legislation, which is why I would like a commitment from this committee around that legislation and that this person will have the powers.  The Senator is right.  There are three actors in the chain - ourselves, the processors and the retailers.  We need clarity once and for all.  All of the people around this table this evening have been working to try to establish where the margin is for a long number of years and we have an opportunity now.  We need the help of these Houses.  The first thing we need is legislation around this regulator.  <\/p><p> Regarding the second part of it, this has happened recently with the banning of below-cost selling of alcohol and using alcohol to get consumers into stores.  We cannot and will not be allowed to continue with the practice because we will not survive.  The sectors we represent will not survive if we continue with the practice of below-cost selling of our produce.  From the day discounters came to this country, the practice of using our produce as a loss leader started.  They put photographs of farmers inside shops and then discounted our produce.  <\/p><p> The Senator mentioned funding.  The Government must put funding in place.  This funding will be used very well if we can get a solution to this and we do not end up in the current situation where pig farmers are losing anything up to &euro;40 per pig and poultry farmers risk going out of business.  We have already seen a mass exodus from the horticulture sector.  We have to make this work for the survival of these sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030200002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Cullinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I compliment Mr. Cullinan on his presentation regarding the pig industry.

I might be wrong.  If so, please correct me.  Given that the cost of energy, feed and labour is only going one way in the next 12 months and the cost of transport is a significant issue when it comes to getting products to market as it is only going one way as well, where do Mr. Cullinan and Mr. Sweetnam see the future when they look at the pig and poultry industries?

We have massive concerns, one of which concerns feed.  If we are going to survive, we are going to have to get a better return from the marketplace.  There are two areas we can get that.  I will speak about the pig one while Mr. Sweetnam will speak about the poultry one.  Fifty percent of what pig farmers produce is sold here at retail level.  It is paramount that we get regulation around this in order that we can see where the margin is and regulate so that we will get a fair price going forward.  That is part of the solution.<\/p> <p>  We can look at energy as well.  For years, we have been listening to the Government saying that farmers are part of the solution in respect of climate change.  If the Government had a proper policy on renewable energy, we could become energy producers ourselves, which would alleviate part of the problem around energy, so there is more we can do.  The Senator is right.  We need to look at where our energy is coming from.  The value of energy being imported into this country is in the region of &euro;8 billion per year.  We as farmers are willing and able and have been asking the Government for support on this for a long number of years.  It is high time Government took this issue seriously.  <\/p> <p>  They are the areas we must work on.  Inputs like feed are out of our control.  It is about market forces and world market prices and we have to deal with those.  The solution in the pig sector and other sectors is, first of all, about being able to get a proper price at retail level.  Obviously, we will have to work on world markets as well.  There is a job of work for Bord Bia to do to find and open up new markets.  There are markets in regions of North America and we need more promotion.  There is demand for pigmeat in California at present.  These are areas we need to focus on.  We all understand that the past two years were very difficult for our agencies, including Bord Bia.  The Minister was on his first trade mission in Dubai only two weeks ago.  We need to see more trade missions.  We need to get out there and get a foothold in new markets.

The first is the regulator to make sure we do not end up in this situation again.  In the short term, we need a price increase for our product.  I have seen 20 years of false dawns in renewables.  I had one of the first biomass boilers that could actually burn poultry litter and produce energy.  We could have a carbon-neutral chicken and produce electricity and heat from the litter under the chickens.  Two thirds of the litter would produce enough energy to rear that chicken but that needs to be supported.  It is being supported everywhere else in Europe.  We are competing against chickens in Northern Ireland.  Twenty years ago, I put a boiler into my farm.  If I put in the same boiler in Northern Ireland, I would be getting &pound;79,000 per year in a subsidy.  Here, I got nothing.  I had the first licence in Europe to burn poultry litter.  We have spoken about renewables here but that is all we have done.  We have just paid lip service to it.  The only green measure we have had to date has been a carbon tax, which is another joke.  Paying VAT on carbon tax is crippling us.  It is a tax on a tax.  This is one area we could look at immediately.  Carbon tax could be suspended or at a minimum, we could ensure that no VAT is applied to it.  To go back to electricity, every poultry house in Ireland should have solar panels on the roof.  It is a no-brainer.  There are huge sheds, the facility and usage are there and it is 24-7 so whatever power that is produced during the day will be used inside the poultry house and that can be supplemented.  Reverse metering on electricity is not a big ask.  The Minister announced targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, funding in this regard but limited it to 5 kW or 12 kW.  That is a domestic house, not a poultry farm.<\/p> <p>  Those are three areas.  We need an immediate price increase to keep the show going.  We have seen guys getting their returns back from the factories and because they are paid by the processor, their energy bills are double what they were this time last year.  When we protested outside supermarkets, we saw there was a willingness on the part of the public to pay an additional 15 cent or an additional 2 cent for the egg guy.  Some of the discounters were offering half of what we needed but that is just not an option.  We have to get cost recovery and that is only to maintain our margin.  We are not looking to improve our margin.  In the long term, we are looking for the regulator in order that we are not in this situation.  Another thing we are looking for is proper support in renewables, not just lip service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030200002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nigel Sweetnam"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Ms Brennan might give me an outline of the timelines applicable to the harvesting of peat and where we are with regard to that issue.<\/p><p>How serious are we now regarding having a Minister get involved directly in order that we can have peat harvesting at the appropriate time required this year?

We were not aware of the quality or availability of the 2,000 tonnes.  That will go nowhere once the main season begins.  That answer is that we need it in place immediately if the Government wants to put an end to this environmental hypocrisy whereby we are importing peat to keep the show on the road.  Our main season is starting.  The amenity sector will have an event next year to mark the beginning of the season.  It is in place.

It gives me the opportunity not to repeat the questions already posed but to have a conversation with the witnesses.  I want to start by welcoming the IFA.  I was in the mart in Kilcullen last Tuesday and, over a cup of coffee, a number of people asked what the IFA was doing for them.  We are talking about prosperous country that comprises Timolin, Moone and Ballitore, down into County Carlow, and Athy and Fontstown - great agricultural lands and communities.  I was glad to say that the IFA is doing a hell of a lot.  That is really important.  I said it is in and out of these Houses at night working for and representing them.  I want to acknowledge that.<\/p><p>As someone who has sat on this committee for two years, I see the work of the IFA.  I see media coverage in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal<\/i>, <i>agriland.ie<\/i>and all other publications and provincial papers.  We have them all upstairs in the library.  They all come in here on a Thursday and I take the time to look, read and see the measure of the publicity.<\/p><p>I am not going to be critical but I will give the IFA a little bit of advice.  The ask has to be very succinct.  I sit and hear people around this table talking about being disappointed.  The reality is that we have a national Government made up of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  The reality is that we have three Ministers in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, namely, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Heydon, who is from County Kildare.  I unable to square up why we are having these difficulties in agriculture when we have three Ministers.  It has been ably demonstrated today when we have a situation whereby we cannot get the three Ministers to appear before this committee.  Here we are; it is not the IFA's problem but our problem in these Houses.  Yet they come in every week, eloquently read the IFA's statements and ask us to tell them what we think.  There is a bit of a disconnect there.  We need to sharpen up our messages.  I sit on the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and see how representatives from the construction industry come in.  They do not make any secret of what they want.  They spell it out crystal clear and make hard, sharp asks.  I say that in a helpful way not to be too provocative.  That is an important thing to say, however.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the enormous work done by the IFA.  I think back on the great politics of agriculture and the witnesses' predecessors, who managed and leveraged that political power on politicians.  We need to do something on that.  I want to share that with the witnesses.  I thank the IFA for its ongoing briefings.  I read its statement today and there are two issues I wish to take up.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the importance of the horticultural sector being the fourth largest after beef, dairy and pigs.  I am really saddened and disappointed by what Ms Brennan said but she has given us a dose of reality today in terms of the horticultural sector and our growers dropping.  I like to divide horticulture into ornamentals and crops, and then, of course, the mushroom sector on its own.  What a wonderful industry we have had up until now.  I think we are somehow failing to communicate the real challenges.  Somehow, we cannot crack it.  We had debates in the D&aacute;il and Seanad on this issue and yet we have a national Government and three Ministers in the Department who are all based in rural constituencies representing rural communities.  I do not understand that.<\/p><p>I would like Ms Brennan to provide some more detail to the committee although not necessarily today.  I would like more detail with regard to the mushroom sector and the real prices.  We need to be equipped with the knowledge the IFA has as professionals representing those sectors, be it poultry, pigs or horticulture, to continue to advance an argument.  No one has taken this seriously to date.  That is really disappointing.  As I said, I think that is important.  I understand that horticulture is not a big sector in terms of IFA representation.  Yes, it has the horticultural sector and forestry and all the other bits but it is an area in which we have great opportunities.  There is a demand for horticulture, food and so forth.<\/p><p>I also want to pick up what on someone said.  If we look at all the multiples and advertising in all the papers, they have suddenly glamourised farming.  Farmers now have designer boots, coats and jackets, and lovely orange carrots that are varnished.  They are using this to sell produce.  I will not name any of them.  I will not give them that publicity.  I bump into people and ask myself whether it is a real person or not.  They are all dressed up in Hunter boots, cut-off jackets and designer hairdos with their family - Johnny and the designer sheepdog - telling us to buy Irish and wear Irish producers.  It is a very nice image and I am impressed by it but we cannot be fooled by it.  That is another concern.  I see the concerns in terms of the multiples and the challenges the IFA has.<\/p><p>On page 4 of the IFA's submission, there is a reference to UTPs.  Clearly, such practices are hugely challenging for the IFA.  The Minister is undertaking a survey, which is to be completed by 15 March.  Has any of the IFA's members engaged in that.  Has the IFA encouraged them to engage in that?  What is its view of the survey?  It strikes me as yet another survey.  Surely, the Minister and his officials know what the problems are.  They do not need another survey of farmers.  I do not know the uptake in respect of all of that.  The IFA might share with us its knowledge of the survey, how it is going and what it thinks of it.  Dare I ask if the IFA thinks it is even necessary.  I do not necessarily think so but I would be interested to see the results of the survey.<\/p><p>The national food ombudsman's office is in the programme for Government, therefore, I presume this Government is going to implement this.  Ultimately, the national food ombudsman will eventually take over the powers of the unfair trading practices enforcement authority.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on that.<\/p><p>As I said, I acknowledge the important work the IFA does on behalf of farmers across the country.  They do not see it here tonight.  It is not necessarily reported in all the media.  The IFA provides a great service to agriculture and to the rural communities in this country.  It is important to say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030200002#J00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

The advertising was incorrect and when our association took a stand and highlighted this in the media, which was the proper thing to do, it did not go down very well with that particular discounter.  It took a challenge against us, went all the way to the High Court and sought an injunction against our association, which was highlighting fake branding by that discounter.  That was very concerning.  The outcome was correct in that the judge saw that the discounter was incorrect in what it was doing.  Not alone did he not grant the injunction, he granted us our costs on the day.  We should not have to go to those lengths to try to protect our sectors.  That is the length we had to go to last year.  The reason I referred to that is the Senator asked me about a survey.  I have not engaged in a survey.

If the mushroom industry gets to a stage where it has to import a product that is 80% water into the country, we have to ask ourselves a big question about what we are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030200002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I will let Senator Boyhan know, it is not guidance.

The unfair trading practices directive is a European directive.  As Deputy Carthy outlined, he was involved in it a number of years ago.  It goes not go far enough.  If we go through it, there are 16 unfair trading practices that are banned by the directive and minimum requirements are to be enforced for all new contracts and existing contracts from 28 April this year.  I have no doubt they will be but they do not go anywhere near far enough.  The words \"price recognition\" of the cost of production are never mentioned in the context of an unfair trading practice.  Terms and conditions of trading, terms of payment and those kind of things are mentioned as they relate to unfair trading practices.  That is why we are here today.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the Senator's advice, we have a specific ask.  When committee members get a chance to scrutinise this legislation, we want them to look for proper teeth in the powers of the food regulator or the ombudsperson, whatever it is termed, of engagement with retailers, investigation and enforcement in order to call out people who are not recognising the cost of production.  Whether it is Mr. Cullinan as a pig farmer or Ms Brennan's horticulturist members, their costs of production are not recognised in those prices.  That is ultimately where the problem is.  If the price set by a retailer for a packer or processor is not enough, the farmer will ultimately lose. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030200002#K01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I will also answer that.

Again, that legislation will be coming to the floor of the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>As we said earlier, the Minister has committed to doing this, but the legislation must be strong and capable of giving a person the power to go along the food supply chain to see where the margin is.  We saw this in 2018, when farmers protesting at the gates over beef prices led to the establishment of the beef task force.  As we stated here earlier, Grant Thornton failed to find out where the margin was at the time.  We now have an opportunity to protect all sectors in farming but the legislation needs to be strong.  It will be scrutinised properly in the D&aacute;il and by this committee, which is important.  The legislation needs to have power.  We need to go a step further than envisaged in that, as well as having a food regulator, we need a regulation to prevent the use of food as a loss leader within stores once and for all.  Our real ask this evening is to have the legislation we require.  It will protect a sector in rural Ireland.  It will protect not just one sector but four or five whose only route to market is the retailer.  We need protection from retailers.  We never see the profits of many retailers.

The Bill aims to provide a legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing a request for remote work can be based.  It also aims to provide legal clarity and procedures to employers on their obligations for dealing with such requests.  The committee recently discussed the proposed legislation with officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

IBEC has been deeply engaged on the issue of remote working for some time.  In addition to the statement I will make today, I have provided the joint committee with a more detailed submission setting out the views of our members on the Bill.  We have also provided the Department with detailed submissions setting out the views of our members on the opportunities and challenges presented by remote working.  I would be happy to share these further submissions with any members who may be interested.<\/p> <p>  IBEC and its members recognise the benefits flexible working solutions, including remote working, can bring.  Of course, as well as the benefits remote working can bring to both parties, there are complex impacts for individual businesses, not least of which is cost.<\/p> <p>  It is imperative that a fair balance is drawn between the importance of achieving reconciliation of professional and private life and the need to sustain employment and enhance economic competitiveness.  It is also crucial to recognise that while many employers can and will offer remote working to employees, there are some sectors and employers for whom remote working simply cannot be facilitated.<\/p> <p>  IBEC notes that the draft Bill is just one element of the Government&rsquo;s broader remote working strategy.  IBEC has previously welcomed Government commitments to invest in necessary infrastructure such as remote working hubs, alignment with childcare facilities, and the national broadband plan, as well as reviewing tax arrangements to incentivise remote working.  We look forward to seeing further progress on these matters.<\/p> <p>  While we are generally supportive of the Government&rsquo;s remote working strategy, we question whether enacting legislation in this area is the most effective way of promoting remote working.  Employers are currently facing an unprecedented amount of legislative and policy reforms in the employment rights space.  Legislation in respect of statutory sick pay, whistleblowing, the gender pay gap and extended family leave entitlements are all expected in the coming 12 months, and that is nowhere near an exhaustive list in terms of new employment-related regulation that businesses must consider and implement.<\/p> <p>  Government must consider these legislative proposals in a way that properly takes account of the cumulative cost and burden of administration for employers.  Furthermore, businesses and their staff are continuing to learn what works for their sector, and many employers are already iterating on various forms of remote, hybrid and flexible work options.  The reality is that offering remote or hybrid working, where feasible, is increasingly a competitive factor and employers will ensure they take the necessary steps to attract and retain talent.  We believe that legislating for a statutory right to request remote work at this stage is premature and may stymie the ability of employers and employees to manage remote working in a creative and flexible way.  It is undoubtedly the case that remote work in some form will remain a permanent feature of the labour market.  However, it would be prudent to take some time to experience the post pandemic workplace before seeking to regulate this area by way of legislation.  There is, therefore, a significant question around the necessity to introduce a statutory right at this stage.<\/p> <p>  If the intention is to provide a framework for employers and employees, then we are of the view that best practice guidance in the form of a code of practice would provide a much more agile and flexible way to address this whole area, particularly in circumstances where there is no one-size-fits-all approach that will work across all sectors.  A non-statutory framework, with appropriate Government supports, is likely to yield much more positive support and results.<\/p> <p>  If this proposed legislation is enacted, it must not be overly rigid or prescriptive.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution to managing this issue.  Employers across sectors are currently engaging closely with employees with respect to requests for remote and flexible working, and they must be given the space and discretion to continue to do this in a flexible, productive and amicable manner.<\/p> <p>  IBEC welcomes the broad grounds included in the draft Bill under which businesses may consider applications for remote working.  We note the criticism these provisions have received from certain parties.  However, it is important to emphasise the need for employers to be given discretion to consider requests for remote working in accordance with their own business needs and objectives.<\/p> <p>  Quite apart from the suitability of the role for remote working, not all remote working locations will be appropriate for home working.  IBEC submits that it is reasonable to expect that employees who request to work remotely can identify a suitable and secure work area which, where necessary, is not too far from an employer&rsquo;s on-site location.  It is the case, however, that there will be cohorts of employees who will find it more difficult than others to identify a suitable work area in their homes.  The obligation to ensure a proper and safe place of work, ensuring data security, confidentiality and the protection of intellectual property at a place of work are paramount considerations for employers.<\/p><p>They must be permitted to refuse requests for remote working where there are concerns relating to these issues.<\/p><p> For some employers, the cost implications of granting a remote working request may be prohibitive.  This is particularly the case given the general expectation on employers to provide whatever equipment they deem reasonable for employees working remotely.  IBEC notes that where remote working is facilitated on a long-term basis, a higher standard will most likely be required to be met to ensure compliance with health and safety, data protection and employment rights legislation.  Facilitating remote work may impose a disproportionate cost burden on some employers that they will simply not be in a position to absorb.  Again, these employers must be given the discretion to decline a request where the financial position of the company so dictates.  We believe the non-exhaustive, indicative list of business grounds for declining a request for remote working included in the draft Bill are fair and objective.  In this regard, we note the requirement that a decision to decline a request be grounded in an assessment of business needs rather on other spurious or arbitrary grounds, and we believe this to be appropriate.<\/p><p> We are very concerned by the mandatory requirement for all employers, regardless of size or sector, to have a remote work policy in place and the creation of a criminal offence for a failure to do so.  We believe this requirement is entirely disproportionate and is based on a misplaced assumption that the legislation can set out a one-size-fits-all approach to this issue.  In addition, this proposal to introduce a legislative requirement to have a policy in place will have a number of unintended consequences.  These include driving employers to have the narrowest-possible policy to ensure the number of claims, litigations or employee-relations issues arising will be reduced to the greatest extent possible.  If enacted as currently drafted, the Bill would stymie innovation and creativity and certainly would not encourage employers to be as agile or flexible as they otherwise would be.<\/p><p> Remote working poses some practical challenges for employers.  Just a sample of some of the questions with which employers are currently grappling include: where equipment or property belonging to an employer is in an employees home, who is responsible for insuring it; how an employer should ensure confidential information is adequately and properly secured when employees have highly sensitive information in their homes; and how an employer should comply with its statutory obligation to record employees&rsquo; working time when they are working remotely and thus not clocking in and out of the office.  We have requested guidance from the Data Protection Commission, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Health and Safety Authority with respect to how employers can best manage such risks associated with remote working.<\/p><p> Furthermore, the area of health and safety in remote and hybrid working models is very complex for employers to navigate.  Employers understand health and safety at work rests with the employer, regardless of whether an employee works remotely.  In response to Covid-19 and increased numbers of employees working from home, the HSA published a frequently asked questions, FAQ, document, including advice on ergonomic assessments of an employee&rsquo;s home workspace, equipment provision and good practice when using digital technologies.  IBEC submits that further guidance from the HSA in certain key areas is required as more permanent remote or hybrid working arrangements are put in place.  One area where clarity is required concerns work-related accidents that occur at home and, in particular, what exactly is reportable if there is a work-related accident at home.  IBEC remains of the view that there must have been a work activity, not just an accident that took place in the home during working time.  It is important further clarity be provided by the HSA in this regard, given the extent of an employer&rsquo;s obligations and responsibilities determines any potential liability that may arise for employers.<\/p><p> Employers recognise the benefits of remote working, not least the ability to attract and retain talent.  Nevertheless, the challenges faced by employers go far beyond the need to ensure adherence to employment rights legislation.  The cost and administrative burden will be significant.  IBEC submits that in order for remote working to become a viable flexible working solution for both parties, detailed guidance and Government supports and incentives will be required, rather than inflexible legislation.  The concept of remote working remains an evolving one, the benefits and challenges of which will continue to emerge in the post-pandemic workplace.  Where legislation is enacted in this area, it must be sufficiently agile to enable employers and employees alike to reap the benefits remote working can offer.<\/p><p> I thank members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present IBEC&rsquo;s views on this draft legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McElwee.

I am accompanied by my colleague, Dr. Laura Bambrick.<br\/><br\/>While most jobs require a physical presence in the workplace, as many as one in four workers in employment worked from home during the first lockdown.  Remote working has now moved into the mainstream of workplace issues.  For the vast majority of these workers and their employers, this was their first experience of remote working, and while it was challenging for some, in the main it has proven to be a success and there is now strong demand to make this temporary arrangement permanent.  Remote working has been shown to improve workers&rsquo; quality of life and their well-being, and it can benefit the environment and foster rural regeneration.  Furthermore, it makes good business and economic sense.  Studies have repeatedly found most employers reported productivity either increased or stayed the same over the past two years.<br\/><br\/>This is why the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and its affiliates were the first to call for legislation on a right to request remote work in summer 2020, bringing us into line with long-established employment law in most EU member states, the UK, Australia and New Zealand.  While employees in Ireland have always had a right to ask to work remotely, they have no right to be heard, nor for their request to be given proper consideration, nor to appeal a decision.  This legislation is intended to end the fact a request can be ignored by the employer or dismissed out of hand for no good reason.  However, as we detailed in our written submission to the committee, which is available to view online, the draft Bill has been stacked in favour of the employer at every turn and is fatally flawed in key parts.  It will not deliver what we campaigned for or what it is intended to provide, namely, robust legislation guaranteeing fair procedure and balancing employers' and employees' needs.<br\/><br\/>In the brief time that remains for my opening remarks, I will concentrate on the grounds for refusal and the grounds for appeal, which significantly impair the usefulness and effectiveness of the entire statutory scheme that has been proposed.  Head 12 of the Bill provides that the employer can decline a request for remote working if it is satisfied the request is not suitable on &ldquo;business grounds&rdquo;.  Thirteen examples of grounds they may &lsquo;&rsquo;include, but are not limited to&rdquo; are listed.  The head is explicit on this point.  The explanatory note states &quot;the phrase 'including but not limited to' is intended to ensure that the list provided does not fetter or confine the definition of &lsquo;business grounds&rsquo; ... The list provided is intended by the Department to be purely indicative and not limiting or binding.&quot;  In essence, the employer continues to be able to refuse a request on any grounds it chooses that relate to the business, including a mere assertion that remote working is not suitable to the needs of the business.<br\/><br\/>In the UK, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy is in the process of completing a consultation reviewing its flexible working legislation, including whether the eight business reasons an employer can reject a request remain valid.  Six of these eight reasons have been duplicated in the 13 examples cited in the draft Bill under consideration today.  Despite a statutory right to request having been in place for all employees in the UK since 2014, it has not brought about the changes intended.  We must learn from the UK&rsquo;s policy mistake and grasp our late-mover advantage.  ICTU and affiliates recommend a refusal must be justified on grounds that relate to the real needs of the business and that are appropriate and proportionate having regard to all the circumstances of the business and the employee.<br\/><br\/>Head 16 confers the employee with a &ldquo;right to appeal&rdquo;, whereby a complaint can be made to the WRC on the following grounds: the employer has failed to return a decision within the timeframe in compliance with head 10; or the employer has failed to provide a notice of the grounds for refusal in compliance with head 12; or an employer&rsquo;s notification under head 9 was given in circumstances that did not satisfy the requirements of head 9(1) or (2).  A major omission from this head is any provision providing that an adjudication officer can hold that a refusal of a request under the Bill is unreasonable, or was not justified on objective grounds, or was not proportionate in all the circumstances.  The head is explicit, however, on the grounds for appeal.  The explanatory note states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tFor the avoidance of doubt, it is noted that the right to make a complaint to the WRC under this Head is <i>not<\/i>intended to extend to a right to complain in respect of the substance or merits of an employer&rsquo;s decision to decline a request under Head 12(1). The right to complain only extends to a failure to effect notice of the reasons grounding that declination as required under Head 12(2). <\/blockquote><p>In effect, the proposed legislation will only allow for a complaint to the WRC on procedural grounds.  ICTU and its affiliates are strongly of the view that an appeal to the WRC taking issue with the substantive decision of the employer must be provided.  Without this, the proposed legislation is utterly pointless.  Furthermore, there is no provision for a complaint that an employee was penalised, victimised or discriminated against as a result of having requested, appealed or engaged in remote working.  It should also be noted that the proposed limit of 4 weeks pay, by way of compensation, is wholly inadequate and completely out of line with the limit of 104 weeks that is available under most existing employment legislation.<\/p><p> It is important that I correct the conventional wisdom that businesses are ahead of Government on this and have put or are in the process of putting in place company policy on remote and blended working arrangements.  This does not tally with what we are hearing from union representatives on the ground.  Their experience is of employers reluctant to engage until this legislation is enacted.  ICTU and affiliates are urging this committee and all Members of the Oireachtas to work with trade unions and the Government in getting this legislation fit for purpose and enacted without delay to ensure the gains from remote working are not lost.  I thank members for their attention.  We are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank Ms King.

I thank the officials for attending and for their submissions.  I have a couple of questions.  My first is to Ms McElwee.  The IBEC submission refers to potential costs for employers and the grave and serious fear it has this is going to run out of control.  I come at this from a different perspective, which I am sure will be no surprise to anyone listening.  I raise the potential benefits.  There are massive benefits.  In addition to the specific benefit to the individual, we might look at the benefits in a climate change context of people commuting less.  We know there are huge benefits that extend beyond access to a form of work-life balance, etc.  From reading the IBEC submission I would not be convinced Ms McElwee and her colleagues see any benefit at all from it.

First and foremost, the vast majority of our members are indicating to us they intend to continue with remote and hybrid methods of working into the future.  They definitely see the benefits.  Even before the pandemic hit, we had already seen quite a significant move towards more remote and hybrid working on an ongoing basis.  Employers recognise the benefit to themselves.  Especially where we look at trying to draw and attract talent and particular skill sets into our businesses and industries, the opportunity to be able to look at a wider market, to be able to identify people who are not within necessarily within the immediate vicinity of the office or environment in which we are working is an enormous benefit.  It also means that we have lots more individuals in the labour market who potentially are not now participating but are much more open to participating in remote or hybrid settings.  Employers absolutely see the opportunities.  Lots of employers are looking at how they might resize some of their working spaces and environments.  That also provides some opportunities.  It is fair to say business and employers see the opportunities and the cost savings for themselves and for their own employees directly.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of this morning was maybe to focus on the issues relating to the general scheme.  There are undoubtedly challenges for employers within that because there are very considerable costs that arise.  These are not just the direct costs but the potential responsibilities that fall on employers.  It is the scale of the fines relating to data protection.  It is the scale of the risk around cybersecurity.  It is the risk that arises with very prescriptive legislation where there are challenges around occupational health and safety, accidents in the workplace, insurance queries and all sorts of equality issues that may arise.  We need to focus on these.  It is not in any way that we do not see the benefit.  Lots of employers absolutely see the benefit and the cost benefit.  It is the scale of the financial liabilities we also need to consider as we look at the development of legislation around this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Of course there must be some form of balance but, with respect, there is no balance in the IBEC submission.

The usefulness of any piece of legislation when it is enacted can be measured by how many people are using it and how successful it is in the change it purports to achieve.  You can see in the UK legislation that has not been great but there are much more fundamental things that need to be considered outside the targets.  It is pointless saying to an employer you can refuse it on any grounds you like and then an employee says I disagree with you and think you are being unreasonable and the piece of legislation before us says you cannot take that and have any appeal on it.  What we are looking at is useless in terms of an employee.  The proposed legislation is giving every ground an employer can put forward as a reasonable reason to reject the request.  That is as good as having no right to request it, if employers can refuse it on any grounds and that is what the current legislation says.  When you take that position and the employee feels it is unreasonable, he or she then goes to the WRC and cannot cite the grounds for the refusal other than just three technical things.<\/p><p>The legislation we are looking at is a real missed opportunity.  There is no hope of reaching any target because nothing will change.  From our point of view, we must grasp this opportunity and move progressively into the new world of working post pandemic.

However, it is so unbalanced at this stage that it can only be described as useless.

At least three times the Minister in charge said, through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, that he was disposed towards putting forward legislation.  We had a general discussion about that on three occasions.  There was then a public consultation, in which we took part in the same way as everybody else.  At the last meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum on 10 December, the Minister told us the heads of a Bill would be published in January.  He did not share those heads with us so we had no idea what was in them, nor was there any disclosure at those meetings as to what would be in the heads of the Bill.

We would be asked for our views on legislation and would engage with officials from the Department and share strong views, particularly on certain aspects of proposed legislation.

One is that we have had feedback, much of which has come from the private sector because, as the Senator will know, in the public sector there is a phased return under way at the moment, which means people are taking part in arrangements for a phased return and there are discussions ongoing with the employer with regard to various aspects of that return, including remote working.  However, this has not been conceded.  I imagine the public sector employer is awaiting the progress of the legislation.  That is an impediment.

Even from a spatial point of view, the Government had proposals for 2040 regarding building and expanding areas in which people could work and live and have essential services provided to them.

It creates a set of principles that suggest what should be done to do a job right from the perspective of both worker and employer.  However, it has no further significance.  It is not going to allay the fears of those workers whose position I outlined in response to Deputy Flaherty.  It is not going to allay those fears at all.  Therefore, in my judgment, it is not the route to go.  There is a provision in the Act whereby the Minister can put forward a code of practice if he wants to.  That probably relates more to the development of a remote working policy.  There is a requirement in the proposed Bill for employers to publish their policies.  I presume the code of practice was to assist consistency in that.  Other than that, the answer is not a code of practice.  I am clear on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030200002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>As we set out in our opening statement, we feel a code of practice might be a useful way to address some of these issues.  The scale of the differences across sectors and industries means this will be a legislative challenge.  We have already seen that in the ability of employers to set out different types of business cases that the legislation is already trying to recognise.  A code of practice might give us some more flexibility in dealing with that.  A statutory code of practice would have significant standing.  We have a number of statutory codes of practice that have significant standing within our employment rights framework.  It can be linked to legislation, in that failure to comply with the code of practice could be relevant to an adjudicator's decision, which could make it an effective mechanism for dealing with some of the challenges.<\/p> <p>  I will also comment on the issue the Deputy raised around the fact that we now have two years' experience.  He was asking if we are raising issues that have already been dealt with.  It is important to point out that many of these issues have not yet been dealt with, which is a point I have made on many occasions.  Over the past two years, we have had the overarching obligation, first and foremost, to manage public health and to address issues of public health and safety.  That has been paramount, above all other considerations, as was right and appropriate in a pandemic situation.  Employers and employees have tolerated situations that are less than ideal and that have created significant risk for many employers but because of the overarching public health issue, we have supported that.<\/p><p>As the members are aware and as I am experiencing myself here today, there are challenges around broadband and connectivity that continue.  Many employers have tolerated that because there has been no option and it has been the safer option to deal with reduced quality in terms of connection than to have people come into the office.  We have tolerated significant challenges around data security and privacy.  We know that when we look at younger cohorts of workers, many of whom are living in shared accommodation, we are going to need to dip into very significant privacy issues around dealing with some of these questions that will come up, such as who they share their home with, where they lock away information, and whether others in the home also have rights to work remotely.  We will deal with questions such as how data are secure, for example, when a person works for one of the big legal houses and the person her or she shares his or her home with works for its biggest competitor.  We will deal with questions of whether conversations are overheard and how a worker can be sure that he or she has not inadvertently left a document on the table at home.  There are big issues for employers to consider.  They have not been worked out in any way.  We have not, in any way, worked out the issues around occupational health and safety or how they arise.  We have not worked out, in any way, how we provide adequate support for people with mental health difficulties and how they operate in the isolation of remote working.  We certainly have not dealt with any of the issues around cybersecurity.  We have tolerated situations where it was more important to protect public health and to make it work than actually focusing on long-term situations where employers bear the overall responsibility and the fines for any of these breaches.  That still needs a lot of work and perfecting before we go down the line of this type of legislation.  I want to put on the record that it is absolutely not settled yet.  We know that people can all work remotely.  We have very little experience of how people work in a hybrid environment.  We certainly do not have the investment required to say that this will work positively in the long term.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030200002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I wish to come in briefly to suggest the following.  If we have legislation to ensure it is a statutory obligation to have a policy and for employers to behave reasonably, and if a code of practice is developed by the Workplace Relations Commission, which may be relevant to adjudication, so we are therefore moving beyond the existing scope of adjudication in the Bill to test something with reference to this code, would that not be a significant strengthening of this legislation?

All codes of practice mean is that if a person takes a case, cites the code of practice and the adjudicator in the WRC looks at the code of practice, they may very well tell the employer that it has not complied with it.  When it suits the employer, it will argue that it did not have to because it is only a code of practice.  That is the answer to that.  Codes of practice fall on their feet.  They do not stand up to robust opposition.  That is the reality.  If they did, they would be used a lot more than they are currently.  In a situation where we need to have a legislation that states that a worker can request remote working and that the refusal has to be on objective grounds, if it is left freefall and open for an employer to pick whatever ground it likes and that cannot be appealed, it is of no meaningful assistance to the worker who wants to achieve home working.  I understand that Ms McElwee has gone into great detail on some of the issues that might arise.  However, some of the issues that she cited might arise whether a person works from home or not.  For example, if a person is a professional working in a legal company and has to read papers for the next morning, he or she could take them home to read at night and could inadvertently leave them on a table.   A person does not have to be working from home for breaches of confidentiality to occur.  There are lots of circumstances around everybody's work that can present those sort of risks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

I wish to raise a few issues.  I have had a look through some of the examples that the Department provided with respect to what happens in other jurisdictions.  It seems to me that the right to request remote working is basically it, and that from what I can see, this legislation is on a par with that is already in place in other jurisdictions.  One of the core issues that Deputy Bruton touched on a bit is the right to go to the WRC and what the WRC can do.  Specifically, it is about whether it can adjudicate and decide on procedural issues or on a substantive issue.  I ask Ms McElwee the following.  If the WRC was given the power to adjudicate on the substantive issue as to whether a right to remote work should be granted in the first place, would that give clarity to the whole situation?<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Ms King.  With respect to what they do in New Zealand, if a person has the right to work from home and the employer is responsible for the health and safety, should the employer have the right to, somehow or other, either remotely or in some other way, inspect the workplace or work location?  It seems to me that it could be the case that a person is working from home and the employer is responsible for the worker's safety, yet the employer cannot gain access because it might be a worker's private residence.  Has Ms King thought how that might be dealt with in any way?  <\/p> <p>  I note that there is an internal appeals procedure.  Within two weeks of the start of the internal appeals procedure, a claim can be taken to the WRC.  In Ms King's view, does that mean that there could be two processes ongoing, an internal appeal and the WRC procedure, at the same time?  Would it not make more sense of the internal appeal procedure was finished first?  If it reached some kind of agreement in that way, there would be no need for the WRC claim.  I will finish there and perhaps come back in later.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030200002#G00500","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I can answer the Deputy's first question around whether the issue would be resolved by the WRC having the ability to conduct a substantive investigation.  The challenge there is the whole issue of how the WRC would actually manage to investigate that.  The important thing here is that an employer is seen to give appropriate and adequate consideration, and that in line with all best practice and with the legislation, they have considered all of the angles and give a reasoned response to an employee as to why that request is being refused or perhaps being offered in a different format.  For the WRC to investigate, we are really looking into very substantial challenges for employers.  In many ways, with issues that are so significant, it would be very difficult for the WRC to actually determine at the individual level of a practice at an operational level, whether that person is critically needed.  We could spend huge amounts of time and WRC resources trying to identify all of those different reasons why it might be necessary for one person in a particular role to have either on-site or a different type of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030200002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":148,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":149,"content":"<p>It would take up a huge amount of resources.

In relation to on-site inspections, it is really important to state that there are challenges for employers that we would love to see more clarity from the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, on this point.  There will be people working alone in their homes.  Sending in inspectors to identify risks and any of the normal ergonomic considerations that employers are obliged to undertake is quite challenging.  Issues include the cost and the geographic distances that may have to be covered.  There is also the reality of people working alone and having strangers moving around their homes, which throws up lots of other considerations for employers.

I hear that employers have concerns and we need to understand those.  I agree that we need updated guidance from the Health and Safety Authority on the ergonomic suitability of workplaces and such issues.

We are 24 months on from when thousands of workers were forced into working from home.  Is IBEC suggesting that employers are only beginning to grapple with these issues now?  They include vital issues of insurance, clocking in and that employers have not been putting software in place to ensure working time is recorded.  With regards to digital security, I find it hard to believe that employers have allowed a Wild West scenario with regards to digital security systems in place for their workers working remotely.

When we talk about the scale of remote working and the fact that we have recognised it is possible, we are saying some of it is possible and some of it will absolutely remain longer term; a lot of what happened would not have been done with the blessing of employers in the absence of the public health guidance and advice.  It is certainly not a Wild West of cybersecurity.  Employers have been investing significant amounts in managing cybersecurity, but it is a fact that where we have challenges around networks and connectivity, and challenges around where people are actually working from, they open up avenues of additional concern for employers and they need to be taken care of.<\/p> <p>  Insurance of equipment continues to be an issue.  Everybody has operated within a pandemic environment for two years, including our insurers, employees and employers, and we have looked at this as being temporary, albeit that its temporary nature has been extended.  When we start to look at permanent solutions to this, we will start to see different issues coming through and we need to have that clarification.  Insurance should just be a matter of clarification.<\/p> <p>  Clocking is extraordinarily difficult because software is not going to be sufficient by itself and there is paperwork required.

I am not sure that small businesses here, in terms of the small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector, are being properly represented.  A couple of people have made comments already that to oblige small businesses, which have no opportunity to offer remote working, to engage in having a policy in place, renewing it every year etc., is only one more onerous task that small businesses do not need.  That needs to be recognised from the outset.<\/p> <p>  It may be my own analysis but I wonder whether a large amount of the rhetoric in the discussion here today essentially is trying to marry the private and the public sector as if they are exactly the same.  I would say that remote working works in many administration jobs and we have a great deal of that in the public sector.  We do not have the same across the private sector.

A bricklayer or somebody else working somewhere where the work has to be done on site cannot be at home doing that sort of work, so a rationale and a level of reasonableness have to come into this.  The Deputy mentioned rhetoric.  I hope this is a little more substantive than rhetoric.  We will not be unreasonable about this but we do know that a considerable level of home-working could be done successfully.

There is certainly no one-size-fits-all solution here.  The problem with legislation such as this is that that is essentially what we are trying to craft.<\/p> <p>  Ms King referred to private employers earlier.  She talked about the tightening labour market, and it is absolutely a tightening market out there.  I was speaking last night to guys in the hospitality industry who want to extend their opening hours and they cannot do so because they cannot get the staff.  That is the situation out there.  There is flexibility for employees to look around for jobs.  If a job entails the possibility of working from home, I think most employers, as long as they get productivity, will offer that.  That raises the question of where exactly the problem is, which brings me back to what I said.  Many public sector administration jobs can possibly be done through remote working.  During the Covid pandemic, however, and other Members of the Oireachtas might agree with me on this, it has been difficult enough for us to do our jobs, trying to meet public servants and civil servants.  That was made even more difficult because of Covid and remote working.  It is very hard to know how productivity is being assessed when so many people are not on site, they are not meeting day-to-day and they are extracurricular, if you will.  These issues need to be brought into this policy before we start enacting policy that will make it very difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to deal with this legislation on top of everything else we are now putting on top of businesses, given the tightening business environment out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030200002#K00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Who wishes to respond to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030200002#K00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Ms King again, possibly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030200002#K00400","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Deputy Shanahan made a general comment about hospitality.

That is not objective, fair or reasonable and it needs to be addressed.  The current proposition in the legislation states that if a worker has from his or her employer a rejection of a request for remote working, that worker cannot appeal that substantive objection to the WRC.  That is unfair and unreasonable.  From our point of view, there are several ways to remedy that.  We are looking for a remedy to this.  We think that engagement would address a lot of this and that we could have reformed legislation that works.  That would not confer a right to remote working on every employee.  It would allow workers to apply for remote working in reasonable circumstances and allow the employer either to accept it or to refuse it on reasonable, objective grounds.  It would allow the worker to say, \"I do not think that is fair so I will go to the WRC and appeal it.\".  It would allow that appeal against the decision of the employer to happen.

How would that be done?  What size of companies would be exempt?  The obvious problem is that if companies with five to ten staff are exempted, a company with 11 staff will have an issue with that.

As I said, the issue is of huge interest to our member companies.  We have used the opportunity of the past two years to share lots of the good advice and best practice that has grown in those organisations, some of whose staff were working remotely or in a hybrid manner pre-pandemic and had experience of these types of operations.  Also, in sharing that experience through member networks, we have done quite a lot of work on developing frequently asked questions and putting together toolkits for employers as to how to go about setting up a remote working policy and on the types of considerations that need to be taken into account.  It is a matter of working through how such a policy might be got up and running in the organisation.  We have been asked for a lot of advice and guidance on that.  Then it is a matter of highlighting the areas in the legislation that need to be looked out for and the areas where companies need to make sure their compliance is appropriate.<\/p><p>There is a great deal of work going on and a lot of very positive engagement for members in the context of getting good practice in place and learning from one another as to how they can best deal with the implementation of remote working.<\/p><p> Most employers feel that we have done remote working relatively well.  There are questions around productivity because we are not measuring people in the same way.  We know lots of people are not in the ideal environment to be as productive and, as a result, that has not been measured in quite the same detail.  Hybrid is very new, and the technology that requires half the people to be in a meeting room versus everybody remotely on one particular screen is different.  Sound systems and the etiquette are growing up and we are very much learning.  The management of that is a very big learning curve at the moment as well.  We are looking at how we train managers and how we put in place appropriate safeguards in order that people do not get forgotten and that they get adequate opportunity.  All of those issues need to be addressed.  There is a lot of learning going on, and some very strong engagement from members around that.<\/p><p> In response to the second question, we support the procedural element of the WRC investigations.  That is because there is a requirement for an employer under this proposed Bill to give a reasoned response.  That should, therefore, already be a matter of record which demonstrates that the employer has considered the questions, looked at their own particular circumstances within their business and addressed the issues.  We must bear in mind that there may be individual and team-related complexities that are private to other members of the team, but that an employer or section manager may need to take into account in the wider application of some of those requests.<\/p><p> I fully accept the Senator's point on the exemption for smaller organisations as to where the cut-off lies, but we suggest that for very small and microenterprises, the exemption from a legally required right to request remote working policy would alleviate it.  That is there.<\/p><p> I apologise for taking up Senator Ahearn's time, but while I have the floor, I confirm that I have opened my own responses on the lobbying register and, in response to the question Deputy Murphy asked me, I understand from my own records that there is a meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum subgroup on enterprise, trade and employment.

I know from years spent as a trade union official that codes of practice do not work when it comes to vindicating employees' rights.  That is just my experience and I thought I would put it out there.<\/p> <p>  \"Flexibility\" and \"agility\" are key words these days in terms of business, but they seem one-sided in nature.  I will give an example of that in terms of how the general scheme is currently drafted.  I echo a point my colleague, Senator Sherlock, was hoping to get a response on earlier.  Under the proposed legislation as it stands, an employee must have worked for an employer for six months before he or she can request a right to work remotely.  Employers then have three months to consider the request and can demand more elements or meetings to discuss the request further, so it would be close to a year before an employee has an answer.  Employees who want to appeal the matter to the WRC could be waiting for up to a further year.  Once the request is refused, a person is barred from making a new request for 12 months.  My question to both parties is simple.  Where is the flexibility or agility in that?  Is agility a word that we only use for employers and not for employees?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030200002#L00800","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>First and foremost, I might suggest that the code of practice on grievance and disciplinary investigations has been a fundamental pillar of our industrial relations and employment rights, so codes of practice can have a very strong impact.  Senator Gavan might agree that that one has been very effective over many years.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to agility, it is not unreasonable that an employer would say that somebody must be with them for six months in order that they have an opportunity to meet colleagues, learn the culture of an organisation and learn things that one cannot write down on how we operate, what our normal methods of engagement are and then the opportunity to have the conversation.  It is not necessarily a case that an employer cannot permit somebody with less than six months' service to work remotely.  It is a piece whereby, if an employer had somebody very new or very junior, he or she might want to make sure that they were very well versed.  For instance, when I think of some of our own team coming in, we want to be very clear that people have the training and background before we send them out to WRC cases and so on.<\/p> <p>  Senator Gavan says that an employer would then have three months.  It is not an unreasonable timeframe in which an employer would have an opportunity to answer.  I am not thinking of smaller microenterprises here, but of an employment where multiple requests might be coming in, and they must be sequenced against requests for annual leave, carer's leave, parental leave, adoptive leave, work-life balance and every other request, whether that might be for a career break, a secondment or a recruitment gap that an employer has.  Where an employer has multiple requests and larger numbers, they must sequence all of those requests adequately and appropriately and to be fair and respectful to other people within the business where roles might fall to them in the event that somebody is working remotely.  I think in particular of where somebody who is going on leave or on secondment might have supervisory duties that another requester may be required to take up for a period.

As was mentioned in our opening statement, 12 EU members states already have this legislation.  Six, including Ireland, are in the process of including it.  The others are the UK, New Zealand and Australia.<\/p> <p>  When we look at it, the vast majority of the legislation is around the right to request for all the reasons we have spoken about today.  While many people will be in jobs that have tasks that allow them to work remotely, the vast majority still need to be in the employer's premises on-site to do the job.  There are two exceptions to that.<\/p> <p>  In the last year, Finland has introduced legislation whereby employees have the right to work where they want and for the hours they want for half of their contracted hours.  The legislation addresses flexitime and the location of their work, within limits, which are the same limits we are talking about today.  It has to be done in a way that works for the business as well.  I cannot say I would like to work between midnight and 6 o'clock if I am required to be contactable by members during the working day.  Therefore, there is a balance.  Finland has gone the furthest there in half-year contracted times.  A person can choose where and when he or she wants to work within reason.  We must recognise, however, that this has been built on by generations of looking at workers' rights around flexibility.  They are not coming at this anew.  Ireland is a laggard here.  That legislation did not happen overnight.<\/p> <p>  The only other one exception is Romania where workers have the right to one day of working remotely from home.  Again, it must suit the needs of the business.  As Ms King mentioned earlier, the bricklayer still would not be entitled to it.  Those are two countries that go that bit further around the right to request.  For the vast majority of jurisdictions that are way ahead of Ireland in this regard, it is around the right to request.

I might read out the reasons for each amendment if that is the best way of doing it.  The purpose of the legislation is to give people access to their records, data and information, which, as we know, has been denied to many people for many years.  In the case of some people, this has been for their entire lifetime.  We know some people have passed away before being able to get some of this information.<\/p><p>We believe the legislation should include all possible and relevant data.  There should be no scope to leave anything out.  That applies in particular to amendment No. 1.  Amendment No. 78 is very similar to amendment No. 1.  It is to include all data, information and possible records.  There is a fear that information may be withheld.  We must acknowledge that has been the experience of people.  These amendments will strengthen the legislation.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 84 is to include all possible scenarios and situations.  Amendment No. 85 relates to all the personal data, making it more inclusive.  Amendment No. 86 relates to the time restrictions mentioned.  We do not believe the legislation should have any time restrictions for fear it might prohibit somebody accessing their records if they fall outside that timeframe.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 87, there may be times when an adoption did not actually take place but it is important that all the relevant information and data are given to the person.  Amendment No. 88 is in the same spirit as amendment No. 87.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 89, we and others believe certain information may not be disclosed.  This relates to the contact preference register.  If somebody indicates he or she does not want to contact and gives a reason, is there a possibility that reason will not be communicated to the individual?  That was the reason for proposing amendment No. 89.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 90 to 92, inclusive, are to ensure there should be no preconditions and that absolutely nothing is left out.  We believe the language we are suggesting in our amendments is much stronger.<\/p><p>The Minister might want to respond to those first because the grouping covers amendments Nos. 1, 78, and 84 to 92, inclusive.

My understanding of the intention of amendment No. 1, combined with amendment No. 90, is to include administrative records in the definition of relevant records so that such records can be safeguarded.  This is something we have given significant consideration to and there was reference to it in the pre-legislative report.  It is important to mention the legislation essentially provides that all birth, early life and care information a relevant body holds must be provided to an applicant.  That includes any such information held on any form of administrative record.  That is why we have written all these definitions so broadly.<\/p> <p>  The term \"relevant record\" does not limit the release of information under Parts 2, 3 or 4.  The term \"relevant record\" is about the safeguarding of records, which is dealt with in Part 7.  That definition of relevant record already covers any administrative record containing birth, early life, care or medical information, or information such as admissions and discharge registers, visitors' books, baptismal and confirmation records, and any other records containing personal information on the daily life of individuals.  The definition of \"relevant records\" is already very wide but, importantly, section 42 empowers the Minister to prescribe other classes of records as relevant records and bring them within the scope of the definition.  We are of the view the definition of relevant record is already extremely broad and covers everything we need it to.  However, we have the option under section 43 that will allow a future Minister to come back to this.  We have that flexibility if something is left out of the definition of relevant records.<\/p> <p>  Administrative records are very useful for understanding the overall working of mother and baby and county home institutions.  They have an historical value.  That is why section 43 empowers the Minister to prescribe relevant records.  It is envisaged these administrative records will most certainly fall within the definition set out in that section.  I am satisfied the legislation would support the inclusion of administrative records in a way that allows coherent archives of institutional records to be protected.<\/p> <p>  I hear there is some concern about the issue of administrative records.  I will ask my officials to consider if any additional detail could be included within the definition of relevant records to provide further reassurance in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#B00600","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":290,"content":"<p>There are other amendments in this group which we have not spoken to yet.

I thank the Deputy for her amendment.  This relates to the definition of illegal birth registration and use of the term \"incorrect birth registration\" within the legislation.  I am very clear and I and the Government absolutely accept that illegal birth registrations took place, and in terms of my engagement with this issue, this is how I describe them.  It is also important, speaking to the set of amendments that Deputy Cairns spoke to earlier, that we make sure as broad a number of people as possible can use the provisions of this legislation.  Our concern is if we use a definition of \"illegal birth registration\", there is a requirement to prove illegality before using that particular provision to benefit.  A person who is the subject of an incorrect birth registration as it currently stands can use this legislation.  If a person has to prove that his or her birth registration was not just incorrect but was actually illegal, that is a harder standard to prove.  That means the provision of using this legislation can apply to fewer people.  What we have always tried to do is broaden access to this legislation to let as many people as possible use the provisions of this legislation to get their information.<\/p> <p>  However, I am cognisant of the issues that have been raised about the language, so I have brought forward an amendment quite similar to Deputy Bacik's.  I asked my officials to work with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  This amendment clarifies that information leading to an incorrect birth registration was given to the General Register Office by a third party, and that information was not merely incorrect, but also false or misleading.  Therefore we have used that term and the addition of that language, that is, as a result of giving information that was false or misleading in respect of the name, to try to address that.  That is very similar to the change Deputy Bacik proposed.  I believe this addresses the concerns that have been raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#E00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":345,"content":"<p>To be clear, and I will take this with baby steps to make sure that everything is clear, we have had the list of amendments, and anyone who has proposed them has spoken to them.

Consultation with stakeholders and people who benefit from this legislation have been to the forefront of the development of the legislation.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, members engaged with a large number of groups.  I have also engaged with a large number of groups and individuals.  I continue to engage with survivor groups, adopted people and their families.  Deputy Funchion and I had a useful meeting last week with a former resident.  That was important and developed my understanding of what is needed in this area.<\/p> <p>  In the pre-legislative scrutiny report, a recommendation was made for a role for stakeholders in the implementation of the legislation.  We considered that recommendation and, on foot of that, I will put in place a stakeholder representative group.  The work of the group will be aimed at supporting the preparation for the implementation of the legislation when it is enacted.  That work will have regard to the public information campaign we have spoken about and general awareness-raising of changes being brought about by this legislation.  The proposals for the group's role, composition and relationship are being developed by my Department.  <\/p> <p>  That is not the only work we are doing in the area.  Action 1 of the 22-point action plan in response to the commission's report referred to developing a new and enhanced model of engagement and we are looking at the proposal to bring forward a special advocate for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions.  This could look at providing a well-resourced and dynamic model of representation for former residents to make sure there is a strong advocacy voice for them on a range of issues beyond the implementation of this legislation.  We know from our engagement with survivors that their priorities are multifaceted.  For some this legislation is key, while for others it is about memorialisation or the recovery of remains, which we have already discussed.  For others again it is issues around redress or education and how the history of this period is reflected.  That special advocate model could support systematic advocacy on behalf of former residents.  The longer term, resourced advocacy model addressing survivors in the myriad of ways they require and the stakeholder group we are establishing for the implementation of this legislation constitute the preferable way to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#F01200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":366,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, are physical alternatives to amendment No. 7.

That sets out the types of care arrangements that are relevant to the release of information provided for in the Bill.  It is particularly relevant to the definition of a &quot;relevant person&quot; and the categories of information that are eligible for release under the Bill.  The types of care arrangement defined in the Bill include a nursed out arrangement, a boarded out arrangement, and an arrangement under which a child was cared for by a resident of an institution, among others.<\/p><p>On the specific amendments in this group, amendment No. 7 is not one I can support.  The definition of care arrangement is a key definition and is central to the understanding of several other definitions.  This definition is expansive and seeks to ensure that a broad range of care arrangements and areas are covered.  What is being proposed by amendment No. 7 is the removal of that and this is obviously not something I can support.<\/p><p>I am also not in a position to support amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10.  They seek to alter the definition of care arrangement.  The provisions of amendment No. 8 are already covered in subsection (9) of the existing definition of care arrangement contained in the legislation, which provides for &quot;an arrangement under which a child was cared for as a resident of an institution specified in the <i>Schedule<\/i>&quot;.  We believe that part is already covered.  Amendment No. 9 is already covered by the definition of care information which provides for the release of information to anyone who made care arrangements or was a party to them.  In that context, amendment No. 9 is unnecessary.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 10 seeks to expand the definition to include care provided by a parent or guardian of the child.  I understand the spirit behind this amendment but this refers to care provided to a child by its parent, outside of the institution.  We have to be very honest about the type of information we are going to have available.  When the child is with a parent and not in an institution, there will not be records of what happened in that situation.  We must be honest with people.  We have all met survivors who have tried to get their information only to be told that the information no longer exists.  Suggesting to survivors that there is information about what happened when they were cared for by their own parents outside of an institution is problematic.  That is not information that the institution has because, by its very nature, the care was taking place outside of the institution.  We can confirm that where a child was cared for by a parent within an institution, and we know that happened in many of the mother and baby homes, that information is available because obviously it is part of the institutional records but we cannot make claims about finding and delivering information about what happened outside of these institutions.  We would be raising false hope by doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#G00800","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I understand that point and it is something that occurred to me too.  However, what we are trying to say here is that if there was a situation where a child was in a care institution, was boarded out or fostered and that did not work out and the child was sent back, it would be important that any records of that would be accessible.  That is why we are including guardians, mothers and fathers because, potentially, the child could have been boarded out with or fostered by a birth parent and then sent back to an institution.  We are trying to cover all possibilities and angles.  I know people will look at this and say that the types of situations we are trying to cover are immense and that everything is covered by the Bill.  However, when people have been consistently let down for years, if not decades, they want absolutely everything possible to be covered by this legislation to ensure that no situation is left out.  That is what we are trying to achieve here.<\/p> <p>  I understand some of the points made by the Minister.

Our belief is that the situation that Deputy Funchion just outlined is already covered by this legislation.  We know that boarded out and nursed out arrangements are two separate things.  Nursed out children were usually very young whereas boarded out children, while still young, could be seven or eight years old as opposed to a few months old.  We believe that the very comprehensive definition of care arrangement and the various types of arrangement provided for cover all of the instances that we can envisage and would have experience of from talking to survivors over the years.  At the same time, it does not raise a false or unmeetable hope that information about what happened when an adopted person or someone boarded out was in his or her own home, cared for by his or her own parent because that information just does not exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#G01000","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(f) any institution, agency, organisation or individual involved in the care of children and mothers who were separated from each other;&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#H00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 9:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(f) any institution, agency, organisation or individual involved in the separation of mothers and their children;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#H00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 10:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(f) care provided by the mother, father or guardian of the child;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>If I withdraw the amendment now, is it possible to raise it on Report Stage if we feel it needs to be revisited?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#H00600","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#H00700","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Just to clarify for people who may be watching, an amendment must be formally moved.

The problem is that we will not know until it is too late whether they are all covered.  That is really worrying.<\/p> <p>  I agree with amendment No. 26.  It would be right to delete the whole lot.  All the amendments in the group are relevant and important.  They reflect the information it is felt has to be included in the section to ensure all the information and all of the options are covered.  Information is vital for adopted people.  Their whole lives are lived with a lack of information.  Amendment No. 29 refers to letters, cards or other materials placed in an adoption file by the relevant person's father or other relatives.  It states people should have access to this information.  Clearly there have been instances where people have not been given this information.  This is why the amendment has been tabled.  It is directly from experiences that people have had.  Amendment No. 30 refers to letters, cards or other material placed in the adoption file by the relevant person's mother.

The definition provided on page 10 of the Bill sets out the various types of information relating to a relevant person's life from birth to 18 years that are eligible to be released under the legislation.  It is not an exhaustive list but it provides clear and consistent guidance on the type of information that has to be released in all cases, which is what we are achieving with the Bill.  It is an expansive definition.  It covers many different types of information, including, among many other examples, any religious ceremony that may have taken place, whether a relevant person has had vaccinations, any record of a person's physical or emotional development and whether the mothers of persons stayed with them in an institution for any length of time.<\/p><p>I cannot accept the amendment because it proposes to delete the definition of early life information, which is a key definition that ensures essential personal histories are captured and released.  The fact that the word \"includes\" precedes the list of types of information that may be on record makes it clear that it is an expansive and not a restrictive definition.<\/p><p> I cannot support amendment No. 27, which proposes to delete the reference to section 2(2).  That is important because it looks at the reference to that subsection.  The function of the reference in the section is to define the period of time during which the definitions of care information and early life information apply, and it is included for accuracy and precision in drafting.  This amendment deletes the particular reference entirely, but it does not offer any substitute or alternative.  That would have the consequence of extending the period until the relevant person is 18 years old, but that amendment would have no practical effect as there would be no records in relation to care information or early life information that would extend past that cut-off point, because once a person is adopted or the persons named as his or her parents in a false or incorrect registration assume the role of parents, there would no longer be any records held by public bodies because the person would no longer be with a public body but with his or her adoptive or non-adoptive parents.<\/p><p> I have spoken about this with the officials.  We do not support this amendment in respect of the reference to section 2(2).  I am advised that under grouping 11, amendment No. 102, seeks to delete section 2(2), and I have asked my officials to review the potential benefits to individuals of amending that particular section.  In the context of amendment No. 102, we will look to see if there is something we can do to provide additional clarity.  That is what I have been advised in respect of amendment No. 27.<\/p><p> To address the extensive list of points that have been raised in amendments Nos. 28 to 63, inclusive, we are not accepting the amendments because we believe all of these issues, bar a small number that I will speak to at the end, are already covered within the definitions that we have provided under this legislation, either under the definition of early life information or the definitions of birth, care and medical information.  Amendments Nos. 45, 48, 50, 51, 54 and 56 to 59, inclusive, are explicitly provided for under early life.  Amendments Nos. 41 and 47 are clearly covered under care information.  Amendments Nos. 32, 33, 36, 37, 42 to 44, inclusive, and 61 are explicitly covered under our definition of birth information.  Amendments Nos. 28 to 30, inclusive, are captured under the term \"provided items\".  Amendments Nos. 52 to 55, inclusive, are provided for under both medical information and early life information.

Deputy Funchion was making points on a good-faith gesture regarding the acceptance of amendments.  We have made significant changes between the publication of the pre-legislative scrutiny report and the final Bill.  I have already indicated that I will ask officials to review some of the points Deputies made where I feel they are legitimate.  I have made proposals that I feel, particularly in terms of illegal birth registration, respond to issues Deputies have raised.  Others have asked whether their list of amendments cannot just be accepted if we are all trying to cover what is roughly the same material.  The definitions we have in the Bill have been carefully fine tuned in accordance with engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General.  Every word has been considered and thought through, and we have examined previous legislation that did not get passed.  The provisions have been expanded to make sure they are as inclusive as possible.  The definitions of \"birth information\", \"early life information\" and \"medical information\" have all been planned and designed in a very specific way to work across all the various sections of the legislation.<\/p> <p>  I accept the point Deputy Pringle was making on the dissatisfaction of adopted people and others in seeking access to information previously, and that is why this legislation is being considered.  I have two points on the question of whether people can have confidence in Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  First, my Department is leading the implementation group.  It is being led by Ms Laura McGarrigle, the assistant secretary in this area.  It brings together our Department, Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland with a view to changing the culture in organisations in the sense of making it very clear that the presumption is one of the release of information.  I accept that has not happened in the past.  This legislation is to give very clear legal grounding for always releasing information but there has to be a culture change.  My Department is leading that through the implementation body.  I have discussed the required change to organisational culture in the past three weeks with the chief executive of Tusla, Mr. Bernard Gloster, who firmly believes in it.  Whenever he was before this committee, he was very clear on it.  I have also discussed the matter with the chairperson of the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  Irrespective of whether the change of culture is clear, the Minister has the power, under various sections of this legislation, to issue specific guidelines on how the release of information can be understood by the relevant bodies.  The cultural changes we are trying to achieve in the agencies and the specific guideline-writing power give us an opportunity to continue to ensure the categories we already argue are very broad can continue to be interpreted in an expansive way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#Q00500","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>When we know there are really ingrained cultural attitudes within an institution, body or Department, it will not just be enough to have a chat with the head of the organisation in the hope it will change.

What Deputy Cairns said is right.  There is a need for cultural change.  It has to happen at some point, and something has to start it off.  I am still worried about the period in which cultural change is to take place in that adopted people could be left behind or something could happen.  I do not know the solution or the best that can be achieved for anybody in this regard.  As is evident from the number of amendments suggested by the bodies acting on behalf of adopted people, a big task needs to be done.  It may require a leap of faith by everybody to ensure it is done.  I hope it happens.  The best way is to give all the information because there should not be anything hidden.

They seek to alter or expand the definitions of \"genetic relative\" and \"genetic relative information\" contained in the Bill.  These definitions were carefully considered in consultation with the Attorney General and the Data Protection Commissioner.  The definition of genetic relative is central to information release in two key ways.  First, it relates to the release of the medical information of a genetic relative where the information is necessary for the maintenance of a relevant person's health; and second, to the release of correspondence between a relevant body or secondary information source and the genetic relative of a relevant person.  It also relates to information pertaining to any visit a genetic relative may have made to a relevant person under the definition of early life information.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 65 seeks to extend that definition of a genetic relative to include grandchildren.  However, this is not relevant or necessary in any scenario where this definition applies.  For example, a record will not hold the medical information of a relevant person's grandchild and they will have corresponded with relevant bodies in relation to that person.  There is no way that someone who was in an institution up to the age of 18 will have had a letter from their grandchild because their grandchild would not have been born at that stage.  This is therefore an unnecessary amendment.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 66, the current definition of a genetic relative already sufficiently covers this, especially with regard to the reasons for defining a genetic relative within the legislation.  It is highly unlikely that a relative beyond a parent, sibling, grandparent, aunt, uncle or cousin would have visited or corresponded with a relevant person.  This is also relevant as regards access to medical information of a genetic relative, as it is highly unlikely that information pertaining to anyone beyond the list provided under the definition would exist within records or would be medically relevant and necessary for the maintenance of a relevant person's health.  This amendment is also unnecessary.<\/p> <p>  It is important to emphasise that both these amendments, Nos. 65 and 66, could jeopardise the release of a genetic relative's information to a relevant person if the definition ended up containing vague or unsupported categories of relatives, as it would not meet the necessity and proportionality test that releasing the personal sensitive data of a genetic relative to a third party would involve. <\/p> <p>  I cannot support the list of information suggested under amendments Nos. 67 and 69 as the name of the genetic relative and their potential status as an adopted person is their own personal data and not the personal data of the relevant person.  This was confirmed by the Data Protection Commissioner when appearing before the committee.  The other suggested additions under this amendment, namely, sex of siblings and position within the family order, are already provided for under the existing definition of a genetic relative.<\/p> <p>  I cannot support amendment No. 68.  Where this information is contained within a file, it will be released under the current definition of genetic relative information.  However, there cannot be a guarantee that this information is accessible and available on all files, as it is totally dependent on a person's position within the family order and whether siblings existed at the time of the record's creation.  I therefore cannot guarantee its release in all cases.  However, the database of the commission of investigation, which created a single record of a mother and her children and which we protected under legislation passed in 2020, should be helpful in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#S00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 66:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(d) a blood relative of a person whether the relationship is of the whole blood or half blood,&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#S00500","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":519,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 67:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(b) the sex of the genetic relative;<br \/><br \/>(c) the name of the genetic relative;<br \/><br \/>(d) the nature of the relationship of the genetic relative to the person;<br \/><br \/>(e) whether the genetic relative was adopted;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#S00700","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":521,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 68:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(i) the number of genetic siblings,&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#S00900","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":523,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 69:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(iii) the name(s) of the genetic sibling(s),<br \/><br \/>(iv) whether the genetic sibling(s) is\/are older or younger than the person,<br \/><br \/>(v) whether the genetic sibling(s) was\/were adopted;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#S01100","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":525,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":526,"content":"<p>We are due to finish at 8.30 p.m. so I propose that, having dealt with that group of amendments, we adjourn and resume our next meeting with amendment No. 70.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#S01300","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 8.28 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 8 March 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health","time":1646179200,"counter":529},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 09:30<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 09:30<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Colm Burke, Frances Black, David Cullinane, Martin Conway, Pa Daly, Se\u00e1n Kyne.

I thank them for the invitation to meet the Joint Committee on Health and the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health to discuss the governance and clinical oversight of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Kerry.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Michael Fitzgerald, chief officer for the Cork Kerry community healthcare organisation; Mr. Jim Ryan, head of mental health operations; Dr. Maura Young, executive clinical director for Kerry mental health services; and Dr. Amanda Burke, child and adolescent consultant psychiatrist and executive clinical director for Galway Roscommon mental health services.<\/p> <p>  The report on the Look-Back Review into Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in south Kerry, also referred to as the Maskey report, was published on 26 January 2022.  The look-back review was formally commissioned by the chief officer for the Cork Kerry community healthcare organisation, CHO, in April 2021, following an audit of case files in south Kerry CAMHS after concerns were raised about the clinical practice of a non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD.  The purpose of the look-back review was to consider potential issues relating to the clinical practice of the NCHD with regard to prescribing, care planning, diagnostics and clinical supervision in south Kerry CAMHS.  In line with our procedures for dealing with serious incidents, this review was conducted in accordance with the HSE incident management framework 2020 and the HSE look-back review process guideline 2015.  The review team was led by Dr. Se&aacute;n Maskey, CAMHS consultant with the Maudsley Hospital in London.  Dr. Maskey and his team reviewed clinical records of close to 1,500 children and young people who had attended south Kerry CAMHS between 1 July 2016 and 19 April 2021.  A helpline was established in April 2021 to provide advice and support to families affected by the look-back review and it remains open.  Through this helpline, families can access information, free counselling support and schedule appointments with clinical support teams. <\/p> <p>  The Maskey report identified a number of deficits in respect of governance, supervision and oversight, clinical practice and administrative processes within the south Kerry CAMHS team.  These deficits are deeply regrettable and were contributing factors to the substandard care received by the 240 children, young people and their families.  On behalf of the HSE, I wish to reiterate our sincere apologies to all those who have experienced deficits in the services they have received.  Our aim at all times is to provide these children, young people and their families with safe and effective services and with every possible support and reassurance.  <\/p> <p>  Cork Kerry CHO has taken immediate action to ensure appropriate governance, clinical leadership and supervision within south Kerry CAMHS.  The objective remains to secure a permanent consultant psychiatrist and, in the interim, measures have been put in place to ensure clinical governance and leadership.  A consultant psychiatrist is on site two days per week with additional support provided remotely three days per week.  In line with recommendations in the Maskey report concerning telemedicine, a consultant psychiatrist will provide three evening clinics per week remotely from Dublin, while a pilot involving a consultant registered with the Irish Medical Council, based outside of the EU, is also under way. <\/p> <p>  The HSE has taken a range of actions to address the findings of the Maskey report and we are committed to ensuring full implementation of its 35 recommendations.  Together with the chief clinical officer, I will chair a national oversight group to oversee, monitor and report on our implementation of the Maskey report.  This oversight group will have a strong service user focus.  It will operate in a fully transparent manner and progress reports will be publicly available.<\/p> <p>  Cork Kerry CHO has already identified supports for children and young people affected in south Kerry CAMHS and, in addition, is standing up a dedicated clinical liaison support team, which will provide key worker and case manager services to children and young people affected.  This team will consult with families to determine how to best meet identified needs, taking into consideration the full range of health services, including specialist mental health services.  The clinical liaison support team will also identify other appropriate services in the community, as well as services available from private service providers that can support the children, young people and their families.  <\/p> <p>  While the scope of the look back review is confined to practices in south Kerry CAMHS, I appreciate that the Maskey report can give rise to concern among children, young people and families who avail of services provided by CAMHS teams in other parts of the country.  In order to provide assurance to families who need our services, the HSE&rsquo;s national oversight group will be commissioning an independently chaired review of medication practice across all CAMHS teams.  The national oversight group will also commission an audit of compliance with operational guidelines as well as a qualitative study of how those who use, work in and refer to CAMHS experience those services.  Information from the planned national audits will guide our continued efforts to enhance youth mental health services.  <\/p> <p>  There has been a significant investment in CAMHS over a number of years to meet increased demand and to improve services for children and young people with mental health difficulties.  Within the past six years, &euro;22.6 million of development funding has been directed to enhance CAMHS.  Since 2013, an additional 18 CAMHS teams have been established and close to 300 additional whole-time equivalent posts added to our workforce.  There are currently 73 multidisciplinary CAMHS teams in place providing important assessment and treatment services.  Alongside these targeted enhancements of capacity in our CAMHS teams, we have invested in telehealth, eating disorder teams and inpatient care.<\/p><p>Importantly, we have also invested in services such as Jigsaw and primary care psychology for children and young people with mild to moderate mental health difficulties who do not need to access the specialist mental health services that CAMHS provide.  The improvement of youth mental health services will continue to be a key priority for the HSE as we continue to implement the recommendations set out in Sharing the Vision - A Mental Health Policy for Everyone.<\/p><p> I once again take the opportunity to apologise on behalf of the HSE to the children, young people and families whose care, as outlined in the Maskey report, did not meet the standards it should have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022030200002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I intend to proceed with the meeting in ten-minute slots.

I was the national director for mental health until my role was reconfigured at the end of 2017.  I was the national director of mental health until 31 December 2017.  At that time, the structures in the HSE were very different.  There were siloed structures which comprised a mental health division, a primary care division, etc.  It was certainly of benefit at that time.  However, from my personal experience I would say it led to other challenges.  At that time, some of the challenges we were starting to encounter were challenges of integration.  Even at the time - in 2017 and heading in 2018 - there was a risk that a siloed approach to mental health was becoming an issue.  For example, we invested in primary care psychology.  The first course for anybody who is experiencing a mental health difficulty needs to be in primary care.  The specialist mental health services are exactly that.  Having a national director does not fit with an integrated approach to service delivery.<\/p> <p>  In other fora, we discuss with many of the members issues such as Sl&aacute;intecare, regional health areas, RHAs, and an integrated approach to care.  That is far more important.  It is more about looking at the functions.  There is much discussion about a national director for mental health.

I want to move away from Kerry, in one sense.  Having looked at the HSE look-back review process guidelines, it seems to me that they were followed and the system works in that sense.  The introduction of Dr. Maskey to carry out an independent review seemed also to have followed best practice.  He is a consultant based not in Ireland but in London, as outlined in the report and as we know.  There was a certain degree of independence in regard to the report carried out so good service was done.

She noted that the HSE also appreciates that the Maskey report can give rise to concern among children, young people and their families who avail of services provided by CAMHS teams in other parts of the country.  In order to deal with that and provide assurances to them, the HSE's national oversight group will commission an independently chaired review of medication practices across all CAMHS teams.  Ms O'Connor told us that Dr. Colette Halpin is to be the chair of that group.  On a brief perusal, and I am not casting any aspersions on Dr. Halpin who seems to have a very good curriculum vitae as a consultant child psychiatrist, she was involved in Offaly CAMHS at one stage.  As a layperson and public representative, I would like to have seen the Maskey model followed and someone without any involvement in CAMHS being appointed.  I ask Ms O'Connor to comment on that presently.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Connor also stated that the oversight group will commission an audit of compliance with operational guidelines.  Will she talk me through the prescribing and medication audit that is proposed?  Many children who turn up to CAMHS would be referred to CAMHS with many different presenting issues.  It could be self-harm, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, or mental health intellectual disabilities, MHID.  That is quite a broad range of complex needs.

According to its opening statement:<\/p> <blockquote> \t...a consultant is clinically independent and retains overall responsibility for the care of...[any] patient.  While a consultant psychiatrist may consult, and frequently does, with other members of the multidisciplinary team with regard to aspects of a patient's treatment including involuntary detention, [or] any legal requirement to do, it poses a risk to patient safety, undermines the contractual responsibility of the consultant and blurs the lines of accountability.  <\/blockquote> <p>What is being talked about there is something very specific, but it is instructive of a kind of reticence or concern around the role of consultants when making decisions on patient care.  I ask for comments on the fact that we currently now have a team, or it seems to me the representatives have outlined that there is a team, where it is not clear that the consultant is in charge or has full reporting responsibility from every single discipline on that team and yet, in practical terms, that is what is happening on the ground.

I ask for a comment on that implication.  Are there any cases where consultants are in a situation where the overmedication of children is a regular occurrence?  I am looking at the notes from the reports of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health in 2018, which referenced a 2011 report from Mental Health Reform that showed there were:<\/p> <blockquote> \tsignificant gaps in primary care provision, [a] dominance of medication as a treatment option, [a] lack of referral options for GPs...[for] counselling, [for] psychotherapy...[a lack of] family therapy or Community...Health Teams [and] Continued use of Emergency Departments as access points for mental health services  <\/blockquote> <p>It seems we are probably living in a system where consultants, or whomever, have little option but to medicate because other services are not available.

As far back as 2015, he has asked various Ministers for Health parliamentary questions about the kind of malpractice we are now dealing with, such as the overmedication of children.  Last April, specifically, he asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, to &quot;order a...review of the use and overuse of psychiatric medication in children across all CAMHS...services&quot; and in particular to review the way chronic understaffing of CAMHS, and a complete failure to resource primary care, was leading to overmedication.  Deputy Boyd Barrett says the Minister passed this review off to the HSE, which apparently brushed off the request for review.  That goes back to April 2021.  Did the Minister pass this request for review to HSE management?  What was its response to that?  Those are two very specific questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022030200002#G01600","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I will start and Dr. Burke will respond to the issue of the medication of children.  On CAMHS in general, it might be argued that mental health has been lucky in that we have had A Vision for Change for many years now, which has set a blueprint for the delivery of services that is based on multidisciplinary team working.  With this growth, especially in CAMHS, and we have to remember CAMHS came from a certain place of a child guidance model, etc., we have sought through the development funding in mental health to develop those multidisciplinary supports, including our OTs, social workers, psychology, speech and language therapists and, in some cases, dieticians for eating orders, etc.  However, as I said, we must remember that CAMHS is a very specialist mental health service and, in reality, we have prioritised early intervention.<\/p><p>This came from work that was done by the youth mental health task force a number of years ago.  We have been prioritising the early intervention supports for children because we know that early intervention is the most important thing in terms youth mental health.  This means having other organisations and working with our funded partners to provide supports to children earlier in their pathway of care and to provide supports, for example, in primary care.  <\/p><p> Most children who present with a mental health difficulty attend their GP in the first instance.  The priority is for the GP to have somewhere to send that child for support and that might not be a CAMHS service.  A very small percentage of children attend a CAMHS service; many more attend other supports that are at the lower level of the pyramid in terms of how we provide our services.  <\/p><p> Multidisciplinary care is essential.  We have increased the number of teams but, equally, we have increased the numbers of those different disciplines across the team.  We sought to invest in all of those multidisciplinary supports since the development funding started in 2011.  We have seen significant increases in those areas.  We will continue to do that and, certainly, in line with the ongoing implementation of Sharing the Vision, we will continue to invest in multidisciplinary care.  Consultants and doctors are a key part and, as Dr. Young said, they are critical in terms of diagnosis, agreeing the care plan and, ultimately, prescribing, where it is relevant.  However, as Dr. Burke said earlier, many children who attend CAMHS are not prescribed medication; they receive other interventions.  I might ask Dr. Burke to comment on the medicating of children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022030200002#G01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":739,"content":"<p>It is important to differentiate between the over-mediation of children and medicating in the absence of psychological intervention.  They are different things.  A psychiatrist taking a history from a young person will always view the case in terms of biological, which is the medication piece, and also in terms of the psychological and the social piece.  A doctor would not prescribe for a child without the parts.  They would not be done in isolation.  However, we sometimes have challenges with psychological intervention.  The vast majority of psychiatrists would also have pursued other studies in psychological interventions and would be therapy-trained.  I do not want people to go away thinking that the only tool that psychiatrists have is medication.  We think long and hard before we put any child on medication.  Individual teams would have checks and balances in terms of medicating.  It is not just part of a national audit; we audit ourselves.  Individual teams audit themselves.  Good practice would have multidisciplinary team meetings every week.  Even though the consultant lead may not see every single person on the team, they would be part of the discussions.  As Dr. Young said, they would sign off on the care plan for that individual.  We never prescribe medication without looking at the other aspects for these young people.  However, we have challenges in terms of psychological therapies.  We also have waiting lists, which we are trying to work on.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to point out that as evidence base for treatments builds in, there are more and more specialist evidence-based and evidence-informed treatments.  It is difficult to provide them everywhere.  The evidence base for psychological therapies is for experienced practitioners who see people a lot with particular conditions and with fidelity to the model.  In every generic CAMHS team, one may not be able to see that number of people or have those experienced practitioners.  That is why, as part of the quality improvement and service development, we have been looking at the clinical programmes and developing hub-and-spoke models for these more specialised treatments, so that we can have fidelity to the model and specific clinical guidelines-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022030200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Amanda Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":740,"content":"<p>Can I interrupt, please?

We have spoken an awful lot about the governance of CAMHS in south Kerry.  I want to touch on probably the most important people, who are the children.  I travelled to Tralee a few weeks ago and met parents and their children on the issues in south Kerry.  Their stories are absolutely heartbreaking.  I am going to relay one of them in as generic a fashion as possible so as not to give away the identity of the child, with the permission of the child and her parents.  This child is now 16 years of age.  In primary school, she showed some mild forms of anxiety after being subjected to bullying.  Her parents and the school put things in place and then she thrived.<\/p> <p>  Outside the primary school, she was enthusiastic and eager to take part in extracurricular activities but she was nervous about the prospect of going from primary school to secondary school, as a lot of children are.  She started getting anxious again in the last few weeks of her summer holidays over the prospect of a new uniform, new people, a new school and new surroundings.  During the transition from primary school to secondary school, she started to suffer from panic attacks and her GP made a referral to north Kerry CAMHS.  She had just turned 14 at this stage in 2019.  She was immediately put on Prozac and melatonin.  This is returning to what was said earlier about other treatments being undertaken in conjunction with medication.  Her parents immediately asked what other treatments were available and she was put on a long waiting list for cognitive behavioural therapy.<\/p> <p>  On the third visit to the CAMHS, her medication was increased.  She was turning into a virtual recluse.  Her parents reported, as did the girl herself when I met her, that she started losing her personality and her smile, which was heartbreaking to see.  She was having trouble sleeping and was prescribed a sleeping tablet.  This sleeping tablet was Tevaquel, which the young girl found out by reading the leaflet is an anti-psychotic medication.  As I said, her personality went and she started losing touch with reality.<\/p> <p>  In February 2021, she was moved from north Kerry CAMHS to south Kerry CAMHS, where she had her first interaction with Dr. Sharma, who, as we know, is the whistleblower.  He immediately took her off the medication she was prescribed.  In his professional opinion, she was on the wrong medication.  Her parents, like any parents, including me, trust medical experts when it comes to the care of our children.  I must say the trust in CAMHS among parents and children is now at an all-time low.  I deal with this issue every day of the week.  This girl's parents reported that their daughter had missed many opportunities in life because of being over-medicated or misdiagnosed.  Her parents then received a letter from the HSE - from Mr. Fitzgerald, in fact.  I have it in front of me.  Mr. Fitzgerald mentioned he has a team working with him but this is one of the most badly written letters I have ever seen.  It is littered with spelling mistakes.  It was very disappointing for the parents to receive this letter.  Spelling mistakes aside, this letter stated that on review of her files, there was no adverse outcome or issue of concern.  This was one of the 1,332 files that were reviewed by CAMHS and this girl is not one of the 227 who have been deemed at risk of harm nor is she one of the 46 children placed at a risk of significant harm.  Did the CAMHS team actually sit down, meet and have a conversation with any of the parents or children prior to sending out these letters?  Was that a part of the review?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022030200002#J01600","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":781,"content":"<p>Part of the review was a file review on each of the cases during that period of time and from that file review it was identified that 240 children, some of whom are now young adults, were at risk of harm or significant harm.

Each meeting was set up or offered to the families or to the young adults to discuss with them, in detail, the findings of the file review and also to discuss where they were with regard to services.  Some of those people came back into service once again while others required or requested more follow through.  The files for the cases to which the Deputy is referring were considered by Dr. Maskey and his team.

Are there any plans to go back and rectify this so that the voices of these children and their parents can be heard?  To get a letter like the one the family received, having been through so much heartbreak and trauma while trying to get the best possible care for their daughter, was not acceptable.

We are talking about a very broad range of complex needs and in that context, I am interested in how the audit will work.  I understand that it will be an independent, random sample audit of a proportion of the caseload and I am interested in the finer details.  It is vitally important that confidence is rebuilt and parents are reassured.  Will it work in the same way as the audit in Kerry, where red flags were raised and a full look-back of files was commissioned, resulting in the Maskey report?  Why narrow the scope of the review?  Should the aim not be to conduct as thorough a review as possible?  If there are problems on a wider scale, how will narrowing the scope of the review identify the issues and what needs to be fixed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022030200002#K01500","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":796,"content":"<p>I will start on that question.  As we said earlier, the focus of the audit will be in line with the Maskey report and its recommendations and in line with our expert clinical advice.  We have spent a lot of time considering this.  Myself and the chief clinical officer have had many meetings with clinical leaders and others in the organisation and the expert clinical advice remains that the design and scope of the audit should focus on the prescribing practice for ADHD.  That is what we are focused on in terms of the use of medication.  However, as I said earlier, the key challenge for us is to identify the standard criteria against which we would be carrying out that audit.  That does not exist here.  We cannot just pick something off a shelf and do an audit against those criteria.  That work is being developed.  There has been a lot of work going on to determine how that will be.<\/p> <p>  The other point that I would make, although Dr. Burke might be better qualified than me to comment on this, is that a lot of prescribing for children in respect of depression and anxiety happens through GPs in the first instance.  There are many children on medication which has not been prescribed by CAMHS teams.  Once we get into the broader prescribing landscape, we get into a whole range of complexities.  We are starting with the ADHD audit but as that audit progresses, if flags emerge in respect of prescribing practices we will look at it in more detail.  <\/p> <p>  As I also said earlier, the plans around this audit will go the national oversight group tomorrow afternoon, which is the scheduled first meeting of that group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022030200002#K01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":797,"content":"<p>In the opening statement today, reference was made to the HSE's primary care services for children and young people and to Jigsaw services.

I thank the chief operating officer for highlighting that Mr. Fitzgerald took up his role in 2020.  I acknowledge the awful findings to emerge from this report.  It is important that we have people of experience, including a psychiatrist with an eminent reputation, managing the report that has come out.  I hope it will be managed in a swift way because we need to see actions now.  I thank Dr. Amanda Burke from CHO 2, which covers counties Galway, Roscommon and Mayo, who is also on the call. <\/p> <p>  I will pose my questions to Ms O'Connor and Dr. Burke.  We in the west are always fighting for investment in our CHOs and primary care services.  The challenge in rural areas is that we cannot get multidisciplinary teams because we do not have centres of excellence.  When trying to encourage the recruitment of psychiatrists and other high-profile experts in health care, the challenge is that they want to be based in Dublin, Galway or Limerick city centres.  How do we get those experts and make change to ensure centres of excellence are spread around regional areas?  In that way, we would develop training around multidisciplinary teams that will be in place to support the recruitment of key roles.  I believe the challenges with recruitment are one of the real reasons we are seeing the awful impacts on families and children highlighted in this report.  This has always been an issue and is currently an issue in the HSE.  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  Are there ways to streamline the recruitment process to get key people into position quicker when we identify them?  When I worked with people in the HSE I learned a great word, which I have mentioned before, namely, \"backfill\".  How do we manage when we cannot put a person into a position because he or she is already in a position somewhere else?  This needs to be tackled.  I put those questions to Ms O'Connor and Dr. Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022030200002#O00400","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":862,"content":"<p>Before I hand over to Dr. Burke, I will address the point made by the Senator about recruitment in rural areas.  Across the board, whether it is in our mental health services or acute hospital services, we are very challenged at times to get people to move into specialist services when they are not close to the big teaching hospitals.  We have seen that in this case and, unfortunately, we see it in a number of specialty areas.  This is a challenge we have in the system.  We must look at how we can work differently.  Telehealth has certainly supported this across a range of specialties, particularly building on the Covid experience.  There is an onus on us to work differently.<\/p> <p>  There is also an onus around the broader recruitment piece.  We have initiated a lot of work in the past 18 months with the Public Appointments Service, PAS, which carries out our consultant recruitment, to improve that process.  We are working very closely with PAS, which has put in place significant changes and great additionality in respect of recruitment capacity to speed up that process.  The Senator is absolutely right that we can identify people and yet it can take a very long time.<\/p> <p>  One of the key challenges too is that we must stop thinking about consultants in isolation.  Advertising for a consultant post on its own is no longer enough.  We must, in effect, sell the whole service.  For example, when establishing a new team that is funded through development funding, we would promote that as a team so that a consultant coming in knows that he or she has people around them.  One consultant on his or her own cannot deliver everything that we ask in the absence of having a team.  I will ask Dr. Burke to comment also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022030200002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":863,"content":"<p>Whether it is the Saolta University Health Care Group or in the Limerick and Kerry areas, we also need areas of excellence for advanced nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists within our hospitals.

Unless we have that expertise in each of our hospitals, we will not be able to develop that sort of regional expertise that would feed into those other roles.<\/p> <p>  With regard to ehealth and investment in technology to support the telehealth aspects, is it feasible to have an electronic patient record that will integrate primary care and the hospital network?

It is not about denuding - quite the opposite.  I will talk about our own area for the purposes of illustration.  We brought in a CAMHS connect model.  Essentially, this is to do exactly what the Senator described, namely, connecting all of our different pieces of the model.  Centres of excellence can be everywhere.  They tend to be in our urban centres.  It is important to recognise that most of the serious mental illness happens late in adolescence, and is now happening to young people into their early 20s.  These young people tend to be in urban centres attached to universities.  This is an important first point.<\/p> <p>  Consultants and consultant teams prefer to work in teams.  It is much easier to recruit to our urban centres.  As I said, the evidence base for treatments is around people who do treatments a lot.  Sometimes we do not have patient cohorts.  For example, if we take psychosis, one would only see a small number of those patients in a community mental health team in any particular year.  To get the real expertise to look after these people one needs to have a centre of excellence.  One can then provide to the spokes, and consultation into the spokes, via a combination of e-mental health and in person services.  Nobody is saying that e-mental health is a complete solution.  We are talking about an adjunct.  Certainly, the feedback we have received from young people as regards relationships is that we might see them face-to-face for the first appointment in an urban centre and then continue the appointments with e-mental health solutions.  They might also have a key worker in the local community supporting them.<\/p> <p>  We need to look at our clinical care programmes, for example, for deliberate self-harm, early intervention in psychosis and eating disorder programmes, in the context of a hub and spoke model going forward.<\/p><p>I would like to see more qualified advanced nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists working and supporting the network of teams there.

We all agree that this has been a terrible neglect or hurt of many children in south Kerry.  We all know that as boys and girls grow into men and women and their bodies change physically, many have mental health problems.  I regret what seems to have been happening in many instances, which I believe was going on beyond the numbers we have heard about since the report came out.  It seems as though what happened was that drugs were pumped into these lovely children, which greatly changed their personalities.  It slowed them down and could have had the effect of increasing their weight.  Their personalities totally change and they stop smiling.  I have seen it over the years.  It has happened in greater numbers in the past five years in south Kerry.  It is not acceptable.  We need more psychologists to talk to these young people.  They need to get time, rather than being given injections and being sent out the door.<\/p> <p>  There is a question of compensation for all the children affected.  I do not think they can ever be adequately compensated for what has been done to their lives over so many years.  It is terrible.  What will happen from today onwards?  Children are developing mental health issues, if that is the term, and they have to be seen to today by psychiatrists.  I still worry and am not satisfied that we will have a system in place where someone is looking over the shoulder of the person who is meting out the medication or whatever it is to ensure that these people get back on track.  There must be some control.  To think that someone was doing that work for four or five whole years and let so many people down.  The parents and the children did nothing at all wrong.  On whose instructions did this locum doctor think he was doing right?  There should have been a review of what he was doing on a weekly basis, if not even daily.  People only get one chance on this earth.  If they fail and go down on themselves it is very hard to bring them back up.  We have to ensure that some better structures are put in place.  In addition to psychiatrists, should we also have more psychologists?  Mental health issues can be helped by talking to people.  That is what psychologists do.  Do we have enough of those and will there be enough of them?  <\/p> <p>  From today on, how will we deal better with this than we have done?  I cannot understand why we cannot get a senior consultant.  But even then, I do not think one consultant is enough.  I heard Ms O'Connor say that there should be a team but we have to ensure that there is.  While we hear of massive sums being allocated to the Department of Health in the budget each year, it does not manifest itself in the treatment of mental health, or at least down in Kerry anyway; let every person who is representing other counties talk about their own counties.  <\/p> <p>  The structures by which this went on for five years are totally wrong.<\/p><p>I believe, and have believed since my father's time, that when the regional health boards were in place, there was more interaction with doctors and consultants.  If there was a local issue, like this one, in community care or primary care, it was discussed around the table and sorted out.  There does not seem to be the accountability that is needed.  What assurances can the witnesses give that from here on, we will have a proper service to deal with these mental health issues that develop in young people?  I ask that they ensure, without delay, that proper compensation is made available to these people whose lives have been totally ruined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022030200002#Q02800","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646179200,"counter":938,"content":"<p>I will give a general view and Mr. Fitzgerald can come in then.  We are fully committed to implementing the recommendations in this report.  We accept them in full and will do everything we can to ensure that we develop a better service for everybody, particularly the people in south Kerry.  From our perspective, there are many considerations with regard to how we deliver our services on foot of this and the three pieces of work we are embarking on will help inform our thinking further.  The Deputy asked for assurances that we will have the service we all wish for.  While we will do everything we can on that, there is a very real challenge with workforce availability at this time.  There are growing numbers of people and doctors in training.  There are more CAMHS-qualified consultants coming out this year than ever and we are investing in more nursing and so on.  There is a finite resource available and our challenge is in making the best use of the resource available to us as we seek to develop our services and implement Sharing the Vision, which is the policy to which we are all working.

It has been a real concern since this started to unfold and throughout the look-back process.  I have been chairing those meetings weekly.  Last Friday, I met with a group representing the families.  It was a hugely constructive meeting from my perspective.  I hope it was of support and benefit to them.  It is one of many and we will continue to work with them on this.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's direct question on the children affected who need further supports, we will be setting up a clinical support liaison team who will work with individual families and the individuals themselves, if they wish to do so.  I will be writing to the families involved about that.  This team will work with them as key workers to support them and advocate on their behalf with regard to services and will ensure, where it is at all possible, that we provide them with those services in a timely manner.  That is an important piece and I made that commitment to the representative group we met last Friday.  I hope to write to the families on it later this week.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the oversight regarding what happened and why it went on for so long.  Dr. Maskey's report looks at that in great detail.  We heard earlier that the supervision of the NCHD was more for the NCHD to take up rather than it being a necessity for the person to do so.  That was a key issue and there are huge learnings in that for all services.  The children concerned will continue to be our focus.  They will continue to be at the centre of this and we will continue to work with them through the clinical support team, which will be place from Monday next.  That will ensure we can match them to the right services and, where at all possible, provide those services to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022030200002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":940,"content":"<p>To follow on from those questions, we heard about the challenges of getting expertise for these multidisciplinary teams.

That is one of the questions people will be asking.  Will we have similar problems, such as lack of full teams in some cases, or teams that are broken and not really delivering for those children?

Ultimately, that is what is really important here.  It is a matter of people's experience of our services and whether they feel the services are having a positive impact on their health.  That piece of work will be very informative but the hard edge will be the audit piece in throwing up any issues in all our teams.  I would love to say that I do not think we have these problems in other areas but in the absence of some of that hard evidence I cannot be sure and the audits will give us that.  Those three pieces of work on which we are embarking will give us the assurance that we cannot definitively have here today.  We have excellent services and some very committed and hardworking staff.  We have a very highly qualified workforce in our mental health services and it is important for them that we have this assurance because people turning up today or tomorrow to mental health services need to know they are getting a service that is really going to make a difference to their lives.

I want to reassure people that in the vast majority of teams there is robust governance around prescription of medication.  It is not arbitrary whether somebody can go to supervision or not.  In fact, if somebody is on a training scheme, he or she will not be signed off as a competent doctor unless there is documentary evidence of weekly supervision from a consultant colleague.<\/p> <p>  Standard practice would be that an non-consultant hospital doctor would only prescribe under the supervision of a consultant and in consultation with a multidisciplinary team and that all cases would be discussed at multidisciplinary team.

Le cead an Chathaoirligh, leanfaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla.<\/p><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for this opportunity to present details regarding An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga's report on the implementation of the Department's language scheme with regard to Gaeltacht placenames.  I am very disappointed representatives of GeoDirectory are not present at this meeting to answer any technical questions that may arise.  However, I will endeavour to get answers to any such questions the committee may ask today.<\/p><p>In 2015, the investigative report recommended seven actions to be undertaken by the Department.  The September 2021 implementation report presented to the Oireachtas acknowledges the Department has made a genuine effort to implement all seven of the recommendations.  However, An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga concluded my Department has breached its statutory language requirements regarding its own language scheme by failing to ensure official placenames of Gaeltacht areas appear in Irish only in the Eircode system.  Despite this, I am satisfied the Department meets the requirements of its language scheme and, furthermore, that all seven recommendations of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga's 2015 investigative report were actioned and reviewed by the Department's management board.<\/p><p>My Department has put in place the necessary arrangements to ensure official placenames of Gaeltacht areas are used as the default for official purposes, in compliance with our official language scheme, the Official Languages Act 2003, the Place-Names (Irish Forms) Act 1973 and placename orders that have been enacted.  This extends to Capita's operation of the Eircode system in that the quarterly dissemination of new Eircode postcodes to Gaeltacht areas is carried out using only the Irish postal addresses provided by An Post and issued to Capita by An Post GeoDirectory.  This also extends to the Eircode finder website tool where responses will default to the Irish version of the address when searching by address or Eircode for Gaeltacht placenames.  In addition, where searching for Gaeltacht placenames is required, the Eircode finder website only utilises the latest maps published by Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, which shows the Irish version of Gaeltacht placenames through the OSI GeoHive web mapping service.  Finally, both the Eircode website and Eircode finder website are available in Irish, and customer queries to the Capita support desk received in Irish by email, post and telephone channels are responded to in Irish.<\/p><p>These measures notwithstanding, I acknowledge it is unfortunate that private companies use addresses and people's names in English rather than their original language, Irish.  However, I will clarify that the Eircode database does not, and never has, contained people's names.<\/p><p>With regard to complaints that individuals have received letters with their addresses translated into English, it is important to state the Eircode system is underpinned by the most current An Post postal addresses, which contain Gaeltacht placenames in both Irish and English.  This is to ensure that the Eircode system, which is postal infrastructure in non-physical form, aligns with An Post's postal network as the universal postal service provider.  Notwithstanding that, Eircode does not change existing addresses but can simply be added to the address normally used for the property.  Individuals and private companies are free to use different forms of address.  Indeed, private companies hold their own various forms of addresses in their own databases along with multiple forms of addresses for the same property.  To resolve this issue of multiple forms of addresses, companies simply append Eircode postcodes to their own existing databases or addresses, whether they are in English, Irish or both.  The use of addressing databases by private companies is an operational matter and a commercial decision for the companies themselves.  My Department has no role in this.<\/p><p>The provision of all postal addresses, including Irish-language addresses, in the Eircode system is solely derived from the GeoDirectory database.  This is the customer-facing product that combines address data provided by An Post and location co-ordinates provided by Ordnance Survey Ireland.  This database is provided under licence by An Post GeoDirectory, APG, a subsidiary company of An Post and OSI, to Capita, which operates the Eircode system.<\/p><p>An Post has advised my Department that it is not possible to remove English postal addresses from its mail sorting system for Gaeltacht areas as this could impact the quality of service metrics in regard to mail delivery set by the postal regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  ComReg has set quality of service standards requiring An Post to deliver 94% of single-piece priority mail posted in the State for delivery in the State on the next working day and to deliver 99.5% of such mail within three working days.  An Post advised that removing English postal addresses would give rise to serious technical difficulties in the sorting and delivery of mail.  This is because An Post's sorting equipment uses both English and Irish variations of addresses.  These are used to match the address of the incoming letter.  If no match is found, the letter will have to be manually sorted or returned to the sender.  Furthermore, An Post stated that removing English variations of addresses in Gaeltacht areas would impact negatively on the quality monitoring that is in place for the delivery of mail.  It is therefore not within the remit of Capita to change unilaterally the form of postal address in the Eircode system as An Post has responsibility for the assignment of postal addresses in the State.<\/p><p>Aside from that issue, private individuals have the option of using the Irish version of a postal address or another of the most commonly used versions in the Gaeltacht.  People can simply append Eircode postcodes to their preferred address.<\/p><p>In the design phase of the Eircode system, Capita, supported by my Department, engaged with Foras na Gaeilge and Conradh na Gaeilge to ensure compliance with all statutory obligations regarding the Irish language.  Since the issue of discrepancies in Irish addresses between the GeoDirectory and <i>logainm.ie<\/i>databases was raised with my Department in 2015, my officials have engaged with An Post, An Post GeoDirectory, Ordnance Survey Ireland, An Coimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha and Capita.  This has resulted in Gaeltacht placenames that are the subject of discrepancies in the GeoDirectory databases being updated regularly.  An Coimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha continues to supply An Post GeoDirectory with a file of Irish-language placenames that have been changed or updated.  APG has informed my officials that the GeoDirectory database includes official placenames data as supplied by An Coimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha and that it updates this regularly with information provided by an coimisi&uacute;n.<\/p><p>The GeoDirectory database is provided to Capita on a quarterly basis for the assignment and dissemination of Eircodes.  An Coimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha is also working alongside Ordnance Survey Ireland to update its online geohive maps portal with the latest Gaeltacht placenames.  This is used in the free Eircode finder.<\/p><p> My Department will continue to engage with an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga; An Post and the An Post GeoDirectory; Ordnance Survey Ireland; An Coimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha; and Capita on the use of official Irish placenames in Gaeltacht areas.  However, I am confident that my Department has fulfilled its obligations under the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 and taken all possible steps to ensure the official placenames of Gaeltacht areas are used.  I am happy to answer any further questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022030200002#B00200","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":962,"content":"<p>An bhfuil aon fhinn&eacute; eile ag iarraidh labhairt ag an staid seo?

The Department&rsquo;s language scheme does not provide for the exclusive use of Irish in Gaeltacht placenames.  The Department, in line with the language scheme, ensures that official placenames of Gaeltacht areas are used as the default for corporate purposes.  In the design phase of the Eircode system, Capita, supported by the Department, engaged with Foras na Gaeilge and Conradh na Gaeilge to ensure compliance with all statutory obligations regarding the Irish language.  The Department also put in place the necessary arrangements to ensure that the official placenames of Gaeltacht areas were used as a default for official purposes.  Compliance with the Official Languages Act, the Place Names (Irish Forms) Act and placenames orders was also part of that and that extends to Capita&rsquo;s operation of the Eircode system and its quarterly dissemination of Eircodes.  If someone searches for a placename in a Gaeltacht area with the Eircode finder website tool, it will default to the Irish version of the address.  There has been and continues to be ongoing engagement with Coimisi&uacute;n na Logainmneacha and GeoDirectory in order to ensure that Irish placenames are kept up to date and regularly updated.

Capita extracts the Irish language address only and uses that to disseminate new Eircodes.  When it sends out the form with the Eircode on it to Gaeltacht areas, it only contains the Gaeltacht name.  Those dissemination letters are sent by An Post, which delivers them on behalf of Capita.  Both the website and the finder site are in Irish and in English, so if someone wants to deal totally in Irish with Eircodes, they can do that.  Capita has employed two Irish-speaking agents so if queries come through about an Eircode or an address, the person can work directly with Capita through Irish from the initial correspondence right through to the resolution of their problem.

In good faith, the Department contacted An Post, which is in charge of the addresses that are given to Capita, addresses which have to align with the postal service.  An Post said that it has to provide the English and the Irish versions and to keep them on its database to ensure next-day delivery.  That was the issue raised by an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  I appreciate the concerns and frustrations in that regard.  That is why I am here today to listen to the views of the committee.<\/p> <p>  As I have said, as part of the contract coming to an end, we will need to hear whether the Eircode systems, the delivery systems and the systems to ensure people are getting their mail delivered in their preferred language, particularly in Gaeltacht areas, are working well.  That is the reason I am here today.  I also wish to highlight, make visible and be very transparent about the issues within An Post with regard to the obligations ComReg has placed on it and which it must comply with to facilitate next-day delivery.  That is the issue here.  I am also here to outline the interaction and engagement between the Department, GeoDirectory, Conradh na Gaeilge and all of the stakeholders to ensure the GeoDirectory database is kept up to date in respect of Irish addresses.  Where there are discrepancies, people must have a direct line to ensure that information is updated and given to Capita to ensure we have the proper Irish placenames in Gaeltacht areas.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, we are in compliance.  In his implementation report in September 2021, an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga acknowledged the genuine effort made by the Department and highlighted the specific issue with regard to Eircode having both an English and Irish version of addresses.  The default position for people putting in their addresses in Gaeltacht areas is for the Irish address to be used.  With regard to cases where that does not happen, that interaction with GeoDirectory and the Irish bodies is continually improving the system.  The issue with An Post relates to the obligations ComReg has placed on it.  That is what it is telling us.  It cannot remove the English version from its mail sorting database.  That is the key issue.  I am here today to answer those concerns.<\/p> <p>  Again, I am obviously also here to listen to all members.  I say that to be very clear.  I have colleagues and officials with me to discuss the progress of the Irish language within the Department.  We have an official Irish language officer coming on board next month.  We are here to listen to all of the genuine concerns, to make sure the Eircode system is fit for purpose and acknowledges the need to have addresses in Irish in Gaeltacht areas, and to look at what we can do around that, including in the future as we look at future contracts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022030200002#F02600","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>D&uacute;irt an Teachta Connolly gur admha&iacute;odh ar ball nach raibh an dl&iacute; &aacute; chomhl&iacute;onadh.

This was the concern the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga had in terms of the complaints he was getting.  During that meeting we looked at the options for how we could have Irish only in Gaeltacht placenames.  We agreed at the meeting that we would write to An Post and ask it if it could take out the English addresses and only use Irish addresses in Gaeltacht areas.  We hoped that would assist in the reduction of complaints to the Minister or the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga on communications with English addresses.  That is what we agreed at that meeting and we subsequently wrote to An Post.  An Post replied to us to say that was impossible because of its sorting system and how it worked.  It also mentioned a broader issue, namely, that there is no legal form for addresses in the State and that there are large variations of English and Irish addresses, not to mention that 35% of the addresses in the State are the same as other addresses.  To resolve that issue, An Post has variations of addresses and the English addresses in its database.  When a letter for a Gaeltacht area arrives in English, the scanning software is able to pick it up and automatically sort it.  We told the commissioner at that meeting that we would write to An Post to see if it was possible for the software to work with Irish only and that was the answer we got.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022030200002#G03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ben King"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l aon bhaint ag An Post leis sin.
