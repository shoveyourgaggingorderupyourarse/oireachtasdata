I welcome the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and his officials to the meeting.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I remind Members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit Members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any Member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask that any Members partaking via Microsoft Teams confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contributions to the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Those attending in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Masks should continue to be worn by those present while they are not addressing the committee.  I remind all members that should a vote be called, members must physically come to the committee room to vote.  I advise all in attendance that should a division be demanded, the secretariat is operating a new system which will display the taking of the division on the screens in the committee room.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and his officials for attending today and engaging with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#A00200","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022: Committee Stage","time":1646179200,"counter":6,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#A00250"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1, 78, 84 to 92, inclusive, 310 and 321 are related.

Generally, we will not all speak to each one.  We will see how that goes.  We thought that was the best way to approach it.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 1, 78 and 84 to 92, inclusive, are linked.  I might read out the reasons for each amendment if that is the best way of doing it.  The purpose of the legislation is to give people access to their records, data and information, which, as we know, has been denied to many people for many years.  In the case of some people, this has been for their entire lifetime.  We know some people have passed away before being able to get some of this information.<\/p><p>We believe the legislation should include all possible and relevant data.  There should be no scope to leave anything out.  That applies in particular to amendment No. 1.  Amendment No. 78 is very similar to amendment No. 1.  It is to include all data, information and possible records.  There is a fear that information may be withheld.  We must acknowledge that has been the experience of people.  These amendments will strengthen the legislation.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 84 is to include all possible scenarios and situations.  Amendment No. 85 relates to all the personal data, making it more inclusive.  Amendment No. 86 relates to the time restrictions mentioned.  We do not believe the legislation should have any time restrictions for fear it might prohibit somebody accessing their records if they fall outside that timeframe.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 87, there may be times when an adoption did not actually take place but it is important that all the relevant information and data are given to the person.  Amendment No. 88 is in the same spirit as amendment No. 87.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 89, we and others believe certain information may not be disclosed.  This relates to the contact preference register.  If somebody indicates he or she does not want to contact and gives a reason, is there a possibility that reason will not be communicated to the individual?  That was the reason for proposing amendment No. 89.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 90 to 92, inclusive, are to ensure there should be no preconditions and that absolutely nothing is left out.  We believe the language we are suggesting in our amendments is much stronger.<\/p><p>The Minister might want to respond to those first because the grouping covers amendments Nos. 1, 78, and 84 to 92, inclusive.

As Deputy Pringle said, it is necessary explicitly to include clear and comprehensive definitions of things such as administrative records, other records and sources that will guarantee survivors and relatives access to the full information they should be provided with.  The level of detail we are looking for is based on the experience of survivors and campaigners.  For years, people have been denied access to information based on the interpretation of the law by public bodies and officials.  We can all understand why people feel the urge to make things such as this explicitly clear in the legislation.  There cannot be any ambiguity this time.

My understanding of the intention of amendment No. 1, combined with amendment No. 90, is to include administrative records in the definition of relevant records so that such records can be safeguarded.  This is something we have given significant consideration to and there was reference to it in the pre-legislative report.  It is important to mention the legislation essentially provides that all birth, early life and care information a relevant body holds must be provided to an applicant.  That includes any such information held on any form of administrative record.  That is why we have written all these definitions so broadly.<\/p> <p>  The term \"relevant record\" does not limit the release of information under Parts 2, 3 or 4.  The term \"relevant record\" is about the safeguarding of records, which is dealt with in Part 7.  That definition of relevant record already covers any administrative record containing birth, early life, care or medical information, or information such as admissions and discharge registers, visitors' books, baptismal and confirmation records, and any other records containing personal information on the daily life of individuals.  The definition of \"relevant records\" is already very wide but, importantly, section 42 empowers the Minister to prescribe other classes of records as relevant records and bring them within the scope of the definition.  We are of the view the definition of relevant record is already extremely broad and covers everything we need it to.  However, we have the option under section 43 that will allow a future Minister to come back to this.  We have that flexibility if something is left out of the definition of relevant records.<\/p> <p>  Administrative records are very useful for understanding the overall working of mother and baby and county home institutions.  They have an historical value.  That is why section 43 empowers the Minister to prescribe relevant records.  It is envisaged these administrative records will most certainly fall within the definition set out in that section.  I am satisfied the legislation would support the inclusion of administrative records in a way that allows coherent archives of institutional records to be protected.<\/p> <p>  I hear there is some concern about the issue of administrative records.  I will ask my officials to consider if any additional detail could be included within the definition of relevant records to provide further reassurance in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#B00600","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>There are other amendments in this group which we have not spoken to yet.

I thank the Deputy for her amendment.  This relates to the definition of illegal birth registration and use of the term \"incorrect birth registration\" within the legislation.  I am very clear and I and the Government absolutely accept that illegal birth registrations took place, and in terms of my engagement with this issue, this is how I describe them.  It is also important, speaking to the set of amendments that Deputy Cairns spoke to earlier, that we make sure as broad a number of people as possible can use the provisions of this legislation.  Our concern is if we use a definition of \"illegal birth registration\", there is a requirement to prove illegality before using that particular provision to benefit.  A person who is the subject of an incorrect birth registration as it currently stands can use this legislation.  If a person has to prove that his or her birth registration was not just incorrect but was actually illegal, that is a harder standard to prove.  That means the provision of using this legislation can apply to fewer people.  What we have always tried to do is broaden access to this legislation to let as many people as possible use the provisions of this legislation to get their information.<\/p> <p>  However, I am cognisant of the issues that have been raised about the language, so I have brought forward an amendment quite similar to Deputy Bacik's.  I asked my officials to work with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  This amendment clarifies that information leading to an incorrect birth registration was given to the General Register Office by a third party, and that information was not merely incorrect, but also false or misleading.  Therefore we have used that term and the addition of that language, that is, as a result of giving information that was false or misleading in respect of the name, to try to address that.  That is very similar to the change Deputy Bacik proposed.

Consultation with stakeholders and people who benefit from this legislation have been to the forefront of the development of the legislation.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, members engaged with a large number of groups.  I have also engaged with a large number of groups and individuals.  I continue to engage with survivor groups, adopted people and their families.  Deputy Funchion and I had a useful meeting last week with a former resident.  That was important and developed my understanding of what is needed in this area.<\/p> <p>  In the pre-legislative scrutiny report, a recommendation was made for a role for stakeholders in the implementation of the legislation.  We considered that recommendation and, on foot of that, I will put in place a stakeholder representative group.  The work of the group will be aimed at supporting the preparation for the implementation of the legislation when it is enacted.  That work will have regard to the public information campaign we have spoken about and general awareness-raising of changes being brought about by this legislation.  The proposals for the group's role, composition and relationship are being developed by my Department.  <\/p> <p>  That is not the only work we are doing in the area.  Action 1 of the 22-point action plan in response to the commission's report referred to developing a new and enhanced model of engagement and we are looking at the proposal to bring forward a special advocate for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions.  This could look at providing a well-resourced and dynamic model of representation for former residents to make sure there is a strong advocacy voice for them on a range of issues beyond the implementation of this legislation.  We know from our engagement with survivors that their priorities are multifaceted.  For some this legislation is key, while for others it is about memorialisation or the recovery of remains, which we have already discussed.  For others again it is issues around redress or education and how the history of this period is reflected.  That special advocate model could support systematic advocacy on behalf of former residents.  The longer term, resourced advocacy model addressing survivors in the myriad of ways they require and the stakeholder group we are establishing for the implementation of this legislation constitute the preferable way to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#F01200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, are physical alternatives to amendment No. 7.

In relation to amendment No. 10, it was brought to our attention that not all care was provided by institutions.

That sets out the types of care arrangements that are relevant to the release of information provided for in the Bill.  It is particularly relevant to the definition of a &quot;relevant person&quot; and the categories of information that are eligible for release under the Bill.  The types of care arrangement defined in the Bill include a nursed out arrangement, a boarded out arrangement, and an arrangement under which a child was cared for by a resident of an institution, among others.<\/p><p>On the specific amendments in this group, amendment No. 7 is not one I can support.  The definition of care arrangement is a key definition and is central to the understanding of several other definitions.  This definition is expansive and seeks to ensure that a broad range of care arrangements and areas are covered.  What is being proposed by amendment No. 7 is the removal of that and this is obviously not something I can support.<\/p><p>I am also not in a position to support amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10.  They seek to alter the definition of care arrangement.  The provisions of amendment No. 8 are already covered in subsection (9) of the existing definition of care arrangement contained in the legislation, which provides for &quot;an arrangement under which a child was cared for as a resident of an institution specified in the <i>Schedule<\/i>&quot;.  We believe that part is already covered.  Amendment No. 9 is already covered by the definition of care information which provides for the release of information to anyone who made care arrangements or was a party to them.  In that context, amendment No. 9 is unnecessary.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 10 seeks to expand the definition to include care provided by a parent or guardian of the child.  I understand the spirit behind this amendment but this refers to care provided to a child by its parent, outside of the institution.  We have to be very honest about the type of information we are going to have available.  When the child is with a parent and not in an institution, there will not be records of what happened in that situation.  We must be honest with people.  We have all met survivors who have tried to get their information only to be told that the information no longer exists.  Suggesting to survivors that there is information about what happened when they were cared for by their own parents outside of an institution is problematic.  That is not information that the institution has because, by its very nature, the care was taking place outside of the institution.  We can confirm that where a child was cared for by a parent within an institution, and we know that happened in many of the mother and baby homes, that information is available because obviously it is part of the institutional records but we cannot make claims about finding and delivering information about what happened outside of these institutions.  We would be raising false hope by doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#G00800","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I understand that point and it is something that occurred to me too.  However, what we are trying to say here is that if there was a situation where a child was in a care institution, was boarded out or fostered and that did not work out and the child was sent back, it would be important that any records of that would be accessible.  That is why we are including guardians, mothers and fathers because, potentially, the child could have been boarded out with or fostered by a birth parent and then sent back to an institution.  We are trying to cover all possibilities and angles.  I know people will look at this and say that the types of situations we are trying to cover are immense and that everything is covered by the Bill.  However, when people have been consistently let down for years, if not decades, they want absolutely everything possible to be covered by this legislation to ensure that no situation is left out.  That is what we are trying to achieve here.<\/p> <p>  I understand some of the points made by the Minister.  There have been numerous apologies made to survivors and survivor groups over the years but the best way to honour and acknowledge that is by ensuring we respect their wishes and what they want in the wording of this legislation.

However, in terms of the circumstances Deputy Funchion just outlined, the type of care arrangements that are defined in the Bill clearly include a nursed out arrangement, a boarded out arrangement and an arrangement under which a child was cared for by a resident of an institution.  Our belief is that the situation that Deputy Funchion just outlined is already covered by this legislation.  We know that boarded out and nursed out arrangements are two separate things.  Nursed out children were usually very young whereas boarded out children, while still young, could be seven or eight years old as opposed to a few months old.  We believe that the very comprehensive definition of care arrangement and the various types of arrangement provided for cover all of the instances that we can envisage and would have experience of from talking to survivors over the years.  At the same time, it does not raise a false or unmeetable hope that information about what happened when an adopted person or someone boarded out was in his or her own home, cared for by his or her own parent because that information just does not exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#G01000","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(f) any institution, agency, organisation or individual involved in the care of children and mothers who were separated from each other;&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#H00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 9:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(f) any institution, agency, organisation or individual involved in the separation of mothers and their children;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#H00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 10:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(f) care provided by the mother, father or guardian of the child;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>If I withdraw the amendment now, is it possible to raise it on Report Stage if we feel it needs to be revisited?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#H00600","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#H00700","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646179200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Just to clarify for people who may be watching, an amendment must be formally moved.

There is quite a lot here.  The amendments govern the provision of information.  It is telling that adopted people feel they have to put forward these amendments.  I am concerned about the Bill on that basis.  I know the Minister will say the legislation is comprehensive and covers all options but we will not know that until afterwards.  The problem is that we will not know until it is too late whether they are all covered.  That is really worrying.<\/p> <p>  I agree with amendment No. 26.  It would be right to delete the whole lot.  All the amendments in the group are relevant and important.  They reflect the information it is felt has to be included in the section to ensure all the information and all of the options are covered.  Information is vital for adopted people.  Their whole lives are lived with a lack of information.  Amendment No. 29 refers to letters, cards or other materials placed in an adoption file by the relevant person's father or other relatives.  It states people should have access to this information.  Clearly there have been instances where people have not been given this information.  This is why the amendment has been tabled.  It is directly from experiences that people have had.  Amendment No. 30 refers to letters, cards or other material placed in the adoption file by the relevant person's mother.  There is a reason for these amendments.  It is important and the Minister should take the amendments on board and include them in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#K04000","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I want to recall what we are trying to do with regard to early life information.  The definition provided on page 10 of the Bill sets out the various types of information relating to a relevant person's life from birth to 18 years that are eligible to be released under the legislation.  It is not an exhaustive list but it provides clear and consistent guidance on the type of information that has to be released in all cases, which is what we are achieving with the Bill.  It is an expansive definition.  It covers many different types of information, including, among many other examples, any religious ceremony that may have taken place, whether a relevant person has had vaccinations, any record of a person's physical or emotional development and whether the mothers of persons stayed with them in an institution for any length of time.<\/p><p>I cannot accept the amendment because it proposes to delete the definition of early life information, which is a key definition that ensures essential personal histories are captured and released.  The fact that the word \"includes\" precedes the list of types of information that may be on record makes it clear that it is an expansive and not a restrictive definition.<\/p><p> I cannot support amendment No. 27, which proposes to delete the reference to section 2(2).  That is important because it looks at the reference to that subsection.  The function of the reference in the section is to define the period of time during which the definitions of care information and early life information apply, and it is included for accuracy and precision in drafting.  This amendment deletes the particular reference entirely, but it does not offer any substitute or alternative.  That would have the consequence of extending the period until the relevant person is 18 years old, but that amendment would have no practical effect as there would be no records in relation to care information or early life information that would extend past that cut-off point, because once a person is adopted or the persons named as his or her parents in a false or incorrect registration assume the role of parents, there would no longer be any records held by public bodies because the person would no longer be with a public body but with his or her adoptive or non-adoptive parents.<\/p><p> I have spoken about this with the officials.  We do not support this amendment in respect of the reference to section 2(2).  I am advised that under grouping 11, amendment No. 102, seeks to delete section 2(2), and I have asked my officials to review the potential benefits to individuals of amending that particular section.  In the context of amendment No. 102, we will look to see if there is something we can do to provide additional clarity.  That is what I have been advised in respect of amendment No. 27.<\/p><p> To address the extensive list of points that have been raised in amendments Nos. 28 to 63, inclusive, we are not accepting the amendments because we believe all of these issues, bar a small number that I will speak to at the end, are already covered within the definitions that we have provided under this legislation, either under the definition of early life information or the definitions of birth, care and medical information.  Amendments Nos. 45, 48, 50, 51, 54 and 56 to 59, inclusive, are explicitly provided for under early life.  Amendments Nos. 41 and 47 are clearly covered under care information.  Amendments Nos. 32, 33, 36, 37, 42 to 44, inclusive, and 61 are explicitly covered under our definition of birth information.  Amendments Nos. 28 to 30, inclusive, are captured under the term \"provided items\".  Amendments Nos. 52 to 55, inclusive, are provided for under both medical information and early life information.  Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 are covered under both early life and care information.  I believe all of the amendments as set out are unnecessary as they are already covered.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 34, 39, 40, 42 and 46 refer to the inclusion of information that is the personal data of a relevant person&rsquo;s mother and is not therefore the personal data of the relevant person.

Deputy Funchion was making points on a good-faith gesture regarding the acceptance of amendments.  We have made significant changes between the publication of the pre-legislative scrutiny report and the final Bill.  I have already indicated that I will ask officials to review some of the points Deputies made where I feel they are legitimate.  I have made proposals that I feel, particularly in terms of illegal birth registration, respond to issues Deputies have raised.  Others have asked whether their list of amendments cannot just be accepted if we are all trying to cover what is roughly the same material.  The definitions we have in the Bill have been carefully fine tuned in accordance with engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General.  Every word has been considered and thought through, and we have examined previous legislation that did not get passed.  The provisions have been expanded to make sure they are as inclusive as possible.  The definitions of \"birth information\", \"early life information\" and \"medical information\" have all been planned and designed in a very specific way to work across all the various sections of the legislation.<\/p> <p>  I accept the point Deputy Pringle was making on the dissatisfaction of adopted people and others in seeking access to information previously, and that is why this legislation is being considered.  I have two points on the question of whether people can have confidence in Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  First, my Department is leading the implementation group.  It is being led by Ms Laura McGarrigle, the assistant secretary in this area.  It brings together our Department, Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland with a view to changing the culture in organisations in the sense of making it very clear that the presumption is one of the release of information.  I accept that has not happened in the past.  This legislation is to give very clear legal grounding for always releasing information but there has to be a culture change.  My Department is leading that through the implementation body.  I have discussed the required change to organisational culture in the past three weeks with the chief executive of Tusla, Mr. Bernard Gloster, who firmly believes in it.  Whenever he was before this committee, he was very clear on it.  I have also discussed the matter with the chairperson of the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  Irrespective of whether the change of culture is clear, the Minister has the power, under various sections of this legislation, to issue specific guidelines on how the release of information can be understood by the relevant bodies.  The cultural changes we are trying to achieve in the agencies and the specific guideline-writing power give us an opportunity to continue to ensure the categories we already argue are very broad can continue to be interpreted in an expansive way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030200002#Q00500","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>When we know there are really ingrained cultural attitudes within an institution, body or Department, it will not just be enough to have a chat with the head of the organisation in the hope it will change.

I do not know the solution or the best that can be achieved for anybody in this regard.  As is evident from the number of amendments suggested by the bodies acting on behalf of adopted people, a big task needs to be done.  It may require a leap of faith by everybody to ensure it is done.  I hope it happens.  The best way is to give all the information because there should not be anything hidden.

They seek to alter or expand the definitions of \"genetic relative\" and \"genetic relative information\" contained in the Bill.  These definitions were carefully considered in consultation with the Attorney General and the Data Protection Commissioner.  The definition of genetic relative is central to information release in two key ways.  First, it relates to the release of the medical information of a genetic relative where the information is necessary for the maintenance of a relevant person's health; and second, to the release of correspondence between a relevant body or secondary information source and the genetic relative of a relevant person.  It also relates to information pertaining to any visit a genetic relative may have made to a relevant person under the definition of early life information.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 65 seeks to extend that definition of a genetic relative to include grandchildren.  However, this is not relevant or necessary in any scenario where this definition applies.  For example, a record will not hold the medical information of a relevant person's grandchild and they will have corresponded with relevant bodies in relation to that person.  There is no way that someone who was in an institution up to the age of 18 will have had a letter from their grandchild because their grandchild would not have been born at that stage.  This is therefore an unnecessary amendment.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 66, the current definition of a genetic relative already sufficiently covers this, especially with regard to the reasons for defining a genetic relative within the legislation.  It is highly unlikely that a relative beyond a parent, sibling, grandparent, aunt, uncle or cousin would have visited or corresponded with a relevant person.  This is also relevant as regards access to medical information of a genetic relative, as it is highly unlikely that information pertaining to anyone beyond the list provided under the definition would exist within records or would be medically relevant and necessary for the maintenance of a relevant person's health.  This amendment is also unnecessary.<\/p> <p>  It is important to emphasise that both these amendments, Nos. 65 and 66, could jeopardise the release of a genetic relative's information to a relevant person if the definition ended up containing vague or unsupported categories of relatives, as it would not meet the necessity and proportionality test that releasing the personal sensitive data of a genetic relative to a third party would involve. <\/p> <p>  I cannot support the list of information suggested under amendments Nos. 67 and 69 as the name of the genetic relative and their potential status as an adopted person is their own personal data and not the personal data of the relevant person.  This was confirmed by the Data Protection Commissioner when appearing before the committee.  The other suggested additions under this amendment, namely, sex of siblings and position within the family order, are already provided for under the existing definition of a genetic relative.<\/p> <p>  I cannot support amendment No. 68.  Where this information is contained within a file, it will be released under the current definition of genetic relative information.  However, there cannot be a guarantee that this information is accessible and available on all files, as it is totally dependent on a person's position within the family order and whether siblings existed at the time of the record's creation.  I therefore cannot guarantee its release in all cases.
