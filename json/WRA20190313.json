The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, which was accepted by members of the Permanent Defence Force through their representative associations, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The increases due under the agreement from 1 January 2018, 1 October 2018 and 1 January 2019 have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel. Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2019 and 2020.<\/p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the payscales of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled as part of that agreement. <\/p>  <p>  New entrants who joined the Defence Forces since 2011, may also benefit from the measures which were recently announced in relation to interventions at points 4 and 8 of the pay scales for relevant new entrants to the public service. <\/p>  <p>  Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a relatively high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel. This is not new and the Defence Forces have always had a level of turnover that exceeds other areas of the public service. <\/p>  <p>  In order to balance personnel turnover there is ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level. This includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to other retention measures, there are a range of actions outlined in the White Paper on Defence (2015) which are aimed at enhancing the capabilities of the Defence Forces. These include HR initiatives which impact on retention such as providing career development opportunities and accreditation.  The criteria for extending service beyond twelve years have been revised and this has ensured that personnel who would have had to depart could remain. An examination of age profiles for enlisted personnel has been prioritised and this is being progressed. A gap analysis of skill sets in the Permanent Defence Force is also being prioritised. In addition, the military authorities have introduced further initiatives to enhance work-life balance and this is also to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of Public Services Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Government has tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with conducting a comprehensive examination of specific recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Sector. The Commission's work is on-going.  The Government will give due consideration to the findings and any recommendations that arise from the work of the Commission. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300066#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300066#WRE02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300066#WRE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[12511\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300066#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the funding his Department or agencies under the remit of his Department have provided to projects in County Galway in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019, respectively; if the funding has been allocated; if it has been drawn down in each case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[12528\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300066#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the funding that his Department or agencies under the remit of his Department have provided to projects in County Roscommon in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019, respectively; if the funding has been allocated; if it has been drawn down in each case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":293,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.<\/p><p>My Department is responsible for two votes - Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs and Trade) and Vote 27 (International Cooperation) and administers a number of funding schemes including under Ireland's official overseas development programme, Irish Aid.<\/p><p>As part of Ireland&rsquo;s development programme, funding is provided through the Development Education scheme for projects to promote understanding and engagement with global development and justice issues.

The harder the Brexit the more negative the impact will be on our economy. <\/p>  <p>  While my Department&rsquo;s central economic and fiscal planning scenario remains an orderly exit involving the UK leaving with a transition arrangement in place, the risk of a disorderly exit cannot be discounted. <\/p>  <p>In November 2018, a number of new research reports in the UK were published that showed that the impact in the UK would be larger than previously assumed. An initial &lsquo;holding&rsquo; assessment was prepared by the Department of Finance in January, based on an initial application of the latest UK estimated, pending the completion of a more comprehensive model-based assessment with the ESRI. This was made public following consideration by government on 29 January 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The initial assessment showed that in a disorderly exit, while in aggregate terms, the economy is likely to continue expanding, the pace of growth would be lower than is currently expected. The assessment suggests that the size of the economy will be around 4&frac14; percentage points smaller than our existing trajectory over the medium-term and will be around 6 percentage points smaller compared to a &lsquo;no Brexit&rsquo; scenario. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that such estimates may not capture the full impact, and the figures may be conservative. Indeed, the impact in certain exposed sectors and regions will be worse than the average.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is therefore working with the ESRI on a new more comprehensive model-based assessment of the economic and fiscal impact of Brexit on Ireland. This work takes into account the recently published UK assessments, and substantial new microeconomic research that has been produced since the 2016 assessment. The assessment will include short-run disorderly impacts, tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, and the positive benefits of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) that is redirected from the UK to Ireland. The results are expected to be published later this month and will inform my Department&rsquo;s next set of macroeconomic forecasts in the Stability Programme Update in April. <\/p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU is an event without precedent in modern economic history &ndash; estimating the impact of this is challenging. Nevertheless, quantifying the impact is important to help Government to understand the possible macroeconomic implications and to design the appropriate policy response. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has already taken significant action to get Ireland Brexit ready. Since the UK referendum, all of our national Budgets have been framed to prepare for the challenge of Brexit with dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019.

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more  extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration will, from 1 January 2019, be paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p>  <p>  The F&Oacute;RSA trade union have requested a meeting with the Department to discuss pay arrangements for grant-funded Secretaries and Caretakers from 2020 onwards.

Preparation has had a wide-ranging focus on operational requirements, including personnel, infrastructure and technology. I know the Commissioner is committed to ensuring the organisation can deal with any policing challenges arising from Brexit though clearly the circumstances which may arise are dependant on the political settlement.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government's policy is that there will be no hard border on the island and there are no plans for such.  However, as she is also aware, policing in the Border region has always presented particular challenges and this can be expected to increase in the context of Brexit.  It is also the case that violent dissident republic groups continue to seek to frustrate counter-terrorism efforts and organised criminals seek to exploit the two jurisdictions in order to try to evade detection.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2018 Cross-Border Threat Assessment prepared jointly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI estimated that some 43 per cent of organised crime gangs in Northern Ireland have a cross-Border dimension. Likewise, mobile organised crime groups, responsible for multiple instances of domestic burglary, operate on an all-island basis.  There are increasing instances of borderless crimes such as cyber fraud and international terrorism.  <\/p>  <p>  The success of cross-Border policing actions is grounded in the recognition that the best means of combating the threat to our communities is to maintain and enhance the excellent levels of co-operation between law enforcement agencies north and south of the Border. The Garda&iacute; and PSNI, along with other agencies, have worked together closely for many years and enjoy an excellent working relationship and co-operation at all levels.<\/p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement recognised this and led to the establishment of Joint Agency Investigation Teams which have had considerable success in combating this type of crime.  I understand this is also the context for the Commissioner&rsquo;s operational decision to establish an additional Armed Support Unit in Cavan.  <\/p>  <p>  Garda ASUs provide a rapid armed response capacity and capability on a Regional basis.  Members of the ASUs are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout their respective Regions.  In the Northern Region ASUs are currently based in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal and Dundalk, Co. Louth.<\/p>  <p>  Garda deployments in all areas of the country including those along the Border have benefited from increased recruitment in recent years.  I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Northern Region as on 31 January, the latest date for which figures are currently available, was 1,406 Garda&iacute;.  There are 59 Garda Reserves and 144 Garda civilian staff attached to the Northern Region.  An additional 49 Garda&iacute; were assigned to the region with effect from last Friday.  <\/p>  <p>  The increased resources coming on stream have also provided the capacity to expand the specialist bureaus including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, all of which are particularly active in the Northern Region in addition to the Armed Support Units.<\/p>  <p>  The ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible, effective and responsive policing service.  These requirements will be kept under ongoing review by Garda management with a view to addressing any policing requirements for the Border region which may arise depending upon the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.  In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in Border areas, further resources can and will be provided through redeployment.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputy will be aware that the resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels this year, with an allocation of &euro;1.76 billion.

I am informed by the Garda authorities that the allocation of Garda resources is subject to constant review in light of operational need, to ensure their optimum use. <\/p>  <p>  Finally I want to assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in dealing with the implications of Brexit and will provide the necessary resources to keep our people and our communities safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300072#WRL02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cyberbullying Issues","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300073#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[12895\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300073#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to revise harassment laws here in view of the impact of cyberbullying on the mental health of a person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>I am aware that the Deputy asked a similar question in November 2018 (46670\/18) and I would refer him to the answer provided at that time.

In 2017 the LEO provided funding for 28 projects to the value of &euro;263,112 and in 2018 it provided funding for 35 projects to the value of &euro;335,937.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, the IDA paid a total of &euro;185,500 to its client companies in Roscommon. IDA Ireland paid no grants in Roscommon in 2016.

The economy has recovered strongly and there are now more people at work than any time in the last decade. With the increase in employment and increase in earnings, there is now more spending in the economy and this is to the benefit of all businesses, including hairdressing and personal care sectors. <\/p>  <p>  The supports of my Department to improve access to credit for businesses are available to businesses in the hairdressing and personal care sectors. These include loans of up to &euro;25,000 available throughMicro Finance Ireland, the Credit Guarantee Scheme which is operated with the three pillar banks and also the Brexit Working Capital Loan Scheme. I am aware that many businesses may import products for the UK and Brexit may give rise to extra costs. I would also encourage businesses from all sectors to engage with their Local Enterprise Office (LEO), which offer a range of advisory and other supports in every county. In particular at this time of Brexit uncertainty I am encouraging businesses to consider participating in the LEO Customs Training programmes if appropriate so they can remain competitive in a post-Brexit environment. Skillnet Ireland and the Education and Training Boards are also engaged with the sector and again I would encourage business owners to engage directly with local providers on their changing skills requirements, in particular where there are requirements for reskilling and upskilling. <\/p>  <p>  Stabilising the public finances and prudent fiscal management is an essential underpinning for a strong and growing economy and is essential to ensuring future growth prospects for all sectors. The Government&rsquo;s ability to directly fund locally trading businesses is more constrained due to considerations of displacement, fairness and equity between businesses. <\/p>  <p>  This Government has played its part in supporting the personal care sector when it most needed it with the introduction of the reduced VAT rate in 2011, which helped to sustain employment throughout the country in the sector. <\/p>  <p>  As the Minister for Finance noted in introducing Budget 2019, while a Government&rsquo;s decision to provide stimulus to the economy is often an easy one to make, judging when it is appropriate to withdraw stimulus measures is always more challenging. The Minister for Finance gave a commitment in the 2018 Finance Bill to undertake an economic analysis of the 9 per cent rate. The review found that the reduced rate has done its job. In the context of the new economic reality where the economy is strong, growth is broadly balanced and full employment is within sight, the Minister noted that it was appropriate to increase the rate of VAT and underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to responsibly manage the public finances and maintain a broad tax base.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300073#WRM01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Reviews","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300073#WRM01600"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[12691\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300073#WRM01700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to update the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":467,"content":"<p>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (No. 10 of 2005) came into effect on 1 September 2005.

That is why my Department started developing supports for businesses from the time when Brexit first became a possibility.

This has informed the range of advisory and financial supports that are in place. <\/p><p>The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme launched last year is open to eligible businesses of up to 499 employees which have been demonstrably impacted by Brexit, or which will be in the future. The Brexit Loan Scheme provides working capital funding to businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to Brexit-related challenges. Loan amounts range from &euro;25,000 up to &euro;1.5 million, for terms of up to three years and at a maximum interest rate of 4%. Loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. This may be useful for businesses whose cashflow has already been impacted by Brexit. <\/p><p>Beyond this, my Department and its agencies are fully engaged in preparing Irish businesses for Brexit and have participated in the Government of Ireland&rsquo;s series of Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events in Cork, Galway, Monaghan, Dublin, Limerick and Donegal. As part of awareness-raising activities, Enterprise Ireland continues to roll out regional Brexit Advisory clinics. To date, these clinics have been held in Letterkenny, Tralee, Portlaoise, Claremorris, Cootehill, Charleville, Dublin, Galway, Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick. Further events are planned in Galway, Cork, Letterkenny and Dublin ahead of the withdrawal date. <\/p><p>EI has also been running a PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the Brexit SME Scorecard and the PrepareforBrexit.ie website, which offers information on the likely impacts of Brexit on Irish businesses and how these impacts might be mitigated. The Brexit SME Scorecard is an interactive online platform that can be used by all Irish businesses to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. <\/p><p>Funding to the Local Enterprise Offices has been increased by 22% and they, along with InterTradeIreland, are offering a range of Brexit-focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland.

As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management.<\/p><p>ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms. ITI have just launched a further financial support - &pound;5,000 in matched funding which will support companies in implementing a change identified in their Brexit action plan.<\/p><p>While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging.

It is committed to the provision of a person-centred approach to the care for each patient.

In addition, I have held meetings with, and sought further information from, the Chief Officers and Executive Clinical Directors of the CHOs specifically on CAMHS vacancies, with a view to improving the rate of recruitment for CAMHS staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300074#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Agency Staff Expenditure","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300074#WRN00500"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[5938\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300074#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cost incurred in using agency nurses for the public health system in each of the years 2016 to 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300074#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Staff Remuneration","counter":487,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300074#WRN00800"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[5939\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300074#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost of a pay award to nurses and midwifes of 12% in the 2019 financial year; the amount of such a figure that would be returned to the State in PRSI, tax and USC; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":489,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300074#WRN01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":490,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300074#WRN01100"},{"type":"question","counter":491,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[12168\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300074#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 167 of 30 January 2019, if one of the 25 dieticians or an allocation of clinical hours could be made available to north Kildare disability network to provide services to, for example, children with autism who have dietetic requirements (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":492,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The size, complexity and specialist nature of the new children's hospital project informed the decision by the NPHDB to adopt a two-stage procurement process comprised of:<\/p>  <p>  Procurement Stage 1: A full tender and contract for Phase A (below ground including basement works) on the basis of a detailed design with the tendering of Phase B (the main above ground works) on a Preliminary 1st stage design with an approximate and remeasurable bill of quantities reflecting the Preliminary 1st stage design. Contract Awarded to main and specialists contractor 3rd August 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Procurement Stage 2: While the basement Phase A works were under construction, the 2nd stage detailed design for the above ground Phase B works was completed with a full bill of quantities priced at the 1st stage Preliminary design tendered rates.

There is also additional investment from other sources associated with broader programme which is outside of these capital costs. This relates to investment in ICT and the Electronic Health Record rollout funded through the ICT capital programme,  the comprehensive Children's Hospital Integration Programme which is well underway, funded through revenue, to ensure the successful clinical and operational merging of three paediatric hospitals, pre-2013 project expenditure relating to the former Mater project, and the planned construction of the Children&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Centre to be funded through philanthropic funding.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to cost certainty , the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) procurement process agreed with the contractors requires the contractors to take all risk for quantities following completion of the GMP process, and, as per the contract, limits their recovery of additional costs incurred by them to clearly defined scope changes, in excess of 4% inflation (as per the average of three published tender price indices) which may occur post July 2019 and changes in legislation (e.g. VAT, PRSI, statutory labour rates, building regulations). Other than in respect of exclusions, the GMP ceiling cannot be exceeded with any amount in excess not recoverable by contractors. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in light of the concerns over the major and sudden cost escalation associated with the finalisation of the GMP, Government also approved the commissioning of an independent review of the escalation in cost at the same time.

These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practicing for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a huge expansion in the number of training places on GP training programmes in recent years.

They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and provide an alternative market outlet for farmers.  My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri-sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, I reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves less than three months of age to &euro;1.20 per animal. This brought greater equity in the fees payable for calves, weanlings and adult cattle and gave an important boost to the trade.  A significant increase in live calf exports resulted in the number of calf exports reaching 159,000 in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Other initiatives in developing the international export market include the issuing of new health certificates for the export of cattle to Libya which were agreed in November 2018.  This increases the range of cattle that can be exported there.  My Department is also engaging with the Egyptian authorities to secure the finalisation of agreement on health certificates for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle. <\/p>  <p>  I have extended an invitation to my Algerian counterpart to visit Ireland in early 2019. This follows earlier contact with Algeria, in an effort to reach agreement on revised and separate slaughter, fattening and breeding certificates.  Furthermore, following my visit to Turkey last week, I am confident that consideration will be given to the reopening of the live export market to Irish cattle by the Turkish authorities.<\/p>  <p>  My Department officials are in on-going communication with the Irish exporters with regard to the need for co-operative management between each other to ensure that the lairage capacity at Cherbourg is optimised.  I had a recent meeting with the exporters where these issues were discussed.  I have also met with farming organisations in recent weeks on the issues.  The provision of additional facilities depends on commercial decisions by private industry.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the recent approval by the French Authorities of an increase in the holding capacity of one of the lairages at Cherbourg.  This additional capacity of 400 places is an important boost for Irish calf exports to Continental Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300081#WRV01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Disease Controls","counter":704,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300081#WRV02100"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[12642\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300081#WRV02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will resist EU proposals to impose a 30 day pre-movement tuberculosis test and tighter assembly periods for live exports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1440","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":706,"content":"<p>In March 2016, the European Parliament adopted the new Animal Health Law (Regulation (EU)2016\/429).

This equates to a cut of approximately 5% to the CAP budget in the next MFF period of 2021 - 2027.  I have previously stated that the proposed cut is unacceptable for Ireland.  The retention of an adequate budget for the CAP post-2020 is a key priority for Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Negotiations on the MFF proposals have commenced and are running in parallel to the CAP post-2020 negotiations. The European Commission's intention is to reach overall agreement on the MFF before the European Parliamentary elections in 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The MFF is a critical matter for all Member States and its agreement requires unanimity at the EU Council.  It is clear that there are divergent views among Member States on the appropriate level for the budget.  While some Member States (including Ireland) have indicated their willingness to increase their contributions, once they contribute towards areas of added European value, there are others who feel equally strongly that the current proposals, such as they are, are too costly.  <\/p>  <p>  The departure of the UK from the EU further compounds the budgetary issue, with some &euro;12 billion per annum in UK net contributions being removed from the budget post-2020.  Against this background, agreeing the MFF will make these negotiations a particularly challenging task.<\/p>  <p>  The new CAP proposals point to a more significant environmental ambition than the current CAP schemes, including in Pillar I. It is a new departure for Member States that they will be required to design a specific climate and environment scheme in Pillar I. This is something that I support as it is consistent with my Department's long term strategy for the agriculture sector, which recognises the critical importance of environmental sustainability.  I believe that protecting the environment and the sustainable development of agriculture are two sides of the same coin.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that farmers play a vital role in the provision of public goods and need to be adequately recognised and recompensed for this role.  It is important that the overall level of the budget acknowledges the public goods being delivered from farmers.  <\/p>  <p>  I continue to work towards building consensus among my agriculture colleagues in Europe with regard to maintaining the CAP budget.  I co-signed a Joint Memorandum in Madrid in May last year, which calls for the CAP budget to be retained at current levels for the EU 27 post-2020.  The memorandum has been supported by up to 20 other EU Agriculture Ministers.  We will continue to work together on this issue as the negotiations for the CAP post 2020 and its budgetary allocations progress.<\/p>  <p>  I have also sought to continue this work as part of ongoing bilateral meetings.  Since May 2018, my colleague Minister Doyle and I have met initially with the EU Agri Ministers from Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Hungary, inter alia to support a strong CAP Budget after 2020. I have also met with Ministers from the Netherlands, Estonia, Belgium, Poland, Luxembourg, and Austria, and my officials engage regularly with counterparts in other Member States on this issue. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland needs to work closely with its EU colleagues to build a consensus around the need to reverse the proposed cuts in CAP.  I would like to reassure the deputy that I will continue to do this, and to fight for a strong CAP budget as the negotiations progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300081#WRV02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":710,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300081#WRV02700"},{"type":"question","counter":711,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[12644\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300081#WRV02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans and incentives to encourage young persons to take up farming; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1440","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":712,"content":"<p>My Department currently has a range of measures, both under the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) and nationally, to encourage and support young farmers.<\/p>  <p>   Under the CAP, the National Reserve and the Young Farmers Scheme provides financial support to young farmers and new entrants to farming during the crucial early years immediately following the setting up of a farm enterprise: <\/p>  <p>  - 8,245 applications were received for the Young Farmers Scheme in 2018, with payments totalling &euro;18.4 million issued to young farmers throughout Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  - A further &euro;31 million has been allocated since 2015 to young farmers under the National Reserve. <\/p>  <p>  - Additionally, under the TAMS II Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme, co-funded under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, young farmers can avail of the enhanced grant rate of 60% as compared to the standard rate of 40%. Under this Scheme, &euro;12.5 million was paid to approximately 1,300 young farmers in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  There are also a number of national taxation measures specifically aimed at young farmers, specifically &lsquo;100% Stock Relief on Income Tax for Certain Young Trained Farmers&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers&rsquo;.  The Agri-taxation Review set out the main policy objectives for continuing support to the sector through agri-taxation measures including: <\/p>  <p>  - Increasing land mobility and the productive use of land; allowing young farmers and new entrants to the sector gain access to land by providing a cheaper means of long-term access to land, as opposed to the relatively high cost of land purchase. <\/p>  <p>  - Assisting succession and the transfer of farms, which continues to be a central part of the Government&rsquo;s agri-taxation policy. Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax, Retirement Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax, Retirement Relief from Capital Gains Tax and the stamp duty exemptions on the transfer of land all facilitate the early inter-generational transfer of farms.<\/p>  <p>   In addition, in 2017 I launched the 'Succession Farm Partnership Scheme'. This provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to further assist with the transfer of farms within a partnership structure, promoting and supporting the earlier intergenerational transfer of family farms.

As part of my 2019 Trade Mission schedule, I plan to lead a Government agri-food trade mission to Japan and South Korea in June. <\/p>  <p>   Given that Free Trade Agreements between the EU and Japan and South Korea are now in place, it is an opportune time to build on the trade mission that I led to those countries in November 2017 and to again highlight Ireland as a source of high quality and safe agri-food, including dairy products, beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat, poultry, drinks, seafood, food ingredients and beverages.<\/p>  <p>   As part of its market prioritisation exercise, Bord Bia has identified both countries among those that present trade opportunities for Ireland. Indeed, Bord Bia will be opening an office in Tokyo and has also received EU funding to promote beef and pigmeat to South Korea.<\/p>  <p>   Japan is the world&rsquo;s third largest economy and one of the largest meat importers globally.

This was a large increase on the &euro;56m worth of product exported in 2016. The main driver behind this increase is pigmeat (&euro;41m in exports in 2018, compared to &euro;14m in 2016). In fact, Japan is the fifth most important destination for Irish pig meat globally. Other notable areas are dairy produce (&euro;40m in exports in 2018 compared with &euro;15m in 2016) and fish (&euro;14.3m).<\/p>  <p>   I also see great opportunities in South Korea, particularly given that it is already an important destination for pigmeat &amp;amp; seafood exports, with nearly &euro;14m in each category in 2018.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to almost 622,900 families in respect of almost 1.2 million children, with expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The rules for determining the person with whom a child resides for the purposes of the payment of child benefit are set out in Article 159 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims, Payments and Control) Regulations 2007 (S.I.

No. 859 of 2007).<\/p>  <p>  These amending regulations contain an additional rule, which provides that where a child is placed in foster care, or with a relative by the HSE, payment of child benefit will transfer to the foster parent after a period of six months of foster care.  The rationale behind this change is that the purpose of child benefit is to assist toward the ongoing cost of child rearing.  However, when introducing the change, it was considered inappropriate to withdraw payment from a parent in respect of short periods of foster care.  Furthermore, it was recognised that the immediate withdrawal of child benefit may have an adverse financial effect on the mother who may, regardless of the duration of the foster care, maintain some level of contact with the child. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that discussions with the Health Service Executive and the Irish Foster Care Association at the time of the making of these Regulations, established that the HSE considers the vast majority of foster care arrangements to be short-term placements.  I understand from my Department that in view of this and in light of the fact that legislating for all possible scenarios would be impractical, it was decided that six months represents a reasonable &lsquo;lead-in&rsquo; time before the transfer of child benefit.   <\/p>  <p>  While these arrangements are kept under constant review, any changes to the payment of child benefit to foster parents would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300088#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Allowance Data","counter":895,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300088#WRCC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":896,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[12546\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300088#WRCC02400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons who received the fuel allowance for the 2018 to 2019 season; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":897,"content":"<p>Fuel Allowance is a payment made to people who are dependent on long-term social welfare payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001\/24\/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. <\/p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  My Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  The recent publication of updated WHO noise standards had resulted in a delay in finalising the revised draft Guidelines. These revised draft guidelines were to be published in Quarter 1 2019. However, there have now been some delays to the planned schedule, due to the need to focus on certain Brexit-related planning issues. As part of the SEA process, there will be an 8 week public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, later in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts. In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300091#WRFF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rental Sector Strategy","counter":974,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300091#WRFF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":975,"qnumday":364,"qnumall":"[12608\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300091#WRFF01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when guidelines will issue to local authorities regarding the proposed new regulations on a company (details supplied); if planning permission will be required in areas not considered under housing pressure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":976,"content":"<p>Under Action 18 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector, a Working Group was established, involving representatives of all major public stakeholders with a policy interest in short-term lettings, to develop guidance in relation to planning applications, changes of use relating to short-term lettings and to examine the need for new regulatory arrangements.  Proposals under consideration by the Working Group have been aimed at facilitating short-term letting of accommodation within permanent residences, known as homesharing, while protecting the existing stock of residential property in areas of high demand.<\/p>  <p>  Having considered the Working Group's report as well as the recommendations in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on short-term lettings, I announced plans to introduce a &ldquo;one host, one home&rdquo; model in areas where there is high housing demand. <\/p>  <p>  Under the proposed new arrangements, homesharing will continue to be permissible for a person&rsquo;s primary residence. In addition, an annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.  Under these arrangements, people who wish to avail of the proposed new planning exemptions to use their own home for home-sharing or limited short-term letting purposes will be required to register this with their local planning authority.<\/p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, they will require planning permission to do so unless the property already has planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to short-term letting can be sought and it will be up to each local planning authority to consider such applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures in the area concerned and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that these proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the proposed new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019. In addition to making revised exempted development planning regulations, which are being progressed, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced which will underpin and strengthen the new proposals.  This element of the changes proposed is currently being developed and details will be published in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300091#WRFF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":978,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300091#WRFF01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wildlife Control","counter":977,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300091#WRFF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":978,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[12454\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300091#WRFF01500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of licences issued by the NPWS to cull badgers in counties Roscommon and Galway in 2017 and 2018, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":979,"content":"<p>My Department issues licences to the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine under Section 23 of the Wildlife Acts 1976 - 2018 to take, capture and release for vaccination purposes or to capture and humanely kill badgers.<\/p>  <p>  While each such licences can operate for periods other than one calendar year and may cover areas other than on a county basis, it can be said that in both 2017 and 2018 a licence under section 23 was in operation in respect of Counties Roscommon and Galway.<\/p>  <p>  While the individual licences issued by my Department do not specify the number of badgers that may be culled, in each area, it is understood that details in this regard are available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300091#WRFF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":980,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300091#WRFF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":981,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[12506\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300091#WRFF01800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the funding her Department or agencies under the remit of her Department have provided to projects in County Galway in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019, respectively; if the funding has been allocated; if it has been drawn down in each case; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1243"},{"type":"question","counter":982,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[12523\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031300091#WRFF01900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the funding that her Department or agencies under the remit of her Department have provided to projects in County Roscommon in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019, respectively; if the funding has been allocated; if it has been drawn down in each case; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":983,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 366 and 367 together.<\/p><p>Details of the annual funding allocation to my Department at subhead level are published in the annual Revised Estimates Volume.
