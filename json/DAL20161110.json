This is the first occasion on which the Minister has been able to bring forward a social welfare legislation that is in any way beneficial in terms of restoring some of the things that were forgotten or ignored during the downturn.  Many have been critical and stated that the measures do not go far enough.  However, I am quite sure that everyone in the House would agree that the cuts made during the downturn were part of a package of emergency measures.  We had no options and those who suggest that we did have options are speaking far from the truth, though that is not to suggest they are telling untruths.  Those of us who were in the House at the time investigated every single option that was available and some that were not.  If there had been other options, we would have found them.  I mean no disrespect to any commentator in saying this.<\/p>  <p>  It is also fair to say that we experienced increased levels of homelessness during the boom as well.  I and other Members visited people in those times who were sleeping rough each night and we even had to rescue individuals who were living in tents on roundabouts, which, among other things, was a threat to their personal safety.  That should not have happened but it did.  It is a challenge to us all to address the issues that are affecting people.  This morning I saw lots of individuals sleeping in doorways as I came through town and we must address this in the short term in order to ensure that irreparable damage is not done to our society as a result of people being forced to sleep and live in such conditions.<\/p><p> A number of speakers referred to and welcomed, rightly so, individual aspects of the Bill, while others said it did not go far enough.  I agree that it does not go far enough, but it is only a first step.  There has to be a first step in every instance and.we now have options.  We could try to address all of the issues arising from the downturn in one go, in which case we would end up back where we were, or we can address them gradually over a period of three years or more.  The latter is the proper approach.  Naturally, people who do not see a restoration of benefits will look askance and raise questions, justifiably so, but as I said, we now have options.  I want to address specifically the difference between the options available to us now and those that were available to us previously.  We are often reminded that we had options and that we took the wrong ones.  We did not because the options that were available to us previously were not simple.  For example, had we taken the option of avoiding the issues arising from the collapse of the economy, all pensions would have been reduced to a figure in the region of 20% or nothing and it would no longer have been possible to pay family income supplement and make many other support payments.  That is what happened in a number of other jurisdictions.  We should never allow what happened to happen again under any circumstance.  That said, we must move on in a way that will benefit the economy, on the one hand, and the people, on the other.<\/p> <p> There are 2 million people at work in this country, the highest number ever.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I have been Members of the House since the 1980s.  At that time it was a struggle to get the number at work up to 1 million.  Therefore, we have moved forward and there are economies of scale when the population increases, from which we will eventually achieve benefits.  Incidentally, there is plenty of scope for a country the size of Ireland to have a much larger population.  We have to plan for an increased population, although I do not propose to make any suggestion as to how that might happen.<\/p> <p> Social support is not meant to be a replacement for employment.  The purpose is to help households and families when faced with unemployment which has hit across the board.  Self-employed persons suddenly found themselves out of work and unable to access social welfare payments.  Many of them were wrongly informed that they had no entitlement to social support payments.  It is not true because everybody has an entitlement to receive such support on a means-tested basis.  Unemployment is very worrying for those who find themselves in that position.  Many people who were well-off, comfortable and self-sufficient and who had built themselves up from very humble beginnings suddenly had the rug pulled from under them.  Our ambition should be to never allow this to happen again.  Whatever our plans and ambitions for the future, we must always keep our feet firmly on the ground with a view to ensuring we will not allow the economy to implode again.  I do not blame anybody for what happened; I am just making the point that it did happen.<\/p> <p> On competing demands, a number of speakers spoke about the need to address the issues affecting the families of people with disabilities and people with disabilities in general.  It is true that this group have been stressed for the past few years and that they were even under pressure during the boom years.  One can only imagine what life has been like for them in the intervening period in terms of the burden on them in trying to meet their requirements, given the withdrawal of services and dramatic cuts in supports.  Many of them, particularly women, are shouldering this burden on their own and faced by an impenetrable wall of bureaucracy that does not appear to be conscious of their needs.  I am sure every Deputy knows of women who have been carrying the responsibility of caring for family members with severe disabilities for up to 40 years on their own with little or no support, recognition or respite.  Very often they are dependent on bureaucrats' decisions on their entitlements.  It is horrific.  I hope that as we recover further economically they will be recognised in a way they have not been heretofore, including during the boom years.  <\/p> <p> It is welcome that many Deputies have highlighted the case of women who, on reaching pension age, find themselves with no or a dramatically reduced pension, which is appalling.  This is an issue I have raised on numerous occasions in recent years.  Many years ago when I was a Minister of State, I was somewhat instrumental in addressing one part of the problem for people who, because they had only made a limited number of contributions, did not qualify for a pension, while another who had made one more contribution was entitled to receive a pension to a figure of 75% or 80%.  There are many things that could be done about this, in respect of which the cost would vary.  I recall that the estimated cost of introducing the current system in 1996-97 was &euro;780 million.  According to one assessment carried out by the Department, the estimated cost was &euro;850 million.  At that stage, I undertook my own assessment - to this day nobody knows how it was done - and estimated that the full year cost to improve the system for the people concerned would be &euro;14.5 million.  The actual cost was &euro;9.5 million; therefore, we had erred on the side of safety.  Unfortunately, a subsequent Government decided to extend the system further and the resultant cost was approximately &euro;1.4 billion, a huge increase.  As such, the issue requires careful consideration before further changes are introduced.  Women who were forced out of the workforce because of the marriage ban and have no entitlement to the State contributory pension need to be catered for.  It must be recognised that women who retire temporarily from the workforce to rear their children or care for a family member are making a major contribution to the national economy and, therefore, should be rewarded by way of entitlement to a pension.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is well disposed towards considering this proposal and we must move towards implementing it.  On the assessment of pension entitlements into the future, it should be on the basis of the potential entitlement of the applicant to the State contributory pension.  In the case of a person who accrued two or three years' contributions at the beginning of his or her working life, the obvious thing to do would be to disregard these initial contributions and thereby allow him or her to become eligible for the State pension.<\/p> <p> On the State pension, I would like to raise another issue.  In the case of a couple, when one person dies the surviving partner is faced with the same costs, including rent and electricity.<\/p><p>The only reduction is in food and clothing costs.  That is disproportionate and the living alone allowance does not compensate for it albeit it is of benefit.  We need to look at how best surviving partners are catered for because they find themselves in a worse position when half the pension is gone.  There is a need to look at their situation again and I hope the Minister will do so in the course of his examination and review.<\/p> <p> A number of people have referred to the removal of the bereavement grant.  It was removed for serious reasons but I agree that in certain circumstances we need to look at it again.  Even as times improve, there are families who find themselves on a tight social welfare budget through no fault of their own.  If there is a bereavement in the family, they can find themselves unable to pay the funeral expenses.  There are people who complain that undertakers were the beneficiaries, but I disagree completely.  In fact, the biggest single expense now is often the cost of a grave, sadly.  I ask the Minister to look at these things in the review.  I know he is doing it, in fact.  How soon it can be done is a budgetary matter, but the sooner the better.  The exceptional needs payment, which is supposed to have taken the place of the grant, does not necessarily meet the expenses that emerge where a bereavement takes place.  It should not be forgotten that it may be a surviving parent who passes away leaving a very young family of orphans behind with very little to fend for themselves with and very little experience.  They find themselves in a very serious situation in so far as making ends meet is concerned and feel threatened and challenged by what is around them.  As public representatives, we have to do our jobs because the system does not always address them in a sympathetic way.  That is the best way I can describe it and the Minister knows what I am talking about, as do his officials.  I hope they will have regard to that in dealing with those sensitive situations that arise.<\/p> <p> I hope we have learned from the experiences of the last six or seven years.  They have been harsh and have hit every aspect of our society in a very severe way.  I hope we have learned how to deal with that situation better than we did in the past and hope that we can plan in future to ensure we do not have that type of economic chasm that makes people involuntarily vulnerable and facing the situation on their own.  The other point it does no harm to remember is simply this.  In future, we can benefit from the sacrifices that were made if we do not try to do everything in the one year.  There is a grave danger that we might decide we are okay again and can do it once more.  I express the wish that the hard lessons we learned never have to be learned again and that we can see our economy and our people moving forward in a cohesive way and remaining a strong economic entity in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000003#A00400","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478772900,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Bill.  In its initial analysis of the budget, the ESRI has said the greatest gains in budget 2017 are in the lowest income brackets.  While the gain is minimal, it is doubtful that this would have happened without the influence of Fianna F&aacute;il.  While a great deal more needs to be done to bring about an Ireland for all, the social welfare package in budget 2017 represents a step in the right direction towards creating a more equal and progressive Ireland in which all citizens have a stake, not just the privileged few.  While Fianna F&aacute;il is not in government, it has agreed to a confidence and supply arrangement to facilitate a Fine Gael-led minority Government.  We did not sit on the fence like some others whose main aim seems to be to highlight problems without offering any credible solution.  We chose to be responsible and to show leadership.  To a degree, this facilitation has enabled us to push our agenda based on the principles of fairness, equality and progressiveness and to ensure that for the first time in years the budget is not weighed in favour of those who are least in need.  While we did not secure everything we wanted in the budget, we have made some vital gains and put a halt to the regressive policies previously pursued in the last five years.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the small gains in budget 2017, however, we are acutely aware that it will not solve the many problems that persist.  Rates of poverty and deprivation are appalling.  There are 134,000 children in consistent poverty and children represent approximately 40% of the entire consistent poverty population.  Of lone parent households, 59% experience deprivation and 51% of those not at work due to illness or disability are experiencing deprivation.  It is clear that one budget alone will not solve this, but the time has now come for fairness.  The budget must work within the fiscal parameters available.  As such, a sensible approach was needed and that is what was taken.  This is not a game we are playing and acting responsibly is not a game.  However, the budget is only the first step in creating a society where everyone, not just the privileged few has a place.  There is work still to be done, which all sides of the House acknowledge.<\/p>  <p>  As Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson for older people, I welcome the &euro;5 increase for pensioners aged 66 and over and the increase to all weekly welfare rates.  I am disappointed that the increase will not become available until March unlike previous budgets where increases were delivered on 1 January.  The additional 10% on the Christmas bonus will also help those on fixed social welfare incomes with no other opportunities available to increase their incomes coming up to Christmas.  This will now be an 85% bonus.  The &euro;5 increase in the State pension which we fought for and secured was a key commitment for us in our manifesto and we stipulated it in the confidence and supply arrangement.  We recognise that despite claims to the contrary, older people were not protected during the last five years of regressive budgets.  Older people suffered cuts to secondary benefits and increased taxes and charges.  Furthermore, any increase must be looked at in the context of the fact that social welfare rates have remained stagnant for years.  While the budget is a step in the right direction, more needs to be done.<\/p>  <p>  An issue that is very close to my heart was just mentioned by Deputy Durkan.  It is the living alone allowance.  This is an issue that is felt acutely by our senior citizens when one member of a couple dies.  Currently, the old age pension plus fuel allowance amounts to &euro;509.10 per week for a couple over 80 and &euro;489.10 per week for a couple under 80.  Obviously, the majority of couples at this stage in their lives do not have a mortgage and use their weekly incomes for living expenses.  However, when a member of the couple dies, they suffer not only the trauma of losing a loved one, but are also plunged into a financial crisis.  The pension entitlement of the deceased ceases and the person left behind gets an extra &euro;9 under the living alone allowance.  The income is slashed by half and despite the living alone allowance of &euro;9, it still costs the same to run the home with lighting, heating, insurance, phone bills and general utilities remaining the same.  Nothing is halved except, perhaps, for the food bill.  This is a payment I would like to see increased incrementally to support our senior citizens who are dependent on the State pension.  This came up constantly as I canvassed during the eight months prior to the budget because this is the only income of those senior citizens who are dependent on the State pension only.  When half that income goes on the death of a spouse, they find it tough.  If the Minister could look at that going forward, it might be done incrementally.  It might start off with a quarter of the original payment even for three years or something like that.  I do not expect the whole pension to be left there, but it could be done incrementally.  I refer specifically to those who are dependent on the State pension only, not to those who have another income as well.  Research by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice has highlighted consistently the additional cost faced by those who live alone and are reliant on the income from State support.<\/p><p>An analysis of the budget shows that despite the &euro;5 increase in the State pension, a pensioner living alone will still be faced with the weekly shortfall and will be not be able to afford a minimum standard of living.  This underscores the need to address the inadequacy of this payment and we must address the issue in future budgets.<\/p> <p> Budget 2017 did not increase the fuel allowance, which was cut from 32 weeks to 26 weeks by the previous Government.  Not addressing the reduced purchasing power of the fuel allowance leaves long-term social welfare dependent household households particularly vulnerable to fuel poverty.  From speaking to senior citizens, I know most people now use smokeless fuel.  A bag of coal costs &euro;20.50.  One would, on average, use 1.5 bags a week.  It is a significant part of a person's income.  Older people feel the cold a lot more because they are more vulnerable in their homes.  It is an issue that is raised regularly.  People find it hard to heat their homes.  They put on extra layers of clothes and try to move around more, and it is an issue for vulnerable older people.<\/p> <p> I would also like to see a reversal of the elimination of the death benefit, which helped greatly when a loved one died.  It was removed three years ago under the previous Government.  I understand that at the time the fiscal parameters were not there, but it has a major effect on people struggling with the cost of burying a loved one.<\/p> <p> The reduction in prescription charges from &euro;25 to &euro;20 very welcome, and it is to be hoped that in future budgets the charges will end.  They were also introduced in difficult times and now is the time to make sure they are removed.  Some 330,000 people aged over 70 years will benefit from the reduction in a charge that has caused financial stress to many.  People have told me that they often put off taking all of their prescriptions in a week due to the &euro;25 cost.  In some instances, people collect all of their prescriptions on the same week of every month.  Handing over &euro;25 in one go is very difficult.<\/p> <p> I refer to the self-employed.  I have been self-employed and a PAYE worker during my life.  I welcome that the invalidity pension is being extended to the self-employed.  This is subject to a commencement order and is due to come into effect in December 2017.  The self-employed have long been forgotten when it comes to social welfare.  They take all of the risks and are the backbone of our small and medium enterprises.<\/p> <p> I also welcome the fact that the treatment benefits package will be extended to the self-employed.  Extending the scheme to the self-employed is expected to cost &euro;3.6 million in 2017 and &euro;4.4 million in a full year.  The current scheme will be expanded for employees and the self-employed.  I welcome the measure.  <\/p> <p> The expansion of the scheme will include the reintroduction of the dental scale and polish and a full restoration of optical benefits, including free glasses or a contribution of &euro;42 towards upgrading glasses.  From having spoken to people who felt that they got nothing from their PRSI contributions, I know this is very welcome.<\/p> <p> While these measures are welcome, we must continue to build on providing a social welfare system that encourages entrepreneurship and provides an adequate social welfare safety net for those who set up their own businesses.  We must actively encourage new businesses and job creation, and having a social welfare system that provides a sufficient safety net is crucial in this regard.  This is the first budget under the confidence and supply arrangement, and it is new ground for all parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000005#C00200","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478773500,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I welcome the increase in the State pension, something for which Fianna F&aacute;il fought and secured.  A key commitment for us in our manifesto was to increase the old-age pension by &euro;30 over five years, and we stipulated that in the confidence and supply arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the changes for the self-employed.  Many self-employed people take risks, employ people and pay their taxes, PSRI and everything else, yet despite their best efforts sometimes businesses fail.  I welcome that they are being recognised in the budget.  That will improve their quality of life.  Until now, such people were stranded with no support whatsoever.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to pay particular attention to the State's contributory pension scheme and the current pension gap between men and women.  Financial hardship in retirement has become a real prospect for many women.  While much attention is given to the gender pay gap, the problem is far more pronounced at pension age, with the pension gap between men and women now standing at about 37%.  Women very often take a step back in their careers to look after children, which can in turn make it more difficult to save enough for their pensions.  Time taken out of the workforce to care for children is time lost paying into a pension, as well as any employer top-ups to that pension.<\/p>  <p>  The past four decades have witnessed a seismic change in women's participation in the workforce, but women are still financially less well-off than men.  A 2012 study by the European Institute for Gender Equality found a gap of &euro;688 a month in pension payments between men and women.  The reason for the pensions gap include the fact that women have less access to State pensions than men.  Currently, only 16% of women receive the full pension.  Changes to the contributory thresholds that determine how much of a State pension people receive have made the situation for women worse.  Sadly, any system that relies on contributions will put women at a disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  With effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 to 520.  This has worked against many women who have spent time out of the workforce.  The cuts to the State's weekly contributory pension were introduced by the former Minister for Social Production, Deputy Joan Burton, to make it more difficult for those without a full-time, long-term working history to qualify for the maximum weekly payment.<\/p>  <p>  The plan was implemented despite an internal Department survey of 5,700 claimants which highlighted the likelihood that women would be disproportionately affected by the measures introduced in 2012.  For a person to receive the top rate, he or she will need a yearly average of 48 paid credited contributions from 1979.  This means that a generation of women are either on reduced pensions, do not have enough contributions to qualify for the full rate or get one as a qualified adult which is related to their husband's pension and is not a payment in their own right.<\/p>  <p>  A new home-maker's credit was approved at the time of these changes, which seemed to off-set any potential inequality, but this was not sanctioned by the Department of Finance because of cost.  The home-makers scheme, which was introduced in 1994, makes it easier for women and men who have spent a number of years outside the workforce caring for children to qualify for a contributory State pension.  <\/p>  <p>  One has to return to work for the home-makers scheme to be effective.  According to the Department, while one is not obliged to return to work to the workforce immediately after the home-maker period ends after 20 years, if one has an insurance record gap of more than two years the credited contributions one and during the home-maker period cannot be used for pension assessment purposes until one returns to work and pays a minimum of 26 contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue is that the scheme only goes back to 1994, which precludes women who worked in the home prior to this from benefitting from a contributory pension.  It is crucial that the promised home-maker credit is introduced and backdated to the early 1970s.  The scheme is currently only backdated to 1994 and is limited to the care of children up to 12 years of age.  We need to move towards a universal pension system which gives women and men equal access to a comprehensive pension guarantee.  This pension must be at a payment rate that provides a decent standard of living for all.  I would like to request a review of the State pension scheme which disproportionately affects women and their ability to qualify for a full State pension.<\/p>  <p>  I know the exclusion of people in receipt of social welfare from being able to buy their homes under the new tenant purchase scheme is not within the remit of the Minister for Social Protection, but such a rule is very wrong.  People should be given a chance to buy their house.  It is unfortunate that they are excluded from so doing unless they have earned income of over &euro;7,500, which many do not have.  I want to mention the issue because it needs to be examined.<\/p>  <p>  In my area, community welfare officers attended to people in towns and villages throughout the county.  Unfortunately, about three years ago all of the community welfare officers were concentrated in one centre in Sligo.  This means that people have to travel 30 or 40 miles to meet one, which is very difficult for single parents or those living in rural areas.<\/p><p>There are no trains, taxis or DART services in these areas for people trying to get to the social welfare office.  They have an hour and a half window in the morning or in the afternoon, usually around midday, to do it.  It is not easy for those with children in school.  It certainly has not improved the service and perhaps it might be re-examined.  If it was only a fortnightly visit to the local health centre or village that was required, it would make things easier for them because it causes a lot of hardship.<\/p> <p> I welcome the increase in the numbers on the farm assist scheme and the rural social scheme.  I also welcome the work done by those on community employment schemes.  As politicians that are involved in local community groups trying to improve our areas, we are aware that the CE scheme has been a fantastic success in that regard.  I know young and middle-aged men that are on these schemes.  Quite a few of them go in every week although the scheme works on a week on, week off basis.  It is hard to believe that for an extra &euro;20 one week they will go in the next week despite the fact that they are not getting paid.  They go there to maintain their mental health.  They mix with people and feel they have a value.  It is not a lot of money but it makes such a difference to these people's mental state.  There is no doubt about it.<\/p> <p> On the issue of those who have to retire at 65 years of age and then have to apply for jobseeker's benefit for the year until they reach pension age, it is wrong that those who have worked all their lives since they left school have to do this.  There should be a system that allows them not to have to apply for jobseeker's benefit.  It does not make any sense.  They are retired and should get an equivalent payment until such time as they become entitled to their pension.  <\/p> <p> I accept that the Minister cannot do everything and there have been improvements, but other issues should be examined to try to improve the lives of those we represent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000006#D00200","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478774100,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  As I have stated on many occasions, we must never go back to the boom and bust policies of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Every citizen in Ireland has paid a heavy price for the reckless behaviour of past Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments.  I am happy that this Government is taking a more prudent and sensible approach and this is reflected in the Social Welfare Bill.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the public finances are improving and it is important that all members of society benefit from this.  While the budget is not a giveaway budget, it gives a little bit back to many.  More than 840,000 people will benefit from a weekly increase for the first time since 2009.  The total budget for social welfare will be almost &euro;20 billion next year alone and this represents almost 35% of the total expenditure in 2017.  To put this in context, the total amount allocated to social welfare for 2017 will be more than the combined budgets for the Departments with responsibility for health, justice and housing. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome measures introduced in this Bill by the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the fact weekly payments for pensioners, carers, people with disabilities, widows, lone parents and job seekers will all see a modest improvement.  I also welcome the fact the invalidity pension will be extended to the self-employed and that they will also gain from the treatments benefit package which includes dental, optical and hearing benefits.  Particularly pleasing is the fact that lone parents will benefit from the new &euro;500 cost of education allowance.  Some 50,000 children will also benefit now from the school meals programme.<\/p>  <p>  The reversal of the cuts to the farm assist scheme and the increase of 500 new places on the rural social scheme will be welcomed in the farming sector.  From my extensive dealings with the farming community, I know and understand their concerns.  They are facing constant challenges with regards to falling income, increasing costs and the uncertainty of the UK&rsquo;s decision to possibly leave the EU.  I know the measures included in this budget, while modest, will be welcomed by the farming sector and rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I know the self-employed sector will be pleased that they will now have access to an extended range of dental and optical benefits as well as access to the invalidity pension.  It is my firm believe that the self-employed in this country have been discriminated against with regard to social welfare benefits in the past.  This sector has been critical in bringing this country back from the brink and we must support it during its difficult times.  Until now, it has had no safety net and did not have the protection of the social welfare system.  This Bill is a good start to protecting the self-employed.  More than 380,000 self-employed people pay class S PRSI.  From March 2017, the self-employed will be entitled to access to optical, dental and hearing benefits currently available to employees under the treatment benefit scheme.  The self-employed will now also be entitled to apply for the invalidity pension with effect from December 2017.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, has stated that he intends to continue to extend the benefits available to the self-employed through the social protection scheme and I for one will support him on this.<\/p>  <p>  I am a firm believer that work must always pay.  A person must always be better off working than having to rely on social welfare.  Over the past number of years I have seen a steady decrease in the number of people who have to rely on social welfare for their daily needs.  It is important that reliance on social welfare is seen as a temporary measure and that every effort is made to get people who are capable of working back to work.  Those who are unable to work due to illness or injury must also be fully supported and, in this regard, I welcome the changes to the various schemes.<\/p>  <p>  As I have already stated, the total social welfare budget for 2017 is almost &euro;20 billion and represents nearly 35% of total Government expenditure for next year.  This demonstrates the Government's commitment to helping those in the unfortunate position of being unemployed or unable to work due to illness or injury.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the changes being introduced by the Minister.  I welcome the fact that as more money comes available due to a growing economy we have more resources to invest in our public services and social welfare schemes.  In February of this year, the people made it very clear that they wanted more resources for public services.  The Government has listened and, with the programme for Government, has committed to these policies.  We must not forget that in order to invest more in public services we need a growing and vibrant economy.  We do not need a boom and bust economy like that of the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government or one such as that advocated by those in Sinn F&eacute;in.  People must never forget the mess left behind by Fianna F&aacute;il and the heavy price paid by all citizens as a result.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the measures contained in the Social Welfare Bill and look forward to seeing them introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000007#E00200","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1478774100,"counter":16,"content":"<p>There are a number of other speakers who wish to contribute, so I recommend to the House that we suspend for ten minutes.

I was absent earlier because I was attending a meeting of the Business Committee.  This flexibility may not have been shown so readily in the past.  We should be thankful for small mercies and new politics.<\/p>  <p>  While the Social Welfare Bill 2016 includes a number of good measures which I very much welcome, it does not go far enough in many areas.  The fiver Friday budget will do very little for many.  I welcome the &euro;5 increase in weekly social welfare payments which have been the subject of some argy-bargy.  However, it is only a start in the process of giving back to those who have struggled in the past eight years, but it was downright mean to hold back the increase until March 2017.  I was in touch with Independent Ministers and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, during the negotiations on the budget.  While I understand money is an issue, it is harsh to have people wait for such a long time for an increase in their payments.<\/p>  <p>  I am also concerned about whether the income thresholds for medical cards will be increased to reflect the &euro;5 increase in social welfare payments or if those who receive the additional fiver per week will be at risk of losing their medical card.  This is a major issue, as the &euro;3 pension increase in last year's budget created a catch-22 for many.  It would be terribly unfair if people were to lose their medical card as a result of an increase in social welfare payments.  Many pensioners would prefer to hold on to their medical card than to receive an extra &euro;5 per week if the additional income was to cause them to lose their medical card.  This is a serious anomaly which must be examined and I expect the Minister to do so.<\/p>  <p>  When the pension was increased by a measly &euro;3 per week, many people also lost special dietary allowances and similar supplementary allowances.  The Government gave with one hand and took away with the other.  This may have been unintentional, but it is an unfair and silly quirk of the system.  People would be better off forgoing an increase if it was to result in the loss of supplementary payments. <\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed that the Minister did not review the means testing of income for the non-contributory pension.  This issue should have been addressed because the income thresholds permitted to qualify for the non-contributory pension have not increased for some years.  Many people have been prevented from obtaining a pension in their own right as a result of these thresholds.  While I acknowledge the Minister cannot address everything at once, I hope he will remove this anomaly. <\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed that changes have not been made to the living alone allowance scheme.  I meet widows and widowers who are struggling to cope with the loss of a second income.  It is bad enough experiencing the loss of a lifelong partner, but the &euro;9 living allowance does not go far enough to bridge the gap created by the loss of a second income.  If a household loses the value of a full pension as a result of a bereavement, &euro;9 is neither here nor there.  Widows and widowers have been penalised for years in the social welfare system and it is time the problem was rectified.  Not only do families lose a second income, but in cases where the surviving spouse has a private pension, he or she ends up paying almost double the amount of taxation because his or her tax credits change.  In such circumstances, the &euro;9 living alone allowance simply disappears in tax.  We must address the effect of the loss of a second income.  Widows and widowers still have to pay the property tax, water charges and household bills and most are very conscientious about doing so.  The cost of heating a home is the same for one person as it is for a couple.  As I stated, &euro;9 is neither here nor there. <\/p>  <p>  Another concern raised regularly with me in recent months and years is the plans to increase the qualifying age for the State pension for employees who are forced to retire at 66 years.  After working their entire lives, many people will have no option but to sign on for one year before qualifying for the State pension.  I am not giving out about people signing on but pointing out that it is degrading and insulting to require people who have worked their entire lives to sign on.  This issue should be addressed to ensure pensioners will not be forced to retire before they are entitled to the State pension.  This means that they must join the live register and sign on every week or month, which is very hurtful for people who have always worked and paid their taxes.  They should not be placed in this position.<\/p>  <p>  I am most disappointed that the telephone allowance has not been restored.  The loss of this allowance had a detrimental effect on the elderly and those living alone, many of whom can no longer afford to keep a telephone.  Deputy Michael Collins and I have been heavily involved in Muintir na T&iacute;re and the community alert scheme for decades.  Fitting hundreds of pendant alarms is one of the most satisfying things I have ever done.  The alarms are like a second person for many.  However, they are useless without a landline.  While a new version is available which can be used with mobile phones, it is not as useful as the pendant system because many elderly people are not accustomed to using mobile phones, the battery of a mobile phone can go flat, etc.  The landline is the only source of contact for many older people who use them to call friends and family members.  The removal of the telephone allowance must be reversed because telephones are vital for safety, security and companionship.  <\/p>  <p>  I thank the staff of MCM Security and TASK Community Care in Dublin for the friendship they offer to people who use the pendant alarms.  Sometimes people activate them for no other reason than that they are lonely.  A survey conducted by Muintir na T&iacute;re found that loneliness and isolation were the reasons for 70% of calls made to the alarm call centres.  As a result of the survey, we established the \"Good Morning South Tipperary\" call centre which contacts people who may be lonely and seeking companionship or to talk to someone.  It is vital that the telephone allowance be reinstated because the new alarm systems are not working and are too expensive.  Where mobile phones are used, there may not be coverage, the phone's battery could be dead or the person may not be able to find his or her device.  In contrast, pendant alarms are fool-proof because people can move around the house while wearing them.<\/p><p> I greatly welcome the moves to extend social welfare schemes to the self-employed, particularly the extension of eligibility for invalidity pension.  This is long overdue and a benefit I have campaigned for many years.  It was a significant issue in the talks for the programme for Government for those Independent Members who happened to be self-employed and know self-employed workers.  The self-employed do not want to be out sick.  Over the years, however, I have had many self-employed people come to my clinics in tears, as they could no longer work due to illness but had little or no support.  Last night, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae recounted a case of a self-employed woman crying in his office with the hunger.  The self-employed are proud people who want to work and contribute.  Many of them have employed many people themselves who were supported when they were laid off when the business crashed.<\/p> <p> I have not seen any mention of extending eligibility for the illness benefit to the self-employed.  I am curious to know how this will work in reality if they have to have been unable to work for one year to qualify for the invalidity pension.  What supports will be available to them in the short term and for the one-year qualifying payment?  This applies to farmers and the self-employed who would be affected by illness.<\/p> <p> I am pleased that the dental treatment scheme has also been made available to the self-employed.  However, we need to go further with this scheme and allow a clean, filling or extraction, as so many have been ignoring their dental health as they struggle to make ends meet.  This has been shown in independent surveys.<\/p> <p> Section 20 provides for the reintroduction of the income disregards which applied to the farm assist scheme, a most welcome provision.  I also welcome the increases to the places in the rural social scheme.  These were badly wanted.  As Deputies Michael and Danny Healy-Rae said the 500 places are a drop in the ocean but a step in the right direction.  The scheme has done significant work in communities across the country.  It suited people in rural areas who were affected by seasonal employment.  They were able to do maintenance work in their communities, in schools, graveyards, Tidy Towns projects, visiting the elderly and safety schemes.  This scheme suited people interested in contributing to their community for a small amount of money.  These are small farmers who do not want to be at home idle.  Instead, they are used to hard manual work over long hours and do not shy from it.<\/p> <p> The increase in the income disregards for the one-parent family payment is welcome.  I note the one-parent family payment can be retained in certain circumstances until the child is 16 but these are limited circumstances.  Will the Minister elaborate on this?  The age limit of the youngest child remains at seven years of age, a measure introduced by Deputy Joan Burton when she was Minister for Social Protection.  This has certainly caused significant difficulties for lone parents and should have been re-examined.  This measure is also another reason why there are only seven Labour Party Members.  It was outrageous for a Labour Minister to introduce such a measure.<\/p> <p> I am deeply disappointed this budget did not do anything to improve the social welfare payments for our young people.  I am all for young people going on work schemes, getting off their backsides and not sitting at home on iPhones, as the then T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton once said.  We do not want to encourage young people to remain on social welfare by providing a disincentive to work.  We have situations, however, where 24 year olds living independently, trying to start out in life and support themselves, but have found themselves down on their luck.  We have one arm of the State telling them that &euro;100 is sufficient to provide for their own means but another arm of the State, the medical card office, refusing to assess them as an independent person because they are in receipt of less than the &euro;124 per week which it considers necessary to be able to live independently.  One thinks of the lunatics running the asylum.  I am not mocking any official but such an anomaly involving two Departments is outrageous.  We need less bureaucracy and more common sense.  There needs to be straight thinking and connectivity between the Departments.<\/p> <p> I am happy the back to education allowance rates for the under-26 has been increased by &euro;33, allowing them to claim the full allowance.  I hope this will allow those who are unemployed to return to education.  I continue to have concerns, however, about the qualifying times for this payment.  We have those in receipt of a social welfare payment who want to go back to education but they have to remain on social welfare for up to nine months before they can qualify to get a back to education allowance.  This is another silly and stupid - I hate using that word - anomaly.  While it may be an unintended consequence, it needs to be rooted out.<\/p> <p> Even though we are paying them the same rate to sit at home, we refuse to consider them for a course if they have not met the qualifying nine or 12 month period to qualify for the back to education allowance.  This just does not make sense.  If we do not want people falling into a welfare trap, then we must look at reducing this to at least a six-month period.  If one is unfortunate enough to lose one's job in February and struggles to find new employment, one cannot be considered for the back to education allowance to start a college course in September because one will not have met the qualifying period.  This does not make sense.  It is loo-lah stuff.  If one is lucky enough to find a few weeks' seasonal work, one will break one's claim and no longer qualify.  Accordingly, one is encouraged not to take up any work, even just a few weeks' seasonal work.  Deputies Michael Harty, Danny and Michael Healy-Rae have referred to this.  We should have some flexibility to allow them do some hours and encourage young people to keep the sense and value of work.  They are also supporting many economies in rural Ireland which need part-time, short-time and temporary workers.  We need to be flexible and remember young people are not all out to cheat the system.  They want to get on in life and should be encouraged.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.<\/p> <p> Our carers do wonderful work but received practically nothing in this year's budget.  They save the State so much but many feel all they get is a slap in the face.  The national carer awards will be held in Dublin on 16 November with a carer from every county.  A young mother who cares for her young son, Alex, won the south Tipperary award and will go to the national awards next week.  I wish all the contestants well.  They are wonderful people and we can never put enough value on them.  They should be supported but the carer strategy has been abandoned.  I never fail to wear the carer emblem on my lapel because they save the State so much and sick people are better cared for at home.<\/p> <p> I did not see any mention in the Social Welfare Bill of efforts to reduce the waiting times for applications and social welfare appeals.  I have constituents who have had to give up work to care for their loved ones.  When they applied for carer's allowance, they were shockingly refused.  Almost one year later, they are still waiting for a decision to their social welfare appeal.  This is just not good enough.  It is stressful and hurtful.  These individuals are not trying to rob the State but giving a valuable service minding their loved ones at home while saving the savage cost of a hospital bed of &euro;1,000 a day.  It is unacceptable that someone would take on the role of carer, saving the State thousands of euro and residential placements of which there are very few, yet get nothing from the State.<\/p> <p> Our squeezed middle class is so squeezed that it is like an orange reduced to a mandarin, and a dry mandarin at that.  As I said on budget day, my biggest concern is our squeezed middle who continue to be squeezed and who have benefitted little from this year's budget.  They are the ones who pay into collections and support so much in the communities.  These middle-income earners are the same families who must pay for everything.  They pay their taxes but they will not get child care support.  They pay for their school books and examinations but do not get the Student Universal Support Ireland grant.  They pay for their health care and their mortgages but are abandoned.  This has gone on with successive Governments over many decades.  I do not expect the Minister to change it overnight but they are squeezed.  This was a strong issue for myself, Deputy Michael Collins and the other Independents at the talks about the formation of a Government.  We got it on the doors.  These are the people who contribute but get hammered every which way.  I do not know how they survive, put their kids through college and pay for doctor visits and medicines.  They must be looked after.<\/p> <p>  I want to raise the issue of Turas Nua, a company appointed by Department of Social Protection to deliver JobPath services.  It is a new journey but it is a bad one.  It is a bad and hard road.  It should be more Turas Bocht or B&oacute;thar Bocht.  This company, which also operates in England but not with great success, is intimidating people.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae spoke last night about a young fellow in Kerry who has to thumb a lift 20 miles to turn up to sign on with Turas Nua.  I have had constituents traumatised by this company.  It gets paid on results and there is nothing wrong with that because we need incentives.  However, the Minister will have to intervene in this case.<\/p><p>I am not blaming individuals; the system is wrong.  Social welfare officers are telling me this is very regressive.  People aged 55 and 60 years are being punished and penalised.  They are being told they must do IT courses, but they are not able to do them as they have never had that experience.  They are willing to work on schemes, but they will not be left in place.<\/p> <p> There is a big problem with community employment schemes.  I thank the Minister for solving a problem for me earlier in the year soon after taking office.  It concerned a community employment scheme, of which I am chairperson, in my village.  I thank the Minister and his officials for their interest and support.  The scheme has a complement of 17 places, but there are five vacancies and we cannot fill them.  Turas Nua is taking candidates from us.  I have said for years that there should be a national audit of the value of community employment schemes which kept communities going.  When we were all busy during the Celtic tiger era, the community employment schemes did all of the work.  Participants worked in graveyards, with groups taking part in the TidyTowns Ireland competition, community halls, churches, etc.  They were also engaged in helping and caring for the elderly and worked in day care centres.  Now one must finish after one year.  A person is trained in a day care centre and when he or she gets to like the clients and they begin to like him or her, he or she is turfed out.  Turas Nua is hounding people.  It is a turas bocht nua.  I will not say it is uaf&aacute;sach, which means \"awful\", but it is becoming awful for people and is awfully traumatic.  I appeal to the Minister to consider it, as well as community employment schemes which have been vital.  Many schemes, including my own, have been very successful in terms of the rate of progression back to work and setting up one's own business.  That is what it is all about.  People are not meant to be participating in schemes for life.<\/p> <p> There are certain individuals who are in a difficult position.  I refer to people who were participating in schemes when they reached the age of 55 years.  One had no way of finding a job in a rural or an urban area, as Deputy Michael Collins knows as he is very involved in schemes.  One continued until pension age.  The schemes provided value, for a couple of euro extra per week.  Participants were making a contribution and generated a feeling of goodness and a work ethic.  They generated pride in one's county through many competitions, including the TidyTowns Ireland competition.  F&Aacute;S used to run schemes, but it is now SOLAS which runs them.  They generated pride and a sense of worth.  A man or woman was out of the house and the person at home could carry on with his or her business.  It was good for everyone.  It was good for families and communities.  The worth of the schemes should have been evaluated and supported and there should have been more flexibility with the numbers.  As we know, unemployment is dropping.  That is good, but there is a need for more flexibility as there are schemes that cannot find workers.  SOLAS is on to us stating we have to have a full complement, but we cannot find workers.  Positions are advertised on the website.  Turas Nua will become something else if it is not dealt with.<\/p> <p> I would like the Minister to address the position of the self-employed who contribute so much and need more flexibility.  I welcomed the budgetary initiative for self-employed persons who are injured, including farmers and those engaged in a wide range of businesses.  I have never had a problem saying they should make some extra PRSI payments because they would do so in order to receive some benefits.  Many of them had businesses employing 10, 20 or 30 people, but then the whole lot crashed at the end of the boom, which was not their fault.  All of the staff received support payments, but the employers did not get a penny.  They have gone through a torrid time in the past seven or eight years.  While I welcome the Minister's initiative, I would like him to explain how the invalidity period, the 12-month period, will operate.  Will individuals have to wait for that long?  It would be a killer if they had to do so as they cannot wait.  They are proud people and will not beg.  They should not be expected to do so, but they need reasonable, modest supports, not a gravy train or anything like it.<\/p> <p> Will the Minster, please, try to knock together the heads of the officials - I do not mean physically - on social welfare benefits, medical cards especially, and also SUSI grants?  There should be connectivity.  We are not all operating little empires in a separate place and doing our own thing, saying, \"Tough,\" or, \"Sugar what the other people do.\"  That is an outdated system.  It was not in place at the time of the foundation of the State after the fathers of the country had fought to free it, set up our democracy and build it successfully.  In recent years, however, the bureaucratic machine has grown and grown.  I have said we need to rattle it.  We were promised by the Taoiseach at the talks, at which the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Leo Varadkar, was present, that there would be considerable reform of the Civil Service, in addition to new politics, but I have not seen any of it yet.  We need it.  These are simple and basic things that should be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000008#G00300","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478775900,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The Bill, while it contains some very welcome measures such as the increase in the old age pension and the income disregard for lone parents, as well as some other social protection measures, still begs the question as to what is the real value of the moneys for those who receive them.  One may say the extra &euro;5 for a pensioner is to be welcomed, but one quickly realises its value reduces dramatically, given the increase in the cost of living.  In some cases, it is absorbed by increases in other areas and swiftly taken back.  For example, an old age pensioner living in local authority accommodation may find that it will be taken away when the rent is adjusted upwards by the local authority.  The real value is not the &euro;5 decided on in the Bill.  A pensioner living in his or her own home which he or she has purchased may not have to contend with rent increases, but he or she will find that home and motor insurance costs and other bills are increasing.  The cost of living has to be considered in the context of decisions made.<\/p>  <p>  Lone parents have been affected disproportionately by several progressive budgets.  Households headed by a lone parent are most at risk of poverty.  It is very welcome that there are some improvements for lone parents.  When a child starts school, the voluntary contribution kicks in.  This is a cost.  The State is having an impact in different ways.  Deputy Mattie McGrath has made the point that there needs to be an holistic approach to these matters.  While there have been improvements in child care provision for lone parents who want to go back to work, we still have the highest child care costs in Europe and, I would say, the developed world.<\/p>  <p>  It is becoming increasingly difficult to keep a roof over one's head.  Lone parents, those in receipt of welfare payments and trying to find accommodation are still trying to top up where there is a rent issue.  Consequently, what they have in their pockets is often much less than what is perceived to be in them.  There does not appear to be a quick remedy, but there ought to be some sensitivity shown in the handling of this issue.  In some cases, the local authorities could be a little more helpful under the housing assistance payment scheme, in respect of which there is a 20% top-up payment permitted but which is not always allowed.  Sometimes people hide things they should not be hiding.  The many increases provided in the Bill may look acceptable on paper, but if we do not take measures to address the rapidly increasing basic cost of living, they will go but a little of the way towards helping those who find themselves suffering the most in trying to make ends meet.  There is a need for a whole-of-government approach to addressing the cost of living.  It should include people at work, those trying to run businesses and those in receipt of welfare payments.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of welfare schemes, the Bill makes provision for self-employed persons to safeguard them in a similar way to the manner in which PAYE workers are safeguarded.  There is no doubt that they are the most exposed group, yet they face the same increases in the cost of living and doing business as others.  Essentially, they are taking risks with their future.  Very often they are the last to be paid, particularly those involved in very small businesses.  They are taking risks where they could opt into a scheme.  They may not be opting in by virtue of the fact that there is ultimately no income to do so.  If we truly want to safeguard entrepreneurs and encourage innovation, we must recognise many of the barriers facing those who try to create jobs in the economy.  The measures contained in the Bill are welcome, but they ought to be part of a wider understanding of the need to support small and medium businesses.<\/p><p>I agree with a point made by Deputy Mattie McGrath that I have raised several times in the context of recent Social Welfare Bills, that being, people who are required to retire from Departments and other State bodies at 65 years of age despite there been a gap until their pensions are paid.  People are in disbelief that they must declare themselves to be unemployed.  This outrageous situation, which owes to the increase in the pension age, must be addressed.  As long as the mandatory retirement age is not changed correspondingly, people will remain in a precarious position.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the cost of living, Irish Rail last week announced a fare increase of 19% on the Maynooth line in my area.  Someone who earns a marginal benefit from going to work five days per week could see it quickly absorbed by that &euro;7 weekly increase.<br\/><br\/>I examined whether the fluctuations in sterling were being passed on by UK-based retailers.  I met the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, concerning this issue.  She has been helpful.  I hope that we will be able to get some outlets to consider what is happening.  There is a 20% mark-up on many items simply because they are being retailed in Ireland.  This does not have to do with the sterling differential.  We must be conscious of the value of money.  I cannot overstate this.<br\/><br\/>By its nature, our social protection system is designed to protect people in society and help ensure that they can play an active role therein.  We would all subscribe to this.  Every academic study across the globe has shown that, where people are equipped to participate in society, the gap between the haves and have nots is reduced and people who need a helping hand are assisted, a healthier and better functioning society will be delivered than one that has inequality at its root.  A study was published which examined unequal societies.  It found that more equal societies were healthier and had less crime.

It failed in the UK and was not an ideal model, but we picked it up, tweaked it and rolled it out in Ireland.  There are serious problems with it in terms of the appropriateness of people's placements.  For the life of me, I do not see the benefit of paying people to give others the impression of the prospect of work while cutting off those who do not work where they are placed even if that work is inappropriate.  I have serious doubts about this scheme.  When I asked at the Committee of Public Accounts about how much we were paying for it, I could not get an answer because there was a confidentiality clause in the contract.  This is not just about the contract, it is not just that there is a different approach.  For many people, and perhaps the majority, the scheme's outcomes will not be good.

Let us be clear, in that the budget was not our budget, but it was one over which Deputies on this side of the House had a degree of influence.  Compared with budget 2016, it is significantly different.  Consider budget 2016's changes in social welfare and USC payments.  Those who benefitted the most from the USC changes were on approximately &euro;70,000 and were probably &euro;800 per year better off.  If they were on &euro;20,000 or &euro;25,000, they were &euro;200 better off per year.  If they were old age pensioners, they were &euro;150 better off per year.  This year's budget is different.  To be fair to the Minister, while people may argue that the payment increases are modest, they are moving in the right direction.  I am not the only one saying this.  According to the ESRI's initial analysis, the greatest gains in budget 2017 would be seen by those in the lowest income quintile.  It is important to recognise that, while we would all like to see additional payments, the manner in which this has been done seems to have been fairer than was the case previously.  I would like to believe that some of that is down to the influence of Members on this side of the House.<\/p>  <p>  We welcome the &euro;5 per week increase in the State pension.  As the Minister knows, it was a central plank in our manifesto and was stipulated in the confidence and supply agreement.  Deputy O'Dea articulated the relevant points well.  We welcome the other social welfare payments that have also increased by &euro;5 per week and the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus to 85%.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to discuss pensioners.  The Minister is familiar with this issue.  The Bill is short in what it does, but there are considerable anomalies in the level of contributory State pension that someone receives.  The initial qualifying criterion is that one must have made 520 contributions.  In addition, though, there is an annual average.  People who have worked their entire lives will qualify at the maximum level, but those who have taken time out to study, rear families or so on have gaps in their pension contributions.  They could have made more total contributions than people who entered the workforce later yet they still receive smaller payments than them.  The Minister and his officials are aware of the anomalies.  The challenge is to introduce a system that addresses them without disadvantaging people who are already in the system.  We need a transparent process to deal with this matter.  Everyone has ideas and suggestions, but we need the benefit and support of the Department's technical expertise to test our proposals.  There is no point in introducing a change that will look good on paper but adversely affect people who are in receipt of pension payments now or will be in future.<\/p><p>That needs to be a transparent process so the proposed changes that come from this House or from the Committee on Social Protection would be tested and validated to ensure they do not have a negative impact.  That work should be done quickly.  As the Minister knows, the statistics clearly indicate that this issue affects women more than men.  There are fewer women in receipt of the full contributory State pension than men because they took time out from work in the past.  That needs to be looked at quickly, in a transparent manner and with the technical support of the Department.<\/p> <p> As I am talking about pensioners, I wish to refer specifically to widows and widowers.  Deputy Mattie McGrath made a point with which I agree, namely, that it is very difficult for a two income family to adjust to having one income and a living alone allowance.  People who are older, who are dependent on that allowance but who had two incomes previously, are still running the same house, still heating it and so forth.  The costs are not halved, yet their incomes are.  Research needs to be done on those costs and the living alone allowance must be targeted to meet them.<\/p> <p> I am sorry that the increases announced are not being introduced until March.  To be clear, I am happier that they are being introduced in March at &euro;5 per week for around 40 weeks rather than at &euro;4 per week for around 50 weeks because that will be the starting point for next year's budget.  However, from the point of view of fairness and equality, those who will see small adjustments and increases to their take-home pay will enjoy that benefit from the beginning of the year but those who are dependent on social welfare payments will not see increases until March.  There is an inherent unfairness in that.  This is not particular to the Minister for Social Protection but relates to the manner in which the budget was framed.  Collective responsibility at the Cabinet table did not deliver fairness.  Benefits should be enjoyed by all sectors of society at the same time.  If changes in taxation are to be effective from January, then changes in social welfare payments should be effective from the same date.<\/p> <p> Reference has been made to additional allowances such as the fuel allowance, telephone allowance and so forth.  As a former Minister of State, I had responsibility for pendant alarms, among other things.  I visited many community groups, particularly in rural Ireland, for whom such alarms were hugely important.  They may not be so important in urban areas but in rural areas, where I saw them operating, they were extremely important and in that context, the removal of the telephone allowance has had an adverse effect.  I welcome and support the &euro;5 increase in the State pension and the other primary social welfare payments, as well as the restoration of the Christmas bonus.  I also welcome the increase in the income disregard for lone parents from &euro;90 to &euro;110.<\/p> <p> I support the various provisions in the Bill for self-employed people, particularly the introduction of optical and dental benefit.  I attended a briefing given by departmental officials on these provisions.  Section 9 refers to treatment benefit.  There are two elements to this section, the first being the extension of treatment benefit to the self-employed with effect from March, the second being the extension of treatments under the dental and optical schemes to self-employed people, that is, those paying class S PRSI.  Section 4 extends the invalidity pension to the self-employed.  It provides for the extension of eligibility for invalidity pension to self-employed persons.  Self-employed workers paying class S PRSI and who meet the qualifying conditions will have access to the existing invalidity pension scheme which currently provides cover for employees in the event of long-term illness.<\/p> <p> Self-employed recipients will have an entitlement to an invalidity pension on a similar basis to those who are employees.  This section will be subject to a commencement order and will not come into effect until December 2017.  I am not convinced that it would take that long to implement such a change.  I urge the Minister to review that date to determine if it could be brought forward.  While I understand that there may be technical issues in terms of administration and so forth, the delay does seem to be excessive.  I am sure that the Minister will argue that there are budgetary implications but the commencement seems to be a very long way out.<\/p> <p> In the time remaining, I wish to speak about lone parents, as other Deputies have done.  We know that children of lone parents are at greater risk of poverty in comparison to children with two parents.  Without getting into the figures, the Department has introduced new schemes, reduced the age limits for entitlement to the lone parent allowance and so forth.  With the exception of the increase in the income disregard, there is nothing in this budget specifically for lone parents.  There must be a very robust evaluation of the new schemes being rolled out by the Department.  The Committee on Social Protection is looking at this and will produce a report shortly.  Such an evaluation is needed to ensure that the goals and targets set by the Department are being met, not just in a quantitative sense, but also in terms of the quality of life for lone parent families.  That is crucially important.  There has been a huge amount of debate on lone parents, their payments and the need for them to re-enter the workforce.  However, they have greater barriers to such re-entry because of a lack of child care and other supports.  Lone parents are doing the work of two people in many cases.  The changes that have been introduced by the Department relating to lone parents need to be assessed.  Officials from the Department indicated to the Oireachtas committee that it was too early to determine the effects of these changes and that research has not been done in this area yet.  This needs to be researched on a continuous basis so that any unintended consequences or adverse effects can be dealt with in a timely manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000011#K00600","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478777100,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I welcome the various initiatives and payment increases contained in the Social Welfare Bill but I want to focus on the amount of money that is lost through fraud and error within the Department.  I ask the Minister to outline exactly what he is doing to ensure that the current levels of error and fraud do not continue.  It appears, from the various cases I have studied, that people who are marginalised and in receipt of benefit of some kind are allowed to draw payments in error for a considerable length of time before the error is acknowledged.  While current legislation provides that a certain percentage of overpayments can be drawn back from the individuals concerned, the fact of the matter is that they do not have the money to pay the Department back.  An individual on a social welfare payment could be faced with the prospect of having to pay back &euro;20,000, &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000, such is the level of error that can occur.  It is not right that any individual could have been overpaid for that amount of time without someone realising that something was wrong.  This is either a system failure or a staff failure and the Minister should look at it closely.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of fraud, how much of the &euro;1 billion lost through fraud and error is lost through fraud alone?  The Minister must quantify that and determine how best to deal with it.  The sums of money that are lost through fraud and error are vast.  If one thinks of how that money could be applied to the various headings within the social welfare provisions, one realises that people would benefit by far more than the &euro;5 per week increase that they received in the budget.  The Minister could have considerably more resources at his disposal to give to social welfare recipients if resources were put in place to assist departmental staff to improve the systems and to ensure that erroneous or fraudulent payments are discovered early and stopped.<\/p>  <p>  In his response to this debate, I ask the Minister to provide details on the amount of money outstanding to the Department due to fraud or error.  I also ask him to confirm the total amount of error related overpayments that people are currently attempting to pay back.<\/p><p>Could he define what has been accumulated over the years, how it is being paid back and what the success rate is?  I would suggest to the Minister that the success rate in terms of repayment is not great but that the Government does need to focus support staff and the systems to ensure it does not continue to occur year in, year out.  This has been reported on by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it is not just something I have picked out of the sky.  It is an issue.  We should always look at the other side of the balance sheet when we are dealing with expenditure.  It is not just how you spend the money and the benefits you pay out.  It is about how we can ensure we do not have the type of losses we have seen over the years, so perhaps we would have more to pay out than what we have.  <\/p> <p> I take issue with the Department in respect of the self employed.  The self employed take the risk and create the employment and, hopefully, the profits on which they pay taxes, which come into the State and are thereafter shared out to the less well off and those who need that State support.  However, those very people - either individuals or families -  are not themselves supported.  The Minister is taking an initiative in this budget but far more needs to be done to ensure that businesspeople who take the risk but who fall foul of their project or who just cannot continue for one reason or another are given the appropriate supports that are necessary.  If we can learn anything from the US presidential election or indeed from Brexit, it is that there is a feeling widespread in Ireland, the US, the UK and throughout Europe that, to take a phrase from the US presidential election, there are people who have been forgotten.  The pledge from President-elect Trump was that those who have been forgotten will not continue to be forgotten.  We seem to have a number of people who have been left behind by the State and who have been forgotten.  <\/p> <p> A lot of those people are within the social welfare system.  I would question whether some of the new initiatives that are taken in the Department to take people from social welfare and put them into training and whatever else might be made available to them are valuable or successful.  I have seen cases where the Department is suggesting that a client goes on a community employment scheme and the other agency of the State is suggesting something entirely different.  The Department is the one I would be led by but apparently when the person goes into that agency, they are then outside the social protection network.  This needs to be looked at because I have come across a number of clients who are treated badly by that agency.  The one thing I have noticed in this House since I was first elected is that the Department and its officials are very prompt and very good at what they do.  They do need support, as I suggested earlier.  This new agency does not have the flexibility that is required to deal with some of the issues that arise in individual cases.  When I as a public representative have to intervene for those people, the chances of getting a phone call back from that agency are nil.  The chance of getting to grips with and informing it of the anomalies in its system is nil.  On the other hand, the Department has been excellent in terms of the learning process about their clients and the issues we raise as public representatives in the context of a better service for them.  <\/p> <p> Turning to the issue of social welfare benefits and local authority rents, where a benefit is given to a recipient who is marginalised and in need of support from social welfare, another arm of the State should not take back some of that money.  If, say, a fiver is given, some other part of the State will take &euro;1, &euro;2 or &euro;3 and the fiver becomes nothing.  While the Minister for Finance may say there are no new taxes, there are many new taxes and many impositions on elderly people in particular in terms of prescription charges, their health care and so on.  They are battling with the State day in, day out and they have a sense that the State is actually beating them up.  It is not being responsive to them, is not giving them the care they need and is not ensuring that they are offered the protection of the Government for which they, or indeed all of us in this House, voted.<\/p> <p> This is what alienates a lot of people from politics.  They look upon us here as an elite that does not understand their problems when in fact, it is bureaucracy that cannot be gotten past to influence them, not to do something wrong but to do something right at a basic level, which is understanding the customers they have and dealing with them promptly and efficiently.  If that was to happen, we would not have as many people at our clinics because the State would actually be working.  I am suggesting to the Minister that there are reforms that are necessary within the Department that will benefit the spending of that money but there is also a need for humanity and compassion in every Department.  Otherwise, we lose the support and understanding of the people because they see themselves as being the forgotten people.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000012#L00200","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478777700,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Speaking in this Chamber I said last month that this budget was another missed opportunity to move towards a fairer society.  The intervening few weeks have not only reinforced that view, it has become clear.  It has become clear that the budget is further enforcing a two-tier system that this Government is implementing across our public services.  Jobseeker's payments increase by &euro;5 but if someone is aged between 18 and 14, they will get &euro;2.70 and if they are aged 15, they will get &euro;3.80.  A secondary school teacher who has recently entered the profession will be on a lower rate than previous entrants.  New members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are on a starting salary of &euro;23,500 are sleeping in cars because they are unable to afford spiralling rent costs.  It is clear to young people in this country that this is a two-tier society where the Government treats them differently based on their age and the fact that they are starting off in their professions.  The costs of living for a jobseeker do not vary much between the ages 22 and 26 but the payment does.  A jobseeker aged between 18 and 24 gets a payment of &euro;102.70.  A jobseeker aged 25 gets &euro;147.80 and someone over 26 get the guts of &euro;193 per week.  No wonder our young people are emigrating.  At the same time Deputies in this House are considering giving themselves a wage increase.  It does not make sense.<\/p>  <p>  I also said that the budget last month was a very mean one.  I now think that this is an understatement.  It is a vindictive budget where the Government divides young people merely by age.  It is also vindictive to pensioners.  The &euro;5 increase, which will not appear until March, will be gone soon after.  It will be gone to their yearly bin charges with no option for instalments or no bin waiver and the increased costs of living, such as car insurance and water charges for which no provision was made in the budget.  Lone parents will now be better off transferring from in-work benefits to a jobseeker's payment.  It is as if this Government and its enablers, Fianna F&aacute;il, do not even consider what these budget measures do to the young, the vulnerable and the elderly.  It does not cross their minds when they draft these measures.  This mean and vindictive budget makes people feel less as citizens and more as a burden on our society.  That is what this Government is doing.<\/p><p>It is time for the Government to change that attitude because we have to cherish all the children of our nation equally and not go down the road of this two-tier system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000013#M00200","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478778300,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1478778300,"counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000014#N00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1478778300,"counter":35,"content":"<p>While today's media coverage is dominated by President-elect Trump, I wish to bring to the T&aacute;naiste's attention an issue of a domestic nature that has not gone away - the issue of housing.  A few weeks ago two teachers from our constituency approached me.  They were concerned about the welfare of two of their students, who are brothers.  I met the teachers and subsequently met the family.  I will not identify who they are.  The parents and six children in this family are living in a hotel in Dublin city.  They are commuting daily to Clondalkin to attend school.  Their plight living in a hotel is not a good one.  There are no cooking or laundry facilities.  Their plight has endured since we were elected to this House; they have been in the same hotel since February.<\/p><p>I know that Members of this House from all parties are concerned about the housing crisis and a housing committee was established in advance of the formation of Government.  Subsequently the Government produced its report on the housing issue, Rebuilding Ireland - an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  That report was launched four months ago and was specific in regard to a range of actions attached to it.  Many Members of this House while having different views on it, fully support and endorse the report and were concerned that the actions would be implemented as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>I am concerned that we have a lot of rhetoric with launch after launch.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, is launching another pillar of the report today.  The implementation of the report is of particular concern to me.  It is worth noting that in the four months since the report was launched, according to a report published by <i>daft.ie<\/i>this week house rental prices in Dublin in particular, but also nationally, have increased significantly.  Those in homelessness continue to rise as indicated by the figures that were published.  Approximately 2,500 children are in emergency accommodation<\/p><p>The first two actions specified in Rebuilding Ireland - an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness would have an impact on the family I described.

That is why this is a priority focus for the Government and for the Hose.  It is why a comprehensive plan has been put forward.  Clearly the lack of supply of homes is central to wider problems in the housing sector as the Deputy described it.  Lack of supply is driving up prices and increasing rents, and in turn influences homelessness.  As the Deputy knows, every action is being taken to ensure that families are not in the situation he has described.  None of us here wants to see one extra family having to be accommodated in a hotel.  Moving into a hotel is not part of the solution to homelessness and we do not want it to be part of the solution.  That is why the announcements have been made and the action has been taken.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy played a role in chairing the committee that did the preliminary work in examining this.  We recognise those very significant challenges.  Today the Minister has made a further announcement on the important point we have to deal with - the fast-track delivery arrangements for the 30,000 new homes in Dublin, Cork and other urban locations around the country.  Every action under pillar 3 is designed to kick-start badly needed additional supply.  A key element, as the Deputy knows, is the identification of the major urban housing development sites with the potential to deliver up to 30,000 additional homes in locations on existing lands, some of them close to our constituency, where there is key demand so that we can ensure that people have housing.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has spoken about the number of families who have already moved out of homelessness - it is over 1,000 this year.  I believe I gave those figures this day last week here.  Clearly fast-track housing is under construction.  Over 300 units are at various stages of construction by local authorities and those will be made available to families as soon as possible.  The budget to support those organisations working with homelessness has been increased in order to help them ensure every unit they have is available to families.  Local authorities throughout the country are ensuring that vacant properties are returned to use in a much more accelerated way than previously.  We all know that was a problem, but it is now being done in many areas.  The Government has made every effort on the various initiatives the Deputy outlined.  It is the unrelenting focus of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to ensure that every unit that can become available will come available as quickly as possible.

However, in the budget the Government failed to deal with vacant properties in the private sector.  The Government committed &euro;6 million to deliver 150 properties.

In Dublin one in four households rent.  Gone are the days of renting being the preserve of transient students, low income families or those who were saving to buy their first home.  Increasingly, the private rented sector is where low and middle income families, and those who are languishing on council waiting lists, spend long periods of time.  For three years the rent crisis has spiralled out of control.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, average rents across the State are now &euro;1,000 per month and in Dublin average rents are in excess of &euro;1,500 per month.  Rents are now higher than they were at the peak of the boom.  In the T&aacute;naiste's own constituency, a family renting a three-bedroom house in Foxborough or in Earlsfort can expect to pay &euro;1,700 per month.  That is more than &euro;20,000 per year for an average family home.  Low and middle income families who rent are now paying between 40% and 60% of their disposable income on rents.  Families relying on rent supplement or housing assistance payment, HAP, are being priced out of the market.  A 200% increase in family homelessness in the last two years is directly related to the crisis in the rented sector.  Tonight some 2,500 children will spend another night in emergency accommodation, many because of the failures of the T&aacute;naiste and her Government since taking office.  The mealy-mouthed measures introduced in 2014 did nothing to stop the spiralling cost of accommodation.  When Sinn F&eacute;in introduced the Rent Certainty Bill in June, Fine Gael - enthusiastically supported by Fianna F&aacute;il - voted it down.  That legislation would have saved hard-pressed families who are renting up to &euro;2,000 per year.  The T&aacute;naiste has said that we are pre-empting the Minister, Deputy Coveney's strategy for the private rented sector which is due later this year.  Yet, only weeks later the Minister introduced legislation seeking to amend the Residential Tenancies Act.

They voted because they are unhappy with the <i>status quo<\/i>.  One of the changes championed by the President-elect has been the change in immigration policy.  When congratulating President-elect Trump yesterday, the Taoiseach said that he also intended to work closely with the new administration and newly elected United States Congress to pursue comprehensive immigration reform.  On 1 September, however, Donald Trump said that there will be no amnesty and that he will set up a special deportation task force.  He said that one cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering that country.  Mr. Trump's position is diametrically opposed to the stated policy of Ireland.  Mr. Trump has said that he would deport illegal immigrants from the United States within 100 days of taking office.  That clock is ticking.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will indicate what the Government's strategy is to secure immigration reform on the basis of an agreed position by the House.

We have had all along a two-pronged approach to the issue of immigration reform - trying to regularise the status of the undocumented and trying to get a dedicated quota for legal emigration from Ireland.  On the former, we have pressed and will continue to press for a solution for the undocumented Irish.  We all know of individual cases and the trauma and difficulties for Irish people who find themselves in this position.  As the Deputy knows, both he and Ministers in the previous Government consistently raised the issue with their US counterparts at every opportunity.  The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, raises it continuously and will continue to do so.  Of course, as we well know, a new administration and a new Congress will take time to settle in, but we fully intend to pursue the issue in our contacts with the administration and Congress and encourage and promote realistic possibilities for a solution.  The should be in no doubt that this remains a priority.  The relationship between Ireland and the United States has a long history and there are many ties that bind us.  This will continue to be the case.  The relationship between Ireland and the United States is complex and multilayered and based on a shared community, as well as our political and economic ties.  Less than 48 hours have passed since the election result was confirmed.  We obviously do not know yet the likely composition of the Trump Administration, but, as the Deputy said, the Taoiseach has already made contact and had a preliminary conversation.

The disclosures, in which it was alleged the Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, was directly involved in a systematic and organised campaign to discredit the whistleblower Sergeant Maurice McCabe with colleagues, politicians and journalists, were due to be investigated by the former judge, who is due to conclude and report back next week.  However, he was given no powers of compellability and no terms of reference.  Attempts made by other whistleblowers to have their cases heard also, as they too have been the victims of bullying and harassment since making protected disclosures, were ignored, despite the fact that their testimony and experiences were current.  They go to the very heart of the systemic problem in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - what is said in public and what is done privately are entirely different.  It was hardly an auspicious start to the inquiry when this was its foundation.  One would be forgiven for thinking it was put together as a fig leaf for the Minister to take cover behind for her lack of action in this regard.  This view has been strengthened as we find out that with a week to go to the issuing of his report, the former judge has not requested any material from either of the two whistleblowers.  He has not met or even spoken to either man.  In fact, the only interaction was request, approximately two weeks ago, to their legal teams to pass on the protected disclosure to the Garda Commissioner.  We could not make it up.<\/p>  <p>  What sort of inquiry does the Minister honestly expect us to believe this is?  While this has been going on, we have had the Garda Commissioner appear at the justice committee with senior officers who are at the heart of many of the protected disclosure complaints.  At the same meeting she misled the committee by stating she was not privy to information on a campaign of harassment against any member of the force when she was actually in direct receipt of 14 letters outlining precisely the situation.  She has been the subject of a detailed section 41 complaint on which the Minister has been briefed.  We are awaiting GSOC's finding.  She has lost the support of the ranks of the force by intervening in a partisan way in their legitimate pay claim with threats of martial law.

The figures show that prisoners in Ireland are held in solitary confinement for 22 to 23 hours a day for months on end and in some cases for more than a year.  On 1 January, a total of 51 inmates across various Irish prisons were being held in cells for at least 22 hours a day and half of them were there for over 100 days.  At least nine of those prisoners had spent over a year in such conditions.  The UN and scientific evidence are unequivocal in regard to these matters.  More than 15 days in solitary confinement means serious and sometimes permanent psychological damage.  The UN special rapporteur on torture was even more unequivocal about Ireland's practice of locking up people in solitary confinement when he said recently &quot;There is no question to me that those people are suffering what constitutes cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and perhaps even torture&quot;.<\/p><p>The Bill creates a definition of &quot;solitary confinement&quot; for the first time in Irish law.  This is critical because in the absence of a definition, those in authority can hide behind words.  In fairness, when I asked the T&aacute;naiste about this situation recently, she used many different terms including &quot;23-hour lock up&quot;, &quot;punishment&quot; and &quot;restricted regimes&quot;.  All of this language means it is difficult to access data and keep tabs on people's circumstance and it has potentially serious consequences for prisoners' human rights.  We need to call it what it is, which is solitary confinement, and to accept just how serious it is and how damaging the consequences of its use and abuse can be.<\/p><p>In accordance with the position of the United Nations, the Bill seeks to provide that no prisoner shall spend more than 15 consecutive days in solitary confinement and that this should be an exceptional measure of last resort.  It seeks to ban the use of solitary confinement as a punishment and prohibit the practice for those diagnosed with mental illness.  Sadly, it too often happens that prisoners who are deemed to be unmanageable are placed in solitary confinement when what they need in reality is a serious psychological intervention.  Putting them in solitary confinement actually makes their condition worse, which is terrible for the prisoners themselves, appalling for prison staff who are on the frontline and have to deal with difficult people who need specialised intervention, and damaging for society when these people are ultimately released, as they are in all instances, because their problems will not only be unaddressed but in fact accentuated.  In moving the Bill, I am conscious that the Government will be before the UN committee next July.  It would be good if we had passed the Bill in advance as it will be one of the issues on which the Government will be questioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000019#S01700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1478781300,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000019#S01800","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1478781300,"counter":136,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000019#S01900","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478781300,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1478781300,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000019#S02100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1478781300,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000019#S02200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478781300,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Residential Institutions Statutory Fund (Amendment) Bill 2016: First Stage","time":1478781300,"counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000019#S02400"},{"type":"speech","time":1478781300,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act amend the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012; to provide for extra approved services for former residents, in accordance with section 3 of the Act; to increase the efficiency in which applicants are processed; to remove a commitment in the Act to establish a special account in the name of the Minister for Health.<\/blockquote><p>The reason I have drafted the Bill is because I have received an avalanche of correspondence from Caranua applicants who have been utterly demoralised by the way in which that organisation is administering the fund.  The people involved were the victims of our industrial schools and they are incredibly vulnerable persons who have already been damaged by a shameful episode in our history.  They must be treated with severe kindness, understanding and care because of their experiences.  However, the experiences of those who have contacted me have been almost exclusively negative in terms of their interaction with Caranua.  Subsequent to us tabling the Bill, the annual report of the appeals officer for 2015 has indicated a rise in the number of appeals and highlighted precisely some of the failings my legislation is designed to address.  The provisions of the Bill are very much in tandem with the findings of the report and constitute an attempt to address some of the failings in the scheme.<\/p><p>It should include other survivors who were not previously in receipt of a settlement, which is also a measure recommended by the appeals officer.  Why should people be excluded for a second time when they have already been left out?  It provides for a widening of the number of services and types of services of which people can avail to include, for example, the cost of a funeral, which is something that frequently arises.  There are a number of limitations in the original Act which do not need to be there.  <\/p> <p> The Bill has a clause that removes the promise of surplus funds being distributed to the children's hospital, because it is very clear that there will be no surplus funds from the administration of the scheme.  The report of the appeals officer is something I recommend all Deputies read.  It highlights the breakdown in communications between the administrators of the fund and the clients, with very long delays, unclear guidelines and protracted procedures which have been very damaging for people who have been very badly let down by the State already.  The Bill goes some way to address some of the shortcomings and I would be happy to see it progressed urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000019#S02500","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478781900,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000020#T00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1478781900,"counter":145,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000020#T00300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478781900,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1478781900,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000020#T00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1478781900,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000020#T00600","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478781900,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"EU Migration Crisis: Motion","time":1478781900,"counter":150,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000020#T00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1478781900,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>&ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

One which has been to the forefront in the lives of many people in my constituency is the plight of self-employed people and the fact they get very little out of the PRSI they pay, except when they come to the end of their working days and are entitled to pensions.  Many people who have fallen on hard times or have fallen ill need to have a proper PRSI package in place in order to ensure they can avail of various services.  While we have gone some distance on that, the system is nowhere near where it needs to be.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the various programmes in place for people in receipt of jobseeker's benefit or allowance.  A woman in my constituency came to see me recently.  She is separated and is 62 years of age.  She was on a T&uacute;s scheme for a year.  When she finished it she was delighted because she was working every day in her community and was involved in the tidy towns committee, such as planting flowers and painting.  She loved her work and wanted to continue doing that.  She had hoped when this work had finished that she would be able to go onto a community employment scheme.  She was about to be accepted onto one, when she received a letter from JobPath.  The shutters came down and she is unable to go anywhere else.  The truth is there are very few jobs for anyone in rural County Leitrim, particularly for those who are 62 years of age.<\/p>  <p>  A woman in her early 60s is in a similar situation.  She lives in a rural area and does not drive.  For the past number of years she has looked after her elderly parents and now that they have passed away she has been refused disability allowance, despite being in poor health.  She ended up in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and received a letter from JobPath telling her to go to Carrick-on-Shannon twice a week.  It is almost 40 miles away from where she lives and she cannot drive.  She is expected to write CVs and prepare for jobs that do not exist.  The scheme is totally out of kilter with reality.<\/p>  <p>  A man in his mid-50s runs a small farm and is in receipt of farm assist.  He is in a similar situation, in that having completed a scheme he hoped to get onto another community employment scheme.  Such schemes are in place for people in rural Ireland, fit into their lifestyles and are very progressive.  The man to whom I refer has a low level of educational attainment but now finds that he is expected to work on computers and learn how to write CVs.<\/p>  <p>  I struggled with these situations and phoned Seetec, the company which runs the programme in our area.  It was like beating my head off a brick wall.  It is a private company which has been hired by the State to carry out the service.  It is simply a means of humiliating, putting to one side and dehumanising people.  It is totally wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I went to see a film, \"I, Daniel Blake\", yesterday.  It is based on the social welfare system in Britain.  Everything I have been told by the people in my constituency was in the film.  It is about a man who lost his job as a carpenter and entered a system that was designed to dehumanise and frustrate him at every turn.  It is never good to tell anyone the end of a film, but the man dies from despair.  That is the reality of the situation.  The film was symbolic of our system.  We have copied a model which has failed in Britain.  We are privatising what is supposed to be a service for people.  It is the most retrograde step in the social welfare system of the past number of years.  We have developed a model to destroy people's lives.<\/p>  <p>  Every Deputy has examples of people in a similar position to those to whom I referred and have come up against the machine of Seetec and JobPath.  It is a machine that blocks, wears down, destroys and dehumanises people.  In the past, many references were made to raging against the machine.  We need to rage against this machine.  I implore the Minister and the Government to rethink their position.  Other schemes were recognised as failures.  This is another scheme which simply does not work and needs to be taken asunder.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that there are no jobs for an awful lot of people in my constituency.  There are certainly no jobs for people in the later years of life who need assistance.  They find that the current system is blocking, frustrating and destroying their lives.  It is time that, above all else, this scheme was eliminated.  A vast amount of taxpayers' money has been used to employ a company to run a scheme which simply does not work.  It is time to recognise that at an early stage and dismantle it immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000020#T01400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1478781900,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I concur with Deputy Kenny.  JobPath is shambolic.

It is an issue which has been raised in the House for many years.  A 2013 report on tackling back to school costs is still sitting on a shelf.  We need action on this issue.  Every year it affects thousands of households across the State, in particular those from disadvantaged backgrounds.  It makes a mockery of our so-called free education system.  The Bill provides no assistance to those families.  It does not increase the back to school clothing and footwear allowance that was slashed under previous Governments.  It does not increase funding for the school book grant scheme, despite evidence that one third of secondary schools in the State do not provide a school book rental scheme.  I welcome the &euro;3 million increase in the school meals programme.  However, this is insufficient to increase the service to the level that is required.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the recent announcement that jobseekers under 26 years of age will receive the full rate of the back to education allowance, but this is long overdue.

Spreading a few euro here and there does not address them.  The same applies to the Social Welfare Bill which we are discussing.  Budget 2017 failed to tackle poverty and the inequalities throughout society.  It failed to bring about fairness and address in a meaningful way those trapped in poverty.  While some elements of the Bill are welcome, in its present form, it does not do anything to address the inequalities inherent in society.  That is the big weakness of the Bill.  The budget further marginalised young people, lone parents and those who lived alone and had no vision to move people from being dependent on social welfare payments towards education or meaningful jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Older people living alone are among the most vulnerable in society and many of them rely on the State pension.  They face unique pressures because of their limited incomes.  For instance, increased prescription charges are a huge burden, yet the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il seem to think a simple pension increase of &euro;5 per week will resolve the difficulties they face.  These are the people who, in many cases, worked all their lives to bring about and support the society we have today.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill fails to address the significant inconsistencies in the pension system.  In Ireland there is a 35% gender pension gap.  There is something wrong with the system and it is not solely the result of different wage levels.  There was a marriage bar that affected women.  There are also those who were involved in child rearing or took a caring role in the home.  This impacts on many of those who attend my advice centre.  Other changes introduced by the previous Government and the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, a Labour Party Minister, are also having a negative impact on those applying for pensions.  A person was able to receive a pension when he or she had 260 contributions, but now 520 are required.  A caller to my advice centre told me that she had started work at 13 years of age and worked until pension age, but there were gaps in her employment history.  Some of these gaps were used to rear children and look after someone at home, but they now mean that she is being told she is not entitled to a full contributory pension.  Then there are those who started work much later in their lives.  They may have stayed at school for longer.  Their work history is minuscule compared to that of others, yet they are in receipt of a higher pension payment.  The argument is made that this is to protect the State, but the system is inherently wrong and unfair. <\/p>  <p>  As Deputies, we are all aware that there is an added difficulty for those who reach 65 years of age.  In many cases, for contractual reasons, they have to retire at 65 years of age, but they must be 66 to receive the pension.  For the first time in their lives, many of them are being forced to sign on for a year.  Anyone who has advocated for senior citizens has argued that the system needs to change and that we should not be forcing the people concerned into community employment schemes or onto the dole.  It is undignified for those who have worked all their lives to be pressurised into doing this.  There has been no attempt to address this difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  Fuel poverty is a serious problem faced by the country.  I am acutely aware, as we go through a considerable cold spell, that 28% of households throughout the State experience fuel poverty.  Ireland has one of the highest levels of excess winter mortality in Europe.  People in this country are dying from the cold, yet there was no attempt in the budget to address the problem.  People are freezing to death in their homes in the 21st century.  We are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising, yet some citizens are dying from the cold and budget 2017 did not attempt to address the problem.<\/p>  <p>  Budgets are about choices and the Government had fairer options.  In its alternative budget Sinn F&eacute;in proposed an older persons' package which would have been worth more than &euro;410 million and provided for a three week extension to the fuel allowance scheme, a &euro;9.50 increase in the living alone allowance and the reinstatement of the transitional pension for those aged 65 years of age, as well as further measures to address the inconsistencies within the pension system.   People only become aware of the difficulties when they apply for their entitlements. The Government should amend the Bill because the House needs to address the huge difficulties which are being experienced every day.  <\/p>  <p>  Constituents have to wait staggering lengths of time for benefit claims to be processed.  One constituent had to wait more than eight months to be awarded carer's allowance.  She needed to give up work to look after her father who had bowel cancer and she faced severe financial difficulties as a result of the long delay.  Another caller to my office had waited more than six months for a non-contributory pension claim to be assessed.  A reply to a freedom of information request I had submitted stated the average waiting time for a carer's allowance claim to be processed was 40 weeks.  That is totally unacceptable.  The reply also stated the overall waiting times for other benefits included 27 weeks for a non-contributory State pension claim to be processed and 21 weeks for an invalidity pension claim to be assessed.  At a time when people are most in need and may be drained emotionally and, in many cases, financially, the State is failing them by their having to wait unreasonable lengths of time to receive their entitlements.  I call on the Minister for Social Protection to instigate an investigation into the unacceptable delays and to increase resources in order that claims can be dealt with more efficiently and within a more acceptable timeframe.<\/p><p>Waiting times for some carer's allowance applications are scandalous and unacceptable.  Something needs to be done to address the problem and this will require more resources.  The Bill does not address the difficulties many of those in receipt of social welfare payments face.  In addition, there are no pathways available to those who are trying to access the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000021#U00200","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478783100,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I propose to share time with Deputies Aindrias Moynihan and Fiona O'Loughlin.<\/p><p>Under the confidence and supply arrangement agreed by the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael parties, my party secured a commitment that available resources will be allocated on the basis of a ratio of at least 2:1 in favour of public expenditure over tax cuts.  This ratio has been exceeded in budget 2017, with a 3:1 split between spending on services and investment in citizens, on the one hand, and reduced taxation, on the other.<\/p><p>The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has demonstrated that the least well-off will benefit most from budget 2017 in proportional terms.  That being said, the gains arising from the budget are modest and nobody will be substantially better off as a result of it.<\/p><p>The budget and Social Welfare Bill provide for an increase of &euro;5 per week to core welfare payments.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party secured agreement on increases to the State pension in the confidence and supply arrangement.  We welcome the increases in weekly welfare payments to carers, the disabled, lone parents and the unemployed.  It is imperative that the benefits of a growing economy and improving public finances are distributed to all those who depend on the State for a significant proportion of their income needs.  Excluding the State pension, this is the first increase in weekly welfare rates since 2009 and it will go some way towards ensuring the social welfare payments these groups depend on to maintain their income keep pace with the modest inflation which has occurred in the past seven years.<\/p><p>A core objective of social welfare payments is to provide recipients with a minimally adequate standard of living in the context of that which prevails in society as a whole.  Therefore, subject to the continued improvement of the economy and public finances, we should aim to ensure the relative position of welfare recipients keeps pace with increases in average earnings in future.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il also welcomes the increase in the Christmas bonus to 85% of a person&rsquo;s weekly social welfare payment.  This will assist individuals and families in receipt of long-term social welfare supports with the additional costs of Christmas expenditure.  <\/p><p>On the free travel scheme, in June 2014, Age Action Ireland felt compelled to launch a campaign under the slogan &quot;Hands off our free travel pass&quot;.  A working group comprised of representatives of the National Transport Authority, Department of Social Protection and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform wanted savings to be made to the scheme.  Options considered included a restriction on the hours of use of the free travel pass, the imposition of a small subscription charge and the introduction of restrictions on the use of one mode of transport.  Thankfully, nothing came of these deliberations in budget 2015.  Nevertheless, pressure from civil servants and others to modify the free travel scheme will continue and we must be vigilant in that regard.  <\/p><p>While the free travel pass is a small benefit, it has a significant impact on the lives of elderly people.  It allows them to get out of the house, travel to all parts of the country and engage in social activities.  It does more than anything else to combat social isolation.  The scheme's effects were revolutionary when it was first introduced and it should not be touched.  All Deputies should support Age Action Ireland when it proclaims, &quot;Hands off our free travel scheme&quot;.<\/p><p>Community Law and Mediation, formally the Northside Community Law Centre, is an independent community based organisation that works to empower individuals experiencing disadvantage by providing free legal representation, education and mediation services to the community.  At a national level, the organisation seeks to have a wider impact through its campaigns for law reform and by acting as a resource for other advocacy organisations.  Community Law and Mediation is part-funded by the Department of Social Protection and this funding from the Department regularly comes under threat.  The Minister will launch the organisation's annual report on 30 November 2016.  Its funding should be maintained and increased because it provides an invaluable service.  <\/p><p>One key area for which the Social Welfare Bill does not make provision is the need to increase equality of access to the contributory State pension for a considerable cohort of women.  A number of women have been in contact with me in recent months highlighting their inability to access the full State pension.  Under an anomaly in the system, a woman who exited the workforce prior to 1994 to look after her children or a relative is not entitled to disregard years spent outside the workforce when her social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is that many of the women who took time out of the workforce prior to 1994 may not have sufficient contributions to access the full State pension.  In contrast, those who have left the workforce since 1994 to raise a family or care for a relative are entitled, under the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, to have up to 20 years of time spent in the home disregarded when it comes to calculating their yearly average social insurance contribution, thus making it easier to qualify for the full pension. <\/p><p>The Government should move towards a position in which women who exited the workforce prior to 1994 have the same pension rights as those who currently benefit under the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme.  A concerted effort to end the unfair treatment these women experience would make a strong statement that this country values the social contribution of everyone who took time out of work to care for their family.  It is essential that future budgets move to ensure that women who have taken time out of the workforce to care for children or a sick or elderly family member are not penalised when it comes to calculating their entitlement to the contributory State pension.<\/p><p>  Through our responsible approach to Government formation, Fianna F&aacute;il has achieved a greater emphasis on fairness and improving public services after years of underinvestment.  While we have experienced a considerable improvement in our economic fortunes in the past three years, a sustained commitment in future budgets is required to guarantee a social recovery for all of our people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000022#V00200","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1478783100,"counter":163,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Bill has been tabled by a Fine Gael-Independent coalition Government.  While the budget was not a Fianna F&aacute;il document, my party did not sat on the fence but instead played an active Opposition role and influenced the budget from the outside.  After five years of harsh, punitive and regressive budgets under the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, we are finally beginning to see an element of fairness restored in the social welfare system as a result of this Fianna F&aacute;il influence.<\/p>  <p>  While the steps taken in the Bill are small, they are moving in the right direction.  The Government is changing the direction in which it and its predecessor were moving and it is being forced to reverse some previous cuts.  I understand, for example, that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, acknowledged that this is the first socially just budget in years.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the pension was a key commitment in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party manifesto.  Our aim is to increase the payment by &euro;30 over the five-year term of the Government.  This increase has been provided for in the confidence and supply arrangement agreed earlier this year.  The increase of &euro;5 in the pension is a small step in the right direction and a positive move. <\/p>  <p>  Despite claims to the contrary, older people were not protected in the five regressive budgets introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.<\/p><p>They suffered cuts to secondary benefits such as the electricity and telephone allowances, with increased taxes, including property and other charges such as house insurance, while their incomes were capped.<\/p> <p> While the budget is a step in the right direction, much more needs to be done.  Of those aged 65 years and over, 10.3% are at risk of poverty, while 14.3% experience deprivation.  A source of major concern is the contributory pension as a result of changes in banding introduced by the previous Government in 2012.  They introduced age discrimination and an unfair cut for those with reduced pension contributions.  Two people with the same reduced number of pension contributions could receive different pension payments if one of them had retired before 2012.  Take, for example, the case of two people who had made 28 contributions.  The person who retired before 2012 received a pension of &euro;225, whereas the younger person who retired after that year received &euro;196, or over &euro;35 a week less for each week of his or her life.  That is a significant difference, despite both of them making the same number of contributions.  Many people, especially women, had a reduced number of pension contributions because they were in the home looking after children or caring for a elderly family relative.  Owing to the way the banding was changed in 2012, they have seen their pension entitlements significantly reduced.<\/p> <p> The home carer allowance only extends back to 1994 and is payable in respect of children under 12 years.  This issue needs to be addressed.  When I raised it recently with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, he told me he would have to take into consideration the number of winners and losers before any change could be made.  Right now everybody is losing and the issue needs to be tackled sooner rather than later.<\/p> <p> Another aspect of the pension system that needs to be addressed is the situation of those who are forced to retire at 65 years of age but who cannot receive their pension for a further year.  They have to sign on for jobseeker's benefit for the year, which means that they will be on a reduced payment of &euro;188.  If that is not bad enough, many of those affected have highlighted to me that they have to claim to be searching for work when they are not.  They just want to get on with their retirement.  While all of the improvements will not happen in one go, they need to be tackled in the forthcoming year.<\/p> <p> The improved Christmas bonus is a positive step, especially at what is an expensive time for families.  The at-risk poverty rate in rural areas is 19.1 %, almost five percentage points higher than in urban areas, where the rate stands at 14.6%.  Changes to the farm assist scheme introduced by the previous Government in the budgets for 2012 and 2013 saw the figures in the assessment of means from farming raised, while the disregards for children were halved and then discontinued.  The Bill rows back to the position before 2012, a move I welcome.  Income from farming and off-farm self-employment will now be assessed at a figure of 70%, down from 100%, with an annual disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and subsequent children.  This is a welcome move which will benefit many farm families in north-west Cork.<\/p> <p> We need to see further improvements in the provision of social welfare services.  Unfortunately, in my area service provision is being restricted.  Due to departmental retirements, those accessing social welfare services in Macroom and the wider Lee Valley area have a reduced service, available three days a week in a small office in which one could not swing a cat.  These changes in the service could have been foreseen and dealt with for the benefit of people living in the wider Macroom area.  The Department of Social Protection has been engaged in a continuous service delivery improvement programme, the aim of which is to provide a high quality and proactive service for customers.  \"Proactive\" means moving first.  When the Department knows that personnel are due to retire, it should be able to put in place adequate replacements and provide temporary services for the people of Macroom rather than waiting until the last minute, reacting and leaving people with a service that is not adequate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000022#V00300","speaker":"1284","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478783700,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I concur with many of the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy Aindrias Moynihan.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, maintains budget 2017 is the first socially just budget in years.  However, he needs to redress the wrongs many retired persons or individuals who are due to retire are experiencing because of previous budget measures.  Many of them have been adversely affected by the anomaly in how entitlement to the State contributory pension is calculated.  I have been presented with a large number of cases where individuals, all women, have been penalised for having made a small number of PRSI payments during what effectively amounted to a previous working life before 1994.  They took time out of their working lives to rear their families or look after elderly parents, essentially peforming important social caring duties to the benefit of society.  Having spent a great portion of their lives in providing these socially vital services, they are now being penalised on the double.  Not only have they secured no private pension entitlements for this period of their lives, they are being denied a full State pension.  While I welcome the &euro;5 increase in the State pension, many will only receive a portion of it because of the discriminatory method of calculation.  Clearly, this must change.  It is clearly unfair and requires urgent action.  It would certainly move the budget in a more just direction.<\/p>  <p>  I was disappointed that the back to school clothing and footwear allowance was not increased.  This payment was ravaged by the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and is wholly inadequate to cover back to school costs.  The previous Government halved the allowance which is a vital payment for low-income parents in meeting back to school costs.  Budget 2017 did not offer any relief to parents with back to school costs.  Some 42% of parents who answered the 2016 Barnardos back to school costs survey told how they had to forgo paying household bills or cut back on daily expenses to afford their child's school costs.  This lack of foresight for young families deprives many of the equality all children deserve to achieve their potential and contribute to a strong community and economy.  I have also been asked by constituents to address the collateral effects of the reduced allowance.  Many school suppliers are being put in a difficult position in trying to produce uniforms for schools that come in under the inadequate allowance.<\/p>  <p>  It is disappointing that the budget failed to address the introduction of a cost of disability payment in recognition of the higher costs faced by those with a disability.  This was a central plank of Fianna F&aacute;il's disability policy in its manifesto.  It would have been a welcome measure in the budget.<\/p>  <p>  The family income supplement thresholds were not increased in line with the increases in the national minimum wage and reductions in the universal social charge.  Consequently, the full benefits of the increase in the national minimum wage will not be felt by households with children.<\/p><p> I have two points on older people.  Although I welcome the &euro;5 increase in the old age pension, it is a shame that the budget did not increase the living alone allowance to acknowledge the higher costs faced by those who live alone.  Independent research has consistently highlighted the additional costs faced by those living alone and reliant on one income or State support.  A one-person household generally faces the same heating, electricity and home insurance costs as a two-person household.  There is a considerable inadequacy in this regard that needs to be examined.<\/p> <p> Budget 2017 did not increase the fuel allowance, the period for which was cut from 32 weeks to 26 weeks by the previous Government.  While the cost of energy decreased in 2016, it remains 16.7%, on average, above the level of 2010.  Not addressing the reduced purchasing power of the fuel allowance leaves long-term social-welfare-dependent households particularly vulnerable to fuel poverty, particularly as we face into a tough and harsh winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000023#W00200","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478784300,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1478784300,"counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000024#X00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1478784300,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Catherine Murphy - the Maynooth line fare increases for commuters between Leixlip and Dublin; (2) Deputy Brendan Griffin - the inclusion of the drug Orkambi under the long-term illness scheme; (3) Deputy Bernard J.

I have listened to many of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues outline the various deficiencies, the welcome improvements and the areas where there is an urgent need to improve schemes and rates of payment.  My party spokesperson, Deputy Willie O'Dea, dealt in detail in his contribution with all facets of the legislation.  I welcome his contribution, in which he has highlighted the great pressure on families, lone parents and pensioners living on their own.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the increase in the State pension.  Naturally, we would all like to see a high rate of payment, if at all possible.  We must have incremental increases over the coming years to try to restore or improve the previous rate.  I also welcome the increase in the primary rates of other welfare payments plus the 85% increase in the Christmas bonus, which is so important to people at a time when there are extra demands on individuals and families.<\/p>  <p>  I am very glad the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, responded positively to an engagement my colleague Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, other Deputies and I had with him in regard to the farm assist scheme.  Like me, the Minister of State who is present, Deputy Joe McHugh, will have many constituents who are small-scale farmers earning a negligible income, if any at all, from their farm businesses.  The farm assist scheme was introduced in the late 1990s through initiatives of the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  It was a very welcome scheme to try to deal with the unfortunate circumstances obtaining in many parts of the country.  Very low incomes were being generated by so many farmers.  Unfortunately, the changes and the abolition of the disregards in the 2013 and 2014 budgets had a considerable adverse impact on recipients of the farm assist scheme payment.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, when Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and I had a very good exchange with him during Question Time and in a Topical Issue debate, he was willing to listen to the arguments we put forward forcefully.  These arguments were articulated by many other public representatives, Members of this House and the farming organisations.  I welcome the improvements.  There is room for further improvement to the farm assist scheme because, unfortunately, we are witnessing a decline in farm incomes and considerable challenges for farm families, be they in livestock, beef, suckler cows or the dairy or other sectors.  Unfortunately, they are not deriving an income from their holdings.<\/p>  <p>  The rural social scheme is very important to rural communities.  It is so important to the many individuals who participate.  I understand that, up until recently, there were approximately 2,600 participants.  Provision was made in the budget for an increase of 500.  My party and other organisations put forward the view that we should be trying to achieve 5,000 participants annually.  We all know of people who participate in the schemes.  We know of their value to the individual as they give one an opportunity to go out and do some work.  They bring great benefits to local communities and voluntary organisations, which are assisted in their valuable work.  We all know there are many services provided in rural areas that would not be possible to provide were it not for community employment schemes and the rural social schemes.  In many instances, those services are being provided by local community and voluntary groups in the place of the State providing such services.  We all know from our constituency work of services that the State should be providing but which it is not providing.  They are being provided through local voluntary effort, supplemented by workers on community employment schemes and rural social schemes.  One should consider that the cost to the State of a person on a rural social scheme or community employment scheme by comparison with the cost of that individual drawing down a weekly welfare payment is negligible.  We cannot quantify the great benefits that accrue from the schemes.  I refer to the benefit to the individual and the local community.  I appeal to the Minister and his Department officials to examine this area further.  It is an area that results in a great return on the small cost.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, both of whom are present, will be familiar with the disadvantage experienced by pensioners in the State who are drawing a pension from Britain in view of the weakness of sterling.  County Donegal, County Cavan and County Monaghan have a considerable number of people who worked in Northern Ireland and Britain but who are now, thankfully, residing in this country.  They are suffering as a result of the drop in the value of sterling.  I acknowledge there is provision in the departmental scheme to have a compensatory payment if a pensioner's payment drops below the level of a comparable pension in this State but in many instances, it takes far too long to get the top-up.  Unfortunately, there have been instances in which pensioners who were in receipt of a small top-up were punished very quickly if sterling improved in value against the euro.  The same is not happening now in regard to trying to offset the decline in the value of sterling where an individual is in receipt of a UK pension.  I appeal to the Minister and Department to consider compensating people quickly when the value of sterling falls to ensure they are not continually losing due to that drop in value.<\/p>  <p>  I join the previous speakers who referred to the anomalies affecting the contributory pension, particularly the anomalies affecting women who were in the workplace and took time out to rear children or care for a family member but who were later denied the full pension because of the method of calculation of the yearly average contribution.  All of us have constituents who are affected.  It is predominantly and overwhelmingly women who are suffering as a result of the method of calculation of the pension.  It is absolutely wrong that a person who was longer in insurable employment could get a smaller pension than a colleague who just completed ten years and alongside whom he or she worked.  This absolute discrimination needs to be addressed.  It would not impose a big burden on the State.  It is a matter of trying to bring equity and equality into the system for pensioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000024#X00800","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1478784300,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Social protection is a massive part of Government expenditure, the second biggest after health.  Welfare for citizens remains the biggest part of Government expenditure although we were supposed to be keeping the recovery going, according to Fine Gael.<\/p><p>In a brave move, Fianna F&aacute;il fought this election on increased public services.  We did not campaign for a selfish society based on tax cuts, privatisation and the rampant individualism endorsed by a liberalism that does not regard welfare as a means to help people in need but as a stick to keep them down.  That is the fundamental difference between our parties.  It has always been there and maybe it always will be, but that does not alter the fact that we need radical change so as to ensure that welfare becomes protection for the people who need it.<\/p> <p> This is crucial in respect of two issues on which I will concentrate.  The first relates to the labour market supports that the Department oversees.  Job benefit and job assistance payments are a direct means of providing financial help to the unemployed.  Thankfully, the unemployment figures are going in the right direction.  I give credit to the Minister for his role in that achievement, but two traps will become embedded unless a radical change in thinking and action is undertaken.<\/p> <p> Youth unemployment and long-term unemployment rates remain too high and supports for this sector are piecemeal, inadequate and, in certain areas, counterproductive.  While I accept that youth unemployment supports involve much more than direct payments and the Government is moving towards labour activation models with training and further education, these moves are too incoherent and are not focused towards the needs of the individual who finds himself or herself unemployed.<\/p> <p> Long-term unemployed people are also being treated as statistical numbers to be played around with by political spin doctors along with an inhumane, bureaucratic and computerised system that at times has lost all sense of the human suffering involved in long-term unemployment.  People who are unemployed are our fellow citizens.  They are human beings who require help and should not be trampled on by an uncaring system.  Has the Minister of State ever spent a day in a social protection office?  Has he seen the security windows, the stressed and overworked staff?  The offices do not look like places that inspire hope.  In too many instances, they are depressing, paper-pushing systems designed to produce data.  They are not there to help people who need their services at a vulnerable time in their lives.<\/p> <p> Good work is being done, however.  There are some excellent people in the Department of Social Protection and on the ground who are a credit to the best of the public service, but speaking with them has proven to me that they are overworked and overburdened by a system that is beyond breaking point.<\/p> <p> The community employment system is under significant strain and has been under sustained attack by Fine Gael since it entered office in 2011.  Community employment schemes in mid-Leinster have the highest progression record in the country of all back to work schemes.  Why is this not being celebrated and endorsed?  Why are we pushing ahead with the privatisation of these schemes when the community employment and rural social scheme models are examples of empowerment and community involvement that should be supported, not consistently and relentlessly attacked by the Government?<\/p> <p> I know of too many stories of long-term unemployed people who are depressed and flattened by their treatment at the hands of an uncaring system.  The Government's privatisation efforts are wrong.  The data for progression are still not available for this new departure, but I have evidence that too many people have had a negative experience with the service.  It needs to be discontinued at the earliest opportunity.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Social Protection is an ambitious man by all accounts.  He is a follower of international political developments.  He is well aware of the democratic rejection of establishment politics that is taking place across the world.  One of the key reasons for this rejection in Ireland is that too many good people feel rejected by the Government and Government services.  Rural areas and those in need of Government services are not being listened to.  Their politicians are unable to change the situation even when they want to try.<\/p> <p> Social protection must live up to its name, not be a centralised, bureaucratic and computerised Government system.

In the limited time available to me, I will focus on a few issues.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies referred to the social employment and community employment schemes, which provide excellent training opportunities and employment, particularly in rural areas.  However, the rules make participation difficult.  I will highlight examples, namely, the three-year rule and the requirement that a participant be over 25 years of age.  One has the opportunity to participate on a scheme for three years, be they consecutive or not.  If someone does so before the age of 30 years, though, he or she cannot participate again before reaching 55 years of age.  This makes no sense at all.  The rule that prohibits those aged under 25 years and the three-year rule should be reconsidered.  There should be greater continuity.  Will the Minister and his Department consider this matter?<\/p>  <p>  The rules make it difficult, not just for participants, but also for the voluntary groups that administer the schemes.  They do excellent work in our communities.  All that we need to do is look around and see what they do in our areas - Tidy Towns, the GAA and other voluntary groups.  Without them, the work might not get done.  If it had to be done through State investment, it would cost multiples of what it does now.  A large social dividend is to be derived for the participants and the communities.  Many participants might be able to avail of other employment, which would free places on the schemes' waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to refer to seasonable and part-time workers and their social protection entitlements.

Seasonal and part-time workers play an essential role in the rural economy, be they working in the fishing, agriculture or hospitality sector.  The current scheme works against them, though.  The requirement to have made 17 contributions over a three-year period equates to 39 contributions per annum.  Thirty-nine weeks' work is practically impossible for people in those sectors.  It is tantamount to telling them that they are better off not working.  There is no advantage.  The subsidiary income threshold of &euro;12.70 per day, or &euro;63.50 per week, is unfair.  If a seasonal worker earns that income from farming, he or she is not entitled to receive unemployment benefit.  All of this defies logic.  We should be trying to incentivise people to work, but this is a disincentive.  An annual subsidiary income of &euro;3,300 should not be sufficient to deny anyone of the right to obtain a social protection payment.  One's social welfare ceases when one is immediately required to make 13 contributions in order to transfer to the next claim.  No allowance is made for the seasonality or unique nature of work in fish factories or the hospitality and agriculture sectors.  The various changes to social welfare eligibility rules have worked against seasonal and part-time workers.<\/p><p>I will deal with this, together with my party colleagues, on Committee Stage and hope there will be universal support for my proposals.<\/p> <p> I wish to refer to those in receipt of social welfare payments who have inadvertently and unintentionally drawn down payments in addition to their statutory entitlements.  This happens, but I do not believe the majority of social welfare recipients set out to defraud the Department.  When it happens and the mistake is recognised, it normally seeks to claw back 15% of an individual's social welfare entitlement.  A person in receipt of &euro;200 per week is expected to pay back &euro;30.  That might not seem like a lot, but it is a considerable sum for an individual in receipt of only &euro;200 per week.  The Department should be more humane in such circumstances.  I am not casting aspersions on the officials who deal with these issues because there seems to be a rule of thumb, but they should be given greater flexibility in this regard.<\/p> <p> The restoration of the bereavement grant should be considered by the Government in the context of the next budget.  <\/p> <p> I cannot understand, nor can most Deputies, why it takes at least 18 weeks to process an application for carer's allowance.  Some applications may take longer to process if additional information is required, but if all of the boxes are ticked, applications should not take that long to process.<\/p> <p> I hope my contribution will be heard and my concerns addressed by the Government.  I will deal specifically with the treatment of seasonal and part-time workers during the debate on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000025#Y00200","speaker":"1289","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478785500,"counter":178,"content":"<p>T&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an mBille Leasa Sh&oacute;isialaigh, 2016.

Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar arduithe suntasacha agus ba cheart d&uacute;inn d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an m&iacute;chothromas at&aacute; laistigh den Bhille.<\/p>  <p>  The social welfare system is supposed to be beneficial and enhance peoples' circumstances.  That is why it was set up.  For many years people have been dependent on it because there is no work available to them, but in the middle of that dependence the Government cut the amounts available to those in need of social welfare assistance.  We are dealing with the legacy of five years of cuts by the Fine Gael Party, in particular, supported by the former Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  Prior to that, cuts were also introduced and implemented by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.<\/p>  <p>  The idea behind the social welfare system is that it enables social transfers to be made.  Social transfers are not designed only to ensure individuals will not become totally destitute; they are also advantageous to local businesses because virtually every cent given in social welfare payments is spent in local shops and businesses.  This benefits the community at large.  One of the side effects of the cuts in social welfare rates in recent years made by the Government and its predecessor which was propped up by the Labour Party was that small local shops and businesses suffered and many closed.  With this Bill, I hope we will see the start of the reversal of the cuts, but the amounts involved are paltry and miserly.  If one gives a social welfare recipient in Dublin living in social housing an additional &euro;3 or &euro;4 per week, I guarantee that, as happened in the past, the local authority will increase the rent payable by the same amount.  In the past increases in benefits, even of paltry amounts, were eaten up straightaway by increases elsewhere with the result that there was no additional money in peoples' pockets.  An increase of &euro;3 to &euro;5 in most payments, as suggested in the Bill, will not substantially alter the lives of those who are totally dependent on the social welfare system, including pensioners, those in receipt of disability allowance, jobseeker's allowance and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the people who are totally dependent on social welfare benefits are not actively seeking work; they are not job seekers.  Many of them will never be back in the workplace again and do not have the wherewithal to find work, even if it was available.  They cannot enhance their lot and are dependent on whatever is handed out by us as a society through the Government.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently called on the Government to ensure social welfare payments will be index-linked.  However, before they are index linked, we must first determine if they are adequate.  That has not happened to date and the Bill does not take the opportunity to set that process in train.<\/p>  <p>  In Dublin and most of the other large cities there is a huge housing crisis, as referred to by my party colleague, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin.  Rent increases in this city have been enormous and this affects everyone, including those in receipt of rent allowance.  There is an assumption that the latter group do not have to pay out any money, but they must contribute a small portion of their income which is worked out by the Department.  However, everyone in this city knows - I presume it is the same in other cities - that in the vast majority of cases rent allowance recipients make under the counter payments to their landlords.  Once landlords know that tenants have an extra &euro;3 or &euro;5 per week, they will come looking for their pound of flesh.  The entire rent allowance system is fraught with danger, which is why I have always argued that rather than propping up private landlords, we should be investing in social housing.  <\/p>  <p>  One element that is missing from the Bill is a focus on a scheme which was introduced by the last Government and which I actually welcomed.  I encouraged the Minister to put time and effort into the JobsPlus scheme, which encourages employers to take on employees in return for a State subsidy.  Instead, the last Government spent all of its time propping up the JobBridge scheme which, thankfully, is now being scrapped.  The Government must make a commitment to promote the JobsPlus scheme in the same way as it promoted the JobBridge scheme, with all of the razzamatazz that went with it.  Under the JobsPlus scheme, an employee is paid at least the minimum wage, if not more, and works for at least 30 hours per week.  That was not the case under JobBridge scheme, which was of no advantage to the vast majority of participants in it.  <\/p>  <p>  There are other missed opportunities in the Bill.  A motion dealing with the situation in Calais was passed earlier in the House.  The vast majority of Deputies have the interests of children at heart.  One of the ways to tackle child poverty in this country is to address for social welfare recipients the qualified child allowance which currently stands at &euro;29.80 per child.<\/p><p>A child who is dependent on a parent on social welfare gets &euro;29.80.  If we want to help those families with children in poverty, we increase that.  It was not increased nor was the qualified adult allowance.  Many people in or associated with the social welfare system do not get the same benefits as others.  A qualified adult does not quality for community employment.  I heard the last Deputy talk about how great community employment is.  I am on a number of boards where community employment is important and I think it should be enhanced.  However, if someone is a qualified adult, they are not in receipt of a social welfare payment in their own right and, therefore, will not qualify for a scheme.  The same is true of many people whose husband or wife might be working but who do not get any social welfare payment and do not have any independent income.  They want to get back into the workforce but have been out of it for a number of years and they think that community employment or one of those type of schemes might be a mechanism for doing so but because they are not in receipt of social welfare, they do not get that benefit.  <\/p> <p> There is a range of issues here, the vast majority of which I do not oppose.  We could have gone a lot further.  The problem is that it is not an imaginative document.  It is not far reaching because it is not making a difference in the lives of those dependent on social welfare.  One area that is often raised is overpayments, about which the Comptroller and Auditor General speaks.  I have argued over the years that the number of social welfare inspectors should be increased because they have shown that they can work.  I pay tax, as does everybody here.  If somebody in Revenue makes a mistake and charges me too much and I do not notice it for four years, it is hard luck.  You have to claim it back within four years.  In the case of a social welfare overpayment, the Department can go back 20 or 30 years because there is no Statute of Limitations in respect of claiming back.  I understand the lack of a Statute of Limitations in the case of fraud because it is a crime but in the event of somebody making an error regardless of whether it is the official or the recipient, there should be some limit matching the limit that is put on what taxpayers can claim back where if the case is more than four years old, Revenue will say it is hard luck because the person should have claimed.  There is a range of other issues.  Hopefully, I will get the opportunity to raise some of them on Committee Stage because it is an opportunity.  <\/p> <p> The Opposition is restricted in what it can do in respect of social welfare and finance Bills.  We cannot put down move amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage if it is a cost to the Exchequer or the people, regardless of whether it is a positive or a negative from the Government's point of view.  I have argued continually that we should be given that opportunity to do this so that we can properly engage with legislation that would benefit the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000026#Z00200","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478786100,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I am Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on children and youth affairs.  In preparing for the budget and our alternative, the issue of child care, which has been discussed substantially since then, was a big focus.  A substantial amount of children's interests and welfare issues come under the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection as well.  The investment in subsidising child care in a universal and targeted way was welcome, albeit that we would have liked to have seen more for child care workers.  This Government's efforts to tackle child poverty in this budget and Social Welfare Bill fall substantially short.  A number of organisations, including Barnardos, Early Childhood Ireland and the ISPCC, would have lobbied on a number of issues that urgently need to be tackled to reduce child poverty.  I will touch on them in the course of my contribution.  The issues relate to child benefit, the one-parent family payment, some of the back to school costs and family income supplement.<\/p>  <p>  There is a failure to recognise that a combination of interventions across all those various payments as well as interventions in child care would have made a very significant difference to child poverty.  I was at a conference on Monday on the Young Knocknaheeny programme, which is an excellent area-based poverty project.  It was said that Irish child poverty remains among the highest among the wealthier end of OECD countries.  I want to touch first of all on single parents.  Every measure or report always finds that single parent families, which, more often than not, are led by females, are among the most disadvantaged, poorest and marginalised in our society.  It is well documented that the lone parent reforms, which are essentially cuts, by the previous Government had the perverse effect of reducing household income and were regressive.  It has been borne out by a number of organisations.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has recommended that the State reverse these cuts.  At the time it took effect, a number of families were affected but a number of specific categories of recipients saw huge reductions in their payments.  I back the campaign supported by Irish Single Parents Fight Back and others that argues that seven years of age is too low to be the cut-off age.  It has been very difficult for many one-parent families to absorb that change.  The cost of a child does not reduce after the age of seven.  In many ways, it increases when it comes to things like education.  The failure to revisit that is serious.  The issue needs to be revisited next year because this is a very marginalised category of people and it would make a very substantial difference and help a lot of people out of very difficult situations and poverty.  <\/p>  <p>  A related issue that many single parents face is the issue of maintenance.  It was reported recently that the Department has been issuing letters to the liable relative - the person who is supposed to making maintenance payments - informing them that they are no longer obliged to pay maintenance once the child reaches the age of seven.  At the same time, the Department is telling lone parents that if they do not seek maintenance, they will receive financial sanctions and it will be taken into account in means testing and various others measures relating to the kind of benefits and entitlements they are entitled to.  This was a very dangerous and regrettable action by the Department that is putting a lot of pressure on a category of people who are already under severe pressure and in very difficult situations.  It is something the Department needs to resolve.  Clearly, those liable relatives have responsibilities and the Department should be active in ensuring that they step up to those responsibilities, should not put all the obligation on the parent who is doing their best to raise their child and should not take a disadvantageous or prejudicial view or too harsh a view of parents who have liable relatives who have not been paying maintenance because, ultimately, that is not their fault and they cannot do anything to control it.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue of child care relates to the so-called reforms to the one-parent family payment.  It was done in the context of the promise of Scandinavian-style child care.  By the time we have a Scandinavian-style child care system, we will have had many years of very regressive cuts and it does not appear as if they are going to be reversed any time soon.  In that context of the discussion around child care, and there were welcome moves in that regard, parents who stay at home raised concerns about the fact it was becoming substantially more difficult for them to raise their children, that they were not receiving any assistance and that it was becoming financially unsustainable for them.<\/p><p>In that context, far more should have been done on maternity benefit.  The Bill has welcome steps on paternity benefit, but we need to go much further than that.  While the &euro;5 increase in maternity benefit is welcome, in my experience people are considerably short at that rate.  Many parents find it very difficult to stay at home at that rate and feel obliged to work much sooner than they would otherwise.  We would have advocated a much more substantial increase of about &euro;40 and an extension of two weeks because we need to be bridging that gap.  While paternity benefit and paternity leave are finally being addressed, which is positive, we need to work towards having a set amount for both parents with flexibility to allow parents to take it between them as and when it suits them.<\/p> <p> I wish to speak about the under 26s.  The Government has continued a discrimination that has been going on for six or seven years between jobseekers up to 25 and older than 25.  It is questionable as to whether it is permissible under the Equal Status Act - I do not believe anyone has ever taken a case on it.  Certainly, morally there is no justification for it.  The &euro;2.70 increase for the under 25s would scarcely buy a young person a cup of coffee a week.<\/p> <p> The discrimination ultimately forces more and more young people back on their families.  That has been a real feature of austerity.  We see it with housing, social protection, fees and all sorts of educational costs.  Parents have already absorbed a burden in their own way through cuts and increased taxes.  The increased pressure on their children is being transferred to them, with children having to move home and rely on their parents for assistance.  However, this is just not an option for many young people under 26, who may not have that relationship with their parents.  They find it very difficult to try to manage their lives, and pay for their food, clothes and other bills out of a very modest - inadequate - jobseeker's allowance that is also based on a discriminatory principle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000027#AA00200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478786700,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Deputy Cahill is sharing his time with Deputies O'Keeffe and Calleary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000028#BB00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1478786700,"counter":183,"content":"<p>This has been a unique budget in that we, as an Opposition party, tried to influence the budget.  With a minority Government, it was an unusual situation.  Deputy Calleary, who is present in the House, and Deputy Michael McGrath tried to get parts of Fianna F&aacute;il's manifesto enshrined into the social welfare aspect of the budget.  The difference between last year's budget and this year's shows the influence of those gentlemen.  Last year there was a 50:50 split between tax cuts and improvement to services.  This time there is a 3:1 ratio, which shows the influence we had on it.<\/p>  <p>  While the budget has welcome elements, with the limited fiscal space not enough has been done.  The &euro;5 increase in the State pension and the &euro;5 increase across the board of most social welfare rates are welcome.  We have gone a long way towards restoring the Christmas bonus, but it is a pity that it has not been fully restored this year.<\/p>  <p>  This is a Fine Gael budget and certain items in our manifesto have failed to be addressed this time.  The cuts to the one-parent family payment, which has suffered many harsh cuts in recent years, have not been reversed, which is a regrettable omission in the Social Welfare Bill.  Disability payments and the recognition of people with disability, a key plank in our manifesto, have not been addressed this time around.  With the reduction in the universal social charge and the increase in the national minimum wage, families will not see the benefits that they could have if there was an increase in the family income supplement threshold.  There has been no increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  There has been no increase in the qualified child payment to those in receipt of social welfare payment.  Families on social welfare have not been well looked after in this Social Welfare Bill.<\/p>  <p>  There should have been more focus on certain schemes in the Social Welfare Bill.  I welcome the extra 500 places on the rural social scheme.  I met representatives of Rural Link this morning.  They have identified that the risk of poverty in rural areas is 19.1% compared with 14.6% in urban areas.  We have to recognise that there is poverty in all communities across the country.  There are 2,500 on a waiting list for rural social schemes, which will increase with the change in farm assist.  It is necessary to be on those waiting lists to qualify for farm assist.  While the extra 500 places are welcome, they will definitely not address the serious issues we have.  While we welcome some of the changes in farm assist which reverse some of the changes in the detail to qualify that were implemented in recent years, only 8,500 people qualify for farm assist.  The figure should be much closer to 20,000 with the drop in farm incomes.  While some changes are welcome, we have not gone far enough in allowing people to qualify for this scheme.  Compared with other social welfare means tests, the test for farm assist is definitely the most punitive test.  Unfortunately, many people who would be deserving of it fall outside the remit of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Another speaker spoke earlier about JobPath, which has many drawbacks.  The two organisations running this, Turas Nua and Seetec, are getting a fee for signing people up.  However, they are signing up to a regime they cannot get out of and they are tied into the scheme for 12 months.  It is not working in practice especially when another opportunity comes up for a person.  This is another scheme like JobBridge which was designed to manipulate the figures and show that long-term unemployment was reducing.  There has to be an opt-out clause for people who get employment nearer home and who can source more economically viable employment.<\/p>  <p>  I have come across a number of cases in my constituency where people who have signed up to this scheme, or who have been forced into this scheme by the various organisations, and now have an opportunity to take up employment nearer home are deprived of that opportunity.  The scheme needs to be tweaked to ensure that people, who get an opportunity, for example, in a rural social scheme or under community employment, can avail of it.  While the objectives of the scheme are praiseworthy, in practice it is not working correctly.<\/p>  <p>  People over 60 are suffering serious discrimination in getting work on community employment schemes.  Unfortunately, when they are debarred from getting work on a community employment scheme at that age, they are in a cul-de-sac and no further employment avenues are open to them.  We have had numerous examples in my constituency where people over 60 are excluded from community employment schemes and cannot get any further employment.  I would like to see those addressed on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000028#BB00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1478786700,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be speaking today.  We all know that Fianna F&aacute;il had an input into the budget, but it is not our budget.  When we put pressure on the Minister to give a &euro;5 increase to senior citizens, he was quick to come back and cover himself by advocating a &euro;5 increase to all social welfare recipients, including jobseekers, carers and others.<\/p><p>It has to be welcomed but it does not kick in until the second quarter of 2017.  It is important to not lose sight of the taxpayer and the PAYE workers.  They must be getting very worried as they do not see the benefit of this economic recovery.  They see more benefits for others than are being accrued to them.  They see themselves funding these social welfare schemes.  The Minister of State must note there are still a lot of people who are still depending on schemes such as community employment, JobsPlus and SOLAS.  If one looks at the numbers compared to five years ago there are still as many people who depend on these schemes.  It is very worrying when the Government speaks about jobs being provided but there are no jobs for the general worker in the area.<\/p> <p> I welcome many of the initiatives in the Minister's programme.  The farm assist measure has to be welcomed with regard to the means testing.  There is still a crisis in the farming community, especially for low income farmers.<\/p> <p> I will now turn to the benefits proposed for the self-employed.  Anything that is done for people who are self-employed and who lose their work or income must be pushed through more quickly so that they can avail of jobseeker's funding.  While we welcome that the invalidity pension has been extended to the self-employed the treatment benefit package is also a major positive measure for the self-employed to the cost of &euro;3.6 million.  This scheme sees the introduction of dental care benefits and full restoration of optical benefits, such as free glasses or &euro;42 towards upgraded glasses.  This measure is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p> With regard to the housing assistance payment, HAP and the increase in this rent allowance scheme for social housing applicants, there are fierce complications in applying for this allowance and it must be reviewed.  There is an issue also when applicants feel that their landlord is not doing enough with regard to compliance to keep the property in good order.  There is an issue there for grant aid towards upgrading of a property as there are landlords who do not have the money to upgrade their properties and they are being precluded from participating in the HAP scheme.  While I welcome the increase in funding I ask that this situation could be reviewed.

It is always good, and appropriate during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, to acknowledge the huge work of the staff in the Department of Social Protection, especially those in local offices around the State.  Staff in every part of the Department have been very much on the front line of the economic collapse.  They have had to deal with people who are trying to manage the consequences of the economic collapse.  It has certainly been my experience that the staff have handled cases professionally, and many in a caring way.  So many staff give more than everything to the job, particularly those who staff the Oireachtas Members' information support line and who support all Members in their work.  If there was a system where the bureaucracy that exists in so many Departments was ironed out, we may not need those support lines, but I acknowledge that the people who staff the support lines do a superb job.<\/p>  <p>  There are increases in payments in this year's Social Welfare Bill and Fianna F&aacute;il fought hard to achieve those.  They are small increases but they are sustainable.  We do not want to go back to a situation where, in a few years' time, we again might have to cut people's income, cut the social welfare protections, cut the Christmas bonus and many other payments.  This year the increases are small, and ideally there would and should be more, but they are sustainable and they can be paid for in the long term.  If we can continue on that basis to build up the payments to people who are in receipt of social welfare, then we would not have to go back to a situation where we are cutting incomes of the most vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  I join my colleagues in welcoming some specific changes such as those in farm assist and the increase in the rural social scheme.  I am delighted to see an increase in the budget for the community services programme, which does unseen work across the State.  It might be appropriate that the community work and the increase would be linked into the town and village renewal scheme.  I believe there is an allocation in this regard under the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for the scheme but in order to make it more effective and to give it a bigger bang it should link into the schemes and programmes that seek to improve services in small towns and communities around the State.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the increase in the back to education allowance.  I know there has been a focus on people who are under the age of 25 but it seems to have been missed that there are substantial increases in the back to education allowance for those people and those who are involved in education or retraining can gain from that.<\/p>  <p>  There are couple of areas on which we need to focus.  The length of time that social welfare appeals currently take seems to be stretching out again, particularly for those who are on disability payments or carers.  My constant refrain, and I do not mean so in a political way but in a Government way, is that we seem to place blockages in the way of those people who are most vulnerable and those who are on the most difficult journeys in their lives.  Carers are a prime example.  The appeals process for carer's allowance has gone to six months in some cases, with the constant feedback and looking for information.  This puts people who do not have the time or the ability to deal with this under enormous pressure.  I think it is time that we looked at the social welfare appeals mechanism to bring some sort of express mechanism into place for those people who are under particular pressure such as those who are carers, those who look domiciliary payments and those who depend on disability payments.  I have often had to deal with a situation where an application for the carer's allowance is submitted and because it gets turned down we end up in the appeals process and because of the length of that process, in many cases the person who is being cared for has passed away.  Given the urgency of these applications there does not seem to be any way within the system to address this type of urgent situation.  With regard to trying to free up hospital beds and trying to free up a system that is clogged, this is another example of where the Department of Social protection could work in conjunction with the Department of Health and the HSE in dealing with those allowances in an express way.  That, however, would require the silos of Government Departments to come down and there seems to be an abhorrence - at senior civil servants level - to demolishing those silos.  God forbid that we might actually assist people and make their journeys a little bit easier.  Silos are blocking and hampering people's experience, particularly at very difficult times, and those silos need to come down and this is just one particular example.<\/p>  <p>  Many of my colleagues have spoken about the anomaly facing people, and women in particular, who have worked and who have maybe taken a number of years off from work to care for or raise a family.  These women are now paying the consequence in their pensions which can sometimes be &euro;10 or &euro;15 per week lower.  It is incredible that was one of the changes brought in by a Labour Party Minister for Social Protection.  Fianna F&aacute;il will make this issue a priority for next year's budget.  Again, a little bit of smart thinking around this could bring a solution.  It is not fair on the people, who have worked but have given time to raise their families or have taken time out to care, should be penalised for doing so.  It is not a way to encourage people to come home to care or to come home to a family situation.  Now that paternity leave has been introduced, which we welcome, the impact of that change will broaden.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Keeffe has said, there have been some limited changes this year for those who are self-employed.  For too long, those who are self-employed have been ignored by the social protection system.  There have been some changes in the last two budgets but the changes need to go further.  We need to say to people who go on the journey of establishing their own business and for whom it does not work out that the State would be there to protect them if it does not work out.  The State will be there on the basis of contributions that the self-employed person has made in order to give them protection and to encourage them to actually go down the road again of creating another business.  Many people fail in starting their first business but they succeed in the second or third business.  In doing so, they provide employment opportunities for others and employ business opportunities in their communities.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;5 increase in social welfare payments is welcome but it will be eaten away because every local authority in the State is going to send out increased rent bills.  It is a crazy situation when people get an increase from one arm of Government and another arm of Government takes it from them.  The speed with which local authorities send out rent increase bills is in complete contradiction to the delays that are actually put in place when tenants try to get council and house repairs done.  I imagine that all tenants will now be getting correspondence from local authorities increasing their rent.  If those tenants had a problem with their house or need to get repair done the same urgency would not be attached.  That is something that needs to be looked at. <\/p><p> Many of my colleagues have spoken about the importance of the community employment and rural social schemes.  I welcome the increase in the number of rural social scheme places, but we must examine the entire offering of community employment and rural social scheme places.  Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher spoke about the inability of people under 25 years of age to get on such schemes.  In many rural communities community employment is the first chance many people have to get practical employment experience.  In the absence and destruction of the apprenticeship programme over recent years, the community employment programme has been the area where many people could pick up a skill which they could go on to use in construction or social services.  We must re-invest in the community employment schemes network and ensure that the materials grant is adequate for the projects the schemes are doing.  With rising insurance costs many community employment schemes are finding that the grant to support a scheme is being eaten up by those rising costs, which are outside their control.  Accordingly, the opportunities the schemes can give to participants and the opportunities to communities who benefit from the schemes are being eroded by things that are outside their control.  We must examine the costs, particularly around insurance and materials, across all the schemes, be it community employment, rural social scheme, T&uacute;s and others, and examine how working together can minimise them.<\/p> <p> There is much work to be done in the social protection area, but it must be done on a sustainable basis and in a manner whereby we will not return to cutting.  I reiterate the point that people on a difficult journey in life need assistance from the State, be it from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Health or the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  They do not need blocks to be put in their way in a difficult life.  I welcome the change of giving medical cards to children in families in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, but that change must be accompanied by a far more intensive process in terms of making that award in the first place.  There are so many areas in the lives of children and older people whose lives are already difficult where Government forces combine, and I do not mean this in a political way, to make their journey even more difficult.  Surely the Oireachtas can set the aim of trying to take down the walls and blockages for people who are on a difficult journey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000029#CC00200","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478787900,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Despite the marginal increases in social welfare payments across the board, nobody feels any more secure about their situation.  As far as the recipients are concerned, austerity has not gone away.  We can safely say the budget was still an austerity budget because the cuts to social welfare payments made in previous budgets have not even started to be reversed despite the introduction of the &euro;5 increase in payments.  As a result income inequality persists, with little done in budget 2017 to tackle this growing problem.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance were too preoccupied with election rallying to go beyond the token increases to appease future voters in a future election.  These directionless increases were introduced without any attempt to address the structural inequalities that contribute to rising income inequality in this country.<\/p>  <p>  When we increase the State pension we should talk about the need for a universal pension, given the ageing population.  When we increase jobseekers' and disability payments by &euro;5 per week we should take account of the poverty threshold and the fact that these social groups are most at risk of poverty.  We should also examine the situation of seasonal workers and how they are impacted.  These are people who, through no fault of theirs, cannot avail of full-time employment and must rely on social transfers to keep them living in their communities throughout the year.  This is something I have raised in the House over the last number of years.  The cuts that were made have had a direct impact on seasonal workers.  The availability of jobseeker's benefit was reduced from 12 and nine months down to nine and six months.  That has had a huge impact.  Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher mentioned the impact in the fishing industry.  It has had a huge impact on workers in that industry.  It would cost approximately &euro;39 million to reverse that cut nationally.  Serious consideration should be given to doing that because it would make a huge difference for the workers who depend on the fishing industry for employment.  In addition, in a perverse way it would ensure that workers are available for work in that industry because the workers would be able to sustain themselves during periods when there is no work.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the limit on subsidiary employment of &euro;12.70 per day, that could be increased substantially without any significant cost to the Department.  In fact, the Department could not tell me how much it would cost to increase it.  We should consider increasing it to approximately &euro;25 per day.  That would make a significant difference to seasonal workers who have, perhaps, farm income from their subsidiary employment.  The &euro;12.70 per day amounts to approximately &euro;4,600 per year in income from farming.  If farmers are above that it excludes them entirely from jobseeker's benefit.  Jobseeker's benefit is an important payment because it is taxable, not means tested and is significant for the recipients in terms of their families and their lives.  Serious consideration should be given to that.  I would like to table amendments on those matters on Committee Stage but they would be ruled out of order.  We are not allowed to table amendments that would give rise to a potential cost on the Exchequer.  Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher mentioned earlier that he would deal with this on Committee Stage.  Perhaps as part of the Government Fianna F&aacute;il will be able to table amendments that could put a potential cost on the Exchequer, but I will be unable to do so.<\/p>  <p>  In increasing the State pension we should also discuss a universal pension for everybody.  Social Justice Ireland states that the biggest inequalities in Ireland are not those between the generations but those between people on higher and lower incomes.  This could not be more true than in the case of the State pensions.  Few people acknowledge the fact that income inequality also exists among people over 66 years of age.  According to Social Justice Ireland, 20% of elderly citizens on lower incomes have seen a reduction of 11.5% in their average weekly equivalised income between 2009 and 2011.  Another matter that should have been addressed in the budget is the cut in the telephone allowance for people on pensions.  That hurt elderly people very badly not only in terms of the cost of it, which was significant, but also because many elderly people depend on alarm systems in their houses.  The benefit of having the telephone allowance made them more secure in knowing they could have the panic and fall alarms available for use, as a land line is required to ensure the alarms will work.<\/p>  <p>  Income inequality between State and private pension provision is due to the disproportionately generous tax relief the State provides to the private pension sector.  Instead of increasing State pension by &euro;5 we could have reduced the &euro;2.2 billion taxes foregone on private pensions in the State.  Nearly 82% of the tax relief for private pensions accrue to the top 20% of earners, with 56% accruing to the top 10% of earners.  Pension tax reliefs mainly benefit older, male, well paid workers.  If one adds how much we subsidise private health insurance, that number increases to &euro;3.5 billion a year based on 2014 figures.  This money could have been used to introduce a phasing-in of a universal pension, with expenditure coming from reduced tax relief.  For example, if we reduce the marginal rate of tax relief on private pension contributions to the standard rate of 20% this could raise approximately &euro;560 million for the State.  This could be used immediately to raise the payments to those on the non-contributory State pension, two thirds of whom are women, by a minimum of &euro;10 a week.  That would make a significant difference to them.  We subsidise every other sector in this country, yet we do not appear to be able to subsidise our people.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to jobseekers and disability payments, we must consider risk of poverty for those groups.  One in six people in Ireland are at risk of poverty.  That is just over 750,000 people living on an income below the poverty line, of whom 230,000 are children.  We are all too aware of the fact that child poverty has doubled since the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government took office in 2011.  The CSO has identified the groups at highest risk of poverty as the unemployed, those on home duties, people with disabilities and children.  Budget 2017 did nothing to mitigate the threat of poverty.  According to TASC, the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, the basic rate of social welfare is &euro;22 a week below the at risk of poverty line, so a &euro;5 per week increase means people will still be &euro;17 below the at risk of poverty line.  When one takes account of inflation since the cuts were introduced in the headline social welfare payments, the &euro;5 per week only equates to &euro;1.72 per week in real terms.  If we do not drastically reverse the accumulated cuts from past austerity budgets, poverty rates will continue to increase despite marginal increases to basic income supports.<\/p><p> We also need to make structural changes to the tax system as that is the only solution to address income inequality.  Budget 2017 continued the transfer of wealth to higher earners and private sector interests by retaining the current corporation tax rate; failing to introduce a Robin Hood tax which could bring in more than &euro;200 million a year, something this Government says it cannot do; enabling private developers to benefit from the first-time buyer scheme; and providing for upward changes to thresholds for inheritance tax.  Furthermore, the proposed universal social charge, USC, cuts will bring far greater benefit to people earning higher incomes than to lower-income employees. Also, landlords will benefit from the increased tax free rental allowance under the rent a room scheme.  The Government has not done anything to address the income inequalities in the State.  <\/p> <p> Some of the budgetary measures are welcome, especially the increase in the green, low-carbon, argi-environment scheme, GLAS, income disregards and the increase in farm assist and restoration of it back to the 2012 level.  It is a pity the Minister did not go back to the jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance and look at the subsidiary payment.  The fisherman's tax credit is welcome and it should be of help.  <\/p> <p> The Bill provides for a technical amendment relating to the secondment of garda&iacute; to the Department of Social Protection.  I saw a photograph in a Galway newspaper of garda&iacute; and social welfare inspectors manning checkpoints in Galway chasing up suspected social welfare fraud.  Is it a good use of Garda resources to have 20 garda&iacute; seconded permanently to the Department?  The Department's 2015 annual report indicates that 1.4 million people were in receipt of weekly payments.  The Department carried out 1.1 million control reviews.  That covers most of the people in receipt of payments.  It saved, through that exercise, &euro;69 million, which represents a saving on the total budget of 0.3%.  We do not know from those control reviews how much of that is due to mistakes within the Department where recipients were overpaid and the amount involved was subsequently recovered and how much of it was due to potential fraud.  That report indicates that 208 cases were referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for prosecution.  That number of cases detected out of 1.4 people in receipt of payments works out at such a small fraction that one would nearly not bother calculating it.  The number of cases is minuscule.  Much more is made of social welfare fraud than the incidence of it that is taking place.  It is interesting that the amount attributed to it is always lumped in with administrative overpayments, which I believe is to boost the figures.  Therefore, I would question if having 20 garda&iacute; tied up with the Department is a good use of those resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000030#DD00200","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478788500,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I want to address a number of issues regarding the Bill.

The Government has not gone the full way in that regard but this is a step in the direction.

This Bill goes some way in examining and reassessing the balance and trying to provide the moneys that are badly needed in certain areas.  Much more could be done and I have highlighted some of those issues.<\/p>  <p>  One area I wish to focus on is how little the Bill does to address the area of pensions, especially pension provision.  I completely disagree with Deputy Pringle in his call for reducing pensions tax relief to the standard rate of 20%.  Other parties agree with him and they fly the ridiculous kite in saying that pension tax relief is focused on the higher earner but it is not.  It is focused on middle income earners.  If the Government was to reduce the pension tax relief to the standard rate of 20% we would be effectively looking at a &euro;560 million tax increase for middle income workers, both in the public and in the private sector.  We as a party would not want to see that happen.<\/p>  <p>  There is very little set out in the Bill on pensions.  The 2013 Social Welfare and Pensions Act introduced by the previous Government brought in what are called single insolvencies, which means that a profitable private company can wind down its pension scheme and effectively unilaterally remove their pensions scheme members from the existing pension scheme arrangements.  That is a dangerous precedent to set when a Government is trying to increase pension provision and pension coverage to get workers to make provision for their retirement.  Why would they make provision for their retirement when certainty in regard to the pension benefits that may accrue to a worker on retirement are removed?  The Government should seriously consider reversing the single insolvency arrangements on Committee Stage.  If a company and its pension scheme are insolvent, we understand the scheme would have to be wound down. <\/p>  <p>  I would cite the example of the Irish Aviation Superannuation Scheme, IASS, the airport pension scheme.  For the first time in the history of the State a Government legislated to reduce benefits in a private pension scheme.  That was done under the State Airports Act in the period 2014 to 2015.  It had the effect of reducing pension benefits for long service deferred pensioners by up to 60% - people with long service approaching retirement.  We spoke about giving &euro;5 a week back to contributory and non-contributory pensioners, which is fine, but people who had contributed to this private pension scheme had their pension payments reduced by six weeks a year by way of legislation.  Those were substantial changes.<\/p>  <p>  Single insolvency arrangements should not be permitted.  No pension scheme should be allowed to wind down unless it has reached a 90% funding standard, and I would ask the Government to examine that.  The previous Government has given employers, particularly those who have defined benefit schemes, a clear roadmap as to how they can get out of contracted arrangements and wind down those schemes, and the people who suffer are the pension scheme members.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the example of what happened in the case of the airport pensioners, when the previous Government passed the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 and the State Airports Act and the President had signed them into law, a week later IAG made a revised bid to purchase the remaining 25% stake in Aer Lingus.  It did that because the legislation that was passed by the previous Government effectively wrote off &euro;800 million of a deficit in that pension fund, a fund that the trustees and the company had run up and doubled over two years because they knew what the previous Government was going to allow them to do so.  There are two court cases pending.  If it cannot be done in this Bill, the Government must seriously examine producing a separate pensions Bill.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is very light on pensions legislation, pension regulation and how we can improve pension coverage.  The only way that can be done is to give legal certainty to people who have paid into a pension scheme and then saw up to 60% of their benefits removed.<\/p><p>People coming up to retirement with 35 or 40 years' service thought they had a pension entitlement of &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 and it was reduced to &euro;12,000 to &euro;14,000.  It is absolutely outrageous.  The Government should try to undo the damage it did with the legislation I have mentioned already.  Will the Minister of State ask his colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, if the Government is planning to produce a separate pensions Bill to deal with the areas of single insolvencies that should not be permitted and the area of pension scheme funding?  The OECD's report on it and the recommendations that have been given say that no scheme should be able to wind down unless it is 90% funded because at least then there would be a decent dispersal of the assets.  What will happen now is that many of our commercial semi-State companies and many of the larger companies out there that have historical defined benefit pension schemes will wind those schemes down.  Thousands more workers will go through what the airport pensioners and airport pension scheme members went through.  There are 15,000 workers in that sector made up of 5,000 active members who were removed from the scheme without their permission, which was facilitated by legislation passed by the previous Fine Gael and Labour Government; 5,000 deferred pension scheme members who lost up to 60% of what they had been promised at retirement; and 5,000 retired members who have lost six weeks of their pension each year because of what was done.  A pensions Bill would provide us with an opportunity.  I have discussed bringing forward a pensions Bill with my colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, to right the wrongs that were done over the last few years.  I will ask the Minister on Committee Stage to look at specific arrangements that can be put in place to ameliorate the decreases in the pension that the IAS scheme members suffered as a result of previous legislation.  When I asked about this by way of parliamentary question, the Ministers, Deputy Noonan and Deputy Ross, said they could not just pick out one cohort of workers and look at giving them some degree of restitution.  I asked the Minister at that stage why he picked out just one specific group of pension scheme members - the 15,000 I mentioned - by bringing in specific legislation to reduce their pension scheme benefits and move them out of their scheme without their permission.  That is what happened with the State Airports Act.  For the first time in the history of the State, legislation was brought in by a Government to reduce pension benefits in a private pension scheme, specifically that scheme.  It was done to facilitate the sale of the State shareholding in Aer Lingus.  The State got &euro;342 million for that.  It did not put any of that money back into the pension fund.  It set up a connectivity fund.  I would love to know what is happening with that.  I will ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, which I have done, about where that money is being used.  My point is we have left people high and dry.  We need a pensions Bill to address these issues not only for these 15,000 workers but for those who the same thing will happen to as a result of the Social Welfare and Pensions Acts of 2013 and 2014.  Those Acts facilitate companies to backslide out of their responsibilities.  It facilitates a situation where a company can run down its pension scheme.  They have a roadmap now to run the scheme down, submit an application to the Pensions Authority to wind down their scheme and transfer into defined contribution arrangements.  It is not something we should facilitate.  I do not believe any Government should facilitate it.  I ask the Minister of State to bring that back to his colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.  I will raise it on Committee State through my party colleague, Willie O'Dea.  Will the Government give a commitment to look at moving a separate pensions Bill so we could work across the House on issues like that?<\/p> <p> Deputy Pringle talked earlier about reducing pension tax relief to the standard rate.  It is a joke.  It is all very well to go out and say to people that higher earners benefit most.  The vast majority of people who claim pension tax relief are in the middle ground; they are normal workers, men and women, who are out there making provision for their retirement.  If we did what Deputy Pringle and others on the left want and reduce the pension tax relief to 20%, it will effectively increase tax on those people by nearly &euro;600 million a year.  If one looks at the issue of Garda and teacher pay and all areas in the public and private sector, by changing the pension tax relief from a marginal rate to a standard rate it would wipe out any increases that have been given and more - it would reduce take home pay substantially.  That needs to be called out very clearly with the hard left, the PBP-AAA, and all these people who say that pension tax relief is for wealthy people.  It is absolute nonsense.  In a pensions Bill, the Government could re-state a commitment to retaining pension tax relief as it is.  It could go further and change the way pensions are structured.  They could be changed from just being an annuity scheme or saving scheme to a lifelong savings scheme.  People could access elements of their proposed tax free cash into the future to pay down debt in certain instances or to take some moneys out, perhaps to put a deposit down on a house.  Our legislation and regulations are far too rigid at the moment in that regard.  There could be a penalty for people to do that which the Exchequer could benefit from.  At least it would mean that people have flexibility with their fund.  I have met a number of people who, through the very difficult years and before that, had actually made provision and had sizeable amounts of money in pension funds.  They were broke but could not reinvest in their business because the money was sitting under trust.  There could be a situation in certain instances where people could access an element of their tax free cash.  They could not access their annuitable amount but an element of their tax free cash in certain instances.  Government needs to look at changing the way pensions are structured by changing them to lifelong savings plan.  If a life event happened, they could access some of those funds with the permission of the Revenue.  That would make it much more attractive for people to pay into pension funds and join pension schemes.  They will only do that if they are certain this Government, like the last one, will not take the legs from under them and pull the rug from under them when they have been paying in for years as in the example of the IAS scheme members who had up to 60% of their benefits taken.  Imagine if that happened to anyone in any other sector.  <\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to bring those comments back to the Minister for Social Protection.  We need a separate pensions Bill to right the wrongs of the previous Government and to improve pension coverage across the country.  The future pension liability to the State is multiples of what the banking debt was.  There is an issue and a pensions time bomb.  People are sick of hearing about it but the reality of it is that one way or another, one Government or another will have to tackle this at some stage.  From 2025 to 2035, there will be a situation where it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for the State to pay its State pensions and the pensions for its public and civil sector workers.  A worse situation is that of the people in the private sector who have not made provision for pension benefits.  They will fall within the State remit.  We need to get serious about this issue.  I ask the Minister of State to bring those comments back to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000031#EE00900","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478789100,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett has offered.

I apologise that I have not had a lot of time to listen to the discussion because I have been tied up at the finance committee.  I will raise a number of issues which may or may not have been raised already.  Some of them will certainly have been raised but two of them may not have been.<\/p>  <p>  On an issue that probably has been raised, I want to add my voice to the chorus of objection and protest on the discriminatory jobseeker's' payments for the under-26s.  I cannot overstate my anger and frustration at the discriminatory jobseeker's allowance rate applying to young people.  It is absolutely retrograde in the extreme when the number of young unemployed people is disproportionate to the overall employment level.  It is still extremely high notwithstanding some improvement in the overall unemployment situation.  The number of young people unemployed is still very high and we continue to have very significant emigration of young people.  I do not have the figures in front of me.  The CSO's report on emigration from the country shows we have a very high proportion of graduates leaving this country for a combination of reasons, including low pay and the apartheid system of two tier pay rates for teachers and nurses.       <\/p><p>This is another example of discrimination against young people.  We said at the time that the recession had been used as an excuse to do things the Government might not otherwise have got away with during a normal period to try to ratchet down wages for young people and, as a consequence, wages overall and social welfare payments.  Essentially, it exploited a dire crisis to ratchet down wages and social welfare entitlements.<\/p> <p> The budget is now famously known as the &euro;5 budget, a pathetic amount for ordinary jobseekers and pensioners who, I would like to remind the House, the Minister of State and the public, are still worse off than they were back in 2008.  If that was not unfair and bad enough, young people are considerably worse off, on a half rate or a two thirds jobseeker's payment rate, depending on their age and whether they are under 26 years.  This discriminatory and unacceptably low level of jobseeker's support for unemployed young people is one of the many contributory factors to youth homelessness.  Social welfare payment levels being as low as they are in general contribute to homelessness because rents are absolutely out of control.  As we know, even if people receive rent allowance, many of them must make under the table payments out of their main social welfare payments to sustain a roof over their head, leaving them in an impossible position.  In many cases, this ultimately drives them into homelessness.  If all of this is true of the general cohort of people on jobseeker's payments, it is doubly true of those on a half rate or a two thirds jobseeker's payment rate, as young people are.  It is utterly disgraceful discrimination, against which I wish to protest.<\/p> <p> The budget is a complete missed opportunity in terms of the restoration of the transitionary pension for persons who retire at the age of 65 years.  Because of the doing away with the transitionary pension they receive a jobseeker's payment after retiring.  It is ridiculous.  At the very least, the transitionary pension needs to be put back in place in order that we will not have the crazy situation where people who are retiring after a lifetime of work are put through the ringer of being categorised as jobseekers and receive a payment which is considerably lower than the pension to which they should be entitled because they will not receive the State pension until a year later.  In the future, it will be paid two or three years later, unless we do something about it because the age at which a person becomes entitled to the pension has increased, another legacy of the austerity assault in recent years.<\/p> <p> The Department of Social Protection could have paid for these and other measures and did not have to go begging to the Minister for Finance.  It cannot use the excuse that Department of Finance would not give it the money because it could have raised it in doing something about the abysmally low level of employers' PRSI paid in this country, a matter which is within the Minister's remit.  Employers pay at the rate of 42% of the average level of employers' PRSI in the European Union.  This is abysmally low and a major reason the State does not have the money for social protection payments and public services and to pay for the welfare state.  We charge employers an abysmally low level of PRSI, one of the many subsidies to the rich in this country in terms of tax breaks.  It was not even proposed to bring up the rate to the EU average.  In our alternative budget we very simply proposed that there be a new rate of employers' PRSI of 19.75% for those earning in excess of &euro;100,000 year.  This measure would raise &euro;596 million, as costed by the Department.  There would be an extra &euro;596 million if the Department had created an extra band of PRSI for those earning more than &euro;100,000.  It would cover all of the issues I have mentioned and there would be a lot of money left over to protect the vulnerable in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000032#FF00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478789700,"counter":202,"content":"<p>The Deputy has exceeded his time by one and a half minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000033#GG00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1478789700,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I am done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000033#GG00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1478789700,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas le hachan Theachta f&aacute; choinne na molta&iacute; sa d&iacute;op&oacute;ireacht anseo inniu.  In opening the debate on the Bill on Tuesday the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, characterised the thinking and policies underlying the Bill and budget 2017 as prudent, with modest increases for all those who looked to the social welfare system for income support; inclusive, with no one being left behind and a clear commitment to ensuring everyone shared in the positive effects of economic recovery; progressive, with particular attention being given to a critically important sector of the economy - the self-employed; and targeted, with key measures aimed at lone parents, farmers and schoolchildren.<\/p>  <p>  In listening to the debate one thing that was striking was the positive response to the extension of benefits to the self-employed.  There is a deal of work to be done to ensure the systems in place in the Department will be in a position to deal with the applications for treatment benefit from March and for invalidity pension from December next year.  That is the reason for the deferred implementation dates, rather than being a cost saving measure in this case.  As the Minister said previously, he plans to continue with the reforms in this area and work towards the extension of other benefits to the self-employed.  Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea asked about the full year cost associated with the extension of invalidity pension to the self-employed.  It is estimated that the cost in 2018 will be in the order of &euro;23 million, but as the scheme matures over a number of years, the full year cost of the measure could be in excess of &euro;80 million.<\/p>  <p>  Many of those contributing to the debate queried the reason there were no increases in budget 2017 in payments such as the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, family income supplement, the free fuel allowance and qualified child payments.  Deputies know that there was a limited amount available to the Government to enhance the social protection system.  When it comes to children, we decided to focus on improving funding for services such as child care, school breakfasts and meals, SNAs and medical cards for children with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The reduced rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance paid to young people was referred to by a number of contributors.  This approach seeks to discourage young people from entering long-term welfare dependency by incentivising them to avail of education and training opportunities.  Long-term welfare dependency carries severe consequences for those affected, their families and communities and the economy as a whole.  Budget 2017 further enhances this incentive by providing that where a young jobseeker returns to education or training, his or her allowance will be increased to match the maximum rate of jobseeker's allowance of &euro;193 per week from next September, an increase of &euro;33 per week.  This is the largest single weekly increase provided for in the social welfare package.  Young carers, young people with disabilities, lone parents and young people participating in community employment, T&uacute;s and other schemes will receive the full &euro;5 increase.  We want to encourage, support and reward young people who seek to enhance their skills.  It is important to also note that the levels of youth unemployment have been falling, from 20.9% in October 2015 to 15.1% in October 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  Some Deputies raised concerns about JobPath, a new approach to resourcing the delivery of employment services to those who are long-term unemployed.  Two service providers, Turas Nua and Seetec, are contracted to work with persons who are long-term unemployed.  These contractors supplement the work of the Department's case officers and local employment services.  JobPath provides additional capacity for the Department in order that it can extend the case management approach in delivering employment services to those who are long-term unemployed.<\/p><p>Participants on JobPath are provided with a range of training and development supports which can include career advice, CV preparation interview skills, specific skills training and funding for items such as tools and work clothing where appropriate.  These supports are designed to help the jobseeker compete for and secure appropriate employment.  Some 54,000 people have started on JobPath to date and very few complaints about the service have been recorded by the Department.  There has now been a sustained reduction in the numbers signing on the live register.  In October 2016, the live register stood at just over 277,000, a reduction of more than 43,500 on the October 2015 figure.  <\/p> <p> Deputy O'Dea raised some issues in regard to pensions.  Other than some technical changes to the welfare code, this Bill is now designed solely to give effect to the measures announced in budget 2017 and, beyond the increases in the rates of pensions payments, no other legislative change involving pensions is addressed in the Bill.  The pensions area, however, is hugely important and challenging.  Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion, is the largest block of expenditure by the Department of Social Protection, representing some 35% of its expenditure.  Demographic change alone increases this by &euro;200 million each year.  Maintaining the value of the State pension is critical to protecting older people from poverty.  Other pension-related issues were raised and the Minister and his officials will no doubt be looking at them.  The issues associated with pension entitlement are constantly being reviewed.  Entitlement levels are currently calculated by means of a yearly average calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the person's working life.  As the Deputy said, this can give rise to situations which are anomalous.  Work is under way to replace the yearly average system with a new system termed the \"total contributions approach\".  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  The position of women and men who were home-makers will be considered in developing these proposals.<\/p> <p> It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension contributory for new pensioners from around 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior to its implementation and it is an area to which the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, will be paying close attention over the coming  months.  Deputies also raised concerns about the position of those who retire from the workforce before the age of 66, when they would become entitled to claim the State pension contributory.  The background to this issue is that the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that the State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This is being done to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number receiving the State pension is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has obvious implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every five years.<\/p> <p> The change to pension age began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State Pension transition which was available from age 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This had the effect of standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  There is no general statutory or compulsory retirement age in the State.  The age at which employees must leave their particular job is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers and there have always been people who have retired before State pension age.  This does not prevent them from taking up a new job.  In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are required to leave employment.  Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  Where a jobseeker's benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new governing contribution year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65.  Effectively, this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Broughan asked about the current standing of the social insurance fund.  The Revised Estimates for 2016 provided for a surplus of &euro;217 million.  It is envisaged that the surplus at the end of the year will be in the order of &euro;300 million after the payment of the Christmas bonus.<\/p> <p> There were a number of contributions concerning the impact of reforms to the one-parent family payment in recent years, issues that were raised also at the most recent session of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection, when the findings of a recent report by Dr. Michelle Millar from NUIG, commissioned by the Irish Research Council, were considered.  The rationale for reducing the age thresholds of the one-parent family payment is sound.  Again, it is designed to discourage long-term welfare dependency by enabling the Department to engage with lone parents in order that they have enhanced access to the wide range of education, training and employment supports that are available.  The increase in the earnings disregard for one-parent family payment from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, which is provided for in this Bill, is evidence of the commitment of the Government to offer greater encouragement to lone parents to avail of employment opportunities and to increase their income from employment.  This is the right direction to take and future reforms affecting lone parents will continue to concentrate on making child care more affordable and work more attractive, as well as reducing barriers to education.  <\/p> <p> Issues relating to liable relative and maintenance provisions as they affect lone parents, and in particular those lone parents who moved from one-parent family payment to the jobseeker's transition payment, were also raised by Deputy O'Dea.  The most recent data indicate that some 40% of one-parent family payment recipients and 36% of JST recipients are in receipt of maintenance.  There is no evidence that the difference between these numbers, of just 4%, is a  result of the recent reforms.  However, the Department is now reviewing the legislation governing liable relatives and maintenance.<\/p> <p> Deputy Penrose inquired about what will be done with the increased funding being made available for the school meals programme.  The  &euro;5.7 million of additional funding, which will bring the total allocation in 2017 to &euro;47.7 million, will be directed to increasing funding for existing DEIS schools, both those which are already in the scheme and those which are not yet participating.  It will provide funding for newly designated DEIS schools following a review of DEIS by the Department of Education and Skills and will increase funding for breakfast clubs in non-DEIS schools, feeding 35,000 more children.  Most disadvantaged children are not in DEIS schools.  It is the Minister's vision to extend school breakfasts to all primary schools over the next five to ten years.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies raised concerns about the time it takes for the Department to process applications for the carer's allowance.  Deputy Barry suggested that the average processing time for carer's allowance was 40 weeks but the most recent data indicate that the average processing time is now 14  weeks.  Another Deputy raised the time it was taking to deal with appeals and I appreciate that this is still a long time but efforts are continuing to reduce it further against a background of an increased number of applications.  Additional resources have been and will be applied to improve the average processing time.  As with a number of other schemes operated by the Department, and particularly those where a medical assessment is involved, processing times generally will be reduced if applicants provide full and complete information and evidence when the initial application is being made and attach all of the required supporting documentation.  <\/p> <p> I appreciate that Deputies raised a range of other issues during the course of the Second Stage debate.  I and the Minister welcome the generally positive response to the Bill from the House and the acknowledgement that everything we would like to do cannot be done in one budget.  Deputy Brendan Smith acknowledged the work on farm assist, an issue which was also raised by Deputy Calleary.  It is important that the collective work of this House continues to ensure that what was a very difficult situation for a number of farmers was addressed in this year's budget.  <\/p> <p> My two county colleagues raised the issue of seasonal employment and I will continue my conversation with the Minister on that issue.  It is particularly acute in respect of the Killybegs area and for part-time fishermen in the processing sector.  It also affects farmers.<\/p> <p> I congratulate Deputy Moynihan for introducing a new history curriculum to the House whereby the history of the State just goes back to 2011, the State was formed in 2011 and nothing happened before then.<\/p><p>I also congratulate Sinn F&eacute;in, in particular Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, for setting an extended continuum prior to 2011 by going back a few years.<\/p> <p> In a financial context, just under &euro;30 billion has been taken out of the economy since 2008.  We now have an additional &euro;1.3 billion with which to play in the total budget for next year.  That puts in context how far we have come and where we need to go.  As our resources are finite, it is important that we continue to work together to ensure we will make life easier for the many people who are still struggling.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge Deputy Dara Calleary's comment that he is already working hard on the next budget, which is a good sign for the future.

I also want to hear about the committee's hearings on the issue and ensure everyone in the House is on the same page in order that proposals for regulations or legislation can be progressed as quickly as possible.  With this in mind, as soon as the joint committee is ready to engage on the issue, I will be pleased to explain to it each of the recommendations and outline the thinking behind them.<\/p>  <p>  The intention is to have the report published in December.

It is important that the reforms will be across the insurance industry sector.   Legislation will be required in some areas, while in others we will need to review existing legislation to ascertain whether certain sections of Acts that have been in place since 2004 have been commenced.  We need to do different things and, again, that speaks to the consensus I hope to achieve to enable us to expedite the legislation and reviews.  <\/p>  <p>  We need to deliver clarity and transparency for consumers and the market to ensure they can be confident when seeking insurance cover that it will be provided at an appropriate price and will stand.  They must also be able to see how increases in premiums are calculated and have more power, not only to shop around but also to understand and have faith in the operation of the market.  They should not feel they are being unfairly penalised for things they have not done.  This speaks to reforms that need to be made in the areas of claim costs, award amounts and the resolution processes currently in place. <\/p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Doherty's questions on a definitive date for publication, we have 40 recommendations and I wanted to wait until I had spoken in detail to the joint committee on each of them.  I do not want one or two recommendations to find their way into the public domain as this could give the impression that we are only considering one issue and ignoring others.  I will be more than happy to circulate to the joint committee the papers submitted to the Minister at the end of last month and I can do so immediately.  I will also be more than happy to discuss them with the joint committee. <\/p>  <p>  We indicated previously that the report would be published in December and I do not see any reason for missing that deadline.

A further piece of work has to be done and there is a recommendation which speaks to that.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 is concerned, there are several measures to review certain sections in the legislation but also other sections which have not commenced.  Transparency of data is key.  It is important for a healthy competitive sector and combatting potential insurance fraud, as well as being important for confidence for consumers.  The working group has been trying to get certain data from the industry so as to drill down into and get a better understanding.  Even that has proved difficult.  We are continuing to work with industry to ensure there will be no delay in implementing certain registers, frameworks or databases.  These will only serve the public interest and which already exist in other jurisdictions such as the UK.  There should be no problem in doing them here as well.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as the reversal of premiums is concerned, I have been communicating to industry from the working group is that we want to give as much certainty as possible to the sector as to the Government's plans.  It is hoped that even before recommendations come online that this certainly will help them to at least put a stop to increases in premiums.  Then, as the recommendations work their way through, we should see some of those costs come down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000040#OO00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1478793300,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I welcome that and, hopefully, we will get it into the committee next week and that the working group's recommendations will deal with the problem we are facing in the here and now.

Previous outputs include a scoping study produced by the ESRI last year under the joint research programme, initial short-term estimates published in the summer economic statement, an analysis of the possible sectoral and regional impacts of Brexit arising from Ireland's trade relationship with the UK, published with budget 2017, and a joint research paper with the ESRI modelling the medium to long term macroeconomic impact of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The medium to long-term analysis\u00a0shows the impact on Ireland will be significant.  Looking at the effect ten\u00a0years after a UK exit, in a WTO outcome the level of Irish GDP\u00a0could be almost\u00a04% below what it otherwise would have been in a no-Brexit scenario, with\u00a0most of the negative GDP impact coming in the first five years.  The level of employment, relative to a no-Brexit world,\u00a0is also expected to be 2% lower in the same scenario and unemployment 2 percentage points higher.  I would stress that these model results are based on a no policy change assumption. <\/p>  <p>  The sectoral analysis - published by my Department on budget day - shows that those most exposed to the UK are generally comprised of indigenous enterprises that are small in scale, are concentrated in food and manufacturing industries, have relatively low profit levels and have a disproportionate concentration of employment in regional and rural labour markets.  Budget 2017 laid out an extensive range of policies targeted at these exposed sectors, including the retention of\u00a0the 9% VAT rate and the extension of the foreign earnings deduction and the special assignee relief programme\u00a0until end 2020.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The sharp appreciation of the euro-sterling bilateral rate is perhaps the most significant short-term economic impact arising from Brexit.  Indeed, the current bilateral rate and its recent evolution will pose significant challenges, particularly for parts of the exporting sector and areas sensitive to cross-Border trade.  For instance, merchandise exports to the UK have fallen by almost 4% since the referendum.  Consumer prices are also beginning to reflect exchange rate developments falling by almost 1% since June.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a number of arrangements to ensure a whole-of-government response to Brexit, including a new Cabinet committee, which is overseeing the overall Government response to Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000040#OO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1478793300,"counter":246,"content":"<p>There seems to be a sense that growth in the economy is slowing.

These are serious concerns.<\/p>  <p>  The report from the ESRI and the Department of Finance concludes that the potential long-term impact of Brexit on Ireland is severe with up to 4% of less output than we otherwise would have.  That has knock-on consequences for Exchequer receipts, employment and investment in the economy.  We need to have a credible and coherent plan to deal with the fallout from Brexit.

When there is such spare capacity in the economy it grows more rapidly than it would be expected to grow on average.<\/p><p>Now that it is settling back, that factor exists in any case.  We predicted around budget time that our sustainable level of growth would be 3.25% or 3.5% out for the five years of the forecasting period.  On top of that, we took 0.5% off the growth rates for 2017, directly because of Brexit.  That was built into the Summer Economic Statement.  We maintained that position at budget time.<\/p> <p> There are figures published today by the European Commission showing a very marginal reduction of 0.1% for 2017, or a reduction from 3.6% to 3.5%, I believe.  It is showing a similar increase for 2018.  It is all very marginal, however, and effectively it is in agreement with the figures we have been working on running from the budget.<\/p> <p> Apart from analysing the potential fallout, it is very hard to make provision until we know where the United Kingdom will land in regard to its future negotiations with the European Union.  The analysis to which the Deputy referred considers what would happen under the Norwegian arrangement, the Swiss arrangement and the World Trade Organization arrangement.  The World Trade Organization arrangement, with the bureaucracy and possible tariffs that would arise from it, is the most extreme.  It is almost 4%.  As the Deputy said, however, it is over 40 quarters - 40 quarters from the British exit.  Therefore, it is about 12 years down the line.  If one assumes a rate of 3% per year and compounds it for 12 years, there is probably an increase in GDP of approximately 40%.  One takes almost 5% or 4% off that.

Since the devaluation is across the eurozone and against other countries, the United Kingdom does not seem to have many alternative sources of supply.  There could be a change of behaviour, however.  To put it very simplistically, the British housewife, instead of buying steak once a week, might buy chicken.  Then one would have a substitution effect that would affect exports of Irish beef to the United Kingdom.  We are trying to assess these results.  In addition, there will be a price change.

The &euro;245 million increase in the deficit is driven by an increase in Voted expenditure, an expected reduction in non-tax revenue and\u00a0a decline in banking-related receipts relative to the same period last year.  All of these are partially offset by increased tax receipts.<\/p><p>At the end of October, cumulative tax revenue of\u00a0&euro;36.7 billion had been\u00a0collected.  This\u00a0is\u00a01.7%, or &euro;613 million, ahead of target and up 4.7%, or &euro;1.651 billion, on the same period last year.  Corporation tax and excise duties are ahead of profile while VAT and income tax are slightly behind profile.<\/p><p>Income tax\u00a0receipts at the end of October were broadly in line with profile, down just 0.6%, or &euro;94 million, against target.  However, receipts were &euro;577 million, or 4.2%,\u00a0higher in year-on-year terms.  This slight underperformance against profile\u00a0is due to a\u00a0combination of weak DIRT receipts and an underperformance in the PAYE element of USC.  Reflecting\u00a0lower-than-expected interest rates, 2016 DIRT receipts are approximately &euro;130 million below profile, which is larger than the amount of underperformance in income tax in the year to date.<\/p><p>The PAYE element of USC is approximately &euro;195 million, or 7%, below profile.  This is due to a combination of factors.  First,\u00a0the final USC yield for 2015 was almost &euro;100 million lower than expected at the time of budget 2016, meaning that the base for the\u00a02016 forecast yield was too high.  Second, the Revenue Commissioners updated their method of estimating the\u00a0first and full year costs of new tax measures with effect from July 2016.  An analysis of the first year and full year apportionment of costs was undertaken to ensure the estimated\u00a0distribution was as accurate as possible.  As a result, more costs-yields of new income tax measures are now attributed to the first year, which results in a consequential lower carryover cost in the second year.  While the\u00a0full year costs of the USC tax\u00a0measures introduced in budget 2016 did not change, an increased allocation of\u00a0that cost to\u00a0first year means that more of the costs\u00a0are\u00a0being incurred in 2016 than was previously estimated.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>As the final DIRT due month has now passed, it should have no further effect on income tax\u00a0receipts.  Given the relative predictability of PAYE receipts, the key open question relates to receipts from the self-employed sector.  November is the most important month for these and a strong performance\u00a0should ensure that the overall income tax\u00a0target for the year will be achieved.<\/p><p>While VAT receipts are up nearly &euro;475 million in year-on-year terms, they are\u00a0running approximately &euro;285 million, or 2.6%, below profile.  This is primarily due to the fact that, while retail sales have been strong in the year, with retail volumes up 3.8 % year-on-year, the 1.9% increase in the value of retail sales, the base upon which VAT is driven, is much more modest, reflecting the fact that there is little inflation in the economy.<\/p><p>Regarding the smaller taxes, stamp duties are behind profile while the capital taxes are ahead.

Previously in 2015, the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation, SBFIC, with the support of the Public Banking Forum of Ireland, submitted a proposal to the Department of Finance regarding the development of a local public banking system in Ireland.

The level of contact I have with SMEs recently does not indicate that there is a shortage of credit available on the market but I do accept that certain products must be tailored to meet particular needs and the products for small businesses in rural communities are probably different from those for medium-sized industries in cities.

The advantage of the public banking model is that it provides a mechanism whereby local deposits are recycled in the local economy which we badly need in rural Ireland so that not all development takes place in our cities.  As is the case in Germany, the public banking model brings that real experience in business lending into that gap between what the commercial banks are good at in commercial lending and what the credit unions or other local facilities are not skilled enough to do.  There is a gap.  Only the study will bring that out but my concern is that at the outset, the Department of Finance, having looked at it, do not see the same gap in the market.

The Sparkasse Institute for International Cooperation and Development has a long record in this respect and Germany in particular, as the Minister referenced, has a large volume of SME development that is very much aided by this kind of local banking.  The credit unions have already been referenced.  We also have a number of regional development agencies as well as the post offices.  In the context of providing a banking service in rural areas where the banks are no longer as visible or plentiful as they once were, I suggest a pilot in an area like the midlands where this could be tested.  I know it has been discussed in the meetings I have had with the Minister from time to time.

We must be prudential.  If we are to learn anything from the experience of the past eight years, it is that you do not take risks with other people's money.  That is why the Central Bank is so rigorous in its regulator regime.  I outlined six different initiatives that have been put in place over the past five years or so.  The strongest one is probably the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which is specifically designed for SMEs.  Some of the money provided there is coming from the German bank KfW, which has a lot of experience in funding SMEs.  To the end of June 2016, the initiative lent &euro;347 million and has provided funds to 8,619 SMEs, 5% of which are based outside Dublin so it is not true to say it is not reaching into the regions.  At the other side of the scale, the microenterprise loan fund is administered by Microfinance Ireland and provides support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 and is available to start ups and newly established or growing micro-enterprises employing less than ten people.  The point I am making is that I would encourage the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to continue with the good work it is doing.  I will pass on the Deputy's suggestion that in order to speed up the initiative, a pilot scheme might be a reasonably good idea in some region of the country and we will see how it goes.

The weakness and\u00a0volatility we have seen reflect market concerns around Brexit and a prolonged period of low and\u00a0negative interest rates as well as uncertainty around the strength of global economic growth.  Clearly, in order for us to proceed with the sale of any of our banking assets, we would need\u00a0to be satisfied that the market is prepared to put a fair and reasonable value on the business bearing in mind its current performance, its future prospects and the outlook for the Irish economy.

The bank has made significant progress in reducing NPLs and growing new business.  PTSB has also significantly de-risked its balance sheet under the intensive oversight of various authorities since 2011 through deleveraging, an improved funding profile and increased capital levels.  It has made good progress in reducing arrears and returned to underlying profitability in 2015 for the first time since 2007.

The IDA works to encourage its client companies in the area to grow and embed their businesses.  In terms of enterprise development in the midlands, and in Mullingar in particular, Enterprise Ireland supports entrepreneurs who are setting up start-up companies in manufacturing and internationally traded services.

It is well known and well documented that there has been a major increase in the population in County Laois, and in Portlaoise in particular, over the last ten to 20 years.  According to the last two censuses, outside of the major cities, Portlaoise was the fastest growing stand-alone town in Ireland.  There has been substantial investment for schools in the town in recent years, many of which have commenced or are under construction.<\/p>  <p>  I am seeking a timeline from the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in regard to the replacement building for St. Francis special school which is currently located on the Timahoe Road.  This school has 90 mild to moderate educationally challenged students.  It is a special school.  The children who attend it are special and so, too, are the teachers but they have been in the current building a long time.  As part of schools development in Portlaoise, one of the existing primary schools, St. Paul's national school, is being relocated.  The patron, through the parish and the bishop, have made the St. Paul's site available for the new St. Francis special school.  I hope that this site will be vacated as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I am asking the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure the process in respect of construction of the new St. Francis special school is progressed quickly because the St. Paul's school site will be vacated next year.  Earlier today I spoke to Fr. Paddy Byrne of the board of management and he told me that the project is at initial design stage.  The chairman and board of management, along with the teachers, staff, parents and pupils are looking forward to the provision of this new school as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The current school building is old and includes many prefabs.  New prefabs were purchased recently and I understand an application for emergency funding to allow certain works to be completed, such that the school is in a reasonable condition until such time as it is vacated, is awaiting approval.  The reason I am asking about this school in particular is that most of the other school projects have either be given the go ahead or are progressing.  St. Francis special school caters for children with mild to moderate educationally challenged students, who cannot be left behind.  For this reason, I ask that the Minister apply pressure to ensure the timeline is adhered to.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the second level school, the Minister recently announced that the new patronage of that school will be the Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board in conjunction with a gaelscoil.  I attended a meeting several months ago at which applications were being put together locally in relation to that patronage.  I am pleased that this is going ahead because ultimately it was the only application submitted from the town and there is general support from everybody for it.  The current CBS and Scoil Chriost R&iacute; convent school are overflowing.  I am told both schools having waiting lists of 40 students for next year.<\/p>  <p>  We already have a new college in Portlaoise which is run by the ETB.  It is important now that the patrons have been announced and a site has been identified at the old Centrepoint shopping centre on the Mountrath Road, which is close to Portlaoise college, that work on the new school commences as soon as possible.  They are the two school projects that are in the system for Portlaoise.  I urge the Minister to keep the pressure on to ensure they are progressed.  I would also like to make the case for a new school for Kolbe special school which caters for students with profound physical and other challenges.  There may be an opportunity for joined-up thinking in terms of the co-location of the Kolbe and St. Francis special schools on the site that will be vacated by St. Paul's national school.  There is an excellent opportunity to accommodate both schools on that site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000049#XX00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1478798700,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Sean Fleming for raising this issue, which illustrates that Portlaoise is at the acute end of a problem being experienced across the country generally.

I acknowledge that Laois and Portlaoise in particular have been at the sharp end of those pressures.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a major building project to provide a new post-primary school in Portlaoise is included in my six-year construction programme 2016-2021 and is listed to proceed to tender and construction stages in 2019-2021.  The Deputy is also aware that I announced the patronage of the new post-primary schools to open in 2017 and 2018 on 3 November last.  In the case of Portlaoise, the patron will be Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board with An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta as trustee partner.

A number of suitable sites have been identified and technically assessed and engagement with the landowner with respect to one of these options has commenced.  However, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, there are sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally and I am not, therefore, in a position to provide further information at this time.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to St. Francis special school, Portlaoise, a major project is included on my six-year construction programme 2016-2021 with the proposed project to be progressed with a view to proceeding to tender and construction stages in 2018.  Following a consultation process with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, it was decided that the project is to deliver a new 12 classroom school to facilitate pupils with mild and moderate general learning disability and ASD.  Officials from my Department met with representatives of the school&rsquo;s board of management, together with the patron&rsquo;s representative in September.  With the full support of the patron, it is proposed that the project will deliver a new school building on the site currently occupied by St. Paul&rsquo;s national school on Borris Road, Portlaoise.  The permanent building on this site, which is currently occupied by St. PauI's national school will be demolished as part of the project.

It is expected that the project will shortly commence the early stages of architectural planning.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Fleming is aware that St. Paul's national school is one of three primary schools that are being amalgamated.  A building project to provide two new 24 classroom schools to accommodate the newly amalgamated schools is expected to be completed towards the end of this year or early next year.  The two 24 classroom schools being built are located on a shared campus on parish lands at Aghnaharna.  St. Paul's national school will remain at its current premises until such time as the new school is completed and ready for occupation.  The Deputy will recognise that the Department is working hard to ensure that these various projects fall in sequence so that we can deliver for the children in Portlaoise.  I can assure the Deputy of the commitment of the Department to keep this project moving swiftly.

The three second level schools currently in the town were built in recent years.  As the Minister said, two new parish schools are being built.  Over the past couple of years a new gaelscoil, and Educate Together school and a Church of Ireland school were built.  This is because of the increase in population in the area and not because Laois is looking for more.  There has been huge growth in the population of Laois as a result of the overflow of people from Dublin and the surrounding areas.

All I can hope is that the architects who have planned the two new schools to amalgamate three existing national schools at a single site have made provision such that extensions may be added quickly when the time comes.  Not too many towns are getting an increase in second level schools for 1,000 people.  The same is happening at primary level.  I encourage the Minister to ensure that the new secondary school goes ahead as soon as possible.  I make a last appeal to the Minister not to forget the Kolbe special school.

Leixlip was in zone 3 but is now in zone 4 if one travels to the city.  Even short hop journeys have had their original destination zones changed.  Leixlip Confey to Maynooth is now considered to be a zone 3 trip meaning that local journeys are now stuck with disproportionately high fares, which puts people off using the service.

However, the result is that a significant number of people face substantial increases of between 16% and 18% from the original destination zones.  Leixlip is 20 km from the city centre and there are two stations there whereas Bray is 34 km from the city centre.  It is more expensive to go from the place that is 20 km from the city centre than from the place that is 34 km away.  Even so, the town that is 34 km away has a better and more frequent service.  There is certainly a reblance in terms of Sallins and Kilcock, which will have their fares reduced and will now come into the suburban service where they should have been in the first place.  It is interesting to note that it is a shorter distance from Sallins to the city centre than from Bray, but the service terminates not in the city centre but at Heuston.  Passengers must then get on the Luas for yet another journey.  It is not even a comparable service in terms of quality.<\/p>  <p>  One must ask if it is a fair increase given that distances do not seem to make a difference.  It depends just on the location and the particular line involved.  It now costs most people &euro;36 per week or &euro;145 per month just to get to work.  It is a sizeable increase.  Passenger journeys on trains have been increasing since 2014 and we all welcome that.  There has been growth of 5% between 2015 and 2016 and it looks like the trend will continue.  The commuter belt areas are those which show the greatest level of improvement.  It is important that this continues because there is a significant congestion issue.  One only has to listen to \"AA Roadwatch\" in the morning to know that the N4 and N7 feature every day.  They are the roads which correlate to the two train lines to which I have referred.  Congestion issues are increasing rapidly and there are obvious environmental impacts.  Climate change comes into play in terms of meeting those targets.  If we are going to make it more expensive and unattractive to use rail services, growth will not continue.  I do not see the sense in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000050#YY00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1478799300,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy for bringing this to my attention.

The reason this has happened is that various stations have been moved from one zone to another and it is not purely, simply and clinically all a matter of distance.  I will pass the message to NTA and see what sort of reply I get.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the National Transport Authority, NTA, published its fares determinations for the year ahead.  These determinations are published annually by the NTA in line with its statutory powers under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  It is important to note that this process and the powers afforded to the NTA are statutory ones and, much as I might like to have it, I do not have any function as Minister with regard to the level of fares.  The statutory role of the NTA allows it independently to examine the level, scope and nature of fares across our public transport system.  Since it assumed its regulatory powers in this area, the NTA has sought to simplify what was an extremely complicated and cumbersome system.  The system differed from operator to operator and suffered from a myriad of different and sometimes overlapping fare types and offers.  It was a system which also gave rise to numerous inconsistencies and anomalies.  It may be that Deputy Murphy has pointed out some which still exist.  I reassure Members that these fare determinations are not developed on a whim, but are rather a consequence of a strategy by the NTA to simplify and regularise how we charge for public transport services.<\/p>  <p>  Fares are set with the aim of maintaining customer support and passenger numbers while ensuring financial stability for the operators.  In recent years, a key thrust of the policy has been to encourage people to switch to Leap cards rather than cash fares.  Members will agree that the development of the Leap card has been a great success and I am sure they all welcome the significant discounts it provides on fares across all modes of public transport.  This year's fare determination sees no increases for around 75% of all passengers using our bus and rail services, which is a benefit to the majority.  As part of the long-term strategy I spoke about a minute ago, the NTA has been seeking since 2012 to overhaul rail fares across the greater Dublin area network and to introduce a more logical and fair distance-based model.  This has involved examining approximately 1,200 origin and destination station pairs across the entire network.  The examination concluded that fares between some station pairs were set particularly low for various historic, commercial and operational reasons and were not in line with the fares other passengers were paying for journeys of similar distance.<\/p><p>This year the final 261 station pairs were examined, with the vast majority seeing a decrease in their fares for next year as a result.  The overhaul has also included the inclusion of Sallins and Kilcock stations within the short hop zone, which will result in significant savings for the many people who use the stations.  I have no doubt that Deputy Murphy welcomes those changes and the savings they will deliver to constituents in Kildare North.<\/p> <p> However, inevitably a small number, 36 to be exact, or around 3% of the total number of possible fares, will see a fare increase.  This is as a result of the previously unfair level of fares when compared with other station fares across the whole network.  In terms of Leixlip, this means that the trip to Pearse Station in Dublin has been moved from zone 3 to zone 4.  A single adult Leap fair will now cost &euro;2.93, as opposed to &euro;2.46.  I am aware that some local media have reported increases to Maynooth-city centre fares.  However, that is incorrect and there is no change in the cost of a single fare between Maynooth and the city centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000050#YY00700","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478799900,"counter":355,"content":"<p>There are three ways to fund public transport and I accept that there is a statutory function for the DTA. One way is to increase fares.  The other element is to reduce costs and the third is subvention.  A decision has been made in the absence of adequate subvention, but it is a short-term strategy.  Getting people onto public transport will save money in the long term by virtue of the kind of obligations for which we will have to shell out hard cash in terms of our climate obligations.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the changes to the Sallins and Kilcock fares.  It was a disgrace that they were not included in the suburban area, given that they are suburban stations.  I have made the argument for a long time that they were located outside of the suburban service when in fact they were suburban services.  I do not want to pick on Bray, but one can choose a location and make a direct comparison.  I would not increase fares.  We need a reliable service, which is the first thing people want.  We also have to have an affordable service.  A direct comparison based on distance shows that the comparison is not fair, and it is a valid point to make.<\/p>  <p>  The change that will come into effect regarding Kilcock cannot happen until mid-2017 because of technology in stations.  The situation will, unfortunately, continue for another six months or so.  The Maynooth train line was upgraded and capacity was doubled through funding from EU Structural Funds.  The upgrade was sought, as part of the Luas package, because of the degree of congestion at the time, which made Dublin an unattractive place.  We now have a good line, but we are making it unattractive for people to use it.  It is a retrograde step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000051#ZZ00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1478799900,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I would like to take up a couple of the Deputy's points.  She is correct in that subvention, costs or an increase in revenue are the only solutions to the problem.  I am sure the Deputy realises, as much as anybody else in the House, that the condition of &Iacute;arnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is worse than critical.  We have an annual crisis.  As a result, I have commissioned the rail review which will be released next week.  It will address the three problems in the broader sense.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the subvention will increase for &Iacute;arnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann next year.  Increasing revenue by raising fares is not something of which I am in favour but, as the Deputy acknowledged, it is not something over which I have any great power.  The net effect of this will not increase costs.  Rather, it is an effort to be more equitable and measure fares as consistently as possible in terms of distance.  That is done by categorising places into different zones.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy made a comparison with Bray, which is a particularly strong case.  She knows I have a vested interest in the station - it is not in my constituency but it is on my doorstep.  I will ask the NTA to examine that case and revert to the Deputy because it may be indicative of distances not being completely consistent throughout the country.  One of the areas in her constituency is obviously suffering as a result.

The official model we are using is outdated.  It is based on a an opiate and heroin addiction policies and procedures model of 20 years ago and does not take into account or have sufficient understanding of today's challenges and the polydrug nature of today's drug users.<\/p>  <p>  We would all accept that the drug problem has never been as bad as it is now.  It is true to say that no town or village in Ireland does not have a drug problem.  We do not seem to have any rural strategy on drugs.<\/p>  <p>  I attended a drug task force meeting during the week, during which we were told that 679 people died from drug-related deaths in the State in 2015.  The frustration expressed at the meeting was that if this happened in another area, such as road deaths, there would be uproar.  We are not good at finding out how many people have died.  In some cases, people die from toxicity or suicide rather than drug use.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is much more overt nowadays.  Many of those involved, such as runners, dealers, mules and those involved in intimidation are getting younger by the day.  It is not surprising to see a ten year old child involved.  There are no safe zones around schools, which are open territory, as is the Luas, bus routes, shopping centres, O'Connell Street and so on.  In my constituency, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Tallaght drugs unit comprised 31 people five years ago, but last year it was decreased to an all-time low of 16 members.  The population is increasing, but the same level of services are in place and there is a large area to cover.  The Tallaght drugs task force, of which I am a member, has seen its core funding slashed by successive Governments.  <\/p>  <p>  An added difficulty is that Departments, which are supposed to be part of the pillars of the drug strategy, including the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Social Protection, do not attend meetings.  In some cases, there is difficulty in getting representatives from the Garda or local authorities to attend.  Different task forces have different problems.<\/p>  <p>  Family support is supposed to be one of the pillars of the strategy, yet Tusla is not involved in discussions.  The HSE attends many meetings, but again it depends on the task force.  The issue involves more than one agency.<\/p>  <p>  One of the gaps in the strategy is that those who should be involved in it are not sitting round table.  Drugs task forces now include alcohol in their remit, but no extra resources are provided for this extra work.  There is a difficulty with addiction services.  There is a gap in the service in terms of councillors.  For example, there is one councillor in Tallaght.  Needle exchange programmes are in place, but some community-based programmes have been told that insurance costs have increased from &euro;1,500 to between &euro;7,000 and &euro;11,000.  That is totally unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  There is a policy of ignoring the problem.  The problem exists, but we tend to ignore the difficulties.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to some of the issues I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000051#ZZ00600","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1478800500,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Crowe for raising the issue of the challenges faced by drug and alcohol task forces throughout the country.  As the Deputy is aware, problem drug use continues to be one of the most significant challenges facing our country and it has become more complex than ever, with a wider range of drugs being abused.  In line with the national drugs strategy, the Government is committed to continuing support for initiatives to tackle the drug problem.<\/p>  <p>  I assure Deputy Crowe that every effort has been made to protect the budgets of drug and alcohol task forces in recent years.  The overall allocation to drug and alcohol task forces for community based drugs initiatives this year is in excess of &euro;27 million.  This is the same overall level of funding allocated in 2015.  It is a matter for task forces to ensure that the budget is effectively deployed to address current priorities and locally identified needs.<\/p>  <p>  Following the 2011-12 review of drug task forces, increased responsibilities were given to task forces with regard to addressing the alcohol problem.  In light of this expanded role, over &euro;900,000 in additional funding has been made available to drug and alcohol task forces from the dormant accounts fund for substance misuse initiatives.  These initiatives aim to promote healthier lifestyle choices throughout society with regard to alcohol by influencing and raising awareness of alcohol harm among the general population and specific risk groups.  In addition, through the alcohol forum, training has been provided to a number of task forces in developing local alcohol action plans.<\/p>  <p>  A key strength of the national drugs strategy is that it brings together the community, voluntary and statutory sectors to provide a collective response to the drugs problem.  The task force model is a longstanding example of partnership in co-ordinating action at local level on substance misuse.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there are many examples of excellent work being undertaken by many task forces across the country in addressing local drug problems.  However, there is an onus on all task forces to play their part fully for the model to remain effective.  In this regard, it is important that all statutory, community and voluntary stakeholders actively participate in the process.<\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe that task forces should be clear on what is expected of them and that they should be given support to strengthen their capacity to meet the challenges ahead.  With this in mind, the Department of Health has commissioned a performance measurement framework for task forces.  This framework will provide a means of assessing the drugs situation in local communities so that task force resources can be more effectively targeted at underlying need.  I am optimistic that this new framework will help task forces to strengthen their contribution to the new drugs strategy, which will come into force in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000052#AAA00100","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1478800500,"counter":362,"content":"<p>We all accept that the problem is getting worse.

Those stakeholders should be encouraged or forced to attend the meeting.<\/p>  <p>  There is positive work happening in communities, but I detect that people are tired and exhausted from the challenges they face.  One of the new challenges that has emerged in recent years is that of drug intimidation, which is widespread.  Children, adults and grandparents experience it.  This needs to be addressed and supports need to be given to communities that find themselves in that situation. <\/p>  <p>  There used to be additional funding provided to the task forces to address emerging needs but that funding is no longer available.

There is a shortage of skilled people to define the condition.<\/p>  <p>  The overt nature of the problem is the most frightening aspect to this.

I also extend a warm welcome to our two interpreters whose presence is perhaps a first for this Chamber.<\/p> <p> The joint committee identified Irish Sign Language as one of its priority issues in its work programme agreed in September 2016.  Following this, the committee invited representatives from the Irish Deaf Society to a meeting which was held on 28 September 2016 to discuss the issue of official recognition of Irish Sign Language.  In the course of the evidence presented, the committee heard of the extent to which the deaf community experiences exclusion and isolation through the lack of sign language provision.  One witness described this experience as one of \"extreme marginalisation\" and this extends from the personal level through to interactions with key organs of the State such as the education system, Courts Service, health service and Parliament, D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p> I thank the representatives of the Irish Deaf Society for the evidence they presented to the joint committee.  Members were very appreciative of the effort made by the delegation and on behalf of the committee, I express to Dr. John Bosco Conama, Wendy Murray and Brian Crean our sincere gratitude.  The committee is of the view that legislation will be required to achieve formal recognition of Irish Sign Language and that this should be progressed with the urgency that is required.<\/p> <p> Three years ago, Senator Mark Daly and the then Senators Thomas Byrne and Labhr&aacute;s O Murch&uacute; introduced the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2013.  The Government did not accept the Bill, which proposed the recognition of Irish Sign Language.  In July 2016, Senator Mark Daly initiated the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016, an updated version of the 2013 legislation.  The report presented by the joint committee recommends that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and Government lend their full support to the Bill initiated by Senator Daly.  The Bill completed Second Stage in the Seanad last month and is awaiting Committee Stage.  The joint committee believes the proposed legislation should be prioritised and enacted as soon as possible and urges the Minister to ensure this happens without delay.<\/p> <p>  As confirmed by the Irish Deaf Society in its revised working paper on formal recognition of Irish Sign Language, ISL is a language of the face, hands and body that has been in existence for hundreds of years and developed from within the deaf community in Ireland.  It is one of our two indigenous languages, the other, Gaeilge, being our first official language. Irish Sign Language differs from sign languages in other countries and is unique to Ireland.  All informed opinion urges earliest exposure to and development of proficiency in ISL.  Just as with other language acquisition, the early development of a competency in Irish Sign Language does not affect a young person&rsquo;s capacity to later acquire other communication skills, including spoken language skills, if within their later competency.  ISL is, as the authors state, a naturally occurring form of communication among deaf people, developed over centuries and, as with all living languages, it is developing to meet the times and needs of those who are its primary users.<\/p> <p> The right to use one&rsquo;s own language is an important human right.  The right to communicate and impart one&rsquo;s thoughts, ambitions, fears, hopes and ideas is a universal right.  The failure to date of independent Ireland to accord official recognition to Irish Sign Language has echoes in history for many of us who lament the enforced decline in the use of our first language.<\/p> <p> There is an almost infinite number of barriers faced and experienced by members of the deaf community.  Could we, who are fortunate to have sufficiently clear hearing, imagine the difficulties of daily life if we were born without the gift of hearing, for example, hearing the telephone ring, answering it and having a conversation; not being able to summon help; never listening to the radio or music players or whatever; being dependent on subtitles to follow films and the daily news on television; not being able to communicate with our doctor, dentist, nurse, solicitor, priest or minister; encountering difficulties while shopping, attending public events, the hairdresser, bank, post office or credit union; accessing State services; and presenting in labour or having a child?  The list goes on and these are only a few examples that I can cite in the short time available to me.  I can well believe that our deaf fellow citizens in the Visitors Gallery would alarm us with the many examples they could advise in an equally short period.<\/p> <p> Mentioning not being able to summon help and the earlier reference to \"extreme marginalisation\" brings me again to a sad and tragic chapter in the recent story of the deaf community in Ireland and those most seriously impacted among its number.  In launching the report on 13 October in the Leinster House audiovisual room, I dedicated the event to the memory of brothers Daniel and William McCarthy whose remains were discovered at their Millrose Estate home in Bluebell, west Dublin, just over a month ago.  Their story is a sad and tragic one, their lonely deaths among the saddest and most tragic imaginable.  Their story and passing will always be recalled when we address this most important, long overdue and now, as always, essential need to accord formal recognition to Irish Sign Language.  Go nd&eacute;ana Dia Tr&oacute;caire ar a n-anamacha d&iacute;lis.<\/p> <p> There are 5,000 people and an additional 35,000 hearing people using Irish Sign Language on a daily basis.  The World Federation of the Deaf advises that many countries worldwide recognise their indigenous sign languages.  Why is Ireland not one of them?<\/p><p>Why do we delay and delay?  Irish Sign Language was formally recognised in the North of Ireland in 2004.  The Good Friday Agreement requires equal respect of all rights bestowed in either jurisdiction in both jurisdictions.  That equality is not in place for the Irish deaf community.  I appeal to the Minister of State, and to this Government, to accept the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  I appeal to them to continue support for the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016 through all remaining Seanad Stages and D&aacute;il Stages and to facilitate its signing into law by our President at the earliest date possible.<\/p> <p> Anois, in&aacute;r dteanga d&uacute;chais eile, molaim go m&oacute;r don Teach glacadh leis an tuairisc seo agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don sprioc soil&eacute;ir at&aacute; ann.

I thank Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Senator Mark Daly and the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality for their amazing work on the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016.  I also commend members of the committee for their considered report on the formal recognition of Irish Sign Language, ISL.<\/p>  <p>  Like the committee, I recently met with the Irish Deaf Society, as well as other groups and individuals from the deaf community, to listen to their concerns, experiences and objectives.  I am keenly aware of the priorities of the deaf community and, in particular, the problems relating to ISL.  We have about 5,000 users of ISL in the State.  It is fair and appropriate that public services provide this group with interpretation services at no cost to the user when questions of statutory entitlement are at issue.<\/p>  <p>  Our discussion of this issue is particularly appropriate as we move toward ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  As Members will be aware, the Government is committed to ratification of the convention.  It is working on finalising the details of the necessary legislation to remove the final legislative barriers to that ratification.  We hope to be in a position to publish this Bill in the near future.  We also intend to ratify the convention's optional protocol at the same time as the convention itself is ratified.<\/p>  <p>  Interpretation services for deaf people on a State-wide basis are provided by the Sign Language Interpreting Service, SLIS, established by the Citizens Information Bureau in 2007.  The SLIS is a voluntary not-for-profit organisation in the form of a limited company, which promotes, represents, advocates and ensures the availability of quality interpretation services to deaf people.  The overall vision is to ensure deaf people can easily exercise their rights under the Equal Status and Disability Acts, as well as being able to access their rights and entitlements to public and social services.  The SLIS has a board of directors comprising representatives of key national stakeholders such as the Citizens Information Bureau, DeafHear and the deaf community.  SLIS receives State funding directly from the Citizens Information Bureau.  In 2016, it has an allocation of &euro;275,000.  It is generally acknowledged the SLIS does superb work in its provision of an extensive range of services, and that it intends to build on its current capacity is clear from its statement of strategy document 2015 to 2020.  In particular, the service intends to increase availability of interpreting services in key areas of daily life, particularly where deaf people are exercising their rights or entitlements.  It is important in the context of this discussion that we acknowledge the excellent services that the SLIS provides for the provision of interpretation services.  It is my intention to build on and develop this capacity.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the publication of the Irish Sign Language Bill, I had approved a draft of the new national disability inclusion strategy with the following proposed action for public consultation, namely, we will propose legislation to ensure that all public bodies provide ISL users with free ISL interpretation when availing of their statutory entitlements.  There will be more work needed to tease out the detail of how this will operate.  In principle, however, what is required is a highly focused approach directly on statutory entitlements.  We know from our experience with the Irish language and the Official Languages Act that what is really important is developing the capacity to provide services in the language of the customer's choice, and that enacting legislation, or indeed constitutional protection, which the report also alludes to, does not solve the practical service delivery issues that need to be planned for.  We need a pragmatic and feasible approach backed up by statutory recognition of the right of users of ISL.  We must also ensure we can actually deliver and that the service can be guaranteed in practice.<\/p>  <p>  I note the committee has recommended the Government should fully support the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016, which passed Second Stage in the Seanad on 19 October.  In this regard, I must flag several questions about specific provisions in the Bill.  While the Bill's central principle is sound, it seems, however, to take a disproportionate approach to the provision of services for users of Irish Sign Language.  Preambles are not a feature of how we draft primary legislation and do not seem necessary.  I am not sure anything useful would come from the proposal to impose an obligation on public bodies to develop three yearly action plans for ISL, as contained in section 9.  The establishment of a new public body by the Citizens Information Board, instead of letting the board continue to develop an ISL service as it has been doing, does not seem to be necessary.  Section 18 includes a provision to offer the annual accounts of the new body for sale.  Usual practice is to publish accounts online.  It is difficult to see that this provision is necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Section 19 provides for borrowing by the public body established under section 12.  Allowing an Exchequer-funded public body to borrow money is manifestly not a good idea.  Of particular concern is how the loans would be controlled and paid back.  Section 29 provides for 12 months' imprisonment for either offering interpretation services or teaching ISL on a commercial basis without being registered.  I fully accept the need for proper standards.  However, this approach is unnecessarily punitive and does nothing to address the real issue, namely, the need to develop the availability of ISL interpreters.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has considered the proposed amendment of section 43 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as set out in Part 4 of the proposed Bill, in consultation with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  It makes the point that the proposed approach would remove an important part of the broadcasting regulatory framework from its natural and appropriate statutory locus, namely, the Broadcasting Act 2009.<\/p><p> Section 43 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 already provides for the preparation of statutory rules by the BAI that place a range of statutory obligations on broadcasters.  In the case of persons who are deaf or have a hearing impairment, persons who are blind or partially sighted, and persons who have a hearing impairment and are partially sighted, the BAI has adopted access rules that contain specific target percentage ranges in regard to sign language and subtitling that broadcasters are required to comply with and that are revised by the BAI from time to time in accordance with the provisions of the Act.<\/p> <p> In addition, sections 53 to 55, inclusive, of the Act provide for an investigation and potential enforcement action in circumstances where there has been an apparent breach of a broadcasting rule.  It is noted that this latter aspect is not provided for in the proposed legislation.  Furthermore, section 43(6) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for biennial reviews of the access rules to be undertaken by the BAI, thereby allowing for potential revisions to be made to the rules.  In Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the proposed Bill, however, it is proposed to incorporate a number of percentage targets for the period 2017 to 2019, which appear to have been taken from the current access rules.  The Bill seeks to make no provision for any review or potential revision of those targets.  As such, the Schedule would become outdated every two years.  We should consider this also.  It should also be noted that Part 1 of Schedule 1, as currently proposed, omits certain services, such as Oireachtas TV, Irish language television and UTV Ireland.<\/p> <p> Finally, from the BAI's extensive and ongoing consultations with user groups, it is evident that quality and reliability of access service provision is as, if not more, important than the achievement of targets as such.  This is a quantitative measure only.  The BAI's regulatory approach facilitates a far more flexible and consultative approach that takes account of improvements in the quality, reliability and range of the access service provision - for example, increased live subtitling, subtitled Irish content, etc., rather than just quantitative targets, as envisaged in the proposed Bill, thereby providing a regulatory approach that delivers in a more comprehensive and nuanced way on the wishes of users and intended beneficiaries of the services.<\/p> <p> All these points will need to be considered very carefully as the examination of the Bill moves forward in the House.  I am delighted that the pre-legislative scrutiny process of the Bill will now be complete and that, in due course and in the light of the assessment by the Oireachtas of the Bill's proposals, we can work together to determine what amendments are needed to create the focused right to interpretation I am thinking of and remove some of the other elements that do not seem appropriate, as I mentioned.<\/p> <p> For now, the new national disability inclusion strategy I mentioned is quite relevant.  The strategy, which it is intended will be in place before the end of 2016, includes a specific action to create a statutory right for a person to receive free Irish Sign Language interpretation services when availing of statutory services.  That is an important step in the right direction.  In taking this approach, we will still need to tease out in detail several issues, including how statutory services are to be defined and whether advance booking of the service would be required, but this approach would provide a more fruitful way forward, focused on meeting real riced in a pragmatic and cost-effective way, than the overly elaborate approach in the Bill.  One of the issues the House might consider is whether it is better to build on the existing support provided for the provision of interpretation services by the Citizens Information Board rather than create a new public body, as proposed in the Bill.<\/p> <p> I thank all those who have contributed and I look forward to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000054#CCC00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478802300,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Before I begin, I wish to make a suggestion.  I am keeping an eye on the monitor and I am conscious that, unlike the people in the Visitors Gallery, those watching the stream of this debate will not benefit from being able to see the interpreter.

It might be worth focusing a camera on the interpreter in the press gallery for the benefit of those watching online.<\/p>  <p>  Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh don Teachta &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in agus as an tuairisc a chuir s&eacute; os &aacute;r mbr&aacute;id agus do Chumann na mBodhar as an bhfeachtas m&oacute;r a bh&iacute; acu le c&uacute;pla bliain anuas.

It is a language of which I am very proud and which I have spoken since I was a child.  It means a great deal to me.  Despite the complaints I might have regarding its status, promotion and funding, I know that although everyone might not understand when I speak it here or in the courts or engage through Irish with public services, it will feature on the record and be translated.  It is officially recognised in the Constitution.  I have a right to use it in the courts in any circumstances and to engage with public services through my native languages, to greater or lesser extent.  While all this is done imperfectly and while there are flaws in how it might be done, I am aware that these are privileges that the deaf community in Ireland does not enjoy.  Users of Irish Sign Language do not enjoy these privileges in respect of what is their native language.<\/p>  <p>  I note what the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, said about the Official Languages Act.  There is a lot to be learned from that because the manner in which it has been implemented has been quite imperfect and flawed.  If we are to use it as a template, it needs to be improved on significantly in terms of how we are to create additional capacity.  I have significant complaints I could rehearse in regard to it.<\/p>  <p>  It is extraordinary that the campaign for the recognition of Irish Sign Language has been taking place for so long.  I note from some of the information we have received from the Irish Deaf Society that the matter was first raised in 1988 by former MEP Eileen Lemass.  Perhaps this was not the first occasion on which it was raised but it was certainly the first resolution on sign languages in the European Parliament.  The year 1988 is the year before I was born so it is literally a lifetime since that happened.  There has been recognition in the North since 2004.  The campaign has been going on for many years.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the work of the Irish Deaf Society, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and the Seanad, which passed Second Stage of legislation on recognition recently.  It is the culmination of a long campaign.  It was a very substantial and widespread campaign.  I was actually canvassed on it during the general election campaign.  Clearly, the community on the ground was aware of the matter and it was lobbying on it.  This is evidenced by the support of the 40 local authorities who supported this motion.<\/p>  <p>  The 5,000 people who use Irish Sign Language daily and the hearing people who use it regularly deserve so much more than what they have received in recent years.  It is a question of respect, access and equality.  Having learned about the importance of Irish Sign Language, I am astonished by the extent to which the deaf community has been disadvantaged by the lack of recognition, particularly regarding rights before the law and the right to access to justice.  It is absolutely extraordinary that, aside from criminal hearings, there is no automatic right to an interpreter in Irish Sign Language.  An interpreter may be provided in practice but the fact that there is no legal entitlement is absolutely extraordinary.  The lack of a register of interpreters is incredible, as is the lack of teachers in the language.  This is about much more than legal entitlements, although they comprise a very important part.  It is a matter of dignity and respect.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Language has different nuances in terms of humour, tone, attitude and culture.  No matter what language one speaks, it is an intrinsic part of our identity.  The Irish language is certainly an intrinsic part of who I am.  The same is likely to be the case for those who use Irish Sign Language in that it is a central part of their identity.  For the deaf community and all users of Irish Sign Language, recognising it will be a mark of respect, esteem and equality before the law and in society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000055#DDD00200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478802900,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the report on the recognition of Irish Sign Language and commend the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, in particular my colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.

I commend Senator Mark Daly for introducing the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016 which I welcome, with the report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, in recognition of and out of respect for the basic right to communicate of the more than 5,000 members of the Irish deaf community.  They are important steps we need to take as a country.  In 2015, while I was a member of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, I tabled a motion that received unanimous support and which called on the Government to give recognition to Irish Sign Language.  It is a privilege for me to stand in this House and welcome the report which seeks to make it a reality.  Irish Sign Language gives thousands of Irish people the invaluable gift of communication.  The deaf community feels isolated and cut off from access to information.  The Irish Deaf Society has been campaigning for more than 30 years to have Irish Sign Language officially recognised so as to ensure equality for deaf people in society who simply want to secure their right to full participation as citizens.<\/p>  <p>  It is essential that public bodies be required to provide the necessary interpretative services for deaf people.  I welcome the measures that seek to do this which are included in the report and the Bill.  Not even for one moment can I attempt to contemplate how frustrating it must be for a person who is deaf to have to engage with a public body.  Simple acts of daily life that we take for granted such as contacting a local authority or departmental office become increasingly frustrating for those who are deaf because there is no one on the other side of the counter who can interpret or communicate with them.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Deaf Society has stated the failure to recognise Irish Sign Language places at risk the health and well-being of deaf people, as they often struggle to avail of vital health and educational services.  Many public and private services taken for granted by others are inaccessible to deaf people.  Availability of services and information in Irish Sign Language as guaranteed by law is the only means of ensuring deaf people will have the opportunity to access and participate fully in society.  The Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016 seeks to ensure members of the deaf community will be able to participate fully as citizens of the country by legally guaranteeing their right to access information in what is their first and, for many, only language.

Those who defeated the Bill were not listening, despite having full hearing at the time.  They did not read any of the reports available.<\/p>  <p>  I also pay tribute to Dr. John Bosco Conama for his working paper on the recognition of Irish Sign Language, which he revised in 2012.<\/p><p>The unique linguistic and cultural identity of deaf people has already been recognised in 41 countries, including Northern Ireland, by the recognition of each country's individual sign language.  In this country, the Education Act refers to Irish Sign Language, but only as a tool in education and not as a right in itself.  I have learned, as a result of the work of organisations like DeafHear in Galway and others, that Irish Sign Language is a language of itself.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in pointed out, it is a language of movement, space, of the hands and the eyes.  Most significantly, however, Irish Sign Language is a language of abstract communication.  This is something that those of us with hearing forget.  It is not a watered down version of English or Irish.  Irish Sign Language is not a pictorial version of the world of spoken language.  It is not an artificial form of communication devised by hearing people nor, indeed, is it an incomplete or broken form of English of the hands.  It is a language of abstract communication.<\/p> <p> The deaf community comprises people who consider deafness to be a difference in human experience rather than a disability.  While the Minister of State has been very positive in some respects, I will come back to some of his weasel words in the midst of his introduction.  The deaf community is telling us that deafness is a different experience and not a disability and therein lies a clue.  We, the Government and society are disabling those with hearing impairment by not providing, as a human right and through legislation, services to which they are entitled so that they can communicate with each other and with us.  Indeed, for many deaf people Irish Sign Language is the only language they can acquire spontaneously and naturally without teaching.<\/p> <p> I believe that the Minister of State is very positive and wants to do something but I am concerned by the fact that he has listed out, in what should be a celebratory speech, obstacle after obstacle.

That is exactly what is necessary in legislation, that we would have built-in targets and built-in plans so that the Oireachtas would be forced to review, reflect and determine what has been achieved in a given period in terms of implementation.

The report from Dr. John Bosco Conama highlights 51 of these, many of which are things that hearing people would not even think about.  I will select a few at random.  Driving through a take away is not accessible.  School tours are not accessible.  In waiting rooms when a nurse or staff member is calling for the next client or patient, the deaf person must try to lip read.  The list goes on but I will not read them all out.  The challenge is for us to help the deaf community to overcome those 51 obstacles and more.  We must progress the legislation, give it the thumbs up and tease out the practical difficulties on Committee Stage.

Even by being here today and discussing the committee's report, we are raising consciousness of the issues.  Talking about people as customers is the wrong way to deal with this.  We are talking about citizens accessing public services as a right and for the 5,000 deaf people in Ireland, the lack of recognition of Irish Sign Language has had the effect of ingraining discrimination into everyday life and has exacerbated their isolation.  This was sadly highlighted recently with the death of the McCarthy brothers, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in correctly pointed out.  We know the statistics already.  Deaf people have a low employment expectation, with only 40% in employment, mostly in low-paid jobs.  Large numbers of our deaf community are excluded and we could spend a lot of time talking about the areas of exclusion.  The report highlights, for example, the need to have interpreters in judicial proceedings.  Earlier this year in a court in Donegal a judge decided to proceed with a case in the absence of an interpreter even though the defendant was deaf.  We would not tolerate a language interpreter not being provided for a person from another jurisdiction but such a barrier was allowed to prevail for a deaf person.  Such inequalities exist throughout the State in terms of other service provision.<\/p>  <p>  The report focuses on the fact that Irish Sign Language, which is formally recognised in Northern Ireland, should also be formally recognised in the South where there are actually more users.  The example of Finland has been given, which has a deaf community roughly the same size as ours.  That country formally recognised Finnish Sign Language in 1995.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to pick up on some of the points made by Deputy Catherine Connolly.  As far as I am concerned, the most important aspect of the report is the recognition of Irish Sign Language as a language and the need for us to educate ourselves as to what that means.  Clause 4 of the Bill moved by Senator Mark Daly last month in the Seanad goes to the heart of this issue.<\/p><p>We are talking about a language in its own right.  It is not a substitute, a tool for disability or a tool to access public services.  If we take that approach, we will downgrade the language and have a poorer outcome for users and future users.<br\/><br\/>Our starting point in the committee report is that ISL is a language in its own right and lack of access to language creates barriers.  It would be a very important step forward if we were to recognise that.  In the past, we have had some awful situations.  Many children were abused in the history of our State but sign language was actually denied and even discouraged in the case of deaf children.  We have heard stories of deaf children having their hands tied behind their backs to force them to stop signing - to force them into a verbal language.  This was crazy.  We spoke to Deputy Shortall on the way over.  She was a trained teacher who taught in schools for deaf children and was prevented from learning sign language because the State discouraged its use.  We must say that this caused lifelong communication problems for deaf people and their families. It was a horrible part of our history and one that we should learn from and not repeat.  Like any other language, the learning of sign language needs to be developed as early as possible.  We do not wait until our children are teenagers or adults before we expose them to language and deaf children should be treated the same as hearing children in that regard.  <br\/><br\/>We should point out that deafness can last a lifetime but it may not.  It may be something that people develop in the course of their lives.  Very young children below school age and older citizens can become deaf so it is not just about accessing ISL in school or work hours or accessing social welfare.  It is more about a system of accessing a language.  <br\/><br\/>As hearing people, we must shift our focus from thinking of deafness as a kind of medical phenomenon and attempt to understand that there is a culture and language that we have ignored and that this is what has caused the problem.  Senator Ruane made a very good and relevant contribution in the Seanad debate when she said:<\/p><blockquote>When people who are deaf gather together, for example in the deaf village in Cabra, there is no communication barrier and no discrimination.  It is only when they leave that setting that their language becomes a problem or a disability because we have not catered for their inclusion.  We make their language a disability.<\/blockquote><p>That sums it up for me very well.<br\/><br\/>A total of 80% of deaf adults have a low level of literacy in the English language and while we need to achieve higher rates of subtitling, etc., on television, we must understand that written English is not the first language of deaf people.  Subtitles are very good but we must do more.  The training and proper scrutiny of ISL interpreters and their broadened availability is critically important.  Other Deputies have spoken about the scenarios people are left in without language.  Earlier this year, the Department of Social Protection brought out a new card that could only be activated over the phone meaning that a deaf person had to give their private information, password details and so on to a hearing person so that the card could be activated.  It is a lack of thought and consciousness.  Deputies have made other points about visits to doctors and so on and said that having a third party involved in one's most intimate and private contacts with doctors is completely unacceptable.  <br\/><br\/>In respect of the services provided by our national broadcaster, the target of providing 2% of television shows with ISL interpretation is insultingly low and indicative of the lack of focus on this.  The cancellation of the &quot;Hands On&quot; television programme is something the deaf community feel badly about.  The use of interpreters on RTE is low.  It is late at night.  We need to make that more accessible.  I echo the point that we have a small deaf community in Ireland which is, in essence, living in a world where nobody else speaks its language.  Governments have not invested the amount of money necessary to rectify and change its quality of life.  We are going to be given that opportunity in the course of this D&aacute;il thanks to the fact that the Bill has gone through Second Stage in the Seanad.  I hope we will not be found wanting this time around.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000057#FFF00600","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478804100,"counter":392,"content":"<p>There are six Deputies offering to speak.

I am sorry I have not learned any sign language.  I was hoping to get Rhona to teach me to say a few things.  I thought of something this morning but I forgot.  I was going to get her to teach me how to say, \"Come on the Wexford Youths\".  Then I thought that if I could say that in sign language, after the results we had last weekend, they would probably say, \"God help the Wexford Youths\".  I welcome everyone in the Visitors Gallery and the sign language interpreters.  It is amazing what they are able to do.  I hope my Wexford accent is not too much of a problem.  I commend the work of Senator Mark Daly.  Listening to John Bosco Conama, Eddie Redmond and Leanne Quigley when they came before the committee was a real education.  I commend Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the Chairman of the committee, for his enthusiasm.  He seems to have been very enthused by it from the outset.<\/p>  <p>  According to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which Ireland signed in 2007, persons shall be entitled on an equal basis with others to recognition and support of their specific cultural and linguistic identity, including sign languages and deaf culture.  However, despite the fact that ISL is the first language of 5,000 deaf people and approximately 40,000 people who communicate with deaf people through ISL, it has no official status in Irish legislation.  In failing to recognise the indigenous language of a linguistic and cultural minority group, the State is actively facilitating the marginalisation of deaf people, particularly with regard to accessing public bodies such as the health service, the courts and the educational system.<\/p>  <p>  Recognition is particularly important in education where its acquisition as a first language for deaf children is essential.  The deaf community has suffered greatly by being ignored by the system.  According to the Irish Deaf Society, one in four deaf adults leave school with no qualifications and one in three has literacy problems.  According to the Irish Deaf Society survey entitled \"Signing In, Signing Out\", deaf people have higher than average unemployment rates and those who are in employment tend to be in low-paid positions earning below the average industrial wage.  <\/p>  <p>  Failure to recognise the rights of a minority is a recurring theme in this country.  Despite the State's promises to the UN Human Rights Committee in 2011, it has persistently refused to recognise Traveller ethnicity, a group that visited the justice committee this week and the previous week.  If we were to recognise their ethnicity, it would help members of the Traveller community towards full employment and full enjoyment of their human and constitutional rights.  At the moment, they are completely marginalised.  Listening to John Bosco Conama, I was taken aback.  It was amazing and not something I had thought so much about.  The manner in which deaf people have been marginalised and discriminated against all these years beggars belief.  Hopefully, this will change.<\/p><p>The last time a Bill on Irish Sign Language was introduced in 2013, the Government refused to allow it on the grounds that not enough services were in place for the legislation to be put into effect.  This obviously sounds bad.  Surely the introduction of legislation could give the impetus needed to change the structure of our public services to make them more accessible to deaf people.  Rather than keep on using the excuse that we cannot supply the services to make it happen, we should bring it in and then the pressure will be on to do what is right.<\/p> <p> The Flemish Sign Language was recognised in 2006 by the Flemish Parliament.  A sign of the progress that has been made is the presence of Helga Stevens, who is deaf, as a parliamentarian in the Flemish Parliament and more recently as a Member of the European Parliament.  Perhaps I should not wish it on them, but perhaps some of the visitors in the Gallery might be in here as Members in a few years' time.  It is not a job I would recommend.<\/p> <p> We should waste no more time in recognising Irish Sign Language, but we need to give some consideration to the practicalities of it.  The regulation of the teaching of Irish Sign Language by the proposed Irish Sign Language council must be done in such a way as to avoid disenfranchising existing Irish Sign Language teachers.  I was approached by a member of the public who is deaf and who is an Irish Sign Language teacher.  While he was very positive about any moves to recognise Irish Sign Language, he expressed concern over the proposed teacher registration requirements.  Currently the only registration course available is at the Centre for Deaf Studies and is a two to four-year full-time course which effectively rules out someone working elsewhere for the duration.  Requiring all Irish Sign Language teachers to register in this way could be overly onerous, both financially and in terms of time commitment.<\/p> <p> Currently there are two options for learning Irish Sign Language under Signature and Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, which many Irish Sign Language teachers use.  If these were not to be recognised under the new legislation, it could create problems for those who use them as their source of income.  Given the already lower employment rate among deaf people, any measures taken must not jeopardise existing jobs in this area.<\/p> <p> I hope the next time I have the opportunity to talk to some of the people in the Gallery I might be able to use my hands a bit better to communicate with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000058#GGG00300","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478804700,"counter":395,"content":"<p>It is a great honour to be able to speak in this historic debate.

I commend them on doing that and I give particular credit to Senator Mark Daly for the very important driving role he has played in all this.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot appreciate the difficult position in which members of the Irish deaf community find themselves unless we understand the importance of the right to communicate.  Everyone in this House understands the importance of being able to communicate.  We take it for granted.  Sometimes when we are abroad in countries where we do not speak the language, we realise how helpless we become when we cannot communicate and find it difficult to be able to state to another person what we seek or what we are trying to say.<\/p>  <p>  We need to recognise that this is a disability and a disadvantage that members of the Irish deaf community face continually as a result of the State's failure to ensure their right to communicate is properly vindicated.  Every person in this country has a constitutional right to communicate.  Members of the Irish deaf community have a right to communicate.  We have to ensure this right means something.  It is putting them in an impossible position unless the State makes strenuous efforts to ensure this right to communicate means something.  We can achieve something for them by seeking to emphasise that right.<\/p>  <p>  What is sought in the report produced by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's committee is very limited.  We want to ensure this State recognises Irish Sign Language.  Although we mention it, we are not even seeking a constitutional amendment for that right to be given express reference in the Constitution.  We simply recognise that it can be done through the passage of legislation.  The legislation is already there.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, here this evening.  I know he is committed to vindicating the rights of people with disabilities.  However, I am disappointed with his speech which, I know, he did not write.  As Deputy Connolly said, the speech simply sets out a series of obstacles to dealing with the issue before us today.  If I were the Minister of State, I would go back to the civil servants and ask them to provide some enabling advice.  I do not want a page and a half on how to improve the Bill.  What we need, and I welcome that the Minister of State has said it, is a commitment from the Government that this will be done.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will be well aware that political careers in general are very short.  The best that most of us can hope to achieve is that we may be lucky enough to be a Minister for two to three years.  Time passes very quickly.  I urge him to put this at the forefront of his ambitions.  He should go back to his Department and say that he is going to ensure Irish Sign Language legislation is brought through Leinster House during his time as Minister of State.  That can be done.<\/p>  <p>  I am very concerned that his speech stated this would go to pre-legislative scrutiny.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is a new term in these days of new politics.  I have a deep concern that pre-legislative scrutiny can mean putting something into a storage facility to be left there for a while.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who is committed to the rights of individuals with disabilities, needs to push this.  He should not worry about the fact that some changes can be introduced to this legislation.  Of course, there are changes that can be introduced.  Let us put it down to amendments on Committee Stage.  We have a very diligent and hard-working committee that is ready to take on the legislation and we are prepared to do the work in consultation with the Minister of State.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in stated, 5,000 deaf people use Irish Sign Language daily and an additional 35,000 hearing people use it.  We talk about the rights of children in general.  The right of a child to communicate is fundamental.  The right of a child who is not deaf to communicate with his or her deaf parents is also a fundamental right that child must enjoy.  We must ensure the precious right of communication which we all take for granted can be enjoyed by members of the deaf community.<\/p>  <p>  As has been mentioned, in court cases, members of the deaf community do not have access to interpreters.  They may have such access in criminal cases.  People go to civil courts to have their constitutional rights vindicated and it is unacceptable that there is no direct access to interpreters in civil cases.<\/p>  <p>  I am reminded of the essay James Joyce wrote in Italian in 1907 about the Maamtrasna murders.  He wrote about Myles Joyce, who in 1882 had been wrongly convicted of the murders in Maamtrasna.  What was so revealing about that criminal prosecution and trial was that Myles Joyce could not speak a word of English and yet his trial was conducted in English.<\/p><p>He did not know what was going on and he was subsequently hanged.  This gives an indication of the disadvantage and disability that members of the deaf community can be under if they are exposed to a State that does not make strenuous efforts to ensure their rights, and not simply their rights to communicate, are vindicated.<\/p> <p> I want to give other Members time to contribute and I will conclude by urging the Minister of State to drive forward with this issue, to go back to his departmental officials, tell them to give him enabling advice and not to find problems in a very well-intentioned Bill that has at heart the interests of the Irish deaf community.  If we work together on this, we can achieve something very useful for these citizens, some of whom are in the Gallery this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000059#HHH00400","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478805300,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan.

It would be a very progressive and important step in our own political history.<\/p>  <p>  I am very pleased to be able to speak on this important topic today, which I believe is an issue of basic dignity, human rights and equality.  The debate offers an opportunity to reflect and consider how this State treats those in the deaf community.  Unfortunately, a situation has been allowed to develop where some 5,000 people who are deaf in Ireland face a whole host of challenges and problems.  In Ireland, many people who are deaf feel marginalised and socially isolated because of the lack of recognition, understanding and compassion towards this issue.  The deaf community has been very proactive in trying to advance our understanding of the challenges facing people who are deaf and in highlighting the need for legislative action.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the various interest groups who have championed the rights of people who are deaf, including the Irish Deaf Society and Deaf Village Ireland.  I was very impressed, but also deeply disturbed, to hear some of the testimony of those involved in this area when they appeared before the Committee on Justice and Equality.  I was struck by the issues and problems faced by so many people, for example, around seeing a general practitioner or any other health care professional and the lengths to which people must go to get that basic interface and communication in a situation that is fundamental to any person's life.  As Deputy Clare Daly has said, if this measure were strengthened as legislation, we would be able to focus each core part of public policy towards improving the lives of and services for people who are deaf.  It would also send a positive message that we take this matter very seriously and that we want to deliver for the people in this community.<\/p>  <p>  A 1991 National Rehabilitation Board report found that 80% of adults who are deaf have a literacy equivalent of an eight or nine year old.  This means that trying to read books, letters, newspapers, the Internet and all the things that hearing people do without a second thought becomes very difficult for some people who are deaf.  Similarly, watching television, going to the cinema or listening to the radio is more difficult when English is not a person's first language.  It is important that we put interpreting to the fore on our television screens as this would build positive awareness that sign language is a different language, and not just for the graveyard slot in broadcasting schedules on our national television.  The small amount of interpreting by our national broadcaster is regrettable.  One person, who is deaf, described their experiences for the committee as extreme marginalisation.  This is simply unacceptable and cannot continue.  It requires swift action, supported by all in this House.  My colleague, Senator Mark Daly, has introduced a Bill on two occasions in the previous Oireachtas, which was rejected by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  It is unfortunate that no Member from either party has attended this debate at any stage this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000060#JJJ00500","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1478805300,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000060#JJJ00600","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1478805300,"counter":404,"content":"<p>It is regrettable but perhaps it also shows the lack of will on their part to take this matter seriously and to address the Bill positively.

All Opposition proposed legislation had some faults with regard to drafting and requires amendments, but this is a motion about delivering a message to the deaf community that we take this matter very seriously and want to address its needs.  The Minister of State's response should not be an outline of constraints of the Bill being put forward by Senator Mark Daly.<\/p>  <p>  I will allow my colleague, Deputy Mary Butler, to contribute and I will conclude.  Recently I was at the Cabra Cabaret in the Irish Deaf Village and I was taken aback by the skills of the Deaf Tones choir, which was absolutely excellent.  To see members of our deaf community celebrate our history on a wonderful night in the Irish Deaf Village and to see the work that is going on there was truly inspirational.  I hope that we in the Oireachtas can progress this matter positively and properly.  Senator Daly's Bill would result in the proper promotion, development and cultivation of sign language for the very first time in the history of the State.  This is an issue of human rights and equality and I call on sides of the House to participate and be involved in future debates and not to go home early on a Thursday.

I also compliment Senator Mark Daly on the work that has taken place in the Seanad to move this forward.  We hope that when this Bill is passed, it will make a positive and meaningful difference to the quality of life for Irish Sign Language users.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Bill, Irish Sign Language would be designated as a native and independent language to be used as the primary means of communication by more than 5,000 members of the deaf community.  We must realise and accept that Irish Sign Language is the language of the deaf community in Ireland.  It is a visual, spatial language with its own distinct grammar.  It is not only a language of the hands but also of the face and the body.  A high percentage of adults who are deaf have low English literacy skills due to English being their second language.  This creates barriers in a society that is so reliant on English.  Irish Sign Language is the first and preferred language of 5,000 people who are deaf in Ireland.  Some 40,000 people in general will communicate with Irish Sign Language daily.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of this legislation would be truly transformative for the deaf community.  It would enable Irish Sign Language to be used in legal proceedings and would require Irish television broadcasters to have subtitling on a greater proportion of broadcasts.<\/p><p>For interaction with social protection services, such as buying a TV licence or dealing with a local authority, the Irish deaf community has been denied equal rights and opportunities for years.  When the Bill is passed, it will also require the State to provide interpreting services for students who use Irish Sign Language and would require every public body to devise and implement an action plan to promote the use of sign language in the organisation.<\/p> <p> The legislation further proposes the creation of an Irish Sign Language council to promote the development of the language, regulate its teaching and co-ordinate interpreting services.  Numerous local authorities have passed motions to date calling for the recognition of Irish Sign Language and the implementation of supports to aid the deaf community.  It is important these calls are answered by the Oireachtas.  This is sensible, pragmatic yet highly transformative legislation.  I hope for cross-party support to bring it to the next Stage of the legislative process.  I also am very disappointed that my colleagues across the House are not here this evening.  Deaf people are not just represented by certain political parties.

I must admit a huge amount of ignorance on the subject prior to reading the Bill, not entire ignorance but a huge amount of ignorance.  Reading the Bill and sitting here make me think that we are all deaf in society, and what we are deaf to is the needs of the people with deafness.  Clearly we have been deaf since the foundation of the State to the needs of those who cannot hear.  Otherwise, we would not be sitting here in 2016 having been at a point in 2011 when a commitment to recognise Irish Sign Language and resource it was given in the programme for Government.  Five years later, we are now speaking about it.  All credit is due to the Deputies and Senators mentioned, including all of the members of the justice committee.<\/p><p>Sitting here reminds me of a comedy sketch show from years ago called &quot;Not the Nine O'Clock News&quot;.  It was very good at throwing a light back on ourselves for the obviously stupid, irresponsible and hypocritical things we do in society.  It had a sketch where a guy had invented a big light that went on and off so that deaf people would know the phone was ringing.  In the sketch, he tests his invention and a deaf person picks up the phone and cannot hear what is being said on the other end, but a fortune was spent on designing the light.  It is ironic and was intended to be funny, but it threw at light back on society on our own hypocrisy and inadequacies.  Being here today discussing this all these years later reminds me of this.<\/p><p>With regard to services for deaf people, I want to mention the very admirable points in the Bill on resourcing classes for parents, siblings, grandparents, other persons <i>in loco parentis<\/i>, a guardian of a child, and to provide hours and hours of academic provision in primary and second level schools and at third level.  There is no point in repeating everything.  Several months ago, I represented a family in Ballyfermot who are as poor as church mice.  They have several family members who suffer with different disabilities.  One sister resides in a school for deaf people in Derry because this State is not able to look after her needs.  The family visits her every week.  I wrote to the Minister and asked whether we could get training for one member of the family in Irish Sign Language so they can communicate with their sister.  I received a one liner back with No as the short answer.  The family cannot afford the training but needs the training, but the short answer back was No, along with a link to the Irish Deaf Society.<\/p><p>With all of these very admirable and important measures in the Bill, we must ensure they are resourced and not just aspirational, because quick as lightning when austerity hit us in the last recession Minister after Minister cut the funding for disability.  Those of us in opposition will remember being outside the Taoiseach's office, and sleeping overnight in some cases, with people with disabilities to help them retain their funding.  Quick as lightning this is an area that could be neglected in terms of resourcing and funding.  It is very important that people such as the Cummins family in Ballyfermot are not disregarded and dumped and that training for siblings, children, parents and grandparents or whoever is resourced by the State and poor people are not expected to pay for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000061#KKK00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1478805900,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I congratulate the justice committee for bringing this report to the D&aacute;il.  It has been a very important debate.  We have had this debate previously, but this time we have the legislation which Senator Mark Daly brought to the Seanad a number of months ago, which is very important and must be worked on.  I would like to hear the Minister of State when summing up state he will support recognition of Irish Sign Language and that it should be legislated for.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to repeat what has been said, but earlier I imagined someone suddenly being dropped into Russia, China or Japan without the language and with no access to the English language or anyone who could speak it, looking for a language school to try to learn the language but not being able to find one.  The person would be absolutely isolated.  This is where people who are deaf have been.  They have been in a dark area where they cannot break out.  They are not recognised by society.  This is a terrible indictment on us in the Chamber for not dealing with this much quicker.<\/p>  <p>  I know that 40 local authorities have recognised Irish Sign Language.  Service providers such as Government bodies are not legally obliged to respect Irish Sign Language.  They translate information into English and Irish but rarely into Irish Sign Language, although their websites have other language translations such as Chinese, Polish, Romanian and other languages.  We have a minority of people who use a language and who determine their lives by this language and we do not recognise it, facilitate it or put into legal means a way to access it.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to be able to speak this evening to support the community and welcome everybody here, including those in the Gallery and the interpreters.  It has been an eye-opener to watch the interpreters speak.  I hope the Minister of State brings this through the legislative process in a positive way and makes the community feel strong.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Connolly stated earlier, the three-year review is important.  It is up to the Minister of State to go back to the deaf community, and the deaf community to come back to the Minister of State, to ensure what is in place is working and see what can be done to progress any issues where the deaf community finds resistance in any area of the State or other areas where they cannot access information and live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000061#KKK00500","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1478806500,"counter":411,"content":"<p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>I thank speakers for their contributions to this important discussion.  I strongly disagree with a number of them, and I am a bit surprised to be saying so because everybody knows my position on this legislation.  I was at the launch and I have had discussions with both Senator Mark Daly and the Irish Deaf Society.  I thank colleagues for their excellent contributions and I agree with every single word that came from the Opposition benches.<\/p>  <p>  I am hearing very clearly, and we are all agreed on the fact, that there is a palpable need to improve and further social inclusiveness for people in the deaf community, and that there is an onus on Government to provide statutory recognition of the rights of ISL users.  That is why I support the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill.  The sponsors of the Bill have carried out a valuable public service by putting the need to cater for the rights of ISL users on our agenda in the Oireachtas and I am committed to working with Members to try to meet these needs in an effective and responsive way.  Let there be no doubt about my position on this Bill.  I want it implemented.  In answer to the negative criticism, I have concerns which I have outlined and I would not be doing the sponsors of the Bill any favours were I not to do so.  That is my job as Minister of State.  We need to be practical and to ensure the approach we have taken is realistic as well as fruitful.  I take my job very seriously, as I do the rights of all people with a physical or intellectual disability, and I would never use weasel words about them.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to continuing discussion on the Bill once it has moved along in a process in which I am sure that my concerns will be examined carefully.  I will also be bringing forward some amendments that aim to add balance and perspective to the proposed legislation.  I accept the need to push this along and I will need the support of Deputies at times.  I am glad that Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and the Oireachtas committee will support me.  In the meantime, the new national disability strategy will shortly be going to the steering group for sign-off and, as I said earlier, it contains a specific commitment that will cover much of the same ground as recognition of ISL, namely, the creation of a statutory right for a person to receive free ISL interpretation services when availing of statutory services.  I am trying to get it moved along before Christmas.<\/p>  <p>  In its report, the committee does refer to this proposed action, but it did not, to my knowledge, undertake any analysis as to how it might resolve some of the difficulties that ISL users face.  It is my firm belief that this specific action in the strategy, in conjunction with developing the capacity of the sign language interpreting service, which is also committed to in the strategy, is the best approach to meeting the needs of the deaf community and will make a real difference in the lives of ISL users.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, action and resources are the key words.<\/p>  <p>  It may be of interest to Members to know that the suggestion to provide free ISL interpretation when availing of public services originated in a public meeting in Cork during the consultation process.  In fact, issues in relation to the deaf community featured particularly strongly in the process as a whole, and the Department intends that the new strategy will respond credibly to the issues raised and that it will make a significant, meaningful and practical difference to the lives of deaf people.<\/p>  <p>  Let nobody be in any doubt tonight of my position on this Bill.  I totally support it and I am determined to implement it.  I will raise concerns but, equally, I will listen to the voices of people who have a genuine interest.  Once again, I thank the deaf community for attending tonight.  I also thank the interpreters and Opposition Deputies who have been very supportive of this legislation.  I have a plan for all people with disabilities and both a strategy and a clear vision on all these issues.  Part of my plan is to do my best to use the limited time I have to get as many things done as possible, one of which is this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000062#LLL00100","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1478806500,"counter":412,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and his committee have earned high praise tonight, which is well deserved.

His clarification and crystal clear statement have left nobody in any doubt as to his position and I welcome them.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to respond to his earlier contribution with a few points.  He spoke about 5,000 users of ISL but the figure is actually 40,000, with 5,000 members being hearing impaired, deaf or hearing challenged.  Their extended families and friends are an important and essential part in developing the same communication skills as the 35,000 hearing people for whom ISL is a part of their daily lives.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of the committee I welcome the signalled publication of the Bill, for which we have been waiting earnestly for some considerable time and which will allow for ratification, at long last, of the UN convention on the rights of people with disabilities.  We earnestly hoped it would be concluded this year and I am anxious that the deadline might not be met.  It would be a disappointment, not only to myself but the all the members of the Committee on Justice and Equality, if it were not met.  Everything should be done to progress it and we are ready to play our part.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State noted what was being done behind the scenes in the way of the provision of ISL interpretation when members of the deaf community avail of their statutory entitlements.  Other elements of the Minister of State's address, however, gave rise to concerns, and while he has gone a significant way to setting those aside, there are still concerns.  The Minister of State paid particular attention to the importance of the capacity to deliver and made this a priority rather than bringing forward the clear intent to recognise ISL, which would force the delivery of the essential outworking of the implementation measures.  It came across as a chicken and egg situation, in which we would never get to where we wanted to be.  There is a need for a pragmatic and feasible approach, backed up by statutory recognition of the rights of users of ISL, and the ideal situation would be to have these in tandem.  The critical line we must cross is the formal recognition of Irish sign language and whatever is not in place by that stage can then be worked on and delivered.  I have no doubt the members of the deaf community, having achieved formal recognition of ISL, will be patient for some little time at least.<\/p><p>We will then be able to see the outworking of the hope and promise of that formal recognition.<\/p> <p> I wish to make a few small points because from the list given by the Minister of State it seemed as if there were a litany of reasons we would not see the Bill progress.  I have analysed each of them.  The Minister of State commenced by stating that the central principle of the Bill is sound, which is important, and I welcome that comment.  He went on to state, however, that it seems perhaps to have a disproportionate approach to the provision of services for users of Irish Sign Language.  My question in response to that is what would he expect and why would we not take that approach?  If he were dependent on Irish Sign Language, I would expect that he would have a disproportionate approach to the provision of services.  Why should the users not expect, hope and aspire to the very best and the most that can be achieved?<\/p> <p> On the Minister of State's comment that the preamble, in terms of the structure, does not seem necessary, that is a technical matter in my opinion.  In regard to the position on imposing an obligation on public bodies to develop the three-yearly action plans, I, and colleagues who have spoken, could very well argue the contrary.  That is something we can address on Committee Stage.  The proposal for the establishment of a new public body by the Citizens Information Board can be discussed.  On section 18, which provides for offering annual accounts of the new body for sale, that is not something that I expect is critical.  In regard to section 19 which provides for borrowing by the public body, this can be reconsidered.  Section 29 which provides for 12 months' imprisonment for either offering interpretation services or teaching ISL - I emphasise the next four words - \"on a commercial basis\" is critically important.  We must have registration and standards.  Unregistered people charging for services for which they are not registered or even, more importantly, not qualified in must be discouraged by some level of penalty.  As to whether what is in the Bill, as constructed, is necessarily the way to go, that is open to us to discuss.  <\/p> <p> On Part 4, let us discuss it in regard to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  These points are not impediments or obstacles to the successful passage of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000062#LLL00300","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478807100,"counter":415,"content":"<p>We can do business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000063#MMM00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1478807100,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I again pay tribute to Senator Mark Daly and those who have worked on the drafting of this legislation.  I have no doubt many in the Visitors Gallery have worked closely with others in the preparation and drafting of the proposals before us.<\/p>  <p>  We are 12 years on from the recognition of Irish Sign Language in the Six Counties and I take comfort from the fact that I believe the Minister of State would be of exactly same view as myself on this issue.  It is to our shame that 12 years on we have yet to officially recognise one of our two indigenous languages on this island, while north of the Border this has been done.  With all of the requirements entailed in the Good Friday Agreement, this failure to reach a point of equality of recognition of the needs and rights of sections of our society is an indictment of our political system and on successive Governments.<\/p>  <p>  This is a motion on a report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and all expressions of appreciation are due to all the members of that committee.  We are a cohesive and hard-working body of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are industrious and intend to continue to so be.  It is important to reflect on the Irish Deaf Society's key and critical points.  I want to pay tribute to Eddie Redmond and all the team at the Irish Deaf Society.  In its small publication, ten main reasons Irish Sign Language must be recognised by the State as a language of this country, it cites the number of people who use ISL on a daily basis.  For these regular ISL users, it is an innate and an integral part of their personalities.  ISL is the only natural and fully accessible language for deaf children.  There is no national registry of ISL interpreters and ISL teachers and, furthermore, there are no accreditation or monitoring systems.  ISL has been in use for centuries, as we have already reported.  Service providers, such as Government bodies, are not legally obliged as matters stand to respect Irish Sign Language.<\/p>  <p>  The motion calling on the Government to recognise ISL has been passed by more than 40 local authorities across this jurisdiction, which is an important point that has not yet been made.  There is no automatic right for deaf people to have an ISL interpreter in the justice system.  No deaf child can fully learn Irish Sign Language as not all allocated teachers are fluent or even qualified in the ISL.  There is no access for deaf people to emergency or help line services in ISL, something that is hugely important.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Members who spoke, attended and our special visitors, the members of the deaf community and friends in the Visitors Gallery.  I thank especially the interpreters who have been wonderful on this very exceptional and special occasion.  I wish every success to our purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000063#MMM00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478807100,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478807100,"counter":418,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 8.20 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 November 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
