As the Vice Chairman said, I am going to talk about RAS and HAP.  I will also talk briefly about rent supplement.<\/p> <p>  To begin with a short overview and reminder of the schemes, rent supplement is the historic cash support available for those in need of assistance with accommodation costs and who are not currently in local authority housing.  This payment was originally intended as a short-term support for existing tenants in the private rental sector.  Under the scheme, the local authority provides part of the payment in respect of the rental cost - most of it, in fact - and the tenant also contributes a payment.  One of the issues with rent supplement was that people working 30 hours or more each week were ineligible.  Therefore, it was deemed a financial disincentive to the taking up of full-time employment.  An important point is that people who availed of rent supplement could remain on the social housing waiting list.  Those tenants were in the private rental sector and could get supports, but they could also remain on the waiting list to get local authority housing or approved housing body, AHB, accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Rent supplement has gradually been replaced by the RAS programme.<\/p><p>It was intended for long-term recipients of rent supplement - those who had been in receipt of rent supplement for about 18 months or more.  Under this scheme, the local authority sources and contracts the landlord for accommodation.  Importantly, particularly when we contrast this with HAP, the local authority is responsible for alternative accommodation if the landlord exits.  The local authority makes payment to the landlord and the tenant pays the local authority.  The tenant payment through the local authority is based on the tenant's income and ability to pay.  The tenant pays the local authority and the local authority pays the tenant contribution to the landlord but the local authority will typically pay most of it as well so the local authority takes up most of the slack.  Rental limits apply to this as they do to rent supplement and HAP, which means that each local authority will have a limit as to how much it is willing to pay to private landlords.  With RAS, the resident is removed from the social housing waiting list so his or her social housing need is deemed to be fulfilled.  Importantly, unlike rent supplement, tenants are entitled to continue to work full time or take up full-time work.  <\/p><p> RAS and rent supplement are due to be replaced by HAP, which is already replacing rent supplement.  It is envisaged that HAP will also replace RAS.  HAP is very similar to RAS.  One crucial difference is that the tenant sources accommodation in the private rental sector.  It is the tenant's responsibility to find accommodation.  The contract is between the tenant and the landlord.  The contract is not between the local authority and the landlord.  It is similar to RAS in that the local authority makes payment to the landlord and the tenant makes his or her contribution to the local authority.  The tenant is removed from the social housing waiting list, as with RAS.  HAP and RAS are similar in that rent limits apply in each local authority.  If the rent exceeds the rent limits, the tenant typically pays the difference to the landlord.  Some discretion is allowed in terms of exceeding those rent limits.  In what are called exceptional circumstances, local authorities can pay 20% more - 50% in the Dublin area - than the rent limit if the household is homeless.  The tenant is allowed to work full time.  The difference between HAP and RAS is that with HAP, the tenant sources the accommodation and has a contract with the private landlord whereas with RAS, it is the local authority that contracts with the landlord.  <\/p><p> Here is some information on spending.  This is what is called social housing output from 2005 to 2019.  The social housing current expenditure programme, SHCEP, is the leasing scheme.

We see that HAP is the main component of this at 36.4%.  Homeless accommodation is 15.7%, SHCEP is 13.2% and RAS is 12.8%.  We see the figure for rent supplement along with a variety of other schemes.  HAP is the most important part of current expenditure on social housing and is set to become more important in the coming years as rent supplement and RAS are gradually phased out.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how we might assess HAP, I will present what one might call positives.  Spending has broadly been in line with Rebuilding Ireland projections.  There is often criticism of HAP for increased budget outlays.  As I will discuss shortly, it is not a very efficient way of providing social housing but nevertheless spending has been in line with the Rebuilding Ireland projections.  It has been effective in providing income support for those in the private rental sector, many of whom would become homeless without HAP.  The advantage of HAP is that it is comparatively easy to set up.  It takes time to scale up local authority or AHB building of social housing whereas HAP is very easy to scale up.<\/p><p>Research by the ESRI has shown that HAP creates a financial incentive to do paid work.  One of the criticisms of rent supplement was that it created barriers to work.  Whatever one's views are, one of the goals of HAP was to remove some of those barriers.  On that ground, HAP has been successful, whether one agrees with that policy or not.<\/p><p> There are problems with HAP.

One of the difficulties is that with most accommodation in the rental markets, the cost of that accommodation exceeds the rental limits or the amount of rent that the local authority is willing to pay.  This has fluctuated from year to year.  In 2020, according to the Simon Community only 5% of rental accommodation as advertised on <i>daft.ie<\/i>was within the rent limits of HAP.  That is it was within the limit that the local authority was willing to pay, and that is 2020.  This improved dramatically in the latest round as rents in Dublin, particularly, fell and I presume that is what was causing it.  So, 38% of rental accommodation that was advertised fell within the rent limits of HAP.  One could still be critical of that and say that almost two thirds of the accommodation that is out there is outside the rent limits of HAP.<br\/><br\/>Another problem is that the rent limits have not been revised since 2017.  So the legislation is 2017 but the actual rent limit is, I think, from the second quarter of 2016.  What happens is that the tenants pay their share to the local authority and the local authority pays most of it to the private landlord.  Sorry, the local authority pays most of the rent and it pays that to the private landlord and also the tenant pays a contribution to the local authority.  What actually happens as well is that there are these tenant top-ups whereby the tenant actually pays an extra amount to the private landlord because his or her contributions are insufficient to cover the rent.  That is also a problem.  That is a figure from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Threshold, based on a survey, said that it might actually be higher and be closer to half of tenants now paying top-ups to private landlords.<br\/><br\/>Unsurprisingly, it is very difficult for HAP tenants to actually source accommodation.  We have, obviously, a big supply shortage in housing and also the rental sector.  So it is really a landlords' market and they do not really want to go to the hassle and risk of taking on a HAP tenant.  HAP tenants are competing with other tenants who have more means to pay higher rents.  If it is a choice between a regular tenant and a HAP tenant, the landlord is only going to choose one person and that is the non-HAP tenant.<br\/><br\/>There is a lack of stability as well.  The tenancy can be terminated for a variety of reasons and then it is up to the tenant to find somewhere else.  That is in contrast because if one is in social housing there is much greater stability.  Even with RAS there is greater stability because it is the local authority which has responsibility for finding accommodation for the tenant.  As I am sure we will discuss, it is more expensive.  Whether one uses HAP, RAS or rent supplement, it is a lot more expensive to the State over the long term, especially to pay the rent of these tenants rather than to build social housing.  As I mentioned, the advantage of HAP and similar schemes is that it is able to facilitate their needs in a quick manner.  It takes time to build up one's housing stock but, as is widely recognised, it is expensive.<br\/><br\/>My last point is that the slide looks at trends in public housing expenditure and the mix between capital expenditure and current expenditure.  What we saw in the depths of the financial crisis, in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and a year here and there, was that there was not a massive increase in current spending but a massive increase in the share of public housing expenditure that was accounted for by current expenditure.  In 2013, for instance, current expenditure was over double capital expenditure.  That has improved in recent years.  In 2019, current expenditure accounted for, I guess, about 40% of total housing expenditure so capital expenditure was actually greater, basically.  That is different from what we had in 2005 and 2006 where current expenditure was less than half of capital expenditure.  Obviously it is much more efficient, from a public finance perspective, if one invests in social housing, which is what capital expenditure is, rather than pay all of these transfers which, essentially, go into the pockets of private landlords.<br\/><br\/>So there are good things and bad things.  What I would like to see, and I think what most people want to see, is for the share of public housing expenditure, accounted for by capital expenditure, to continue to rise in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Robert Sweeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1621499400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Sweeney for his very helpful presentation, which will stimulate discussion.

There was a general reduction in public expenditure during the years of austerity.<\/p> <p>  I imagine one of the reasons there was a large dip in the capital expenditure in particular was that we had extensive overbuilding of housing in the 2000s.  In 2020, for example, we built about 20,000 houses and in 2019 the figure was approximately 21,000 houses.  However, in 2006 we built 90,000 houses.  Those are the total numbers of houses built, by the way, including public and private construction.  During the housing bubble years, therefore, we had massive overbuilding of housing.

Reliance on these schemes is not an efficient use of public funds and it would be better to build new units, as analysis by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has shown.  That was also shown by an analysis by the architect, Mel Reynolds.  In 2017, he compared how much it costs to build social housing directly with relying on HAP.

Dr. Sweeney earlier mentioned that more than 50,000 people avail of the scheme and that is evidence of its blooming.<\/p> <p>  I was surprised no reference was made in Dr. Sweeney's presentation to the thresholds that are applied to applicants for social housing under the housing assistance regulation.  There is a maximum threshold in Mayo and I am sure that threshold is much higher in the Dublin region.  I think the threshold for couples is &euro;26,000.  That means a whole cohort of people who are earning &euro;30,000 do not qualify for social housing and cannot get access to a mortgage.  In other words, these applicants are too wealthy to avail of housing assistance and too poor to get a mortgage from their banks.

As I said, the thresholds have not been changed since the most recent round that was introduced in 2017, based on the second quarter of 2016.  Rents have obviously increased a lot since then.  I referenced the fact that many households are now topping up their HAP to private landlords.  For instance, Threshold did a survey in conjunction with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in 2019 and found that 48% of HAP tenants are paying top-ups to their landlords.  Under the HAP scheme, local authorities allow tenants to pay top-ups to their private landlords but, in general, that is not supposed to be in excess of 30% of their net income, so their total housing expense should not be more than 30% of their net income.  The Threshold survey found 20% of people who are paying top-ups were paying more than 30% of their income.  There appears to be an issue there in terms of the thresholds not keeping pace with rising rent expenses.<\/p> <p>  Figures from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform showed only 28% of tenants are paying top-ups.  Let us say that between 28% and 48% of tenants are paying top-ups.  I agree with Deputy that there are affordability issues for people on the HAP scheme despite the fact there has been an increase in funding for HAP in recent years.

Dr. Sweeney spoke about the number of current HAP tenancies.  I have departmental figures relating to May 2020.  The total HAP tenancies in May 2020 was 59,821.  That is quite significant.  I presume it has increased since then.  The figures were broken down by individual local authority area.  For Dr. Sweeney's own knowledge, the figure had increased to almost 60,000 tenants.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the number of additional households that are supported by HAP each year and the associated cost, there seems to be a decreasing yield on moneys spent.  There was an increase in the spend of &euro;42 million in 2016 for, I believe, 12,000 new places.  It amounted to an average cost of around &euro;3,482 per person, per year.  The additional &euro;78 million that is provided for this year will work out at around &euro;5,200 per person for 15,000 people.  That amounts to a doubling in the subsidy, when nationally we have seen rent increase by over 25% since 2017 alone.  In my own constituency in Louth, for example, in quarter 1 of 2017 the average rent for a three-bedroom house was &euro;977 per month, with the cost over the same period this year being around &euro;1,230.  That is an increase of nearly 26%.

Ultimately, the increase in rental prices has been driven by an underlying lack of supply in the market.  Obviously, by availing of HAP, the amount of money that low-income households are able to spend increases, so there might be some small factor there in terms of driving up prices.  Essentially, the Government is creating a demand for rental accommodation that low-income households would not be able to create on their own.  However, the underlying factor is there are not enough houses being built.  It could be argued there is an opportunity cost in respect of the amount of money the Government is spending on supports.  If that money was spent on building houses, it would alleviate some of the rental price pressures.  Of course, we need the temporary measures such as HAP until we scale up the building of public housing.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the reduced yields, rents have risen significantly in recent years, but the proportion of rent the HAP tenant pays to the local authority is based on his or her ability to pay.  For instance, in 2016, the tenant paid about 28% of the total payment.  That figure fell slightly in 2019 to around 26%.  There has been some attempt to maintain the fact the tenant payment is based on his or her income and the local authority is taking up most of the slack in respect of the rising rents.  Still, the tenants are paying more over time, but the local authorities do appear to be taking up most of that slack.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052000002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Robert Sweeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1621499400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>The HAP contract concluded between the local authority and the tenant sets out the HAP payment per month for the accommodation or the property and the HAP contribution for the tenant.

The average age of a first-time buyer has increased over time.  I believe it is currently 34, compared with 29 in the 2000s.  There is an increasing number of people in their 40s and 50s who are renting, perhaps, because they could never afford to purchase a property or because of a relationship breakdown and so on.  This will be a problem in the years to come if we do not begin to address our housing problems today.  <\/p> <p>  Renting is not necessarily bad, if we have a functional rental system.  Currently, rents in the Dublin area in particular are not affordable or stable and tenants are open to eviction where a landlord proposes to sell a property or to move some of his or her family into it.

The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has been advocating for a cost rental model for a number of years.  In terms of roll-out, the local authority or approved housing body would build the house and the tenant would pay rent which is sufficient to cover the cost.  In the case of approved housing bodies in particular, some would have to borrow to build the housing and the rent would have to be sufficient to cover that cost.  To be honest, I have not done a huge amount of work on the cost rental model, but it seems a way to proceed going forward.  The system we have now for social housing is very much oriented towards low-income households.  I would like to see a situation where it is not just the poorest of the poor who can avail of public housing.  A cost rental model would be a way of doing that.  The rent paid would be based on a person's income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052000002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Robert Sweeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1621499400,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I agree with Dr. Sweeney's final remarks, particularly in regard to those people for whom affordability is an ongoing challenge and for those who are in professions and on a fixed income.  For example, a primary school teacher will stay within a particular pay bracket and need certainty around housing, in particular duration of tenancy.  This is a big part of the affordable housing Bill that is currently on the table and a large part of the Land Development Agency model.  In my own area in Shankill, planning permission granted for 600 homes provides that a chunk of those houses will be used for the cost rental model.  In terms of where the opportunity lies, I would be interested in taking up with Dr. Sweeney another time if it is around providing certainty to people in regard to rent, which is the cost of build plus the cost of management, but not profit.  That differential enables the State to build more and to retain the asset in perpetuity and thus there will available stock over time.  The other advantage is the ability to provide long leases, be that five or ten year leases, which will provide certainty to people that they will not be subject to eviction or rent increases and also access to homes for those over the social housing threshold, people on fixed incomes and at pension stage, who have made changes to their lives.  I appreciate this is not a matter which Dr. Sweeney expected to be raised today, but I just wanted to get his perspective on it.

It is more that there is insufficient supply relative to demand that is causing the distortion and the ability of landlords to demand top-ups.

If a landlord was not able to get as good a tenant from his or her perspective in terms of the amount of rent paid, then he or she would not demand a top-up.

The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.

The first such report was published in 2017, with the Public Service Performance Report 2020, being the fifth edition of the report.<\/p> <p>  As recommended in the committee&rsquo;s Interim Report on the framework for parliamentary engagement throughout the course of the budgetary cycle late last year, it was signalled that financial performance should be assessed through the principles of performance budgeting, focusing on what is being delivered with resources and how this aligns with the programme for Government and departmental statements of strategy.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of the performance report is to increase transparency and accountability and to ensure that the committee, as parliamentarians, and that citizens can see clearly how the public funds are being used and what they are accomplishing.  The information is deliberately presented in as clear and accessible a way as we can to ensure that people generally, not just those with financial expertise, can better understand how public money is being used.<\/p> <p>  The report builds on the existing elements of the performance-based budgeting initiative and creates a space within the budget process and cycle for performance-based dialogue.  While performance information is provided alongside financial information in the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, in December, of each year, outturn information for the current year cannot be provided because of the timing of the REV publication.  This means that committees may not have the relevant or most up-to-date information to allow them to assess performance for the most recent year in a timely fashion.<\/p> <p>  The performance report tries to address this lacuna by providing timely quantitative and qualitative information on what was delivered with public funds in the previous year so that there is an opportunity for meaningful dialogue between Ministers, Departments and the relevant sectoral committees on Government performance.  The information provided will hopefully assist the relevant sectoral committees in tracking progress from year to year as to the outputs and outcomes of key governmental strategies.<\/p> <p>  I note that the committee's Final Report on the Framework for Parliamentary Engagement Throughout the Course of the Budgetary Cycle puts forward the proposal that sectoral committees should meet to consider the chapters of this performance report that are relevant to their areas of oversight.  The performance report is designed to support such an enhanced focus on performance and delivery by committees.  The relevant performance indicators are presented in this dedicated, focused document in as accessible a manner as we can make it.  This approach seeks to enable the sectoral committees to make best use of the time available for reviewing performance and achievement by Departments and agencies.<\/p> <p>  This performance report is just one part of a broader suite of measures across the system to increase evidence-based decision-making, such as the spending review process, and the analytical papers that are produced regularly in that context, including by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, network and the public spending code, which also set certain standards there.<\/p> <p>  Towards the back of the document the report includes an update on initiatives such as equality budgeting and green budgeting which are both integrated into this performance budgeting framework.<\/p> <p>  The equality budgeting pilot was introduced in 2018, and brings a new focus to performance budgeting, looking at various equality dimensions such as gender, socio-economic inequality, disability and minority groups.  To date, 12 Departments have participated in equality budgeting and it has increased steadily year-on-year.<\/p><p>Following a Government decision earlier this year, we are stepping that up and an interdepartmental group is being established to drive this important work across all areas of Government.  This work is overseen and contributed to by an equality budgeting expert advisory group, which comprises key stakeholders and relevant experts, including independent voices.  The last time I spoke to this committee, I drew attention to the OECD report on equality budgeting and we are moving forward with implementation of the various recommendations in that report.<\/p><p> Also related to the OECD, in 2019 Ireland joined the OECD Paris Collaborative on Green Budgeting and committed in that context to the progressive implementation of a range of reforms to the budgetary process with a view to better embedding climate and environmental goals within the budget process.  With the ambitious climate targets in the programme for Government and their incorporation into legislation via the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2021, the requirement for the budget process to support this grows more pressing.  As I said, an update on this work is also included in the performance report.<\/p><p> As regards next steps, an ambitious work plan for performance budgeting policy is in place for the year ahead, which aims to continue and build on the momentum achieved to date and further advance this work.  Last year, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform successfully applied for funding to develop our performance budgeting framework and systems under the EU structural reform support programme, SRSP.  The project incorporates the various elements and dimensions of performance budgeting, such as equality and climate-related budgeting and other aspects, including the Sustainable Development Goals and the well-being framework, all of which is in line with the programme for Government commitment to develop and utilise a national well-being framework.  That EU-funded project is now near its mid-point and we are focusing on key priorities, such as improving and upgrading the IT framework for performance budgeting and increased the tagging or labelling of expenditure so we can more easily prepare and generate reports in order to highlight progress.  In this context, we have undertaken a number of peer-to-peer study missions with counterparts in other countries to allow us to learn from best international practice.  We keep our performance budgeting framework under constant and regular review to ensure it best serves the purpose of increasing transparency and accountability.  Feedback from stakeholders is an essential part of this and, in particular, we value feedback from this committee as a cornerstone of that ongoing process.<\/p><p> In conclusion, it is clear from the committee&rsquo;s final report that the performance report is a source of information that can be further utilised by the various sectoral committees in their engagement with Ministers and their Departments.  This engagement in principle allows the various committees to consider, with the relevant line Departments, any issues regarding performance against target and what is actually being achieved, and perhaps issues with the specific indicators selected for inclusion in the report and how they can be refined and upgraded.  We found that the recommendations contained in the committee&rsquo;s report were quite thoughtful in this regard and we are putting together some material with a view to submitting a formal reply to the recommendations in that regard.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for including this performance report on its agenda and I look forward to hearing feedback and the views of members.  This engagement with the committee in regard to the overall format of the report, and its positioning and role within the budgetary cycle, is very important to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as we continue our work in enhancing the overall performance budgeting framework and the performance report in particular.  I know the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is committed to advancing this agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronnie Downes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Thank you.

As I have to go to the convention centre to chair a session at 10:30 a.m., I will do what politicians often do, which is to speak and run.  No disrespect is intended.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Downes for his presentation and thank the witnesses for attending.  On equality budgeting, the assistant secretary general will know that was an initiative of the last Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I and Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett were members.  It is excellent to see it embraced.  It resulted from a lot of consultation and the Scottish Parliament was particularly helpful to us on that.  For the benefit of newer members, although they may know anyway, until that point there was always a danger that budgetary measures could have a disproportionate impact on different members of society.  The social protection cuts in 2011 were a classic example in that they disproportionately hit women more than men.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight had people from a range of equality backgrounds present to us and equality budgeting was originally an initiative and recommendation from this committee.  The Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, embraced it in the first year it was introduced, and it has been embraced since.  It would be nice at some stage to have a report on its impact, where it has worked and what difference it has made.<\/p> <p>  I want to make a general point in regard to public service performance, as a public representative interfacing on behalf of the public with the public sector.  My experience is that there have been heroic performances by Departments, and maybe that is because some are more visible.  The Department of Social Protection has performed miracles in the last year in keeping society afloat, particularly those who have become dependent on it, including those who might not have been used to being dependent on it.  I have also found the HSE incredibly responsive.  However, there have been Departments where there is remote working, which I think is going to be an indicator in the future, and the witnesses might have a comment to make on how we measure the performance of remote working as it becomes a significant part of the work of some Departments.  What I liked about the Department of Social Protection and the HSE, just to use those two examples, is that the officials who were available to us pre-Covid remained available to us.  Officials in other Departments, which I will not name, cannot be reached and have been unreachable directly for a year without going through a Minister's office.  That is part of public service performance.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of further points on remote working as an indicator.  Has the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform looked at its impact in different Departments?  What are the plans?  What impact has the provision of remote working had on public expenditure?  I also ask Mr. Downes to follow up on the equality budgeting piece.  Is there an opportunity to integrate the metrics regarding the implementation of the public sector duty into the public service pension reduction, PSPR?  On green budgeting, which has also become a staple of the way we move forward, does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provide reasoning for its own choice of indicators or are there any other choices of performance indicators?  Can Mr. Downes explain why it chooses the indicators it does and what is the basis for that?  Is any further examination undertaken by the Department as to the correlation between outcomes and impacts?  How does the Department measure those?  Those are my questions.  I thank the witnesses again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052000002#B00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621465200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p><p>First, let me acknowledge the point he made about heroics.  Certainly, this has been a tough year for everyone and for those in the health service and in various parts of our public service who deliver and continue to deliver public services to a high standard during those tough times.  I thank him for that acknowledgement.<\/p><p> With regard to remote working, that has been a relatively new experience for most civil and public servants over the past year.  We have gone from a position of 98% or 99% of civil servants working in the traditional office to it being completely reversed with 97% or 98% of civil servants working remotely.  Of course, that is not the case in the health service where certain front-line workers have had to keep working.<\/p><p> Regarding the Civil Service experience, there is much working ongoing with surveys, getting feedback and a sense of the impact remote working has had on public service performance.  There is probably more work to do to collate and interpret that information, but the initial signs we are seeing are that people have adapted very well to the remote working environment.  Departments continue to deliver on their core missions.<\/p><p> Looking forward, the Deputy asked whether we would develop an indicator for that.  Certainly, there are some operational indicators which would be relatively routine to build in into the future regarding the number of staff who work either on site or remotely or in a blended working environment, which some people think we are evolving into.  Ultimately, the purpose of this performance report, subject to the committee&rsquo;s views, is and should remain not so much on the operational issues but on what is being delivered in terms of public services, outcomes and impacts.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked how we select outcomes and impacts.  In the first instance, the people who know and the organisations that know their business best are in the Departments and are the Departments themselves.  It is a matter for Departments in the first instance to come up with output and impact indicators.  Members will see throughout the report that, for each organisation, we have broken down the indicators very simply into outputs and impacts.  Outputs are things that are delivered on year to year.<\/p><p> Looking at page 12 of the report, which refers to income supports for children, for example, there are the number of monthly child benefit payments, and &euro;1.2 million is delivered by the Department of Social Protection.  There are also listed several impact indicators, such as the percentage of children at risk of poverty.  We can see that percentage has declined, that is to say the situation has improved to some degree, certainly since 2017, and there are the percentage of children in consistent poverty and deprivation rates.  Looking at supplementary payments, there are impact indicators there such as the percentage of people without heating at some stage during the past year, which is something people can understand what that means, and the percentage of people who are unable to keep their homes adequately warm.  Rather than just providing the number of household benefit payments, which is 440-odd thousand, which the Department is delivering, it is about what it is actually doing in terms of the impact on people&rsquo;s lives.<\/p><p> There is also the method of how we select the indicators.  There are opportunities as we implement, embed and evolve our processes for performance supporting and accountability, including the role of this and various sectoral committees, for members as parliamentarians and in committees to ask questions, challenge or make suggestions to counterparts and colleagues in Departments as to whether there are other indicators members would like to see to give a better flavour or a more rounded account of what is being accomplished in different areas and what are the things that matter most.  Perhaps I will leave it there for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052000002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronnie Downes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Downes for his presentation and for coming before the committee.  I am a new member of this committee, unlike the previous Deputy who was speaking about the developments within equality budgeting.  I have a question on that.  I can see from Mr. Downes's presentation and the report that it is something which is being focused on.  On some of the shortcomings highlighted by the OECD in its recent report, it stated that when it comes to equality budgeting that:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... there is no overarching strategy or set of goals in Ireland.  This makes it difficult to judge the extent to which equality goals currently being set by departments are in line with real needs or are sufficiently ambitious. <\/blockquote> <p>It further noted that:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... equality budgeting is not obligatory; departments have limited incentive or capacity to participate, and they are unclear of the ultimate goal of the initiative. <\/blockquote> <p>That all sounds very negative and I had started off today thinking I would be very positive.  I do not mean this to be negative, I am just reading out what the report stated.<\/p><p>We know a huge amount of money is spent annually on public procurement.  Can this spending be challenged in such a way as to achieve social and environmental objectives through the inclusion of social clauses in contracts?  Does Mr. Downes see a greater role for progressive public procurement in equality budgeting?  Does he envisage it being reported on in future public service performance reports?  Going back to my starting point, it is positive to see this and I would like to hear Mr. Downes&rsquo;s reaction to my comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052000002#C00400","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621465200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Farrell for those comments.  Regarding equality budgeting in general, it was introduced in 2017-2018 on a pilot basis.  We invited the OECD to come and take a critical look at what the experience of the project was in its initial stages and to help us set a direction for the future to make sure it would have an impact.  We were hoping, and were quite happy, that the OECD report would give us the critical feedback we wanted to help us stay on track.  The point it made about the lack of an overarching framework within which equality goals can be articulated is one we can acknowledge.<\/p> <p>  One of the ways that is being addressed and progressed is in the context of the work already under way to develop a national well-being framework.  The national well-being framework is at a reasonably advanced stage.  It is being spearheaded by our colleagues in the Department of the Taoiseach, with us in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, and the Department of Finance sharing leadership of that agenda, but it is taking place on a whole-of-government, cross-departmental basis.  Part of the objective of that exercise, as signalled in the programme for Government, is to develop a set of indicators which can serve multiple purposes.  One of those purposes, for example, is to develop an alternative set of economic and social indicators to see whether Ireland is making progress in improving the lives of our citizens, including alternatives to GNP and so on.  It can also play a more systematic role in providing the overarching framework of recognisable well-being goals and objectives.  Each of those goals and objectives, from our point of view and part of the role DPER plays in this, is to make sure the well-being framework can serve that purpose as an overarching framework for performance budgeting, but also to integrate those equality dimensions within each of those well-being indicators so that it will also serve those purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052000002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronnie Downes"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Downes.  That is very informative.  I am just conscious that my time is running away from me so I will ask my other few questions together and then give Mr. Downes an opportunity to respond.<\/p> <p>  Regarding housing, the whole point of this performance report is that it increases transparency and accountability and ensures that every citizen can see clearly how public funds are being used.  On that basis and on those principles, the principles of the report, the housing section reports the \"total number of units delivered through Social Housing build and acquisition programmes\".  This is not by any means unique to this report; the lumping together of social housing builds with housing acquisitions into a single metric is something we see time and time again.  However, building and acquisition are two very different things.  In future could we see these two presented separately so we can see what is actually being built rather than what is being acquired?  In the interests of transparency and for citizens to see how public funds are used, that would be really important.  I know this report has been reformed in recent years, so I hope that perhaps in the next report these two things, social housing builds and social housing acquisitions, will be accounted for separately.  I would like Mr. Downes's views on that.<\/p> <p>  As for the Department's approach to green budgeting, there are three pages focused on this.  The first two pages mainly explain what green budgeting is and the principles that underlie it.  The last page of this part notes: \"Over the course of 2021, DPER will work with those Departments responsible for climate and environmental related expenditures to develop ... metrics that are meaningful.\"  My question relates to the development of such metrics, particularly as it relates to capital expenditure.  We know that capital expenditure is budgeted to rise, and it is fair to assume that sizeable amounts of this will be on what can be referred to as green investment.  It seems to me, therefore, that we need some metric that can link capital expenditure on green infrastructure to our emissions target, as per the new climate Bill.  Can Mr. Downes tell us about any work that has been done in this regard?<\/p> <p>  I have one question about capital expenditure.  I see on page 7 of the report that gross capital expenditure for 2020 was just shy of &euro;9 billion.  The stability programme update, SPU, states that gross capital expenditure in 2020 was budgeted to be &euro;11.5 billion.  Could Mr. Downes advise on this difference?  Was it the significant carryover cost?  Will the Department put in place measures to ensure that each Department will be incentivised to spend its allocation?  We heard reports at the weekend that the Minister was concerned about ensuring that the capital expenditure is actually spent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052000002#D00100","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621465200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those questions.  I will deal with them in turn.<\/p> <p>  Regarding social housing build and acquisition, the Deputy's point is that it would be perhaps useful to know about the separation between those and what underlies them.  There are two ways we can progress that.  One is that we can relay this feedback to our colleagues.  We will take on board the Deputy's comments, certainly for the next iteration of the report, and relay that feedback to our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  There is another way of addressing this, going back to my opening remarks.  These indicators are being put forward by the Departments, including ours, as indicators that we think are useful.  However, when it comes to having that performance dialogue, which is envisaged in the report the committee brought forward recently, with the relevant Departments, committee members should by all means have that discussion with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and tell them what would be more useful for committee members to have broken down.  We, for our part, will see what we can do.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the question about green budgeting and environmental budgeting, Deputy Farrell asked about some metrics that are being developed and the work that is under way in that regard.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that we have worked with EU and OECD colleagues and have had some peer-to-peer or virtual visits with colleagues in other jurisdictions to see some approaches to integrating environmental indicators within the budgetary cycle.  We are very much developing in that context.  In the context of the ongoing work on the national development plan, as the Deputy mentioned, and regarding capital expenditure, we have been working closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to make sure there is a strong environmental focus that permeates right through the national development plan.  I will mention two specific initiatives.  I guess they will be spelled out more fully when the NDP is brought forward in due course.  One arises from some of our lessons from best international practice, including in the context of the Paris Collaborative on Green Budgeting.  We are putting in place and have developed a process to conduct an environmental assessment or weighting of the different projects and programmes that are brought forward by each of the Departments in order that when it comes to the overall prioritisation and presentation of capital initiatives within the national development plan, that dimension can be taken systematically into account.  Beyond the NDP, we will look to see whether and to what extent this type of systematic approach to assessing and weighting by reference to environmental criteria can be brought forward beyond capital to current expenditure also.<\/p> <p>  The second point about capital expenditure is that we are engaged in another initiative to improve and upgrade our public spending code still further.  As the Deputy may be aware, we undertook a major update of the code and published it in late 2019.  We are also conducting a specific analysis to see how, when it comes to conducting appraisals of capital projects, the technical appraisal can integrate those environmental dimensions in a way that is more structured and more specific than has been the case in the past.  Those are two ways in which those environmental dimensions are being embedded into the capital side of things.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Farrell's final question related to overall capital expenditure and how Departments can be incentivised to spend.  It is the case that there was a capital carryover into 2020 and a high capital carryover into 2021 arising in part from the shutdown in works that took place during the first lockdown.  There are perhaps other issues that may be more specific to particular Departments and sectors.  One of the number of initiatives that will be developed and spelled out further in the context of the final NDP report will be a range of measures to improve capacity and capability and to professionalise skills within our public sector capacity for delivery in the context of some of those supports at the centre, whether in procurement, as the Deputy mentioned, or public-private partnerships and some of the technical analysis around that.  There is also other work on expert independent appraisal and how all this can be made more systematically available and more streamlined to develop that culture of professionalism.  We are talking about approximately &euro;10 billion in 2021 in capital expenditure, depending on what the NDP will come up with.  It will be of that order of magnitude of capital expenditure just about every year for the next five to ten years.  That requires that each Government Department and the system of how we interrelate with one another in the Civil Service and the public service are fit for purpose in making sure we can use that money in a timely way such that it delivers and has an impact as soon as possible for citizens.  That is the agenda we are working to in the context of the NDP and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronnie Downes"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I am in the convention centre and have to leave to be in the Chamber for Oral Questions shortly.  I have ten minutes, so I will ask all my questions in one go and have plenty of time for the answers.  I am watching the monitor at the same time and if I have to leave, it will not be that I am being rude but I must go to the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  The first issue I want to mention is performance monitoring and the extent to which the system is working adequately and is sufficiently incisive to identify trends that may have a negative impact on our economy, our financial independence, or whatever the case may be.  For example, alternatives in housing provision have gradually emerged in the past few weeks.  This has a direct impact on the State's finances because housing is a strategic element of our taxation system.  If we do not have affordable housing, we must pay people more to pay their mortgages and so on.   <\/p> <p>  Are the witnesses satisfied with the extent to which information available to the Department on an ongoing basis to alert them to changes that might have a positive or negative impact?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lahart made some observations on working from home.  This is something that will affect our economic performance.  I think working from home is boring.  That is my opinion and it is not the only opinion.  Restricting oneself to working from home is not good for individuals for two reasons - boredom and lack of interaction with work colleagues and the work environment and the tendency towards working more hours, where people are forced to work by virtue of calls, commitments etc., when they are unable to do the work in the course of the day, which then drags on into the evening.  Some conscientious people will then try to work after hours.  That will further contribute to boredom and a poorer performance.  <\/p> <p>  Two other issues will affect our economic future.  We hear much about restoring houses in the centres of towns and villages to the market but we do not seem to stop and ask ourselves why such places are vacant now.  One reason is people could not stand the level of noise, interaction and traffic and the racket in the background at all times.  There are places on the main streets of towns and villages where sound barriers had to be erected inside buildings to ensure some quality of life for the people working there.  People also moved out of the main streets because it was not safe to have children there.  Where could they go?  If they stepped outside the door, they were in danger.  There are issues that should be borne in mind.  We can rely on these alternatives but we should not pretend that they are a panacea for our problems in the future because they are not.  <\/p> <p>  Working in hubs and centres throughout the country has considerable potential.  Industrial parks could be developed anywhere allowing access to the central location.  However, they must have communications, including top grade broadband.  They give people a work environment within easy reach of their homes.  They do not contribute to carbon footprints.  They are an important development.  They can have a huge impact on less populated parts of the country, of which there many, and can help address the lopsided nature of our economy.  <\/p> <p>  From all the information I have, our procurement system is slow moving, repetitive and is not something in the interest of the public.  I am not sure what the Department has found around that.  I acknowledge it was mentioned earlier, but it is an area on which we need to spend considerable time to make the procurement system efficient, effective and up-to-date.  A simple issue can go into the system at local level and emerge a year or two later.  That is ridiculous nonsense.  We cannot compete on world markets like that because we are competing with people who have developed nuances to a significant extent, and identified the negatives.<\/p> <p>  I must go into questions soon.  I will stay as long as I can but please do not be offended if I am seen running out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052000002#E00100","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621465200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>There was a question on the extent to which we can be satisfied that we are identifying trends that might be important from performance information in areas such as housing that are economically and socially important.  As I said in my opening remarks, the performance report is just one element of a broader package.  It is almost the tip of the iceberg in the type and nature of the information available to policymakers to keep track of what is happening and to inform ongoing policy developments.  In this report, we are trying to focus on some of the key high level indicators.  As became clear in the discussion earlier with Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, there might be scope for separating things out a bit more or clarifying to zero in on those indicators that are of most relevance, certainly in this forum and in other sectoral committees.  Other analytical and evidential tools are available to policymakers in the civil and public service.  These include spending reviews.  Our Department has produced a series of spending reviews that focus on different aspects of the housing market and the relative efficiency and impact, for example of rental and leasing models versus purchase models.  Those all form part of that corpus of analytical information that can inform policymaking.

Most obviously, my colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and their interaction with local authorities who are on the front line in developing and implementing policy, weighing up the evidence and putting it into practice.<\/p><p>A separate point, which goes some way towards answering the Deputy's question, is that when it comes to assessing those particular policy choices there are different ways of approaching the analysis.  In spending reviews we look at it from the point of view of the value for money for the public purse or the Exchequer of the different interventions.  Part of the value for money consideration is not only the money being spent but what interventions will deliver in improved outcomes or housing outcomes for people.  Some relevant considerations are whether the State is holding on to or developing an asset over time or is the asset more of an ongoing recurring expenditure.  From the point of view of capital investment in housing, there are value for money advantages in the public sector developing its own asset base rather than purely having recourse to other models which involve ongoing payments.  The analytical approach is to look at the value for money aspect.  That is the overall amount of money going out and the efficiency and positive impacts of that for our citizens in delivering housing outcomes.  We are aware our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and local authorities often do not have the luxury of waiting for years for a particular policy to bear fruit, as intended.  They may have to adopt some short-term and immediate-term interventions to get people the housing they need.  In parallel with that, we understand colleagues are developing those medium and longer term policies which would put things on a more sustainable beneficial basis in the longer term.<\/p><p> The Deputy raised other important questions regarding working from home, including that it is not necessarily completely advantageous to work from home.  The Deputy mentioned some mental health related issues arising from the tedium of working in the same place all day and the blurring there can be between work and life that can impact on having a work-life balance.  Those are issues my colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are reflecting on as we take account of and collate the different learnings from the experience to date.  Part of the solution or the space we may be evolving towards is hubs, to pick up on the Deputy&rsquo;s point, and the potential that may have to strike a better balance for some people.  Some of the negatives in working from home that people report are the lack of social and direct interaction with their peers and colleagues and the learning by osmosis and interaction that takes place.  There is scope in hubs for some of those benefits to be captured.  There are regional development benefits with respect to regional hubs.  All of that is currently in the mix.  If we are moving towards a blended approach, whether it be the traditional workplace, working from home or a blend that will incorporate some of those regional hubs, that is all being currently considered.<\/p><p> I recall being at a meeting prior to the pandemic with some senior officials at which remote working was mentioned and someone around the table expressed the view that remote working or people working from home would never work and that we focus exclusively on people working in hubs, which was the way to go.  There was much nodding of heads at the time.  My experience of working from home for the past year has changed my thinking on that for what it is worth.  I have seen civil servants work extremely well and effectively from home.  I am working from home today but I have been in the office a few days this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052000002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronnie Downes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I might stop Mr. Downes there, as we are out of time on that section.

I will confine my remarks to a number of straight questions.  When we talk about budgetary oversight, the way we spend money and if we are getting value for the money we spend, an issue related to housing that increasingly comes to mind is the amount of money we spend on the housing assistance payment scheme and what return we will get from that in the long term.  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to capital expenditure.  Deputy Durkan mentioned the procurement process.  I believe we have created a procurement process which has created a procurement industry in its own right. We have created something that is not giving us any more value for money.  We seem to have over-complicated the process, introduced a great number of rules and regulations and distanced ourselves from the smaller suppliers and contractors in the regions who have walked away from public contracts on the basis that the process is too complicated and they could not be bothered with it.  We are not getting value for money in the long term because local businesses which were sponsoring events in schools or communities are being excluded.  When one wants to buy photocopying paper one must buy it centrally from some place in the country and get it delivered and one does not know what quality of it will be or if left short of an item one does not know who to contact, and the threat is if that one does not comply with the process one will lose one's capitation grant.  <\/p> <p>  On the capital expenditure side, the public private partnership contracts we have put in place leave a great deal of liability with the State.  The witnesses might give their view on that.  I will cite a good example of that.  The capital build of the 14 primary care centres in this country has left the HSE without any control over the buildings.  I can vouch for that.  The HSE cannot change anything structurally in the buildings for the next 25 years without, first, getting the permission of the public private partnership company and, second, getting a cost from it on it.  Something has gone wrong on that.  That public private partnership process took three years.  It was going to deliver everything and anything and now when it has been worked out I wonder how we will measure that.  For instance, currently the public private partnership company is refusing to allow a water main to go through a site which is owned by the HSE to service another HSE site.  What is going on is baffling.  <\/p> <p>  Public works contracts need to be examined and addressed.  We have created public works contracts which are very adversarial and confrontational and they are not achieving what they set out to achieve, which was certainty in terms of cost, time and quality.  It is now the norm for those in the construction industry to go to mediation, conciliation and arbitration.  That must be a fantastic business for people who are in that game but such conciliation or arbitration must be costing the State, the taxpayer and public purse a great deal of money and that money should be spent on building structures.<\/p> <p>  We are coming out of a pandemic and there are major inflationary pressures in terms of capital works and how they will be delivered.  How do we measure or consider that as we start to spend money into the future?<\/p><p>Will the carryover that we have had for the past two years, when we did not have public spend, be spent?  My entire frustration is based around the fact that the day it is decided to do a capital project, it takes on average about seven years before we get a contractor on site.  Something has gone wrong that was not there 20 years ago.  We have created a huge plethora of paperwork and mini-industries within the industries.  How can we unravel that and what is the Department's take on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052000002#F00500","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621465200,"counter":129,"content":"<p>On housing policy, value for money and a good return from the housing assistance payment, HAP, I covered it to some degree in my responses to Deputy Durkan.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has done several spending review analyses and produced a series of analytical papers which have had a critical look at the relative return on the HAP-type models versus building-type models.  I refer the Deputy to some of the findings from those spending review papers.<\/p> <p>  Our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage have their own priorities.  There is always a balance to be struck between meeting the immediate needs of someone who actually needs to have their housing situation addressed versus putting in place some long-term developmental measures.  The people best placed to directly address those important issues are my colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p> <p>  To the extent that this performance report sheds some light on some of those policy achievements, policy trade-offs and value for money, if Deputies want more indicators to be developed to help them in their oversight work, we are happy to listen to what emerges from discussions.<\/p> <p>  As regards procurement, my colleagues in the Office of Government Procurement are the experts in all of this.  The Deputy raised an issue about risk.  On the one hand, we have a highly developed and professionalised public procurement system.  It delivers many benefits in terms of integrity, consistency, clients of European frameworks and so on.  In that sense, we have a best-in-class procurement model from a compliance perspective.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of whether this has come at a cost of some overcomplication, as well as at a cost of making things more difficult for local contractors and local businesses to get in on big contracts.  That is something my colleagues in the Office of Government Procurement are very much alive to.  For example, on page 85 of the performance report, there is a series of indicators from the Office of Government Procurement which includes the frameworks and mini-competitions which have been developed and implemented.  They were developed specifically with a view to facilitating engagement with a broader range of contractors, not just the biggest contractors.  Then there are the numbers of users on e-tenders and how matters are dealt with on the help desk and so on.  This is the sort of topic which would benefit from detailed engagement with the committee and my Office of Government Procurement colleagues directly.  I will certainly pass on some of those remarks.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned some issues with public works contracts.  I was not aware of the specific case about the 14 primary care centres which the Deputy said has given rise to some issues.  Public private partnerships, PPPs, have some pros and cons to them.  As a model, they have been quite effective in rolling out a round of public infrastructure with the involvement of private partners, both national and international.  This has been seen with the provision of, for example, schools and courthouses.<\/p> <p>  Among the benefits of public private partnerships, if things go wrong, say one of the contractors goes bust, the State can be protected from some of the financial fallout which would not arise otherwise.  We saw that in recent years when school building projects have run into issues but it was all dealt with on the private rather than the public side of the equation.  There are benefits.  It is a question of the trade-off and the balance of benefits versus costs and various risks.  I was not aware of issues about control, access, operation and capabilities associated with these buildings.  I will take that up with colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE to see what specifically the case is.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the more general points the Deputy raised about public works contracts and whether they have become overly adversarial over time, this is an issue under review.  Colleagues in the Office of Government Procurement who are responsible for the public works contract are undertaking a review of that, including with regard to some of those issues the Deputy raised.<\/p> <p>  The final point the Deputy raised is about capital expenditure and the degree to which it could give rise to inflationary consequences, for example.  We are aware of the fact that there has been a huge ramping up of capital expenditure over recent years, not just in the context of the pandemic response.  Even before we take account of capital carryover and exceptional pandemic payments, this year we are at over &euro;10 billion in capital expenditure.  It is the largest level of capital expenditure in the history of the State.  That carries with it some challenges in terms of ability.  As I mentioned earlier, there is an obligation on the public sector to work with colleagues across the sector, while developing our capabilities and having a professional relationship with colleagues in the private sector.  That is something we are actively working on at the moment.<\/p> <p>  We commissioned a report from EY to review phase 1 of the national development plan to look at different aspects and dimensions of what needs to be upgraded in terms of public sector capability.  There are many areas of good practice but also much work to be done.  We are working on that.

We have to prioritise our focus towards those areas from time to time.  For example, to take the year just gone, although it was, of course, not a typical year, we had extensive and intensive engagement with colleagues in the Department of Health on issues such as the arrangements with private hospitals to secure extra capacity during the course of 2020 and expenditure on personal protective equipment, PPE, and how such PPE was being procured and expended.  We also engaged with the Department in respect of its engagements with nursing homes and the kinds of special measures that needed to be put in place to protect people and standards in those facilities.

I have already mentioned the public spending code, which people tend to think about by reference to capital programmes.  We are upgrading this code by reference to current spending programmes.  Since that page is open, if someone were to bring forward a proposal to improve disability services in a particular way, the Department concerned would have to bring forward a proposal in a structured way that makes it clear how much money was to be spent and what the impact would be across different dimensions, including the impact on equality.  This equality provision obviously affects people with disabilities but there would also be intersecting issues relating to gender and ethnicity.  Issues of regional balance might also arise.

To expand just a little bit, I will mention one of the things we have learned from experience with regard to how we manage capital expenditure programmes as against how we manage current expenditure programmes.  We have reached a pretty structured approach with regard to capital projects.  With the new public spending code, there is a project lifecycle.<\/p><p>One of the lessons we learned when capital projects, including big ones, went wrong over the years was that a lack of effort and attention to detail at the outset of the planning stage will bedevil a project all the way through, including in respect of monitoring its effectiveness.  This lesson should apply, in principle, to current programmes such that, right at the outset, before a well-meaning or nice-sounding project comes forward, we will have to do some due diligence to be clear on what we are trying to achieve with it and to determine how we will know whether it succeeds and its likely impacts in terms of the various dimensions of quality.  Once that rigorous process takes place at the outset, it puts all of us, as policy stakeholders, in a better position to monitor and hold people accountable for what is delivered.  Unfortunately, what can tend to happen not only in Ireland but also in other countries is that where a project is proposed based on some brainwave or other, there can be an impetus to move forward with it before it is subject to the rigours I have mentioned.  People may criticise the latter as causing a delay or being overly bureaucratic but we have certainly learned the lesson on the capital side that more focus on getting things right at the outset stands us in good stead throughout the project lifecycle.  Those good principles also apply on the current side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052000002#J01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronnie Downes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome that.

I have sent on my opening statement.<\/p> <p>  In my opening statement, I propose to set out the key reforms introduced by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, to provide an update on the Decision Support Service, DSS, establishment project, including timelines and dependencies and throughout to comment on how the 2015 Act interfaces with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD.<\/p> <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is significant and long-awaited legislation.  According to its Long Title, it is: \"An Act to provide for the reform of the law relating to persons who require or may require assistance in exercising their decision-making capacity, whether immediately or in the future.\"  The signing of the Act on 30 December 2015 followed a protracted legislative process and extensive consultation and it has been broadly welcomed as reforming, human rights-based legislation.  On enactment, it was described by Inclusion Ireland as \"a seismic cultural shift away from a paternalistic and 'best interests' approach ... to a rights-based approach of choice, control and consent\".  The Act applies only to adults and, according to early estimates provided by the Department of Justice, as many as 220,000 adults could potentially benefit from the new statutory framework.  This figure includes adults with decision-making capacity difficulties due to intellectual disability, acquired brain injury, enduring mental illness and age-related cognitive impairment.  It would be wrong, however, to presume that any one of those 220,000 people will necessarily come within the ambit of the Act.  That will depend on their individual circumstances.  Equally, it would be a mistake to think that this legislation is targeted at or belongs to a particular cohort of people.  Any of us could experience difficulties with our decision-making capacity in the future due to illness or injury and the Act provides important tools for advance planning. Therefore, this is an Act for everyone.<\/p> <p>  Although fully enacted, the 2015 Act is largely not yet commenced and intensive work to prepare for commencement is ongoing.  Commencement of the Act has been identified as a priority in the current programme for Government and essential to compliance with CRPD.  The 2015 Act is regarded by the State as the principal legislative reform required to give full effect to its obligations under Article 12 of the CRPD, which requires that: \"States Parties shall recognize that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life.\"  I am aware that other stakeholders who have appeared before this committee have called for the Act to be operationalised as a matter of urgency and their impatience is understandable.<\/p> <p>  I turn to the key reforms contained in the 2015 Act.  These may be summarised as follows.  The first is the abolition of wardship.  The Act abolishes the wards of court system, which currently operates under the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  When a person is taken into wardship, the court declares the person to be \"of unsound mind and incapable of managing his or her person or property\".  This has been described as a blunt instrument.  In 2019, the Supreme Court acknowledged that an order for wardship can deprive a person of the power to make many of the choices which are fundamental and integral to day-to-day life and that orders can be over-broad in their effect and disproportionate in their scope.  Following commencement of the 2015 Act, there will be no further applications for wardship, and all current adult wards will have their cases reviewed by the wardship court within three years.  These wards may have their assets and their autonomy fully restored or, where appropriate, will transition to the new supports available under the 2015 Act.  The DSS understands there are approximately 2,300 such adult wards at present.<\/p> <p>  The Act also repeals the Marriage of Lunatics Act of 1811.  This repeal came into effect on 1 February, so wards are no longer prohibited from marrying. <\/p> <p>  Significantly, these antique Acts from 1811 and 1871 are the only two pieces of legislation which the 2015 Act repeals.  There is nothing else to repeal.  The 2015 Act introduces structure and regulation to the area of decision-making and capacity, where currently we often operate based on custom and practice.  There is a tenacious but unfounded proposition that the next of kin enjoys some presumed status as a substitute decision-maker who can supply or withhold consent on behalf of another adult.  There is no legal basis for such a proposition.<\/p> <p>  A second key reform concerns the functional assessment of capacity.  Under the Act, capacity is defined in a time-specific and issue-specific way.  Section 3 states: \"A person&rsquo;s capacity [is] assessed on the basis of his or her ability to understand, at the time that a decision is to be made, the nature and consequences of the decision to be made by him or her in the context of the available choices at [the] time.\"  Incapacity is not a status as in wardship and is not linked to a medical diagnosis. The intention of the 2015 Act was to adopt a disability-neutral approach, so that a person lacks capacity in respect of a particular decision if he or she is unable to understand the information relevant to the decision, retain that information long enough to make a voluntary choice, use or weigh up the information, and communicate his or her decision, with assistance if necessary.  This is already the applicable standard at common law, having been articulated by the High Court more than 12 years ago.  The functional assessment has already been adopted in standards and policy, including the HSE national consent policy and the Medical Council&rsquo;s guide to professional conduct and ethics.<\/p> <p>  Section 8 of the Act sets out a number of important guiding principles to ensure the rights of the \"relevant person\", who is defined as \"a person whose capacity is in question or may shortly be in question in respect of one or more than one matter\".<\/p><p> As we see it, the 2015 Act&rsquo;s fundamental purpose is to ensure that the relevant person is supported to make his or her own decisions as far as possible.  The guiding principles include the following: the presumption of capacity; a relevant person shall not be considered to lack capacity to make a decision unless all practicable steps have been taken to help him or her to do so; a person is not considered to lack capacity on the basis of having made or being likely to make an unwise decision; there is minimal restriction of the relevant person&rsquo;s rights and freedom of action; respect for dignity, bodily integrity, privacy, autonomy and control over one&rsquo;s affairs; respect for a person&rsquo;s past and present will and preferences; and to act in good faith and for the benefit of the relevant person.<\/p><p> Respect for will and preferences has been held up by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as essential to Article 12.  The committee has emphatically rejected any approach based on a person&rsquo;s best interests. &ldquo;Best interests&rdquo; as a standard is not mentioned anywhere in the 2015 Act.  It is notable and encouraging that the recent statutory instrument to facilitate the Covid-19 vaccination programme contains a requirement to ascertain the will and preferences of a person who cannot supply consent.  We understand that this is the first reference to will and preferences in legislation other than in the 2015 Act itself.  At present, the guiding principles apply only to &ldquo;interveners&rdquo;, as defined.  The Decision Support Service, DSS, has called for an amendment to broaden the remit of the guiding principles so they are of general application.<\/p><p> I turn now to the three-tier framework of supports.  Decisions under the Act are broadly defined and divided into two categories: property and affairs; and personal welfare, including healthcare.  All such decisions are capable of being supported within the new graduated framework.  At the lowest, least formal level on the framework, the relevant person may appoint a decision-making assistant to help to gather up and interpret information and communicate the relevant person&rsquo;s decision.  The relevant person is still the decision-maker.  At the middle tier, a relevant person may register a co-decision-making agreement, under which specified decisions are made jointly with an appointed trusted person.  At the upper level, there is provision for an application to the Circuit Court by any person who has a bona fide interest in the welfare of the relevant person.  Foreseeably, the applicant will often be a family member or carer, or the HSE, as is the case in a significant number of wardship applications.  The court may make a declaration that the relevant person lacks capacity in respect of a specified decision or decisions.  The court may either make the decision or may appoint a decision-making representative to make decisions on behalf of the person, under the supervision of the DSS.<\/p><p> In its General Comment 1, the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities interpreted Article 12 as prohibiting substitute decision-making.  At the time of ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, the State entered a declaration permitting the retention of substitute decision-making in appropriate circumstances and subject to appropriate and effective safeguards.  Therefore, orders for substitute decision-making should be made as a last resort and only where lower-tier supports have been considered and discounted.  The court must apply all of the guiding principles, having regard to the known will and preferences of the relevant person.  Orders must be limited, where possible, in terms of time and scope, made subject to periodic review and may be re-entered before the court by the relevant person.  In line with Article 13 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which guarantees the right of access to justice, the Act provides for the relevant person to be heard by the court and to have access to representation and to legal aid.<\/p><p> The 2015 Act also provides two tools for advance planning to allow a person to plan ahead in case he or she loses capacity in the future.  First, enduring power of attorney, EPA, may already be created under the Powers of Attorney Act 1996.  The scope of an EPA is extended under the 2015 Act so that an attorney may now be appointed to take decisions in healthcare matters.  Attorneys under the 2015 Act will now be subject to a new form of supervision by the DSS.  Second, advance healthcare directives, AHDs, are placed on a statutory basis under Part 8 of the Act, the part of the Act which is the responsibility of the Department of Health.  The purpose of an advance healthcare directive is to allow a person to be treated according to their will and preferences and to provide healthcare professionals with information about a person's treatment choices.  A person may also appoint an agent, known as a designated healthcare representative in the AHD, to ensure that his or her AHD is complied with.<\/p><p> Part 8 states that the Minster for Health may make regulations to provide for the notification of the making of an advance healthcare directive to the director of the Decision Support Service and for the director to maintain a register of advance healthcare directives.  It is the view of the DSS that these regulations would enhance the operation of Part 8 and would benefit the person and healthcare professionals alike.  However, we are informed by the Department of Health that the absence of unique health identifiers is an obstacle that must be overcome before these regulations can be written.<\/p><p> Certain other matters in Part 8 require attention by the Department of Health.  The DSS and the Mental Health Commission have called for the amendment of a section which provides that an advance healthcare directive is effective if the person is detained under the Mental Health Acts and purporting to refuse mental health treatments.  It is our stated view that this is discriminatory.  The section dealing with the applicability of advance healthcare directives in pregnancy also requires review following other legislative changes since the Act was passed.<\/p><p> The 2015 Act establishes the office of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission, MHC.  The MHC has proved to be a very good home for the DSS as it has important experience of applying reforming human rights legislation to develop new structures.  The support of MHC colleagues has been invaluable to the DSS establishment project.  The principal functions of the director are as follows: to promote public awareness in relation to the Act and related matters, including the CRPD; to provide information and guidance; to set up a website; to establish and maintain searchable registers of decision support arrangements; to regulate and supervise the activities of &ldquo;decision supporters&rdquo;; to receive and investigate complaints; to appoint four separate panels of suitable persons to assist with certain statutory functions; to furnish reports to the Ministers and make recommendations on the operation of the Act; and to act as the central authority under the Hague Convention on the International Protection of Adults.  The director may also publish a suite of codes of practice to provide guidance, including guidance for certain categories of professionals.  In general terms, the Act provides for significant regulation and oversight of the new support arrangements.  This is in keeping with the requirement under Article 14 of the CRPD to ensure liberty and security of the person.<\/p><p> I will now give an update on the DSS establishment project and our dependencies.  Responsibility for the 2015 Act and the DSS transferred from the Department of Justice to the new Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in October 2020.  The level of engagement with and the support of the new Department and of the Minister of State with responsibility for disability have been very welcome.  An interdepartmental steering group for the implementation of the DSS has been in place since 2016.  It is now chaired by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, with membership from the MHC, the DSS, the Courts Service, the HSE national office for human rights and equality policy, the Department of Health and the Department of Justice.  I was appointed to the post of director in October of 2017 at a time when the only blueprint for the establishment of the DSS was the Act itself.  The project is well under way and comprises six work streams, with 28 sub-projects.  Progress has continued without interruption while we have been working remotely during the last 14 months.  The project is subject to detailed oversight and reporting requirements, internally and externally.<\/p><p> Our vision for the DSS is for a person-centred, accessible service with a digital-first approach, while we must accommodate the challenges that some of our stakeholders may experience with digital literacy and connectivity.  Key milestones to date within the establishment project have included the following: the appointment of an experienced DSS senior management team, who accompany me today; development of our organisation design and workforce planning strategy; mapping of approximately 60 detailed business processes; policy development; development of proposals around fees for our services, noting that costs must not be a barrier to those accessing our service; commencement of the ICT project with departmental approval, and a provider has been procured and is in place since July 2020; the review of codes of practice drafted by the National Disability Authority and the HSE ministerial working group, in preparation for public consultation; the launch of our website in August 2020; demand forecasting to support our planning activities; preparations for panel recruitment; extensive and diverse stakeholder engagement, including the procurement of Inclusion Ireland to facilitate focus groups of potential future service users; and development of our communications plan.<\/p><p> At the request of the Department of Justice, a detailed 24-month, costed plan for the establishment of the DSS was presented to the interdepartmental steering group at the beginning of 2020.<\/p><p>This proposes that the DSS would commence operations in mid 2022.  The plan was approved by the steering group members.  The requested uplift in budget allocation was achieved for 2021 and the  Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has publicly committed to a date for full commencement of the Act, which is 20 June 2022.<\/p><p> Regarding dependencies, as set out in our 24-month plan, the timeline for commencement of the DSS is subject to a number of external dependencies that affect the critical path of the project.  These include: budget allocation; sanctioning of posts as per our workforce plan; finalised amending legislation; finalised regulations to provide for multiple procedural and documentary matters; and decisions on fees for services and terms and conditions for panel members.<\/p><p> The Bill to amend the 2015 Act has been granted priority in the current legislative programme.  The amendments will address certain matters, some of a technical nature and others more substantive.  It is hoped that these will ensure the better functioning of the Act.  In particular, it is proposed to improve the position of current wards of court with regard to access to the court, to representation and to ongoing periodic review.<\/p><p> The readiness of the DSS is not the only precondition to commencement of the Act.  The 2015 Act will have impacts on stakeholders, including the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board, legal and financial service providers and their regulators, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, disability services, and generally across health and social care.  There is much preparatory work to be done in these sectors.  There must be support for training and education and the re-evaluation of policy and standards in line with the 2015 Act.  Appropriate supports are required to ensure that costs are not a barrier, where, for example formal legal documents and capacity statements are required to support the registration of arrangements with the DSS.<\/p><p> The DSS welcomes the recent amendment of the terms of reference of the interdepartmental steering group so that its purpose is not just to prepare for the implementation of the DSS but for the commencement of the Act.  It is our view that the appointment of a mandated single point of contact in the Department of Health to co-ordinate preparations for which it is responsible is now a matter of some urgency.  As part of our statutory functions, the DSS remains committed to working with all relevant stakeholders to provide information and to promote organisational change.  We look forward to further engagement with this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Flynn for her comprehensive overview.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#C00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses and Ms Flynn for the comprehensive report.  It was excellent and contained much important information.  I have three questions.  We have seen approximately 1,200 people taken into wardship since the enactment of the 2015 legislation, yet because of this slow pace, various levels of decision-making supports are not operational.  Wardship is, in my opinion and the opinion of many, including Ms Flynn, a blunt instrument.  We all agree that it is important that it be replaced by a new graduated framework of supports aligned to a person's need.  While it is disappointing that this is taking so long, it is welcome that we are seeing real progress.  The guidance from the President of the High Court regarding vaccines and wards, together with the memo from the HSE, was a welcome development in assisting healthcare professionals with approaching the matter of consent with regard to public health measures.  That was an issue for me.  It led me to think about how Covid had impacted us so much.  We had to take a minute because the law stipulates that consent is required for vaccination.  Some issues were thrown up which would highlight the importance of this Act.<\/p> <p>  We were expecting the establishment of the decision support service next year.  Has Covid had an impact on that?  There was an issue of funding.  Where are we now?  Is there likely to be more delay?  It is important to properly reconcile the Constitution, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p> <p>  We must support all adults who have difficulties with their decision-making capacity for medical access.  Can Ms Flynn talk me through the costs?  She gave some figures there.  I have concerns about costs involved which are not guaranteed under this legislation.  Medical card holders would be covered for any costs relating to supporting documentation from doctors but what about those without a medical card?  Have we a plan to make this affordable?<\/p> <p>  There was a report entitled Mind the Gap.  It was compiled by a researcher at the Centre for Disability Law and Policy at NUI Galway's Institute for Lifecourse and Society, and was commissioned by the Ombudsman for Children's office.  It stated, \"the supports offered under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act apply only to adults, even though children and young people with disabilities might also benefit from specific and tailored decision-making supports, especially during the transition from childhood to adulthood\".  Ms Flynn said that this is an Act for everyone.  Is that being discussed, especially at the age where a child becomes an adult?  I welcome that Ms Flynn spoke about awareness and websites.  I thank her for the valuable information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#C00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621465200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>It is concerning that since the Act was signed into law, people have continued to be admitted to wardship in some numbers.  I mentioned in my presentation today that there would be immediate provision for the review of all current adult wards of court.  We believe that, in total, they number something like 2,300.  That is a matter to be managed by the Office of Wards of Court, which will organise for those cases to be brought before the wardship court.  They are all entitled to bring themselves up the list if they want.  They do not have to wait for the wardship court to get to them and can bring their own applications to the court to have their cases reviewed and decisions made about their capacity and their need for further supports.  Many may choose to take that route.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether Covid-19 has had an impact on our establishment project.  We were able to mobilise quickly.  Perhaps it was an advantage of being in project mode rather than business as usual.  I offer my gratitude to colleagues who were able to make it happen.  We were able to adjust to remote working quickly and almost without interruption.  We were able to move on to remote working platform and the project was continuous.<\/p> <p>  I also welcomed the comments of the President of the High Court, the structure of the roll-out of the vaccination programme and the welcome use of the words \"will\" and \"preference\" in the context of people's consent to be administered the vaccine.  That was novel and we were glad to see it.<\/p> <p>  We are sensitive to the fact that costs must not be a barrier to service.  This cannot be something which only those of means are able to access, especially when one thinks of the importance to all of us of being able to plan ahead.  That is why I have described it as an Act for everybody.  We have presented proposals on fees for our services.  The Act also provides that there can be an abatement or full waiver of fees in certain circumstances.  That is important.  We have also received assurances that there is no imperative that we be a self-funding service.  That will be reviewed over time when we look at how we deliver when in business as usual mode, but the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said at an event of ours on 13 April that costs should not be an impediment.  That was very much a theme.  The Deputy asked how people of limited means, not just medical card holders, will be able to access services.  The Minister of State certainly had something to say about that.<\/p> <p>  There are certain arrangements under the Act which require a formality of presenting documentation, including a statement by a legal professional, and by medical and other healthcare professionals.  We are keen for people to be able to access those statements without costs getting in the way.  In the UK, the Office of the Public Guardian has looked at it and has been keen to make its service, which is narrower than ours, accessible.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the Centre for Disability Law and Policy's Mind the Gap study.  I was aware of its comments about how anyone under 18 is not served by this Act.  That is correct.  This is an Act which applies only to those over 18.<\/p><p>I am aware that in other jurisdictions with roughly comparable legislation, 16 and 17-year-olds are sometimes identified as a separate cohort and provision is made for those young adults.  That has not been part of the conversation here.  Again, it is something that may be kept under review.<\/p><p> Those minor wards who turn 18 years post commencement of the Act will enter in that transition period as well.  They do not have to wait until three years has passed before they are considered adults and are able to benefit from the review.  Those who age out, as it were, after the Act commences will also be due to have their cases considered in that transitional review period.  The position of younger adults is something to keep an eye on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Flynn for her presentation.  I thank all of the guests for attending the meeting to inform us about the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the establishment of the Decision Support Service, DSS.  We all recognise the importance of this matter, particularly in terms of the full implementation of the UNCRPD that, without this Act, cannot be fully realised.<\/p> <p>  My first questions concern the timescale.  The Act was passed in 2015.  Was it always foreseen that it would take seven years for the Act to be operational?  Was there an issue with funding?  What issues delayed the Bill, if it was delayed, or was that always going to be the timescale?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the role of decision-making assistant, co-decision-maker or decision-making representative, will the process of engaging with the service be straightforward and uncomplicated?  How will people find information and access the service?<\/p> <p>  Does the DSS anticipate tension and possible opposition to the operation of the Act from family carers, especially those who care for family members with fairly complex disabilities who may feel, as next of kin, they know what is right for the person concerned?  Will family carers end up, in some cases, as the decision-making representative?  Is that possible or does it have to be someone who is neutral to the family?  Sometimes decisions could be made by a person that are contrary to what other persons in the family feel is the right thing.  If so, how can that situation be resolved?

Quite honestly, when I came into the post, which was two years post commencement of the Act, I may have underestimated the sheer scale of what was involved.  The Act is dense and complex legislation.  It is ambitious and attempts more than comparable legislation in other jurisdictions.  There literally was a lot to do and the direction from early days was to do it all at once.  Some other Acts might be more amenable to an incremental roll-out but the decision had been taken, which was correct, that everything should come together and be green lit at once.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, we did hope it would be quicker.  There were funding issues, which we have been open about.  The direction was to do it quickly.  We had a plan and presented budget proposals relating to that but we did not get what we sought in terms of our allocation in either 2019 or 2020.  There was also some delay in achieving approval for our ICT project.  Again, that was linked somewhat to budget allocation.  There was a concern we would be committing to a vision for ICT without the funding to back it up.  There were delays of that nature.<\/p> <p>  Things stepped up, improved and had a much better sense of momentum and political will at the beginning of last year when we were asked to present a 24-month plan to commencement.  Ideally, we would have presented a 12-month plan to commencement and been resourced accordingly but it was considered at that point that a 24-month plan was realistic.  That plan was presented, endorsed and we got the budgetary uplift we sought for 2021.  A budget is only a year's budget so it will need to be backed up by a budget allocation in the coming year.  We will be entering into the Estimates process shortly having regard to the fact that, for the second half of next year, we will be an operating service with all of the associated costs, including fees for panel members.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the three tiers and the possible complexity of having to engage with our service.  We are very keen to ensure this is very much an accessible, public-facing and person-centred service.  Accessibility is going to be key and it is with that in mind that we have engaged with focus groups to try to get a sense of how well we will be able work with them and so we will be properly alert to their needs.  The CRPD would require that.  The codes of practice will help with that but we are also producing easy-read guides and other guidance materials on which my colleagues are hard at work.  We hope the engagement with us will be as straightforward as possible, and I can say a little more about that, if the Deputy wishes.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about particular sensitivities family carers might have.  We are aware of those.  My colleague, Ms Fitzsimons and I have recently engaged in workshops with Family Carers Ireland and its concerns can be distilled down to this: life is hard enough, and it is.  The task and ask of a family carer is no small thing.  We are very sensitive, therefore, to their apprehension that this might create a further burden and create undue formality, costs and complexity, and that they have always been the decision-makers and now they are being asked to do so in a formal and regulated way.<\/p> <p>  Our message is that we will work with them on that.  We are not setting people up to fail.  At the same time it is to bring home that message that where they may have thought they had a formal and authorised decision-making role up to this, they really do not because next of kin does not mean anything.  You do not have legal authority merely by virtue of that family relationship.  Our message is that, with this Act, you have the opportunity to step into a formal, recognised and unarguable legal role, so you have security of tenure so nobody can argue about your right to be in the room, to access information and, if necessary, to be the decision-maker.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether, at that upper tier of support, it would be appropriate for a family member to be the decision-maker, and the answer is \"Yes\".  The Act specifically spells out the court must have regard to the value of subsisting family relationships and to not interrupting those, as far as possible, having regard always to the wishes and value, the will and preference of the relevant person, himself or herself.  There is a very clear role and a preferred role for the trusted family member or friend.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about, and this is to be anticipated, whether there could be problems within the family dynamic, whether one family member will think a certain thing and the other will disagree.  The Act sets out notice requirements so that it is not possible for one family member to get in there ahead of other siblings, shall we say.  If we imagine a situation where siblings might have different and competing views about what is best for an elderly parent with age-related cognitive impairment, if one sibling were to attempt to apply to court and to step into that decision-making representative role, he or she cannot do so without putting other family members on notice.  Those other family members have an opportunity to input or to object, and they can do it on the lower tiers of support as well.<\/p> <p>  There will be decisions to be taken.  We will have to deal, perhaps, with objections that come our way, or the court might have to deal with objections to try to resolve difficulties.  Those difficulties could arise post the registration of the arrangements in terms of complaints and investigations.  Perhaps Ms Fitzsimons might want to say a word about how there will be provision for dealing with complaints and investigations, including alternative dispute resolution, which would be key to our processes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621465200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Yes.

We are, as part of our processes, setting up an informal resolution service within the DSS to help resolve those family conflict situations we anticipate will arise, because not everybody will agree on every point or every action a decision supporter is going to take.  We will have trained staff in the DSS to help resolve those family disputes that will ultimately arise.  If we cannot resolve them, then we will proceed to investigate the complaints and see if there is a need to go to court and have that person removed, ultimately, if needs be.

Deputy Tully touched on a couple of the questions I had intended to ask.  I was glad to hear about the consideration of carers because they are often such incredible advocates for the people they care for.  The idea that this is a pathway towards an unarguable legal role is an important message to get across to families who might be a little worried about what it might mean.  The volume of work the committee has ahead of it is considerable.  That this legislation was passed in 2015 but will really take full effect only in 2022 is, I have to say, disheartening in terms of the rate of change.  I hope there will be faster and better progress in this area.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by the point our guests made that this relates mostly to interveners and that they hope the remit could be broadened to give it a more general application.  Will they expand on what that would mean for other Departments and other sectors of society?<\/p> <p>  Where an order is enforced, who or what body sets out the time and scope of the order?

We are committed to a timeline taking us up to commencement and, subject to the dependencies I mentioned, it is a timeline we hope to meet.<\/p> <p>  On the question about the scope of an order, it is a court order and the Act has quite a level of detail about that.  We hope to engage further with court personnel and the Judiciary to provide input on training and a uniform approach insofar as possible, and a shared understanding of the Act and its ethos.  The Act sets out time limits for a review of a declaration of incapacity.  The declaration has to brought back before the court and kept under review.  I think the recommendation is for every 12 months or, at the most, every three years where there is a perception that the person is not going to recover capacity.  Even within that timeframe, the relevant person has a pathway back to court to seek to re-enter the matter and to have the court revisit the finding that he or she lacks capacity, and it can then revisit the decision-making representation order that has been put in place.  The Act is quite strong on the business of review and the continuing right of access to the court, and that is important for all sorts of considerations relating to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD.<\/p> <p>  The other, lower tier arrangements are subject to periodic review by us as well.  I refer in particular to the middle tier, the co-decision-making arrangement.  We have to be satisfied that a person's capacity, as declared under that arrangement, remains the true position.  There is quite a degree of oversight, and the Act in its drafting has been clearly person-centred in that regard.<\/p> <p>  To respond to the question on interveners, which relates to section 8 on the guiding principles under the Act, this has been something of a theme of ours and we have raised it with the Department of Health, and previously with the Department of Justice.  I do not want to get too niche or technical about it but those guiding principles I mentioned are really important.  They include the concept of will and preference, which is really at the heart of the Act.  They apply to interveners as defined, and interveners in turn are quite narrowly defined under the Act.  They are a category of persons that includes all the decision supporters I mentioned, the court, my own role and healthcare professionals carrying out a function under the Act.  A person is an intervener when he or she is carrying out an intervention, which in turn has quite a narrow definition.<\/p> <p>  Why are we taking these guiding principles, which also govern how we even assess capacity, and narrowing them down to quite a fixed category of people doing fixed things?  If this is about ushering in a new ethos and approach, why is it not just how we all do things in the future, relative to somebody who may have an issue with their decision-making capacity?  That is an idea that has gone back and forth a bit, and while I do not want to speak out of turn, it may be addressed in the amending legislation.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, the ethos and the key ideas of autonomy and respect for will and preference are taking hold in any event.  I mentioned that they can already be seen in other policy and standards, and they are infiltrating how we approach people who may have an issue with their decision-making capacity.  They can also be seen in other standards throughout health and social care.  That idea of a rights-based approach is taking hold.  It has been a theme of mine that I would have liked to see those guiding principles have a general application, but there may be-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting Ms Flynn but my time is almost up.

There will be codes of practice for them, largely informed by those guiding principles, that will help but my view is it might have been useful if the guiding principles had a broader remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#E00500","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for attending and Ms Flynn for her comprehensive opening statement, which was excellent.

The HSE group, for example, is a small team but it has been doing a great deal of work since before I came on board to reach out across health and social care and to educate people about the provisions of the Act and the cultural change the Senator mentioned.  I think that, broadly speaking, there is receptiveness to that.<\/p> <p>  As for the practical preparations, as I mentioned earlier, it would be very beneficial if the Department of Health had a mandated single point of contact to co-ordinate its preparations, but thus far that has not happened.

The number of people who understand the Act and feel ready for it is relatively small.  That is to be understood and we need to work with people.<\/p><p> In terms of a huge change in mindset, that landscape is improving.  We often speak about a cultural shift but it is important not to overstate that.  I am aware of a growing receptiveness to change but some people have reservations and it is important that we deal with them.<\/p><p> We are considering awareness raising of the importance of having an accessible and very much public-facing service so that people feel they can engage with us.

I want to use my time to relay the frustrations of the people who have been impacted by the fact that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act has been delayed in its commencement and the implications a delay has on individuals.  The time that lapses between the introduction of legislation and its commencement can be years, which is hugely unfortunate.  In addition, it makes the introduction of legislation slightly redundant.  Stand-alone legislation seems like it is not good enough.  We need commencement, implementation, resources and regulation.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of specific difficulties with the ward of courts process from families I have had the pleasure of communicating with about the implications that this has for them and their families.  I welcome the point that has been made about the role of an existing carer or even a family member being afforded the opportunity to facilitate that decision-making capacity, and also that it has to be the will and preference of the individual in question.  That aspect is hugely important because the provisions have created a bit of nervousness within families about what is in store once the legislation is commenced.<\/p> <p>  The Mental Health Commission, in its 2019 annual report, noted that the ward of court process has been determined to be insufficient in hearing the voice of the ward and lacks safeguards in the interest of the ward.  Can DSS representatives discuss how the new service will ensure the voice of the relevant person?<\/p> <p>  There has been discursive conflict between the carers' interests and how carers have been depicted by designated adult protection officers, DAPOs, perhaps.  The witnesses have said that they are aware of the matter so I will move on.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the abolition of the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  It is hard to stomach that such archaic legislation held sway in a modern, 21st century Ireland.  Mr. John Dunne, Family Carers Ireland, has expressed deep concerns about a distinct lack of meaningful consultation with many different stakeholders and is dubious that these issues will be resolved over the next 12 months.  The organisation anticipates that anywhere between 10,000 and 25,000 people will want to register some aspect of a decision in court and he does not feel that many people will feel a direct benefit.  Will that volume of applicants be dealt with in a timely fashion?<\/p> <p>  I noted that Ms Flynn stated earlier when discussing the commencement that it was decided to have a 24-month project.  Please elaborate on why the project could not be more succinct and be for a 12-month period.  I ask because I am conscious that the situation will have a knock-on effect on families who have really needed an intervention for the past number of years and for the Act to be commenced.<\/p> <p>  Finally, does the DSS put excess stress and pressure on family carers?  The scheme relies on civil society to make it fly.  The intricacies of the duties and obligations of family carers get increasingly nuanced and complicated as more policies come into play.  Are there supports for family members who will take up the role in being able to implement decision-making effectively for the person in question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#F00200","speaker":"1520"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621465200,"counter":208,"content":"<p>In a few moments, my colleague, Ms Frowein, will discuss numbers because we have done some forecasting and the Deputy mentioned the number offered by Family Carers Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The comments by Deputy on the voice of the ward have been very well made.  I wish to briefly mention that there will be an amendment to the Act to improve the position of current wards of court, and to improve Part 6 of the Act, so that that voice is better heard in the context of the review of those current wards in terms of access to the court, representation and the same periodic reviews as the relevant person who is coming in brand new to the system.  I hope that I have made sense.  We have been assured that there will be access to a scheme of legal aid and we have spoken to the Legal Aid Board about its preparations.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether the 24-month project could have been shorter.  I wish it had been a 12-month project.  I suppose with speed comes extra cost and that is what we were asked to produce.  We produced a 12-month plan but the 24-month plan was the one that was approved and considered realistic in terms of resources plus the scale of the task.  In fairness, I mentioned that we have six different work schemes and 28 sub-projects.  We are really busy getting from here to go live given that the direction is that we do everything at once, and that is the correct direction.<\/p> <p>  In terms of carers, it is important that we do not somehow fall into setting up carers and the Independent Living Movement Ireland against each other.  There is no need for that tension to exist.  I am very keen to address that narrative, where we can, and provide reassurance.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the burden carers already carry.  In my past life, I worked in a law firm that acted for carers and very often on trying to unlock access to appropriate services.  I was aware of the particular frustration that carers encountered when they found that they were sidelined when a child turned 18 years so I am think that I am sensitive to the plight of carers.<\/p> <p>  Our intention is not to catch people out.  We seek to work with carers if they move into decision-making roles to ensure that they are the best they can be and that there are appropriate supports to ensure that their access to the Act, when they need it, is streamlined.<\/p> <p>  There is a perception, I think, that really high numbers are going to have to immediately apply to move into these formal structures.  That may not necessarily prove to be the case and I do not think that is what was foreseen or intended.<\/p> <p>  Ms Frowein may comment on forecasting and on what we think, based on our best estimates looking at raw data and some survey work that we have done or perhaps the realistic levels of demand on the Act in the early phase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621465200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked an interesting question.  It is important to point out that the DSS is a totally new and novel service so there is no national data on the number of people who might need or benefit from our services.  To repeat what Ms Flynn said earlier, there is no assumption that persons who are currently in receipt of certain services or have a diagnosis would immediately fall into the services of the Decision Support Service, or be presumed as needing those services.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, we have been looking extensively at potential people who may benefit from our services.  We think that there could be between 15,000 and 20,000 people who could benefit from some of the top-tier services but, again, we would not see them immediately being subject to a court order.<\/p><p>It is one of the guiding principles that there would only be an intervention when it is necessary.  There is a decision that needs to be made and a trigger to bring that into play.  Based on our estimates, we think it could be around 1,500 to 2,000 people that would be in court each year and that there may be an order in respect of their capacity and in requiring the appointment of a decision-making representative.  That would be around the top tier but there would be a much broader cohort of people who would benefit from other supports like the co-decision-making agreement or a decision-making assistance agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Frowein","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Senator Seery Kearney is substituting for Deputy John Paul Phelan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#G00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I apologise as I am between two committees.

Will there be a pathway of transition out of that?<\/p> <p>   My next question relates to next of kin.  I hear the witnesses and I think we need to do an information programme to explain to people that next of kin has absolutely no standing.  I have had a number of cases in recent years where people do not understand that and cannot understand how they are excluded from information.  We had a \"Prime Time\" documentary some years ago about a husband excluded from the care of his wife in a care home, where she needed constant care and he was excluded because, he alleged, he started making complaints in that context.  It has a silencing effect on families at the moment.  The way around that in current law would be to establish enduring power of attorney so there is somebody who can make decisions.  However, that is very expensive.  My concern is the system we are putting in place will rely on families having to make an application to court.  Has consideration been given to ensuring there will be legal aid provision for that?  Is there an easier way to create a pathway to court?  Otherwise, those with means will have access to having a say in the care of their loved one while those without means will be left in some sort of wardship arrangement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#G00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621465200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>In relation to current wards and the pathway out, there is provision for that review that must take place in relation to all current adult wards, numbering something like 2,300 to 2,500.  Those applications will be taken by the wardship court, which can decide whether the person is to have his or her autonomy and decision-making restored to him or her or whether he or she needs to transition into one of the new supports under the Act.  The new supporter under the Act could be the family member.  He or she will be involved in that application, able to make representations and, if necessary, appointed as a decision-making representative.  Families should not consider that they are to be sidelined in this process.  The court will have the obligation under the guiding principle to hear from those closest to the relevant person and to look at existing family relationships.<\/p> <p>  I agree there is work to be done in addressing the established myth around next of kin.  People can feel hurt and offended by this and there can be a perception that the Act is doing it to them when I would say the Act is the solution filling the gap that has always prevailed. <\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned EPAs as the current solution.  One can only make one when one has the capacity to do so.  I recognise that advanced planning is not a route available to everybody.  The Senator is correct that it can be an expensive structure to put in place currently.  We are keen that costs are not a barrier to the service and the support under the Act.  If all of us who can do so plan ahead, we may avoid the more onerous and off-putting process of having to go to court.<\/p> <p>  On supports around going to court, the Act amends the Civil Legal Aid Act.  The amending legislation will further amend the Civil Legal Aid Act, so members should keep an eye on that.  It makes provision for the relevant person to have fairly ready access to a scheme of legal aid.  They do not have to satisfy all the conditions that would apply.  Legal advice and legal aid is to be made available to other parties to Part 5 applications, including family members. <\/p> <p>  I hope the court process is streamlined as far as possible.  We have engaged with court services to ask that the court rules be made as accessible as possible and that one form be sufficient, rather than many affidavits, motions and supporting documentation, so the path to court is eased for people and the costs associated with filing a court application are not an off-putting factor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I call Senator Flynn, in substitution for Senator Higgins.

I reiterate the importance of carers not seeing themselves pitted against the Independent Living Movement Ireland and its support for this Act.  We need to be very conscious of and continue to address that.<\/p> <p>  On fees, I do not have the specific numbers but we can share those as appropriate.  We looked at best practice in other jurisdictions.  We came up with numbers.  Fees are largely to be set by regulations to be supplied by our parent Department.  Looking at the service we will have to provide, we have recently come up with proposals to say, \"What do you think of these numbers?\"  We will see what the feedback is on those.  The directive to us has been that there is no perceived requirement that we are to be a self-funding service.  Other comparable services in other jurisdictions are.  In certain cases, we will provide an extensive, involved and lifelong service for people who may be high net worth individuals and it may be entirely appropriate that a certain cohort have to pay for some of our services.<\/p> <p>  Access and regional offices is an important consideration.  We have all in the last 12 to 14 months had to think creatively around that and use virtual platforms.  Is there a greater opportunity to reach out to ensure this is perceived as a State-wide solution?  We are looking at the possibility, which is very much in its infancy, of having regional hubs or other offices.  Where people cannot access us digitally, we are looking creatively at perhaps using the services and good offices of the Citizens Information Board, library services or whatever, so information is available through those channels.<\/p><p>I will not comment greatly on the 16 or 17-year-olds.  They are identified otherwise as a separate cohort in legislation.  In answer to an earlier question, however, it has not been part of the conversation here yet specifically on capacity legislation but it has certainly been the subject of comment and is something to watch with interest.

How do we define such a bona fide interest?  I am aware that our witness has said that the applicant can often be a family member, carer or the HSE, but Ms Flynn made reference to perhaps where different members of a family may have different views and there can be conflicting interests there as well.  If there is a relevant person and a number of family members who have different views, how is that issue addressed?<\/p><p>In a practical situation, a parent may, perhaps, leave something in a will to a family member with an intellectual disability and there may need to be support around that.  Is that something that comes within this situation if there is conflict between other members of the family in respect of such a will?<\/p><p>Apart from those points, I refer also to the challenges in the use of substitute decision-making versus supported decision-making and how that aligns with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, which is essentially what our committee is about.  What other changes does Ms Flynn think are required to ensure compliance because part of our <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre<\/i>is to ensure compliance with the CRPD.<\/p><p>I share the sense that others have expressed in how long it has taken to implement this convention and the fact that the Act was passed in 2015.  I am aware that Ms Flynn said that this is a priority for legislation this year and that she expects to have it in place in 2022, together with the full operation of the Decision Support Service, DSS.

There are a number of people who do not need the leave of the court in order to so act and these are the top tier group.  I could be an applicant under Part 5 of the Act and certain categories of persons do not need leave of the court.  In other cases, there will be an interim stage where the court will have to engage with the person bringing the application and, perhaps, assess their bona fides.  Yes, families may come into conflict in that.  I mentioned earlier that we will have a certain role in addressing that and the court may have to assess the competing positions of different family members as to whether they should step in to a formalised role or not.<br\/><br\/>The Senator asked about a family member receiving money by way of an inheritance.  That is exactly the sort of thing that might be amenable to support, bearing in mind always - and this is a point I would seek to emphasise - that somebody with an intellectual disability may well be about to manage that inheritance without stepping into a formal structure under the Act but the stepping off point is not to think how we go formal with this but rather to try to shore up somebody's independent decision-making to see if that is something that he or she can manage himself or herself.  On the face of it, managing an inheritance, or any kind of property decision around that, is something that could come under the formal support of the Act.<br\/><br\/>Substituted versus supported decision-making is a day-long conference in itself.  Article 12 of the CRPD is subject to varying perspectives and, as I mentioned, the State at the time of ratification entered a declaration that if substitute decision-making is something that is prohibited by CRPD -  the convention does not explicitly prohibit it but the interpretation of the convention by the committee for the convention does - the State is then still going to have substitute decision-making very much as a last resort, as I set out in my statement.  There are all kinds of competing perspectives and a great deal in the literature about that.<br\/><br\/>It is important that the fact we provide for substitute decision-making does not mean that that is the default option of choice.  We need to be careful that decision-making is facilitated and supported on those lower tiers far as possible, bearing in mind that substitute decision-making is still a matter that is subject to the guiding principles, including the individual's will and preference.<br\/><br\/>In terms of ensuring that this can really happen next year, I have mentioned our dependencies and they are fairly straightforward and are the ones that might always arise.  We need support for our resourcing as to the continuing budget allocation.  We will be addressing that in the Estimates process and we will be looking at what we think we need to open our doors and to operate a service for the second half of next year, together with sanctions for posts, and so on.  The importance of getting that amending legislation through and the whole regulatory framework is going to be essential to our operations.<br\/><br\/>We must feel for the wards of court who have been brought into wardship because of the delay.  Here is a structure that was promised and while waiting for it people have continued to be taken in through the front door of wardship.  I have mentioned the route out of the back door and these individuals will be amenable to that review process and can seek to have their applications heard on day one, when the new service commences and I hope that many may take up that offer.<br\/><br\/>On the GALs, I know that the wardship court has been somewhat creative about ensuring representation and hearing the voice and I know that my colleague, Ms Macklin has looked somewhat at those guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>and parallels with the panels that we will operate.  We have looked at those mainly around identifying, resourcing and recruiting those panels but our hope is that with that access to the court, to representation and to legal aid, that the voice of both the relevant person coming into the system and the current ward who is being reviewed potentially out of the system will be heard very strongly in court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Flynn and members.

They are often very tragic cases where someone has received an award compensation following, for example, an acquired brain injury.  There can be this unfounded perception that that is somehow something that can be managed by the next of kin.  If one has not been able to plan ahead by way of an enduring power of attorney, EPA, then that is not true.  Anyone of us in exactly that situation could be the subject of an application for wardship.<\/p> <p>  The Chair asked what might happen if that person is unsupported by family members and there is nobody appropriate to step into that role.  The court is the decision maker under wardship, with certain day-to-day decisionmaking devolving to what are called committees.  There are committees for the person and committees for the estate.  Often the day-to-day function is carried out by family members.  Where nobody is available or suitable, it is a role that is taken on by the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court.  If we think again about that number of 2,300 or so current adult wards, the general solicitor acts in about 600 of those cases.  In about 25% of cases, family members are either not available or not suitable for one reason or another.  That is the process, as it is in the present day.  <\/p> <p>  Often those applications are brought by the Health Service Executive, HSE.  Sometimes - where money is not an issue at all, but there are day-to-day decisions to be made where somebody is very much unsupported in the world - the fundamental object of the application for wardship is around safeguarding consideration.  This is often the context of applications for wardship that are brought.  <\/p> <p>  Having said that, I am no longer in the wardship court.  I hesitate to provide an authoritative statement on exactly what is happening in the wardship court at the moment.  By way of the replacement process, in the scenario that the Chair described, it would be open to a family member or anybody with a bona fide interest, if necessary, to bring an application to court.  It would normally be the Circuit Court, the idea being that is more regional, accessible and less costly.  The Circuit Court could say that somebody sadly lacks the capacity to make a decision around the management of this award of compensation.  It will, therefore, appoint a decision-making representative to fulfill that role.  If there is no family member to fulfill that role, the court can call on us to nominate a decision-making representative.  We can nominate two from a panel, which we will set up and maintain.  The court can then appoint a decision-making representative, who will be a professional person.  We hope to make that panel as diverse as we can.  They will be able to step in and carry out that decision-making role.  My colleague, Ms Macklin, has been looking at setting up those panels currently.  Work for their recruitment is active and ongoing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021052000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I thank members for their participation and the witnesses for their expertise.

On the Estimates for the public services 2021, the D&aacute;il ordered that the Revised Estimates for public services in respect of the following Votes be referred to this committee for consideration: Vote 35 - Army Pensions; and Vote 36 - Defence.  Today, the committee will consider those Votes.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, and officials from the Department of Defence, who we cannot see but who are present.  I thank the officials for the briefing material received by the committee.  On behalf of members, I take this opportunity to thank the Department for its engagement with us over the past while and for its prompt replies to queries and submissions on the part of members.<\/p> <p>  The committee will with deal Votes 35 and 36 under programmes A and B.  At the outset of the consideration, I will invite the Minister to give an overview of the Votes, outlining any pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance or expenditure in regard to the Votes for the remainder of this year.  We will take the Votes in reverse order, starting with Vote 36 and followed by Vote 35 and then the floor will be open to members for questions and observations on each programme for both Votes.  I ask that members put their questions on specific programmes in order that we can progress in an orderly and efficient manner.<\/p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

In this opening statement, I will set out the overall position and update members on some of the recent developments within the defence sector.<\/p> <p>  As members will know, the defence sector comprises two Votes: Vote 35 - Army Pensions; and Vote 36 - Defence.  The high level goal of both Votes is to provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government.  Accordingly, defence sector outputs are delivered under a single programme in each Vote.<\/p> <p>  The combined Estimates for defence and Army pensions for 2021 provide for gross expenditure of more than &euro;1.07 billion, an increase of over &euro;32 million, or 3%, on last year.  The 2021 provision comprises &euro;810 million for Vote 36, which is all of the broader defence issues, and an increase of &euro;29 million on 2020 and more than &euro;262 million for Vote 35 - Army pensions, an increase of &euro;3.5 million.  The Army pension Vote is a single programme entitled, provision for Defence Forces pension benefits.  It makes provision for pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to, or in respect of, former members of the Defence Forces and certain dependants.  The 2021 Estimate provides for a gross sum of &euro;262.7 million for the Army pension Vote, of which &euro;253 million covers expenditure on superannuation benefits.  Pension benefits granted are, for the most part, statutory entitlements once certain criteria are met.<\/p> <p>  During 2020, 290 Defence Forces members retired on pension.  There are currently 12,780 pensioners paid from the Army pension Vote and this number continues to rise year-on-year as people are living longer.  Against that background, I am pleased to inform members that the gross allocation for Army pensions increased by &euro;3.5 million to almost &euro;263 million for 2021.  This builds on the previous funding increase of &euro;10 million achieved in last year's Estimates.  On the issue of pensions, I am pleased to say that I recently secured the approval of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to pass on to the qualifying military pensioners the benefit of the increase in the military service allowance, effective from 4 July 2019.  This increase was awarded to Defence Forces personnel on foot of the 2019 report of the Public Service Pay Commission.  The work is ongoing on the calculation on the pension arrears involved.  <\/p> <p>  I will turn now to Vote 36 - Defence, which is delivered under a single programme entitled, defence policy and support, military capabilities and operational outputs.  The Revised Defence Estimate of &euro;810 million for 2021 includes a pay and allowances allocation of more than &euro;534 million.  The pay allocation provides for the pay and allowances of up to 10,440 public service employees, including Permanent Defence Force personnel, civil servants and civilian employees.  It provides for all outstanding commitments arising from the Public Sector Stability Agreement 2018-2020, along with the restoration of the 5% cut in Permanent Defence Force allowances imposed under the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  The non-pay allocation comprises current and capital elements and the Revised Defence Estimate provides a non-pay current expenditure allocation of more than &euro;144 million for 2021.  This allocation provides, in the main, for expenditure on ongoing and essential Defence Forces standing and operational costs such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.<\/p> <p>  The capital allocation provided in the Revised Defence Estimate is &euro;131 million.  This allocation has increased over recent years and demonstrates the Government's commitment to capital investment in the Defence sector.  It will facilitate an ongoing programme of equipment replacement and infrastructural development.  Comprehensive multiannual plans completed through joint civil-military work in the form of the defence equipment development plan and infrastructure development plan were published last year and are delivering on the White Paper on Defence policy commitments.  <\/p> <p>  The White Paper on Defence has identified that demands on future capability will need to take account of climate change objectives.  In that regard, defence remains fully committed to incorporating green procurement practices into all defence organisation procurements, in line with the overarching climate action plan objectives and in accordance with all applicable obligations in the fields of environmental law applying under national and EU law, as well as various international conventions on environmental law matters.  The principal demand drivers of defence capital funding are the ongoing renewal, retention and acquisition of military equipment, along with the development of military infrastructure and information and communications technologies.  The acquisition of military equipment is pursued through the equipment development plan and is based on White Paper objectives and provides a consolidated, structured basis for investing in military equipment to maintain and develop the necessary capabilities.<\/p><p>At present, a significant number of defence equipment programmes and projects are at various stages of development and include the ongoing upgrade of the Army Mowag armoured personnel carriers, the maritime patrol aircraft replacement programme, the purchase of military transport vehicles and the mid-life refit of two Naval Service vessels.  In addition, an ongoing schedule of capital investment across a broad range of force protection, transport, communications, information technology, weapons and ammunition systems continues in 2021.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, an infrastructural development plan sets out the requirements for essential infrastructure development works over the medium term.  This infrastructural investment, which has a strong regional or local dividend in terms of local enterprise and employment, seeks to ensure that all Defence Forces installations are fit for purpose, taking account of operational security and health and safety considerations.  A significant level of defence built infrastructure projects, many of which involve buildings with historical significance and encompass accommodation, training and storage facilities, are at various stages of development from design and tender to construction.  Those include: an upgrade of training facilities in Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, and Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny; upgrades of accommodation facilities and various military installations, including the Defence Forces' training centre in the Curragh Camp and Defence Forces student accommodation in Galway, which is badly needed, McKee Barracks and the Naval Service base in Haulbowline; an upgrade to aircraft hangars in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel; and the remediation of Spencer Jetty in Haulbowline.  I called in to look at the progress at the jetty in the past ten days or so.<br\/><br\/>I will now briefly reference some of the many outputs to be delivered by the Defence Forces from the Defence Vote throughout 2021.  The 2021 allocation will allow Defence Forces personnel to meet Government commitments on our overseas peace support missions and proudly represent Ireland abroad in diverse and often challenging locations around the world.  As of 10 May, there were 561 Permanent Defence Force personnel serving in ten overseas missions around the world.  This level of overseas deployment reflects Ireland's ongoing contribution to international peace and security and I thank our Defence Forces for their professionalism and commitment to their overseas roles.  I hope to visit some of those missions by mid-summer.<br\/><br\/>At home, the funding provision allows the Defence Forces to continue to provide essential support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as requested across various roles, such as explosive ordnance disposal call-outs, Garda air support missions and Naval Service diving operations.  It also enables the Defence Forces, as part of their aid to the civil authority role, to provide support to local authorities and to the HSE in their emergency response efforts.  In what has been an unprecedented challenge to our country, the defence organisation has contributed and played a leading role in the national response to Covid-19 throughout 2020 and in 2021.  This collective defence response involved Permanent Defence Force personnel, members of the Reserve, Civil Defence volunteers, civil servants and civilian employees within the Department.  I thank them all for their resilience and support throughout what has been an anxious and uncertain period for us all.  They have shown remarkable flexibility and professionalism in what they have been asked to do.  I say that of the Department as well as the Defence Forces because members of both organisations have been phenomenal at a time of significant need when there have been big asks of them across multiple areas.  I am happy to take questions about that, if committee members want me to.<br\/><br\/>Throughout the pandemic the Permanent Defence Force has continually provided significant and essential support to the HSE in areas such as contact tracing, patient transportation, logistics, vaccinations and Covid-19 testing.  In terms of the financial impact, more than &euro;18 million has been expended from the Defence Vote to date in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  This expenditure was incurred across a broad range of areas and includes, for example, the payment of additional aid to the civil authority allowances, to Defence Forces personnel, the acquisition of a new Pilatus PC-12 utility aircraft, additional expenditure on medical, engineering, building, personal protective equipment, audiovisual information technology, communication and transport requirements, and other additional Civil Defence and departmental requirements.  All Covid-19-related expenditure was met from within the overall Defence Vote allocation in 2020 and to date in 2021.<br\/><br\/>The Defence Vote provides funding of more than &euro;4 million for the Civil Defence in 2021.  This funding supports Civil Defence units throughout the country by way of central training and the supply of vehicles, boats, uniforms and personal protective equipment for volunteers.  Civil Defence volunteers provide essential support to efforts of the front-line services and had a highly visible role in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.<br\/><br\/>The Government also values the support of the Reserve Defence Force and the White Paper on defence highlights that there is a continued requirement to retain, develop and, I hope, grow the Reserve in the months and years ahead.  On behalf of the Government, I commend the voluntary effort made by members of the Reserve Defence Force and thank them for their ongoing dedication and enthusiasm, particularly those who assisted in the Covid-19 response.<br\/><br\/>As members will be aware, pursuant to a commitment in the programme for Government, the Government established the independent Commission on the Defence Forces last December.  The role of the commission is to examine structures for governance, joint command and control, the arrangements for the effective defence of the country and the composition of Defence Forces and their pay and allowance structures.  The commission has been busy to date and I was delighted to observe a very productive and positive interaction between the committee chairperson and members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence at the meeting in April.<br\/><br\/>In addition, as a further part of a broad, ongoing consultative process, the commission is reviewing more than 500 submissions from individuals and organisations on matters relevant to the terms of reference.  This level of response highlights the significant level of public interest in the broader issues with which the commission is being asked to deal.  It is my hope that the commission's report, when published, will assist the Government in ensuring that our Defence Forces remain agile, flexible and adaptive in response to dynamic changes in the security environment, including new and emerging threats, such as from climate change and cybercrime, and in terms of seeking to develop a longer-term strategic vision for the Defence Forces.  That applies not only to the Defence Forces' role in protecting the State and their international role, but also in presenting the Defence Forces as offering an attractive career path for people who want to choose them as a career option.<br\/><br\/>Aligning with the commission's role, I also want to advise members of the strategic review and development process currently under way within the Department.  There is, in many ways, a parallel process here.  There is a commission on the future of the Defence Forces and there is a review process of the Department, which is serious and robust.  Both will report and conclude at the same time, which is appropriate for many reasons.  This process, which will include, <i>inter alia<\/i>, a very comprehensive independent organisation capability review of my Department, allows for an objective assessment of the Department's capabilities and capacity to deliver on objectives and presents an opportunity for my Department to take positive action to address any gaps that may emerge from this review process.  This process will be ongoing throughout the year.<br\/><br\/>The onset of the pandemic has forced a significant recalibration for all of us, as individuals and as organisations.  However, through a combination of innovation, resilience and sacrifice, the collective national response, which encompassed significant defence inputs, has helped us to turn a corner.  We can now start to look forward with real optimism to an easing of restrictions and a return to some semblance of normality across society.<br\/><br\/>I am very pleased with the significant overall level of funding of more than &euro;1 billion provided to the defence sector for 2021.  This allocation ensures that the Defence Forces will have the necessary level of resources to enable them to fulfil all the roles set by the Government and within the White Paper on Defence.  Committee members have been provided with briefing material on both the defence and Army pension Estimates and I look forward to a positive engagement and to addressing any of the questions committee members might have.  If there are technical or detailed questions that I cannot address today, perhaps committee members could send such questions on in writing or, as with previous meetings, if they want to follow up with telephone calls or meetings with me and various experts in the Department, we would be happy to do that.<\/p><p>That was quite a long introduction but hopefully it answers some of the questions from earlier on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021052000002#A00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I agree and fully support the comments by the Minister about the fantastic work by all members of the Defence Forces, and especially those on overseas missions and those engaged in efforts to tackle the Covid pandemic.  I say a big well done to all members of the Defence Forces who actively participated in all of that.<\/p> <p>  The key issue affecting the Defence Forces is recruitment and retention.  While the issue of pay and conditions are central to recruitment and retention, the financial answer to that question must be preceded by a political solution, namely, the freedom to associate with ICTU and the restoration of allowances.  I spoke to the Minister in the Chamber last week on the issue of the 1994 service contracts.  As we head into this debate, the number of members in the Defence Forces continues to drop.  The 2019 to 2020 numbers have decreased again, which emphasises the problem and the huge issue of retention and recruitment.  The ongoing under-staffing of the Naval Service and the Army remains a massive concern.  I heard what the Minister said about the huge work the commission has embarked on, with more than 500 submissions.  The commission will ultimately make its recommendations on all the matters that have been identified and that fit within the terms of reference.  I am not entirely sure that we can hold our breath, however, and hope the political will that is required will actually follow to implement the recommendations that come.  I hope to be proved wrong on that but we will have to wait and see.<\/p> <p>  Within the Naval Service, we have seen a 40% reduction in the number of patrols carried out since 2018.  This is alongside a 12% reduction in the number of inductions to the Permanent Defence Force in the same period.  Those issues are a major concern that need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch on the issue of cybersecurity.  It must be said that the Defence Forces are playing a key role in the State's efforts to defeat hacking attempts of key systems.  Over the past week we have seen how important all of that work is and the impact it is having on our health service.  The Communications and Information Services Corps is the unit with responsibility for this and is supplying the HSE with a specialist team from within that it.  Will the Minister respond to the claim put out that the unit has been subject to massive cuts over the past years?  It has been suggested that it included the loss of a whole company of 50 personnel and that the unit is currently one third below strength.  It has also been suggested that these cuts have savagely undermined the capacity within the Defence Forces to assist in the defence of our country against these types of cyberattacks.  These cuts, along with the failure of the Government to introduce the necessary measures to retain the key skilled personnel, are absolutely devastating.  This is despite agreeing in 2019 to introduce technical pay for the specially trained members of the forces, such as those in the Communications and Information Services Corps.  Will the Minister clarify what provisions will be made to bring this unit back up to full strength to ensure it can play the critical role it is supposed to play?<\/p> <p>  I turn now to the measures to ensure there is gender equality within the Defence Forces and to the need to recruit more women into the Defence Forces.  I congratulate Chief of Staff, Mark Mellet, and his team on the immense amount of work they have done on the issue.  I congratulate also Lieutenant Aoife Campbell who last month replaced Commandant Gillian Collins as the new gender equality and diversity adviser to the Defence Forces.  We, as a country, and the Government have identified women, peace and security as a key area for the duration of Ireland's membership of the UN Security Council, which must be commended.  It is a fact that the more women involved in peacekeeping missions the greater the chances of maintaining peace.  I raised this last week with the Minister in the context of Mali and the key role played by women who participate in those peace negotiations and agreements.  It is critical.  By achieving a figure of 35% involved in peacekeeping missions we can see tangible transformation.  What measures are contained in the Government's plans to increase female members within the Defence Forces and overseas missions to allow them to build on the already fantastic contributions in combat roles and peacekeeping missions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021052000002#C00300","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brady.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021052000002#C00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his team for coming in today and for the opening statement.  The Defence Estimates are very clearly itemised.  It is very insightful with regard to what is going on in the Defence Forces at the moment.  <\/p> <p>  I will go through the Estimates one page at a time, starting with page 3 if that is okay.  I will flag a few things.  The strength of the Reserve Defence Force at 39% is appalling.  If one was asked to run a school with 39% of teachers, or a hospital with 39% of nurses, one can imagine how dysfunctional that school or hospital would be.  It is particularly poignant this year in light of what the Reserve Defence Force could have done during the pandemic and could have done last week during the cyberattack.  They really have niche skills that could have been used very effectively.  I am aware the Minister has inherited this problem and he is actively engaged in improving it, but those figures are absolutely stark.  They do not require any forensic questioning of the Estimates because they just jump off the page and slap us in the face.<\/p> <p>  On page 3, it is very clear that even though there is quite a large reduction in the numbers of troops, there is detailed expression there that there has been no impact on operations whatsoever.  This gives the false impression that even though the Defence Forces claim to be in crisis, they cannot really be in crisis because they are meeting all their operational objectives.  Underneath those figures, however, we must realise that many people are working to the point of exhaustion and of burnout.  I can speak with personal experience on that.  One of the reasons people are leaving the Defence Forces is that so few people are doing so many jobs.  They are absolutely exhausted.<\/p><p>The next point I would like to raise concerns sea fisheries patrols.  There was a big reduction in 2020 by comparison with the previous year.  It is stated there is no control plan and no defined target for Naval Service inputs for 2022.  This is also a point of concern.  The Minister might be able to comment on that.<br\/><br\/>The fourth point relates to quite good news.  Page 4 refers to the Defence (Amendment) Bill, which I hope will be enacted this year.  It is important from the point of view of the Reserve Defence Force.  There is a plan to enact the Bill this year.  I got very good advice from a gentleman in Portarlington many moons ago.  He said, &quot;If the Minister wants it to happen, it will happen.&quot;  In fairness to the current Minister, he has grabbed the bull by the horns on this one and is bringing forward legislation.  Is there a date for enactment?  When will the legislation come back before the D&aacute;il for approval on Report Stage?  What is contained in it?  It was indicated that it would give the Reserve Defence Force the ability to serve overseas.  What would be the position operationally from training, sport and ceremonial perspectives?  It was suggested that the legislation may contain crucial employment protection provisions for Reserve Defence Force personnel called up on active service.  Will it?  This would be very useful.<br\/><br\/>The next point I would like to raise is on page 5.  It concerns Naval Service patrol days.  As Deputy Brady quite rightly pointed out, there is a big reduction.  There is a mitigating factor in that it is stated that 197 days were spent in support of the HSE in three dockyards - in Cork, Galway and Dublin - in respect of the pandemic but even that does not account for the drop-off.  My concern is that a reduction in the number of Naval Service patrol days increases the number of gaps in our defences.  We need our ships on patrol to address issues with drugs, weapons, fugitives, vulnerable persons and, crucially after Brexit, fisheries protection.<br\/><br\/>There is some good news on page 6.  Subhead A13 refers to built infrastructure.  A sum of &euro;28 million accounted for the Estimate in 2020.  Unfortunately, 25% of that budget was not spent.  I accept that the building sites were closed last year on foot of a Government direction and I can understand the public health reason for that.  There is an increase for 2021, up to &euro;37 million.  It is already nearly the end of May.  I would be grateful the hear the Minister's thoughts on whether that &euro;37 million can be spent as intended.  As he is aware, the infrastructure deficit in the Defence Forces is huge.  Many of the buildings are from the Victorian era and were inherited from the British armed forces.  Therefore, every single euro allocated for infrastructure needs to be spent in this area, if possible.<br\/><br\/>The next point is a little more contentious so I will be as courteous as possible.  Page 7 mentions the Civil Service and the number of civil servants in the Department.  I am very much in favour of the Civil Service and Department of Defence but there is an anomaly in that the number of uniformed personnel, or front-line troops, in the Defence Forces has plummeted in the past ten years from 10,500 to 8,500.  Unfortunately, the number of civil servants in the Department has increased.  That is a red flag in any organisation.  According to the Estimates, the number of civil servants in 2010 was 354.  Last year, the number had increased by seven.  It is incredible that the number of troops has dropped by 2,000 while the number of civil servants has increased by seven over a ten-year period.  In any organisation, alarm bells should ring when the number of administrators is increasing and the number of front-line personnel is in free fall.  That is the canary in the coalmine.  I fully appreciate that there is a need for the Department of Defence and for staff therein doing Civil Service duties but when we see one number increasing and another plummeting, it should raise concerns.<br\/><br\/>I am aware that an organisational capacity review is taking place.  I thank the Minister for mentioning that in his opening statement.  My concern is that the review might recommend a further increase in Civil Service numbers.  That would have a serious effect on morale in the uniformed services.  They would be dealing with more micromanagement, perhaps, and more encroachment and bureaucracy.  The role of the organisational capacity review should be to reduce the layers of bureaucracy rather than increase them or keep the <i>status quo<\/i>.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's thoughts on that.<br\/><br\/>Even in the three past years, the number of civil servants has increased by 8%.  It has increased by 22 in the past three years while the number of front-line personnel has plummeted.  That is an anomaly in any organisation.  Perhaps we could work on this over time.<br\/><br\/>There is some good news on page 9.  It states there should be 14 members in the Army nursing service.  They would have been really useful during the pandemic.  They could have gone into nursing homes and helped out with vaccinations and a myriad of other tasks.  There are probably only three or four left.  A nursing review has been ongoing for the past five years.  It depends on who one speaks to.  Perhaps the Minister could comment on it or indicate when it will be completed.  What is the report likely to contain?  The review has been going on for years and the number of Army nursing service staff has plummeted in the meantime.  At present, many on-call nurses are being hired.  These are really expensive from an organisational point of view so it would make more sense to regularise the nurses' employment contracts.  There is a nurse in Kilkenny barracks whose contract has pretty much been renewed every 24 hours for the past ten years.  If the position could be regularised and the nurse could be brought into the Army nursing service to have a regular job with full benefits, it would make a whole lot of sense.<br\/><br\/>There is a comment on page 9 to the effect that the ability to adopt and train recruits in 2020 was severely impacted by Covid.  That is 100% correct.  My answer is that we should put more emphasis on re-induction.  The re-enlistment and recommissioning of former members of the Defence Forces are important.  I have two points to make on that.  First, a major impediment to getting former members of the Defence Forces back is that their pension abatement is not waived.  Most people will be aware that when personnel leave the Defence Forces, they get a very small pension.  Its value is between that of the dole and that of the pandemic unemployment payment.  That is the kind of scale we are talking about.  If a prison officer returns to the Prison Service, his or her pension abatement is waived.  Based on a deal struck with the unions and the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, only a couple of months ago, a teacher who returns to the teaching profession can work for 50 days every year without having his or her pension abated.  Similarly, a healthcare professional who returns to the health service can work for 19 hours per week without having his or her pension abated.  Is it likely that these policies will be extended to members of the Defence Forces?  It makes perfect sense.  The principle is exactly the same.  Members of the Defence Forces are also public servants.  The provision is deemed good enough for the prison officers, healthcare staff and teachers so it should be extended to military personnel.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's thoughts on that.<br\/><br\/>As mentioned by Deputy Brady, the 1994 contract is coming to a head now.  We should try to hold on to the personnel as much as possible.  There is no point in turning on the tap of recruitment if there is a big leaky hole in the bath or sink.  Any sensible intervention the Minister could make in this regard would make a whole lot of sense.  We should remember that most people who join the public service get a full-time job and have tenure for life, but it is not the same in the Defence Forces.  Any latitude or flexibility that could be granted would make a big difference.<\/p><p> On page 11, there is another good news story.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister and the Secretary General over the last few months to sort out the anomaly in regard to the pay of the Defence Forces Reserve.  The FEMPI cuts have been restored, which is a positive news story.  There should not have been any cuts in the first instance, but the matter was promptly rectified when brought to the Minister's attention.<\/p><p> At the bottom of this page is news that is not so good.  The strength of the Defence Forces Reserve, which should be more than 4,000, has continued to plummet in the last three years and now stands at 1,588, which is probably generous.  I understand the effective strength is probably below 1,000 at this stage.  The Defence Forces Reserve could have been very useful during the pandemic.  Our Permanent Defence Force is exhausted.  The Defence Forces Reserve could have been brought in to do camp security barracks guard and thus allow the regular troops to deploy on operations from a pandemic point of view.  I do not think any other European Union country would accept those numbers in their Defence Forces Reserve, or the trajectory in that regard.  I appreciate that the Minister is trying to make in-roads through the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2020, but a more concerted effort is required to get the numbers and capability back up, particularly from a cyber perspective.  Many members of the Defence Forces Reserve work in the cyber field in large big tech companies around Dublin.  It would be ideal to hold onto those people, who are very patriotic.  The number of cyberattacks will likely increase over time and we need to be prepared for that.<\/p><p> On page 13, there is another good news story in terms of the slight increase in the number of civilian employees.  There should be 550 such staff but currently there are only 446, which means we are down about 100.  These are key staff.  Many of these people have never served in the Defence Forces, but some of them have, and they re-entered as technicians, mechanics, aircraft inspectors and so on.  I have received a number of calls from former members of the Defence Forces who would love to rejoin as a civilian employee.  These people are skilled armourers, aircraft technicians and mechanics, but they cannot rejoin because of the pension abatement.  The introduction of a pension abatement waiver in this area, as happens in other areas of the public service, would result in a large number of former members of the Defence Forces rejoining and a use of the skills they were trained to use in the Defence Forces.  If this was implemented, it would make a significant difference, particularly in the Curragh Camp, where much of the technical expertise is based.<\/p><p> Page 17 deals with Naval Service fuel costs.  This appears to be dressed up as an improvement.  The reduction in costs for the Naval Service, from a fuel perspective, was &euro;1.5 million.  For me, this is a bad news story because it means the Naval Service was not patrolling the seas, as it should have been doing, and the fuel bill reduced by &euro;1.5 million in 2020.  I take the point that at least two of the Naval Service ships that could have been put to sea were deployed in Galway and Dublin temporarily.  Our Naval Service ships should be on the high seas rather than tied up in port for lack of personnel.  <\/p><p> On page 19, again, there is a good news story in terms of the increase in the infrastructure spend for 2021 to &euro;37 million.  As we are almost half way through the year, how likely is it that that &euro;37 million will be spent on infrastructure?  My own view is that it will be difficult to spend that amount of infrastructure given building sites have been closed for four months.  Are there alternatives or a plan B in regard to that spend from a capability perspective, if not on infrastructure?  I was grateful for the Minister's comment a week or two ago that he is open to an multi-departmental approach to solving the infrastructural deficit in the Defence Forces.  It would be a good move to get the Departments of Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Rural and Community Development and the OPW involved.  In that regard, I would like to raise one matter with the Minister.  The post office in the Curragh Camp is a historic building with massive heritage, but it is falling into disrepair.   Kildare County Council is keen to use the town and village renewal scheme across the county.  The old post office is owned by the Department of Defence.  I would welcome the Minister's thoughts on tapping into that fund through Kildare County Council.  My constituency team is meeting tomorrow to map out our plans for the post office and to put forward a proposal in that regard to Kildare County Council.  Perhaps the Minister would arrange a meeting for us with the property management branch of the Department over the next few weeks at which we could firm up on what is possible in regard to the old post office.  If we do not intervene soon, it will deteriorate further and open the doors for anti-social behaviour.  <\/p><p> On page 23, there is another interesting statistic.  In regard to travel and moving of stores and people abroad, the Defence Forces spent &euro;1.74 million last year.  That is a very expensive way of moving troops and cargo around.  Would we not be better off purchasing our own organic capability from an aircraft perspective?  If we are spending &euro;1.74 million per annum in this area, would it not make more sense to invest in a strategic aircraft over a ten or 20 year timeframe?  The aircraft would pay for itself overtime and also add a great deal more capability and flexibility not just across the Defence Forces, but Government.  Rather than outsourcing that spend, we should in-source it and ensure maximum benefit across the public service.<\/p><p> I come now to page 24.  I am very grateful to the Minister for addressing the issue of private healthcare for enlisted personnel, at a cost of &euro;4 million, in the programme for Government.  I accept it is expensive, but it is much less expensive than the cost of personal injury claims.  <\/p><p> Page 27 deals with both a good news and bad news story in that it is about litigation and compensation costs.  Approximately &euro;7 million was spent on compensation claims last year.  For me, this is unnecessary spend.  Many of the compensation claims are medical claims, the reason being, that enlisted personnel who are injured in training exercises and operations receive emergency treatment free of charge through the HSE hospitals, but, if required, they have to pay for back surgery, knee surgery, MRI scans and CT scans.  The only recourse they have then is to sue so that they or their families are not out of pocket.  It would be helpful if the commitment in the programme for Government that private healthcare be extended to enlisted personnel, which is 11 months old at this stage, was implemented.  This would result in savings for the State because the level of compensation would drastically fall.  The vast majority of the compensation claims are to ensure that troops are not out of pocket.  In regard to the &euro;7 million paid out in compensation claims, statistically about 40% of those claims will go to legal fees.  I do not think the Defence Forces should exist to pay the legal profession.  The establishment of a compensation tribunal should be considered by the Minister and the Department.  I refer to the model used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service.  As in the case of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, which is based in Cork, matters would be dealt with in a non-adversarial and non-legalistic way.  This would save the Department a fortune in legal fees and, most important, it would result in swift and smaller pay outs for people who are deserving.  If the Minister is not minded to establish a Defence compensation tribunal, consideration might be given to the Defence Forces linking into the model used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which would then become a tribunal for garda&iacute; and Defence Forces personnel.  That would make a big difference from a compensation perspective and it would ensure that people who are injured would not be out of pocket.<\/p><p> I note that &euro;1.5 million of the &euro;7.5 million was for employment cases, rather than personal injury cases.  Again, this begs the question as to whether we should be adopting this overly legalistic approach to solving employment cases.  There is a conciliation and arbitration scheme in the Defence Forces' establishment.  The findings of an adjudicator should be on a par with that of the Labour Court.  The adjudicator's findings should be implemented and the matter not taken down the legal road because in doing so we are only feathering the nests of the legal profession, when the money should be going to the people who are deserving of it.<\/p><p> On page 28, there is a very good news story, or at least I think it is.  On the grants to the veterans associations, I am not sure what the figures were last year but they seem to have increased this year which is a good thing.  The amount is &euro;411,00, which is very positive.  IUNVA and the ONE will be very grateful for that.  I am not sure of the breakdown but that appears to be an increase.  Many people do not know this, but I suspect there are in excess of a 250,000 military veterans in the country, including former members of the Reserve Defence Forces and Permanent Defence Forces.  That number is increasing over time.  It is probably on a par with the GAA or the IFA in relation to the size of the network and constituency.  I would not have become be a Deputy if it were not for that network.  It is regularly overlooked.  The veterans' network is huge and it must be supported.  There are people in it with issues resulting from service and with medical issues.  The veterans associations are the original Men's Shed.  Any further support the Minister or the Department could provide would be greatly appreciated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021052000002#C00500","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time, Deputy Berry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021052000002#F00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I am happy to finish and follow up with a written query.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021052000002#F00300","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I reckon we will have time for a second round.

I think 60 seconds should be enough.  On page 32, there is reference to receipts from occupation of official quarters.  Some &euro;90,000 was taken in rent.  This proves that if we invest in military accommodation, it would not be a cost; it would actually be an investment because the Department would receive rent back.  Something should be considered regarding married quarters.  There are very few houses there and yet there is an income of &euro;90,000 coming in under appropriations-in-aid, which is very important.<\/p> <p>  My last point is on appropriations-in-aid.  Under receipts on discharge by purchase, &euro;50,000 has been paid out by troops who have not fulfilled their full five-year engagement and are fined &euro;300.

There are not anything like the same number of complications, as were in previous years, regarding shortages of fund for the pensions Vote.  I think it is more straightforward.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked me about the ICTU issue.  As he knows, within the Defence Forces organisations, there are differences of opinion on this.  RACO's and PDFORRA's views on being formally associated with ICTU in the context of public sector pay negotiations is a source of ongoing discussion and debate.  As I have said, I have an open mind on this.  On balance, my view on this is that the setting up of a separate and independent pay review body for the Defence Forces makes sense, because a career in the Defence Forces is unique within the public service in terms of limitations on political lobbying and industrial action, and so on.  The kind of service people commit to and the oath they take puts them in a slightly different category.  We must take account of that in the context of the complexity of pay and allowances, and a take home package that is attractive enough for people to commit to a career with the Defence Forces.  Whether or not associate membership of ICTU in someway compromises that, or compromises ICTU, is a source of ongoing discussion and debate.  I will happily continue to talk to PDFORRA about this.  I know it is pursuing a legal course of action on this issue.<\/p> <p>  On the pay and allowances issue, there is an outstanding discussion which is continuing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the technical pay issue.  Members who know about pay and allowances and commitments that have been made will know that there is an outstanding technical pay issue.  We are trying to make progress on that.  It has taken a long time but we continue to try to make progress on that with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  Deputies Berry and Brady have talked about the Naval Service and the number of patrol-duty hours.  Let us be honest, we have a problem in the Naval Service with recruitment and retention.  That has been the case for a number of years.  We must fix it, and we are going to fix it.  We are putting together a very ambitious plan to change those numbers.  Ships have been tied up this year that would otherwise have gone to sea.  Covid has added to that because we had to prioritise ships to set up testing facilities on quaysides in places like Cork and Dublin.  That was a higher priority than fisheries protection.  We made that call and that is what happens in the middle of a pandemic.  That is why, when one looks at the patrol-duty hours, they are lower than they otherwise would have been because of both those reasons.  Are we still doing a good job on fisheries protection?  I think we are doing a pretty good job on fisheries protection.  We have moved away from the memorandum of understanding with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, which is the body that is answerable to the European Commission in terms of our sea-fisheries protection, the enforcement of the rules, and so on.  We have moved away from a set number of hours that are committed annually to a risk and outcomes-based approach.  That has given more flexibility of hours.<\/p><p>That does not mean it should be used as an excuse to drive down hours year after year, by describing that as a shift to a risk-based approach.  We can do a lot in Air Corps surveillance, and a lot more data are available now for fishing vessels, which we can monitor in a much more accurate way than ten years ago.  Anyone who visits the Naval Service and looks at the screens will see all the fishing boats in Irish waters under the Common Fisheries Policy.  We have applied a risk-based approach, reflecting some of the challenges we have around sea-going capacity in our Naval Service fleet.  We hope to get more ships to sea.  To do that we are looking at the decommissioning of some vessels and the potential acquisition of vessels that could be crewed by a smaller number of crew, which could do as good if not a better job in terms of more modern vessels.  These vessels are also much more efficient from a fuel perspective, which is a by-product benefit.<\/p><p> I do not shy away from the problems we have with the Naval Service numbers.  We have great people in the Naval Service.  It is a super career.  I had very seriously thought of joining the Naval Service when I was leaving school but I did not do it for a whole series of reasons.  We have an exciting plan for investment in new equipment and new ships.  We are investing heavily in Haulbowline naval base, as we speak.  The State has spent more than &euro;30 million putting in the new People's Park as part of that, of which the Department of Defence has now taken ownership from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The workplace on Haulbowline Island is improving all the time, in terms of quality of life and facilities, and will continue to improve through this year.  We have a big capital expenditure programme there.  I am on the case with regard to the problems in the Naval Service.  I do not sugar coat the problem that is there.  We are well below where we should be in numbers, but I hope to be able to turn that around in the next few years.<\/p><p> Everybody in the country is talking about cybersecurity at the moment because of what has happened with the HSE, the Department of Health and the attacks on the systems.  If we do not manage it really well it will result in loss of life and huge inconvenience for patients.  Hospitals are trying to manage a pandemic as well as significant increase in demand for healthcare over the last months.  It is hugely demanding and now they are faced with this.  We have a lot of good expertise in the Defence Forces.  Cybersecurity is an issue with very significant implications.  The response to cyber threats is a whole-of-government challenge, with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications taking the lead role, through the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, and with inputs from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  The primary role of the Defence Forces in cybersecurity relates to the defence and security of its own networks and systems, which I understand are well protected.  During the current situation the Defence Forces have provided IT facilities for contact tracing, as requested by the HSE.  I confirm that my Department has received briefings from NCSC on these incidents.  As the situation is evolving and investigations are ongoing I will not make further comment at this time, because it is not appropriate to do so.<\/p><p> Officials from my Department and members of the Defence Forces are actively participating in the implementation of the national cybersecurity strategy.  Officials from my Department are members of the steering group developing the public sector cybersecurity baseline standard.  My officials and members of the Defence Forces are also actively involved in the preparation of a national cyber risk assessment, which will support the development of resilience in Ireland's national infrastructure.  My Department has recently availed of Build to Share management desktop services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021052000002#F01100","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":256,"content":"<p>In the interest of time, I suggest that the Minister would forward to rest of the note by way of email to the committee for the benefit of members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021052000002#G00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":257,"content":"<p>On the actual strength of numbers, it is not true to say that we are one third down in staffing.

We are very embedded in the national response and the cross-government response in cybersecurity protections.  We are involved in this current incident also, working with the HSE and the Department of Health.  I just want to give some reassurance around that.<\/p> <p>  We have made some progress in the area of gender equality.  The last time I was in the defence role I spent a lot of time speaking to the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General about how we can attract more women into the Defence Forces.  There has been a gradual improvement.  In 2016 it was 6.2%; in 2017 it was 6.5%; in 2018 it was 6.7%; in 2019 it was 6.9%; and 2020 it was 7%.  There is a gradual increase, but it is still only 7% of our Defence Forces.  We must get that into double figures at least.  Much thought is going into how we can make a career in the Defence Forces more attractive for women.  It is working, but it is working far too slowly.  It is one request I often get when I have conversations at the UN on peacekeeping.  It is always asking if it could get more female peacekeepers from Ireland.   In many of the very complex environments, which Deputy Berry will understand very well, and particularly in conflict and post-conflict management in parts of the world where sexual violence is being used as a tool of war, as well as being really good soldiers, female peacekeepers can do things that male peacekeepers cannot such as engaging with local populations and having private conversations that are often difficult and traumatic.  We will continue to prioritise this and I thank Deputy Brady for raising it.<\/p> <p>  There are 600 women in the Defence Forces, which is a good story and can be made better.  I would sum it up that way.  I do not want to down play what we have done here.  It is an improving situation.  Ireland is one of the few countries in the world where it is an improving situation.  Let us take the positives when they are there.  When one considers the career of someone like General Maureen O'Brien, for example, and the role she continues to play, there are templates for hugely successful careers for women in the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Berry's 96 questions, I will get to them.  I am joking, but the Deputy knows that I am happy to take a call from him at any stage on any specific questions.  I will try to move through these questions quickly.<\/p> <p>  The strength of the Reserve Defence Force is nowhere near where it needs to be.  There are a number of reasons for that.  The main reason is why would a person join if he or she does not feel part of something that is active?  Of course, some people will always want to join for the opportunities around training and career development, but ultimately I would like to see a broadening of the role for the Reserve, very much working in a complementary manner to the Permanent Defence Force at home and overseas.  This is why the legislation is being amended, as we have proposed.  We hope to have this done well before the end of the year.  It is not complicated legislation.  This element of the Reserve has become the focal point of that legislation now, rather than the other elements within it.  I hope we will see a significant increase in numbers.<\/p><p>On some of the suggestions we have got, people who leave the Permanent Defence Force now are targeted as potential reservists in that they are given a brief on the Reserve and the options available to them.  There is a genuine effort to attract new personnel into the Reserve but it is also a case of asking personnel who leave the Permanent Defence Force to consider joining the Reserve because their skill sets could be very useful, not just in a pandemic but more generally.<\/p><p> The Defence Forces are delivering on what they are asked to do but they have to work 120% more than they would otherwise have to.  I take that point.  I have heard it made during visits to various barracks and so on, and having spoken to leaders there about the multitasking of many Defence Forces personnel.  Ultimately, we are a thousand personnel short of where we should be in terms of the overall Defence Forces number.  The Naval Service experiences the really sharp end of the problem but it also features in the Air Corps and the Army.  In some areas, however, we are not short at all.  In others, there are many vacancies.  This is not going to be solved overnight but it certainly needs to be solved in a sustained and planned way over a period.  I hope the commission will be able to make a serious contribution by way of proposals in this regard.  The idea that we are standing still or sitting on our hands on this issue is not true.  There are many things going on, such as re-enlistment, recruitment, recommissioning and directly targeting people from the private sector.  The latter initiative has been very successful in getting pilots back into the Air Corps, for example.  There is a lot happening in this space but we need to do more.  It is the job of the commission to consider this strategically.<\/p><p> On the question as to when we will see the legislation, I will introduce it as quickly as we can.  Whether we will be able to complete it before the summer, I am not sure, but we will certainly try to get it passed before the end of the year.  My target is to have it done before the commission reports, so it will have more options legally.  What we do not want is for the commission to make recommendations on the Reserve and then for us to go through a 12-month process of legislation to facilitate that.  The legislation allows us to do a lot more with reservists.  I hope it will allow us to act quickly on the commission recommendations on the Reserve.<\/p><p> I believe I answered the question on the targets for the Naval Service.  We do not have a target number of patrol hours.  The arrangement with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority is different.  It is more qualitative and risk based but that is not necessarily an excuse for fewer hours; it is just a different approach.<\/p><p> On the question on whether we can spend &euro;37 million on built infrastructure, I believe we can.  There are currently infrastructure projects worth more than &euro;53 million at different stages of development.  This expenditure will increase as the programmes advance.  It is projected that &euro;100 million will be spent over the next three years and that &euro;145 million will be invested between 2021 and 2025.  There is no shortage of projects; it is a question of whether they can be delivered in the context of the disruption for which the pandemic has been responsible.<\/p><p> Capital expenditure for this year is likely to increase significantly beyond the estimated amount because there will be unspent money marked for current expenditure because we have enough in our Estimate for 9,500 serving personnel but we do not have anything like that number.  Therefore, we have managed to solidify an agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to transfer unspent money for salaries and allowances into capital and funds for other strategic investments.  Our Estimate is probably an underestimate of what it is possible to spend in this area.  I hope that gives us financial options.  The main challenge is whether the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence can, working together, deliver the projects in a timely manner given the huge disruption so far this year, particularly affecting building projects.<\/p><p> On staff, it is a little unfair to make the case that the number in the Department is increasing and the number in the Defence Forces is decreasing as if Government policy were to increase the number of civil servants and reduce the number of serving personnel.  That is not the case.  We are bending over backwards to try to find ways to recruit more people into the Defence Forces and to limit the losses owing to people being targeted by the private sector.  An increase of seven people in the Department is hardly a significant one.  Believe me, they are hard-working, talented people.  I work with them every day.  As in other Departments, there has been a modest increase in the number of civil servants since the deep recession of ten years ago, during which the number of civil and public servants generally was reduced.  The growth in civil servant numbers is very modest.  The civil servants are working in a very focused way to help the Defence Forces to recruit more people.  The better the teams in the Department, the more we will be able to improve the prospects for recruitment to the Defence Forces and have less churn in terms of losses.  There are some signs of positivity based on the numbers of personnel leaving the Defence Forces last year and this year by comparison with previous years.  There have been challenges associated with recruitment and training because of Covid restrictions, which have been a genuine problem.  The Defence Forces are trying to respond to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021052000002#G00300","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I must intervene although I am conscious of the Minister's need to give a comprehensive reply.

I very much echo his concerns about the Defence Forces.  The numbers are deeply concerning.  The Minister might address the Civil Defence and the funding of &euro;4 million that is being provided.  I note there was under-expenditure in 2020 and I note also, with some concern, that there has been a significant drop in the number participating in courses, seminars and exercises.  I am concerned for constituencies like mine, which rely heavily on the Defence Forces and Civil Defence when it comes to issues such as flooding.  They have played a significant role in this area in recent years.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch on subheads A10 and A17, which concern military transport and Defence Forces logistics and travel, respectively.  In one case there is a decrease, and in the other there is a significant increase.  Can the Minister go into some detail on how the climate Bill will affect these two subheads of the Estimates?  What is the impact of the reorganisation that took place several years ago on the increasing travel demands being placed on members of the Defence Forces?<\/p> <p>  I would like to move on to Defence Forces communication and IT.<\/p><p>A quick glance over the documentation provided today would say to me this is an area that is looking at a significant decrease, in fact one that is very closely behind the payments being allocated to relatives of those in the War of Independence.  It is one of the highest levels of decrease.  I have to put it to the Minister that in many ways this is not reflective of a modern defence force.  We should be seeing increases in spending on technology as the work undertaken by the Defence Forces changes and modernises in line with the rest of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021052000002#H00300","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Which heading is the Deputy speaking about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021052000002#J00200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1621465200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>This is heading A15 on communication and IT.  It is an area where we should be seeing increased spending year on year simply because of the changing nature of the environment in which the Defence Forces work.<\/p> <p>  I know we are under time pressure and I want to move ahead quite swiftly.  With regard to medical care and support and the increase in the Estimate for litigation and compensation costs, when we look at this in comparison with A5, which is under Vote 35, regarding allowances for compensation payments, how does the Minister square this circle?  We are seeing a decrease in allocation for medical and healthcare supports and an increase for litigation and compensation costs but we are not seeing an increase in the allowance for compensation payments.  This is something that needs to be looked at again.  With regard to these compensation costs and payments, what alternative non-adversarial models has the Department looked at to reach a quicker outcome that meets the needs of the person and the Department and limits the amount of money that needs to be spent on legal fees?  Often, in my experience, resolution can be found much quicker and much more easily where there is active negotiation and communication.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned briefly there has been an agreement with regard to an underspend being almost ring-fenced into defence and this is very positive.  The Minister also mentioned buildings of historical significance.

The total number of active Civil Defence volunteers as of today is 2,793.  The total budget for Civil Defence from the Department in 2021 is &euro;5.64 million.  This includes &euro;1 million from the dormant accounts fund, which is used to upgrade the Civil Defence fleet.  This allocation will ensure the Civil Defence continues to perform its core function of supporting the principal response agencies, as set out in the Civil Defence - Towards 2030 policy, which was launched last year.  We continue to support the Civil Defence and it is playing a significant role again this year in the voluntary work it does.  Our funding is primarily about ensuring it gets the right equipment and training to be able to do the job and we remain strongly supportive of the work it does.<\/p> <p>  Climate action is important across all aspects of Government now, even in defence.  If we look at what we are doing here, we are investing in the energy proofing of our buildings and we have a significant number of buildings.  Improving energy efficiency and the energy management of our portfolio of buildings is important.  We use electric vehicles where possible but there are some vehicles for which this does not work.  We are not likely to have an electric Mowag any time soon.  This does not mean that in terms of many of the transportation vehicles we cannot look at more emissions-efficient vehicles.  We are also using green energy where possible.  This will be factored into procurement discussions and choices, as it will for every Department.<\/p> <p>  With regard to communications and information technology, the outturn for last year was a lot higher than this year's Estimate.  I am told that if the outturn this year is higher than the Estimate as it was last year then we will spend more money as needed.  When we look at the list of areas where we are spending money, including computer and data preparation, equipment, printing, photocopying, signal equipment and maintenance and telecommunications services, they are in contract cycles so we will sometimes have higher expenditure and sometimes lower expenditure.  I assure the Deputy, and I have been very clear with the chair of the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces on this, that I expect it to look in a very serious way at cybersecurity as one of the key priorities in future planning for the Defence Forces, in terms of their own systems and contributing to the national challenges on this.  I do not think money or funding will be a problem in terms of this issue.  The challenges will be skill sets and recruitment.  The Deputy can take from me that the actual hardware and equipment and the housing of those personnel will not be a problem.  It is about the skill sets.  We already have many skilled people in the Defence Forces but we probably need more.
