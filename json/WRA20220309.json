Under the National Development Plan &euro;1bn has been allocated to specific carbon reduction measures, including vehicle electrification.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the\u00a0electric\u00a0vehicle\u00a0charging network over the coming years.\u00a0A national charging infrastructure strategy is being developed\u00a0which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030. My Department is engaging with\u00a0relevant stakeholders\u00a0to inform this work and it is envisaged that the strategy will be published for consultation at the end of this month.<\/p>  <p>  EV sales continue to grow strongly and it is imperative that a seamless network of recharging infrastructure is available\u00a0to support that growth. In the development of the strategy officials from my Department have engaged with local authorities, other public sector bodies, and the private sector in identifying how to best support the prompt rollout of infrastructure both to address challenges in domestic and neighbourhood charging as well as the need for fast charging.\u00a0 My officials have also reviewed international best practice in the provision of EV charging infrastructure to understand what mix of infrastructure provision will best address the needs of Irish EV owners.<\/p>  <p>  A package of supports aiming to facilitate a swift delivery of infrastructure across the country is being prepared to be launched alongside the strategy, including a destination charge point scheme and an update of the public charge point scheme.

This requirement is set out in EU Regulation No 996\/2010 which states the addressee of a Safety Recommendation shall acknowledge receipt of the transmittal letter and inform the safety investigation authority (in this case the AAIU) of the actions taken or under consideration, and where appropriate, of the time necessary for their completion and where no action is taken, the reasons therefor. <\/p>  <p>  The responses were required by 3rd Feb 2022 and were provided in advance of that date. The responses will in due course be made public on the AAIU website via the associated published Investigation Report, and in the European Safety Recommendation Information System. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to prescribing the response to the Safety Recommendations, Article 18 of EU Reg 996 of 2010 also requires the AAIU to inform the addressees of Safety Recommendations within 60 days whether or not it considers their reply or replies adequate. The AAIU can also seek more information or clarification in relation to any aspect of a response.\u00a0 Furthermore, if responses include details of actions to be taken, the AAIU will note that but the Safety Recommendation will remain open until such time as the AAIU is satisfied that the actions have been concluded.<\/p>  <p>  Around the time of the publication of the AAIU Final Report I stated that I fully accepted the recommendations addressed to me contained within the report.

Following publication of this independent review, known as the AQE Report, in September 2018, the then Minister committed to implementing its twelve recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  The measures that have been taken fall under six broad categories:<\/p>  <p>  1. Development of a new national search and rescue framework (the National SAR Plan)<\/p>  <p>  2. Enhancing safety and oversight across the Search &amp;amp; Rescue system<\/p>  <p>  3. Addressing oversight of Search &amp;amp; Rescue aviation elements&ndash; nationally and internationally<\/p>  <p>  4. Review and revision of all relevant Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and training for Coast Guard personnel, particularly Rescue Coordination Centre staff training with a focus on aviation tasking. This includes the introduction of a formal course on tasking of aviation assets delivered by an IAA Authorised Training Organisation (ATO).<\/p>  <p>  5. Development of an externally accredited safety management system in the Coast Guard<\/p>  <p>  6. Review of governance arrangements in relation to the aviation contractor, enhancing aviation expertise in critical areas and legislative reform of the IAA.<\/p>  <p>  It is appropriate to refrain from detailed comment until such time as the AAIU have had an opportunity to provide their formal replies to our responses to their recommendations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030900080#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[13214\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030900080#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a recommendation (details supplied) has been implemented in full; the person or body that is providing the technical expertise to his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>My Department formally responded to the Chief Inspector of Air Accidents in respect of each safety recommendation addressed to me, in advance of the 90 day timeframe required under the relevant EU legislation.

announced funding in January 2021 for up to 248 new posts in local authorities to expand walking and cycling facilities all over the country. This increase in resourcing reflects the &euro;1.8bn of funding committed for walking and cycling over the planned lifetime of the Government. The additional staff will be dedicated to delivering and promoting Active Travel in Ireland and will work across design, communication, community liaison and construction oversight.<\/p><p>The National Transport Authority has been working closely with all the local authorities in the State to deliver the additional resourcing plan for Active Travel. Following discussions with the relevant stakeholders including my Department, the Local Government Management Agency, the County and City Management Association and the local authorities, it was decided that the new Active Travel staff would be located in each local authority rather than co-located in the Regional Cycle Design Offices as had been initially proposed.<\/p><p>As of 1 January 2022 I can confirm that 117 additional staff have been recruited to work in Active Travel in local authorities across the country. In addition, 39 positions are currently &lsquo;pending&rsquo;, meaning interviews have either been completed or are ongoing, and the positions are expected to be filled shortly. Once these pending positions are filled, the total staff numbers will be 156. Recruitment processes are ongoing and it is expected that all the remaining positions will be filled in 2022.<\/p><p>It is important to note that there is strong competition for staff given the

A &lsquo;pedal cycle&rsquo; means:<ol type=\"1\"><li>A bicycle or tricycle which is intended or adapted for propulsion solely by the physical exertions of a person or persons seated thereon, or<li>A pedelec, being a bicycle or tricycle which is equipped with an auxiliary electric motor having a maximum continuous rated power of 0.25 kilo-watts, of which output is progressively reduced and finally cut off as the bicycle reaches a speed of 25 kilometres per hour, or sooner if the cyclist stops pedalling.<\/ol><li>The bicycle and related safety equipment must be new and must be purchased by the employer. <li>The bicycle and related safety equipment must be used by the employee or director mainly for the whole or part of their journey to or from work.<li>An employee or director can only avail of the Cycle to Work scheme once in any 4-year period, commencing with the date the employee is first provided with a bicycle or bicycle safety equipment. As noted, prior to 1 August 2020 an employee or director could only avail of the Cycle to Work scheme once in any 5-year period. <\/ol>The cycle to work scheme operates on a self-administration basis, and relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation. There is no notification procedure for employers involved. This approach was taken with the deliberate intention of keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers.

However, Irish Water is subject to range of external oversight mechanisms.<\/p>  <p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which has statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. <\/p>  <p>  A key aspect of the CRU&rsquo;s regulatory role is to ensure that Irish Water&rsquo;s revenue is spent appropriately to improve services for customers. To facilitate this, the CRU has put a Performance Assessment Framework in place against which it monitors Irish Water&rsquo;s performance and progress over time. This Framework currently includes 28 metrics covering customer service, security of supply, quality of supply, sewer incidents, environmental performance, and energy and emissions. This arrangement is in place to ensure that Irish Water performs to a high standard, keeps the public and other key stakeholders informed of its performance, and supports the CRU in making evidence-based decisions in the interests of customers.  <\/p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for regulating Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with environmental regulation.

The Water Advisory Body issues quarterly reports to the Oireachtas on Irish Water performance.

We have raised these concerns, along with our partners in the EU and the wider international community, on a number of occasions. I also raised these issues directly with my Chinese counterpart, State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during a visit to China in May 2021. <\/p><p>Ireland has consistently called on China to allow unrestricted and meaningful access to the region for independent observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and we note that some progress has been made towards a visit of the High Commissioner. We look forward to the High Commissioner&rsquo;s report on human rights in Xinjiang.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s approach regarding Xinjiang has been to cooperate with like-minded states through the multilateral system to demand progress on this issue. At the 48th UN Human Rights Council in September 2021, Ireland joined an EU Group Statement, which called on China to comply with its obligations under national and international law to respect and protect human rights, including in Xinjiang.<\/p><p>In October 2021, Ireland joined a cross-regional statement on the situation in Xinjiang, delivered at the Third Committee of the 76th UN General Assembly. The statement calls attention to the arbitrary detention of over a million people in Xinjiang and the &ldquo;systematic human rights violations, including reports documenting torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.&rdquo; <\/p><p>The EU has also initiated sanctions under the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime against four Chinese persons and one entity for their role in Xinjiang. These sanctions are designed to act as a deterrent and encourage changes in these actors&rsquo; behaviour. Sanctions are based on solid legal evidence and are deployed alongside other measures, including dialogue. <\/p><p>My Department has studied the report by the Uyghur People&rsquo;s Tribunal in detail. Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs met in person with representatives of the World Uyghur Congress following the publication of the report. This report is a further contribution to our understanding of the situation in Xinjiang. While the &lsquo;Uyghur&rsquo;s People&rsquo;s Tribunal&rsquo; is not a judicial body with the authority to issue judgments on matters concerning international law, I recognise the significant work undertaken by its authors, including in collating reports from a number of different sources.<\/p><p>I am aware of the US Government&rsquo;s finding that genocide and crimes against humanity occurred against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang. The term &lsquo;genocide&rsquo; has a particular meaning under international law. Recognition of events definitively as genocide involves an analysis of both facts and law. Ireland follows the practice of recognising genocide only where this has been established by a final decision of a court in Ireland, or by a final judgment of an international court, or where there is international consensus on the matter. Such a final judgement has not taken place and international consensus has not been reached to date. <\/p><p>This in no way undermines the seriousness with which the Government approaches the situation in Xinjiang, or our commitment to pursue this matter and seek better protection of human rights for the Uyghur people. The protection and promotion of human rights is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy, and Ireland will continue to monitor and assess the situation and, along with our EU partners, engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora to address our concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030900083#WRE01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":209,"content":"<p>Question No. 94 answered with Question No. 93.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Policy","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030900083#WRE02000"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[13264\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030900083#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of officials, companies and persons currently sanctioned by the Irish Government broken down by country and the reason for sanctioning in tabular form.","asker":"1504","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>Ireland implements both United Nations sanctions, as adopted by the UN Security Council, and EU sanctions, as adopted as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.

While some regimes have very few people or entities listed (for example, EU restrictive measures in view of the situation in Zimbabwe sanction one entity only), other regimes sanction hundreds of people and entities (for example, there are currently 702 individuals and 53 entities sanctioned by EU restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine). This information is nonetheless made available to the public by both the UN and EU. The UN publishes a consolidated list of all individuals and entities subject to sanctions measures adopted by the UN Security Council. Regarding EU sanctions, a consolidated list of persons, groups and entities subject to EU financial sanctions is available on the European Commission&rsquo;s sanctions website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030900083#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukrainian War","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030900083#WRE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[13302\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030900083#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if consideration has been given to an aid match programme for Ukraine aid such as the one announced by the Canadian government and the Red Cross; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs provides funding to a range of non-governmental organisations through a series of grant schemes dedicated to delivering on the Government's priorities at home and abroad.

While the main day to day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, it also carries out a number of other non-fishery related tasks in tandem with maritime surveillance.  As such any Naval Service patrol should be viewed as a multi-faceted activity. The Naval Service carry out a significant security role. By its nature, often that security role goes unrecognised or unacknowledged but it is vital to Ireland's national priorities and interests. In terms of fishery protection, the Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the EEZ.<\/p>  <p>  The Air Corps Maritime Patrol Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of the EEZ using two CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft. These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the EEZ.<\/p>  <p>  At any one time the Naval Service can have a number of ships on active operations around the Irish EEZ whilst a number of others are undergoing routine resupply, maintenance and down time for ships companies. <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service, including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class of vessels, and the replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi-role vessel (MRV).  The MRV is an important element of the Defence Equipment Development Plan and is provided for in the Government's National Development Plan as a major capital project. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capability for a wide range of maritime tasks. <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence also provides for the replacement of the CASA 235s with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was entered into with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to security and surveillance matters within Irish territorial waters, primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice. One of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is to provide Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to assist An Garda Sioch&aacute;na when requested to do so. This assistance can include direct support from the Naval Service. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission on the Defence Forces recently published their report on the 9th February 2022. The Commission have undertaken a significant body of work encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference.

The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service. <\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that this process will take at least four to five months in order to bring a considered and comprehensive proposal back to Government to address the fundamental issues that the Commission have set out. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030900083#WRE05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[13362\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030900083#WRE05500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the involvement the Defence Forces will have in assisting with the settlement of refugees arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":243,"content":"<p>Ireland is continuing to provide strong political and practical support for Ukraine and we continue to assert Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.<\/p><p>The Government has stated that Ireland will play its part in assisting people from the Ukraine and has already lifted visa requirements to allow people from the Ukraine who want to seek safety here in Ireland to do so as easily as possible.  <\/p><p>The European Union has agreed a package of &euro;500 million in military assistance for Ukraine.

A Working Group has been established with a view to bringing forward proposals on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Medical mental health services available to personnel include access to clinical psychology and psychiatry services. The psychology service assesses, diagnoses, treats and advises on strategies to prevent mental health disorders, and there are currently two Clinical Psychologists employed by the Defence Forces. Psychiatry services specialise in the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. There is currently one dedicated civilian consultant psychiatrist engaged by the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these clinical supports, non-medical mental health services are provided by the Defence Forces Personnel Support Service (PSS). The PSS provides a welfare, information, psycho-social support and referral service to serving members of the Defence Forces and their families. The service is also available to civilian employees, and in a limited role to veterans. This service sustains and enhances the individual well-being of personnel, and promotes a safe and positive work culture, in order to support the effectiveness of the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  The service is delivered through a network of military Barrack PSS Officers and civilian Occupational Social Workers. This network of professionals is prepared to provide immediate help to service personnel and their families in a routine environment or at a time of crisis. This assistance can range from the simple provision of information to counselling or, if required, signposting and referral to specialist help and assistance. <\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces, through the PSS and working closely with the HSE, has and continues to engage in mental health education programmes for all members of the Defence Forces. These programmes include:<\/p>  <p>  - Issuing an \"Information Guide on Mental Health and Well Being in the Defence Forces\"; <\/p>  <p>  - Providing access to \"Mental Fitness\" programmes through the Defence Forces Intranet; <\/p>  <p>  - Providing Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) training to all PSS personnel; <\/p>  <p>  - Conducting Skills Training on Risk Management in suicide and self-harm mitigation (STORM) training with all overseas units; <\/p>  <p>  - Conducting Safe Talk training throughout the Defence Forces; <\/p>  <p>  - Providing Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) training for all personnel; <\/p>  <p>  - Issuing and giving presentations on \"Defence Forces Guidelines on Suicide\"; <\/p>  <p>  - Running courses on \"Suicide and Self Harm Awareness\"; and <\/p>  <p>  - Providing Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) in conjunction with the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The Mental Health Wellbeing Strategy for the Defence Forces, which was launched on 2 December 2020, recognises the unique nature of the experience of military life in Ireland. The aim of the strategy is to provide a coordinated and effective mental health and support system for the personnel of the Defence Forces through the adoption of a series of measures between 2020 and 2023.<\/p>  <p>  Eight supporting objectives (Governance, Resilience, Suicide, Stigma, Critical Incident Stress Management, a Comprehensive Approach, Military Families and a Model for Clinical Support) have been identified as essential components of the strategy to support the principal aim. It is intended that at the end of 2023, mental health and wellbeing support within the Defence Forces will be delivered in a coordinated, multi-disciplinary and directed manner that is designed to produce the best outcomes for the organisation and the military personnel and their families.<\/p>  <p>  On 2nd November 2020, the Deputy Chief Of Staff (Support) issued an order for the convening of the Defence Forces Mental Health and Wellbeing Standing Committee which has responsibility for the implementation of the strategy. The Committee is chaired by the Officer In Charge of the Defence Forces Personnel Support Services and includes representatives of all subject matter experts in the area of mental health and wellbeing within the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  The Standing Committee has selected 15 milestones from the strategy for consideration. Each milestone has been allocated to a working group consisting of selected members of the Standing Committee and other key personnel and subject matter experts as required. Work plans have been created and the Working Groups report monthly to a full meeting of the Standing Committee. At these meetings progress achieved is assessed and guidance offered to counter obstacles or to provide direction for action.<\/p>  <p>  Currently half of the milestones identified within the strategy are being addressed and it is expected that working groups will be stood up to address the remaining milestones during 2022. Some of the key milestones address issues regarding the support of families. The Standing Committee will produce a report at the end of 2023 and will be in a position to develop a follow on Mental Health Strategy for 2024-2029, which will look to build on the progress achieved and ensure the effective delivery of mental health and wellbeing within the Defence Forces to the end of the decade.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department funds a confidential counselling, referral and support service for serving members of the Defence Forces, civilian employees and Civil Defence volunteers. The service provides confidential counselling on a wide range of personal and work related issues, including but not limited to health, relationships, addictions, financial, bereavement, stress, conflict, critical incident and trauma. A Freephone confidential helpline is available on a 24\/7 basis 365 days a year. The helpline provides for referral to appointment-based telephone or face-to-face counselling. <\/p>  <p>  While I am satisfied that the available services offer comprehensive supports to Defence Forces members, I can assure the Deputy that they are kept under constant review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030900084#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[13377\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030900084#WRF01100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if his Department will consider the recommendations set out in the Commission on the Defence Forces Report published in February 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":258,"content":"<p>The Commission on the Defence Forces was established on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government and the Government decision in December 2020 which also agreed its terms of reference and membership. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces was recently published.

Core Funding aims to offer better financial sustainability to providers in return for a cultural shift to a partnership relationship between providers and the State that reflects the public good dimension of ELC and SAC.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across Early Learning and Care provision, as well as Managers with a relevant qualification.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (at standard capitation rates), AIM, CCSP and NCS.\u00a0 It incorporates ECCE Higher Capitation and funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Instead of ECCE Higher Capitation, a Graduate Premium will be a feature of Core Funding.\u00a0 This will make a payment to ELC services in respect of Lead Educators and Managers with a graduate qualification and the requisite experience.\u00a0 This development means additional funding for graduate Lead Educators outside of the ECCE programme will be available for the first time.<\/p>  <p>  Extra funding to support administration costs is also contained within Core Funding. This means that the budget previously allocated to Programme Support Payments, with an increased allocation, is now incorporated into Core Funding.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The total available budget for Core Funding is &euro;73.5 million in 2022 (September-December), equivalent to &euro;221 million in a full programme year.\u00a0 \u00a0This level of allocation to Core Funding is contingent on an Employment Regulation Order being agreed by the Joint Labour Committee and in effect in time for the planned start date of Core Funding in September.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will be allocated to services based on the capacity the indicate they will offer and the qualifications of those working in a service. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million will be distributed based on the capacity that the service is offering to provide (child places, age groups, hours and weeks), which includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions\u00a0(&euro;138 million), for administrative staff\/time (&euro;25 million), and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million).\u00a0&euro;38 million of the &euro;221 million will be distributed in line with ELC graduate qualifications of ELC Lead Educators and Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services.<\/p>  <p>  The precise implications of the funding for staff pay and conditions depends on the agreement by the JLC. However, I believe that the level of funding provided is significant enough to achieve a substantial improvement in levels of staff pay and the development of career frameworks.

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the regulatory framework, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for homecare and support providers in April 2021. The framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services. Development of regulations and quality standards are at an advanced level and public consultation on both is planned for Q2 2022. They are underpinned by four key principles &ndash; a human rights-based approach, safety and wellbeing, responsiveness, and accountability &ndash; all working together to achieve person-centred care and support.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is the statutory body established under the Health Act 2007 to drive high-quality and safe care for people using health and social care services in Ireland. It is envisaged that the HIQA Chief Inspector will be responsible for licencing and inspection of the provision of homecare and support services to ensure that governance, management, service delivery, and staff training are in accordance with regulatory requirements and quality standards. The focus of the inspection is on the registered provider and it is not envisaged that this will involve home visits. HIQA may have some discretionary powers regarding examination of individual complaints. <\/p>  <p>  The importance of integrated care pathways, communication and coordination of care between services to enable people to get the right care, at the right time and in the right place is fundamental to Sl&aacute;intecare.
