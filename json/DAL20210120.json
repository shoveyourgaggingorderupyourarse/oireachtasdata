I first raised this issue with the Minister for Health on the floor of the D&aacute;il in July 2020.  I raised it again in September, October and November.  As the Minister is aware, other Members also raised the issue and brought forward a Private Members' motion, which was voted down and against by his party and colleagues in government.  <\/p><p>I want to say from the outset, so that there is no confusion, that my party is not seeking to change the current model of education and training for student nurses and midwives.  It is a model that serves us well.  In my view, we turn out some of the best and most hard-working student nurses and midwives, who are the envy of the world.  The problem is that they do not feel respected or valued.  I have engaged with hundreds of student nurses and midwives over the last number of months.  I have listened, at first hand, to what they have told me.  To be clear for the Minister, they understand that there is an element of training, education and supervision to their placements.  However, as the Minister is aware, they also understand and know that when they step onto a hospital ward, there is a strong element of work.  They are doing real work and they want that to be respected and valued.  They want the Minister to put fair and reasonable solutions on the table.  What the Minister has put on the table so far has been completely unacceptable.  An allowance of &euro;100 per week for first, second and third years has been quite rightly been regarded as a slap in the face and far from adequate.  It is not fair and reasonable.  That approach should be contrasted with the approach the Minister took in respect of the most senior civil servant in his Department.  He sat down with two of his ministerial colleagues and hatched a plan to give that individual a pay rise of &euro;81,000 upon the post becoming permanent.  I am not referring to a salary of &euro;81,000 but to a pay rise of &euro;81,000, bringing the individual's salary close to &euro;300,000 a year.  How can the Minister say that is fair and reasonable, and shows that he values the work that those on the front line, including student nurses and midwives, do in our hospitals?<\/p> <p>How is that fair?  Student nurses and midwives are looking at this, as are others, and they are saying that what the Minister did over the past number of months is prioritise that individual over the needs of the thousands of student nurses and midwives who have done such huge and Trojan work in our hospitals since this pandemic struck.<br\/><br\/>I want to outline to the Minister some of the experiences that have been recounted to me by those student nurses and midwives.  One of them said:<\/p><blockquote>\tI was diagnosed with Covid-19 during my placement.  I had to put my entire family at risk because of the work that I do.  For all of that, I got nothing.  An allowance of &euro;50 per week and a travel allowance of 25 cent a mile paid two months after placement finished or, if you lived close by, nothing at all. <\/blockquote> <p>Another told me:<\/p><blockquote>\tIt is ten months since I got Covid while working for free and I am still not better.  I will either emigrate or return to college because it is not worth working as a nurse in this country. <\/blockquote> <p>I want the Minister to listen to those words because they show why this motion is so important.  If we do not value the work that student nurses and midwives do, they will leave.  We are putting them through what is, as I said earlier, one of the best training and education programmes in the world, yet they are leaving in droves because, they are telling me, they do not feel valued and respected by the Minister and the Government.<br\/><br\/>This is an issue that should not divide us.  It is an issue on which this House should be united that we do what is right, that we right a wrong here and that we make sure we pay student nurses and midwives reasonable and fair rates of pay and allowances.  That is all they are looking for.  I am calling on the Minister to support this motion.  I am calling on him to do what is right.  I am calling on him to send a powerful message to student nurses and midwives that we want them to stay here working in the Irish healthcare system, not emigrating, and that we value the work they are doing on a daily basis.  I ask the Minister to listen to and support this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000003#A00200","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611137100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>It is time now to pay student nurses and midwives.  A payment of &euro;100 is an absolute insult to the hard work put in by student nurses on the front line.  Student nurses and midwives did not go into hiding when they were called upon.  They have put themselves at daily risk for the common good.  They have gone above and beyond what they were asked to do.  These students were working, they were needed to work and they should be paid for working.  It is as simple as that.  The &euro;100 the Government has offered will not cover transport, lunches or childcare.  It is an insight into how the Government values our student workers, and workers is what they are.<\/p><p>As Deputy Cullinane said, it is no wonder that so many are leaving our shores once they qualify.  This is about fairness and &euro;100 is an insult and just will not cut it.  The decision to pay student nurses and midwives lies with the Minister for Health but the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is also responsible for protecting students from exploitation.  The two Ministers need to step up to the plate and pay student nurses and midwives now.  There should be no more empty promises and no more delays.  If my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, was Minister for Health, I have no doubt that he would pay student nurses and midwives now.  The decision to suspend placements for student nurses is just another attempt to kick this issue down the road and muddy the waters.  I spoke with students in my own area in Dublin Mid-West and they tell me that suspending student places does not make sense during a staffing crisis.<\/p><p>This motion also includes students who are performing essential pandemic-related work in hospital settings.  This includes student radiographers, one of whom told me:<\/p> <blockquote> \tEvery student radiographer, while on placement, has been face to face with Covid patients from day one.  The first thing a Covid patient gets done when admitted to hospital is they get a chest X-ray. <\/blockquote>  <p>Every day, our student radiographers go into Covid ICU units to take X-rays and they also take CT scans and assist physicians in ICU units if their assistance is required.  We believe that any student performing pandemic-related work in hospitals during the Covid-19 period should be paid appropriately.<\/p> <p> The initial review commissioned by the Minister falls short of the expectations and needs of student midwives.  Moreover, the Minister chose not to examine the circumstances of other students who work in hospitals.  We need to pay these student workers now.  We need to do it without delay.

It is patronising and demeaning.  What they actually want is fairness and respect.<\/p>  <p>  The situation has not been good in our hospitals in recent years.  That is due to the under-investment not only of this Government but of previous Governments as well.  It has become far worse since Covid-19 - we are all aware of that.<\/p>  <p>  For me and my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in this is an easy and straightforward decision.  It is about fairness and respect.  A sum of &euro;100 is an insult and will not cut it.  Where students are needed to work, they should be paid.  The decision not only lies with the Minister.  There is a responsibility on the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, too.  Ironically, he was the Minister for Health before the current Minister and, of all people, he should know about this situation and should be well aware of it.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot see any more empty promises or delays in respect of this.  I wish to take this opportunity to make a point in respect of the health services.  The staff are exhausted and at breaking point, if they have not already gone past that point.  If our colleague, Deputy David Cullinane, was the Minister for Health, he would ensure that student nurses and midwives were paid.  It is a reality that our hospitals were understaffed badly before the pandemic.  We simply could not function without the valuable work the student nurses and midwives do.  No one wants to put students at risk but the Government has been failing to invest in health, has failed to put in place enough staff and has failed to keep this virus under control as a result.  Throughout the pandemic, student nurses and midwives have been working bravely and tirelessly every day to protect our families and community from Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  I will finish because we are tight on time.  People are sick of talk, promises and claims from those who say they have sympathy and empathy for others.  They really want to see action.

We are in a situation now where Deputy David Cullinane has to bring a motion before the House.  It is the second motion relating to the demand, request and plea that student nurses would get paid for the work they do.<\/p>  <p>  That we are even discussing the motion at all is incredibly disappointing.  That we are discussing it in a week when Government is defending its decision to increase the salary of the Secretary General of the Department of Health to &euro;292,000 per annum shows how perverse Government thinking is.  The proposed salary for Robert Watt marks an increase of &euro;81,000.  That is more than front-line workers get paid in totality.  Let us compare that with the offer that is apparently being made to student nurses of &euro;100 per week for the work they do.  After all the testimony we have heard and the reality they have spelt out to us an offer of &euro;100 per week is insulting, patronising and really sums up this Government.  People may wonder why our newly-qualified nurses are found in every corner of the world and treasured by almost every other health service in the world.  It boils down to one thing: lack of respect.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, defended the proposed increase in Robert Watt's salary by &euro;81,000 to &euro;292,000 per annum.  His logic is incredibly interesting.  He says that this pay hike is in recognition of the unique challenges and significant responsibilities attached to this role.  That spells and sets it out in the clearest possible terms.<\/p> <p>This Government, the Minister and the leaders of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party recognise the unique challenges and very significant responsibilities of bureaucrats and officials but do not recognise the unique challenges and significant responsibilities that have been undertaken by the front line of the front line, our student nurses and midwives.<\/p> <p> I commend the motion to the House, I commend Deputy Cullinane on tabling it and I beg and plead with every Member of the House to stand by those who have stood by us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000005#C00300","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611138000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Can Members imagine getting a pay rise of &euro;81,000?  That is two or three wages for most working families.  It is the amount the new Secretary General of the Department of Health can look forward to.  That is the shocking backdrop to any debate on pay for student nurses and midwives.  Three Ministers went off by themselves, colluded, if you like, ignored existing pay structures and agreed State mechanisms and then decided among themselves that someone earning well over &euro;200,000 was not being paid enough and agreed collectively to give him an increase of &euro;81,000.  At the same time, the Government of these three wise men says student nurses are worth only &euro;100 per week.  The Secretary General's pay rise alone would cover a student nurse for almost 16 years if the Government got its way.<\/p>  <p>  The lack of respect and appreciation this Government has and the Fine Gael-led one before it had for our healthcare workers is staggering.  The Government drove nurses out onto the picket line in 2019 and its attitude has not changed one iota since.  We have a broken system that depends on students stepping into danger to fill the gaps caused by colleagues falling ill to Covid or having to self-isolate.  We have a Government that demonstrates a complete lack of compassion, understanding and gratitude.  Student nurses and midwives should not be seen by the State as cheap or free labour but they are and always have been.  We know it has always been this way but, again, that is no reason to allow an unfair and exploitative system to continue.  If this Government thinks handing a gift of &euro;81,000 to a Secretary General who is already on more than &euro;200,000 is okay and then expects student nurses to survive on &euro;100 a week, then it has a problem and clearly does not live on the same planet as the rest of us.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019 nurses kicked off and went on strike.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, said, \"We are happy to find that money in the Budget because we want to pay our public servants better, but there is a limit to what we can afford.\"  Clearly, he was referring to those on the top of the pile and not to those on the front line who look after our sick and our vulnerable.

It is often said that nursing is a vocation, but this pandemic has proven this much more.  I have been contacted by many student nurses over recent months and the stories I have heard are shocking.  Many student nurses work for free during the day and then work nights and weekends as care staff to pay for their fees and expenses while they are on placement.  While they work in hospitals they might receive up to &euro;50 per week if their placement is far enough away from their university.  This is not enough to cover bus fares and lunches, let alone other expenses.  Our student nurses are burnt out and this Government has the cheek to say they do not do real work.  They have held the hands of the sick, the lonely and, sadly, now, the dying.<\/p>  <p>  I sometimes get anxious when I see the number of cases, which is high at the moment.  Our death toll is particularly high.  Although I have heard many harrowing stories, I can only imagine how anxious those on the front line must feel.  On top of that, they have to worry about passing on the virus to their loved ones, all the while trying to make ends meet.  One student nurse told me recently that while helping a patient to shower, the patient's toe came off in his sock.  The student nurse was on her own and could not leave the patient alone.  She had to finish the patient's shower and then find a nurse to seek help.  I ask the House to imagine that and to imagine she does not get paid for that.  Another student nurse told me how they were left alone, without care staff, to dress and lay out a deceased patient to give the person a little dignity in death.<\/p> <p>The Government thinks that the nurses do not deserve to be paid.  <\/p> <p> Many families have also been in contact and have told me about the difference that our student nurses are making.  One family told me of the lengths to which one of these student nurses went, by staying behind after work to help a patient to unlock a phone SIM card that had somehow become blocked.  The student nurse restored the family's only way of communicating with their father because no visits were allowed and they had not seen their father since he had been recently diagnosed with cancer.  As far as this family is concerned, these nurses are angels.<\/p> <p> Finally, I commend the work of the Muir&iacute;osa Foundation, based in Moore Abbey in Monasterevin in County Kildare.  It has a long and proud history in assisting service users and their families in the area of intellectual disability.  Each year, their students undertake 70 placements.  They and all of our student nurses need proper pay and terms and conditions.  We do not want any more token gestures or false promises.  Enough is enough.  It is time to do the right thing and it is time to pay our student nurses.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all nurses and midwives, and indeed all healthcare workers, for their dedication and commitment as we continue to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  I begin by noting that nursing and midwifery have been graduate professions in Ireland since 2004.  It is important to focus on the benefits of our undergraduate nursing and midwifery programme, which is second to none.  This degree-level programme is run over four academic years and offers the full student experience.  Unlike the UK and other international graduate degree programmes, it includes an internship period with a salary for the final 36 weeks.  The programme supports the optimal learning environment where students actively take part in patient care while building competence throughout each stage of training.<\/p>  <p>  Student placements in our hospitals are a vital part of nursing and midwifery education.  They enable students to develop the practical knowledge, clinical skills and professional behaviours required to attain competence to qualify and be eligible to join the professional register.  As students rather than employees, clinical student placements ensure learning takes place on the front line in a supervised and protected environment.<\/p>  <p>  Student nurses and midwives gain practice experience under the supervision of a registered nurse or midwife.  The move to the graduate programme has created exciting and attractive career opportunities for nurses and midwives.  Graduate training has enabled extended practices and provides the necessary sustained change to operate in advanced and specialist practice roles.  The evidence shows that those opportunities have been seized in the intervening years and this is very much a tribute to all of those involved.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure that every Member of this House will agree that Irish nurses and midwives are internationally sought-after graduates.  This is a testament to the very high standards of the graduate education programme.  I have engaged directly with group directors of nursing and midwifery in the HSE.  I was heartened to see how important student education is to the group directors and how connected they are to the placement sites.  Every site has a joint working group between the higher education institution involved and the placement sites.  There is student representation on these groups.  This allows for feedback so that local issues can be resolved speedily and efficiently.  It also allows for feedback up to the level of group directors, if necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Students also have access to their mentors, to clinical placement co-ordinators and to higher education institution, HEI, personal tutor support throughout the placements.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, a national clinical placement oversight group has been formed to monitor the safe continuation of clinical placements during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The remit of this group involves developing solutions to minimise the impact of any deferrals, delays or suspensions on students' academic progress.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that training for healthcare students during a pandemic is challenging.  Recognising these challenges, I secured additional supports and protections for student nurses and midwives.  This includes specific access to pandemic unemployment payments and additional occupational health supports equal to employees while on clinical placement.  Student nurses and midwives also have access to appropriate training and occupational health support on the sites in which they are learning.<\/p> <p>I was happy to see our student nurses and midwives being vaccinated this week.  They are, of course, included in the priority group.<\/p> <p> To assist student nurses and midwives while on clinical placement, I appointed Professor Tom Collins to carry out an independent review of clinical placement allowances.  I received his report on 31 December.  Its key recommendation is to implement a pandemic placement grant of &euro;100 per week for each supernumerary placement week during the pandemic.  I have accepted the recommendations and I am keen to progress this additional support.  I would also like to see it backdated to the beginning of the academic year, which was last September.<\/p> <p> My Department and I are closely monitoring the Covid-19 situation nationally, including the context of its impact on student nurses and midwives.  The oversight group, with representatives from my Department, the higher education institutes, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, and the HSE, is meeting weekly.  Student representation is included as an important source of feedback on the experience of clinical placements in the current situation.  The primary focus is to ensure that the education of students is safe and protected to support progression.<\/p> <p> Following a request from the HSE on 15 January to release senior qualified staff to provide direct patient care in the current Covid-19 surge, supernumerary clinical placements were suspended for first, second and third year student nurses and midwives for at least two weeks from Monday, 18 January.  The request was directly related to the increasing demand on care and critical care and the requirement at this time to maximise the number of qualified staff available to assist.<\/p> <p> My Department is working with the HSE, the higher education institutes, the NMBI and clinical partners to ensure that students will not be disadvantaged in completing their educational programmes.  I want to protect their status as students and protect their graduate programme, which has delivered many benefits.  This week, we have shown, through the necessary decision to suspend placements, that to protect the educational aspect of placements, we will not allow them to continue when support structures are not in place.<\/p> <p> I do not underestimate the difficulty that student nurses and midwives have experienced in the past ten months.  Without question it has been a difficult time.  In conjunction with the HSE, the higher education institutes, the NMBI and clinical partners, my Department and I will continue to focus on keeping our students safe and ensuring that their academic progress is not unduly impeded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000007#E00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611138900,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I commend my party colleague, Deputy Cullinane, on tabling this motion.

Medical scientists have performed heroics during Covid-19 and they have done it while delivering an uninterrupted routine and emergency service 24-7, 365 days a year.  Despite this heroic effort, a headline in the media less than a week ago announced the threat of strike action from this group of workers.  The chairperson of their union said the last thing any medical scientist wants is to be forced into this situation.<\/p>  <p>  Laboratory services are hanging on by a thread.  Medical scientists want recognition of their qualification, ability and contribution.  I outlined this to the Minister before.  All have degrees and many have masters degrees as standard.  Others go further and do PhDs or take the fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists, FRC, path, largely for their own personal development.  The truth is that the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and their respective Ministers ensure a glass ceiling is imposed.  Fifteen years into a 40-year career, they say a person can go no further.  There is no opportunity for career progression and, as a result, significant potential goes untapped.  While colleagues in Britain and elsewhere are taking on senior clinical and academic responsibilities up to and including consultant grade, medical scientists here are stymied.  To add insult to injury, medical scientists have lived with the disrespect of pay inequality for decades.  They work side by side doing the exact same work as clinical biochemists but are paid less.

We have systemic understaffing in the health service.  This predates Covid, but Covid has exacerbated the difficulty.  Nowhere is this problem more evident than in my local hospital, University Hospital Limerick, UHL, in the constituency of Limerick City.  Twice so far in 2021 we have had 66 patients being treated on hospital trolleys and at no stage this year has the trolley number fallen below 35.  The pre-existing staffing and capacity issues at the hospital are compounded by the absence of staff who have been forced to isolate for Covid reasons.  We wish them well in their recovery and isolation periods.<\/p>  <p>  In UHL, like in many hospitals throughout the State, it is the student nurses who have stepped into the breach.  They have stepped up.  They have truly entered the bearna baoil.  They have been brave.  Since the start of the pandemic, the work they have done has gone beyond their educational requirements.  To be fair, these nurses are filling the gaps in the health service and they are doing it for no pay.  I have had the opportunity to speak to hospital staff and they are in no doubt about the important function the student nurses have served.  The feedback I received is that the behaviour and performance of the students in general has been exemplary.<\/p>  <p>  The frightening post-Christmas rise in infection has put significant pressure on staff in the health service.  Healthcare staff are exhausted, both physically and mentally.  We must be cognisant of the mental strain this pandemic is putting them under.<\/p> <p>Due to the need for visitor restrictions, it is nurses and student nurses who are now the only human contact that patients have.  This is a heavy burden for pre-graduate personnel to carry.<br\/><br\/>This is what the family of one student nurse had to say to me:<\/p><blockquote>\tMy daughter is on a Covid ward.  Because of staff shortages, [she] and two other staff members were on the ward alone.  She was assigned over ten Covid patients.  She has been working long hours.  She tells me the hospital has been wonderful to her but given the risks she is exposed to, she feels she should be paid the healthcare assistant rate at the very least. <\/blockquote> <p>These students have answered Ireland's call but now it is time for us to answer their call.  It is time to pay these people for the work they do.  A payment of &euro;100 per week for clinical placement during the Covid-19 pandemic is clearly not enough.  The applause and appreciation we offer is important but it is simply not enough either.  Our appreciation of their work and the risks they face must be shown in a more tangible way.  We can offer those students that tangible recognition.<br\/><br\/>The healthcare assistant arrangement from the start of the pandemic can and should be reinstated to ensure students are appropriately paid for their work on the front line during the pandemic.  The opportunity to do this is now.  The next generation of health professionals is watching and if the Minister wants them to work in our health service when this pandemic ends, we need to treat them with respect and give them deserved pay now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000009#G00300","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611139800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>It has been said here that we describe our front-line health workers as heroes and they have done absolutely heroic work, and nobody would deny that.

I particularly notice accusations from the Opposition and his own Government Members that are not truthful and that could be extremely frustrating for the Minister.  I heard a Member from the Opposition state we are at the bottom of the European table when it comes to vaccination, which is not true, and a Member from the Government - the Minister's own party - stated that vaccinations are only happening from Monday to Friday, and again that is not true.  I know that in the Minister's position, he must battle through many political accusations and misinformation.<\/p>  <p>  However, I know if the Minister were standing where I am now, he would make the exact speech I am about to make.  I know if he were still in his role as part of the Opposition, he would not find any way to justify the treatment of student nurses and midwives.  I know he would rail against it.  I know he would connect the new pay deal for the Secretary General at the Department of Health with this matter.  I know he would probably pick up the speech the Minister would have just made and dismiss it out of hand as being tone deaf to the reality of the work being done by those who are putting their health and lives at risk.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister does not need to be reminded of this but I will do so anyway.  Yesterday, 93 people were recorded as having died from this virus.<\/p> <p>The youngest was 41 years of age, and yet student nurses and midwives are working in this scenario for poverty pay.<\/p> <p> My Labour Party colleague, Senator Hoey, has published a Bill, the intent of which is to link the pay of student nurses and midwives to the rate paid to healthcare assistants in recognition of the increased workload and risk.  The INMO has also called for healthcare assistant contracts for all students whose placements were suspended and clarity on what will happen to placements over the coming months.  The Minister mentioned his own review, but as the INMO has stated, it is quite clear that this review is out of date and is not going to cut it.  It is not good enough.  The Minister would not accept it if he was in my position, and the student nurses and midwives should not accept it either.  They need to be paid at the healthcare assistant rate to reflect the higher levels of risk in the health service, as proposed in the Labour Party Bill.<\/p> <p> There are other outstanding issues that need to be addressed, including the fact that nurses are being asked to pay for the privilege of renewing their membership of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, for 2021.  I put it to the Minister quite baldly that we are all being told that we are in this together, that all of the old received wisdom and legacies are being challenged, and that there is nothing that will not be done to address the situation, but that patently is not true.<\/p> <p> I wish that student nurses and midwives had the same power as other lobby groups who seem to be able to influence Government policy.  I wish they had the same power as the hospitality industry and that they had the ability to change completely the methodology and mechanisms being used by the Government to address this problem.  I wish the Minister had bent the advice he got from within his Department to facilitate student nurses as he did to facilitate hospitality and home visits simultaneously in December.  I wish that student nurses and midwives had the same power as the private hospital sector, which seems to be a sacred cow in this country and one that must be pussyfooted around.  Robust engagement with that sector seems to be impossible for some reason.<\/p> <p> Apparently people like me, standing where I stand, just do not understand the complexity of the situation, how delicate and difficult it is or the fact that it is not at all simple.  However, when it comes to student nurses and midwives, the Department conducts a review, which is already out of date, and recommends a payment of &euro;100 which it believes will suffice.  At the same time the Department believes that the new Secretary General of the Department of Health is fully worth an extra &euro;81,000.  None of this adds up.<\/p> <p> The problem here, as far as the Irish public is concerned, is that there is a deep unfairness at the heart of all of this.  When it comes down to it, for those on the front line who are putting their own health and lives at risk as well as the health and lives of their families, there is a barrier or a line which the Government will not cross, unless it involves rounds of applause.<\/p> <p> I know that the Minister for Health would be saying the very same thing if he was standing where I am standing now.  I have some advice for him from his friends and colleagues in the Labour Party.  I suggest that he thinks of the speech he would make if he was still an Opposition health spokesperson.<\/p> <p>I suggest that he realise the depth of feeling regarding this issue within hospitals and healthcare settings and among student nurses themselves.  I ask him to reflect on how embittered people are and on the length of time for which this issue will affect their mindsets as they look forward to a career in this area.  I also ask him to reflect on the amount of money this would actually cost in the overall scheme of things.  I ask him to reflect on how he can justify the pay increase of &euro;81,000 for the Secretary General of the Department of Health and on the reasons he has given for this increase, which include that the job is difficult, high-powered and responsible.  Reflecting on that, he might consider how those superlatives and adjectives might apply to the role of the student nurses and midwives who are asking to be paid and how they will have to register this year and pay for that privilege.  I ask him to reflect on all these matters.<\/p> <p> I know, as the Minister knows, that these things are not simple and that it would take some manoeuvring and action on his part but, if anything has been proven over the course of this pandemic it is that if Government really wants to do something it can do it.  What I learned from my time in government is that, when a group is important and strong enough and when the political will is strong enough, anything can be achieved.  The problem is that the will is just not there.  Perhaps this is because departmental officials are advising the Minister that this may set an unwanted precedent and that it may open a Pandora's box that it would not be possible to close but, in the fullness of time when this pandemic is over, this will be a black mark on the Minister's own record and that of the Government.  It will be felt that when it came down to it these people were just not worth more than &euro;100.  If the Minister was standing where I am, he would be saying the exact same thing.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party supports this motion.  We have not just been drafting motions, but have published legislation.  We want these payments to be given so that these people can have the dignity they deserve and we want the Minister to live up to the rhetoric he used in opposition now that he is in his current position.  I ask him not to stand behind speeches which he would have decried if he were standing where I am.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000010#H00300","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611140400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Over the weekend, I heard a Minister talk on the radio about how we all need to be on team Ireland during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many young people, however, will feel that they have effectively been left off that team.  The pandemic has impacted everyone but the disproportionate effect on young people has not been discussed properly.  It has led to cancelled plans and deferred dreams and has caused increased isolation.  Young people feel abandoned by the Government.  Ministers seem to take hardly any interest in the issues affecting teenagers, young adults, renters and new parents.  Of particular relevance to this generation is the absence of a meaningful mental health response to deal with the fallout of the pandemic but neither has there been any meaningful preparation to deal with the unemployment crisis which many young people will face after it.  The hospitality and arts sectors are major employers for young people, especially in rural areas, but for almost a year now this vital source of not only income, but professional experience has been denied to them.  This Government refuses to take young people into consideration.  Instead, it lurches from crisis to crisis with no emphasis on, or empathy for, our young people.<\/p>  <p>  The treatment of student nurses, midwives, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, radiographers and others is a glaring example of the Government's utter indifference.  It is proof of its disregard for the worth of young people.  The Taoiseach has argued that student nurses should not get paid because, in fact, they should not have been working in the first place, when we all know that student nurses are on the front line of the front line.  The same goes for midwives, therapists and other healthcare workers who are performing vital services for all of us, including the elderly and those in need of care.<\/p> <p>This type of comment effectively gaslighted our student nurses by denying them the realities of their own experience.  A Taoiseach who tells them that the work they are doing is not real work is deliberately and intentionally not listening, but it should not be a surprise because this is a Government which has effectively gaslighted an entire generation.<\/p> <p> I come from the generation who came of age during the financial crash.  We know what it is like to have our plans dashed and to see our neighbours, our friends and our loved ones scattered across the world.  Every generation in Ireland has had to face an emigration crisis and every time, we as a country have lost the ideas, passion and energy of the young people who depart.<\/p> <p> Even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the cracks had appeared.  It is very clear that the Government expects young people to accept a standard of living which is not as good as their parents.  It believes that they should expect no better than what is on offer, that perpetual renting and uncertain tenancy is a norm, that the precarity of the gig economy is a good thing and that childcare which is more expensive than a mortgage is acceptable.  That is the gaslighting of a generation.<\/p> <p> However, things are changing.  Our young people want more than the Government is willing to offer.  They want more than rounds of applause.  They want a society where they can have a future.  Will the Government condemn another generation to emigration, or will it take action?  Will it agree today to pay the student nurses, midwives, therapists and others as workers?  Will it take meaningful action to address the looming unemployment crisis?  What will the Government do to ensure that our healthcare graduates, whom we need to run the health service, will get jobs here?  Are we just training more staff for the British NHS, Canada, or Australia?<\/p> <p> We need change.  Young people are demanding change.  The pandemic is a time for change.  There is a growing sense of solidarity.  Large numbers of people who are not student nurses support their cause.  On issues we are now confronting as a society, such as mother and baby homes, direct provision and climate change, young people no longer want to see matters being brushed under the carpet, ignored or treated with indifference.  This is the generation that is seeking justice, not just for themselves but for everybody.  They are more connected, more passionate and more active.  The Government would be wise to catch up.  It should listen to the student nurses, midwives and others, who have so brilliantly driven this campaign, and pay them properly.  The Government also needs to listen to leaving cert students, climate campaigners and new parents.<\/p> <p> I previously outlined to the House some of the crucial work that our student nurses and midwives are doing on the front line.  Today, I am saying to student radiologists, therapists, midwives and nurses that they do not need to prove themselves again.  The case has been made, and they have made it crystal clear.  If anyone sitting here today does not get it and does not support them, it is because they are choosing not to listen.<\/p> <p> We are now back to where we were last March, and the Government needs to bring our student nurses and others who are working in hospitals back to where they were last March as a bare minimum.  We need certainty for students in healthcare on their placements, and we need contracts as healthcare assistants for these students.  I remind Ministers who are making tributes to the work of healthcare students that they cannot eat tributes, buy clothes with empty words or save up on empty platitudes.<\/p> <p> I pay tribute to the nurses and other healthcare staff throughout the country who have campaigned, lobbied and fought for their rights.  They have refused to be silent.  They know their own worth and they know their own value.  The Government needs to step up now, treat them not with platitudes but with respect, and pay them properly.  Young people are watching the Government and its actions will be remembered.  There is still time to do the right thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000012#K00200","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611140700,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Paul Murphy and Barry.<\/p><p>Last week the victims of the mother and baby home scandal were insulted.  The insult centred on the Government's refusal to value the direct testimony of those victims and instead to follow an official narrative from institutions.  This week we have the same pattern of insulting the student nurses and midwives, refusing to listen to their direct testimony and instead listening to the official and, quite honestly, dishonest narrative that it is getting from the health authorities about what they do.<\/p><p>Hundreds of student nurses had their testimonies read out and circulated all over social media.<\/p> <p>They attended meetings where they spelled out what was happening in detail.  People Before Profit brought a motion last year calling for the payment of student nurses and midwives.  The Minister for Health simply dismissed that testimony.  The testimony continues to come in, however.  It explains, sometimes in shocking and graphic detail, the work the student nurses and midwives do, the risks they take and the pivotal role they play and have always played - not just during the Covid-19 crisis - in making up for chronic staff shortages and working during their placements.  Instead of acknowledging and respecting that testimony, the Government insults those student nurses and midwives by suggesting that it is protecting their education.<\/p> <p> To be honest, I nearly choked when I heard the Minister speaking again about protecting their education and referring to the \"full student experience\".  How can the Minister trot out those phrases again?  For student nurses and midwives, the \"full student experience\" is paying fees of &euro;3,000, or &euro;7,000 in some cases, for the privilege of working on the front line of our health services.  That is even more the case in these dire conditions of the pandemic, when they are playing a critical role in helping us to combat the virus.  The Minister, because he was forced, then offered them a miserable &euro;2.50 an hour for the work they do, in the same week that he bumped up the salary of Secretary General of the Department of Health from &euro;210,000 to &euro;290,000.<\/p> <p> It is shameful and an insult on so many different levels.  It is an insult to women.  I do not believe it is a coincidence that this involves a mostly female profession.  It is an insult to students to treat them in this way.  It is also an insult to young people, as Deputy Cairns said, 70% of whom have said that they are seriously considering leaving the profession, and many will leave after their training because they are treated so badly.  They are treated badly as students, and then they will also be treated badly when they come to work in the health service.  Nurses are being made to work free hours in the form of the Croke Park hours, when they are fighting to protect all our lives on the front line.  The Minister offers these student nurses and midwives an allowance that will not even pay their bus fares or parking costs, in most cases.  It is an absolute insult.<\/p> <p> I disagree with Deputy Cullinane when he says that he does not want to fundamentally change the structure of nurse training.  We need to do that to stop the drain of talented nurses and midwives out of this country that is happening now.  In Britain, the Government was forced to acknowledge that it needed to pay student nurses &pound;10,000 a year because of the drain of nurses out of the NHS and out of Britain.  We should be doing that too.  When the Minister says it is not possible to pay the student nurses and midwives and for them to have a degree, as I pointed out to him last week construction engineers get paid &euro;12 an hour for doing their degrees.  Student paramedics get paid, in some cases, &euro;28,000 a year for doing their degrees.  It can be done, therefore, and it should be done.  Fees should also be abolished, not just for the student nurses and midwives, but for all students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000013#L00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611141300,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I am old enough to remember a month and a half ago when all Government Deputies united to vote down our motion to pay the student nurses and midwives.

We had reports on that aspect of the matter from the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael parliamentary parties, but I am not sure if we got one from the Green Party.  My constituency colleague and Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, is reported to have said at the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting that even die-hard Fine Gael members believed that what the Government had done was \"nasty and mean\".  I am sure the same was said at the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting.<\/p>  <p>I have a bit of advice for Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party Deputies, and especially for those who suggested that in some way the decision the last time was a mistake.  If they do not want to be seen as a nasty and mean Government then do not vote in nasty and mean ways.  Vote to pay the student nurses instead of not paying them.  Last March the Government accepted that student nurses deserved to be paid &euro;14 per hour for their work, but now they are being told to live on &euro;100 a week.  How can that be justified?  If anything, their work is even more dangerous and difficult during the current peak.  There are 4,500 student nurses and midwives working day in and day out to keep our hospitals from collapse.  They have had to give up their other part-time jobs to protect patients.  How on earth does the Government expect them to pay their bills and cover their rent with &euro;100 per week?<\/p> <p> It is worth contrasting the treatment of the student nurses with the position of the Secretary General of the Department of Health who is getting a raise of nearly &euro;90,000 per year while student nurses are expected to be happy with &euro;100 per week.  It sums up this Government of the rich for the rich.  The Government has said that student nurses should be praised but not paid, applauded but not rewarded.  According to the Government, nursing is a vocation, a good deed, and that this is a reward in itself.  It is clear, however, that the Government does not take the same attitude to itself.  The Government is not happy with claps or a vocation or pats on the back for itself.

Last weekend there was the death of a nurse in a Kilkenny nursing home.  With all of this going on, the Minister has decided that fourth year students, who are mostly female and young, should risk their lives and health to go into wards in hospitals that are raging with Covid-19 and that they should be paid less than &euro;10 per hour and less than the minimum wage.  I do not carefully watch the psychology or personality of Government Members, but insofar as I have a sense of the way the Minister for Health projects himself, I often get the impression that he is a chap who is sometimes rather pleased with himself.  I hope the Minister is pleased with this decision.  Young workers, who are in the main women, are getting less than &euro;10 per hour in hospitals that are ravaged with Covid.

We all remember when, just before Christmas, the Government voted against paying student nurses and the wave of disappointment and anger that rolled across the country the days after the vote.  Young student nurses, some with their faces still bearing the marks of the face masks they wore on 12-hour shifts, looked at their TV screens as Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party votes, one after another, torpedoed their chance of getting paid.<\/p>  <p>  Numbered among those who voted against student nurses getting paid was the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, who back in March had issued a press statement saying they would get paid.  It is one thing not to pay student nurses and to make them work on the front line without pay in extremely hazardous conditions in daily fear of their health and that of their parents and grandparents at home, but it is another cruelty entirely to promise to pay them and then to come into this Chamber and vote against it, just as the Minister, Deputy Harris, did before Christmas.<\/p> <p>For any student nurses or midwives watching this debate, I will outline exactly why they have not been paid yet.  There are 72 of us in this Chamber who want to pay them but there are 77 Members of this House, namely, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Deputies, who do not want to pay them.  They should learn the names of these 77 Deputies and repay their arrogance and greed at the ballot box in the next election.<\/p> <p> We in Aont&uacute; have been speaking to many students on the front lines and it has been incredibly moving to witness the selflessness of their work.  They will not strike, simply because they do not want that to result in their patients suffering or dying.  When they phone me, they spend the majority of the phone call expressing concern for their patients.  They tell me of the wards on which they are working and of the heartache of seeing patients take a bad turn.  They tell me of ringing the bell looking for senior staff to help them and coming to the realisation that there are very few senior staff on that ward to do so.  When student nurses and midwives get talking to a Deputy on the phone, the priority of their conversation is the welfare of the vulnerable.  It is only at the very end of the conversation that they turn to the economic circumstances they are in.  These are ordinary men and women - mostly women - around the country who are doing extraordinary things for us.<\/p> <p> When Deputy Harris was Minister for Health, he wasted billions of euro in overspend on the black hole that is called the national children's hospital.  Many other Ministers wasted billions in overspend on broadband, and millions were spent on the D&aacute;il printer and on faulty PPE that is now deemed unusable.  We should compare and contrast this issue with the Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party proposal to increase the salary of the Department of Health's Secretary General by &euro;81,000.  That is not &euro;81,000 as a full salary but as an increase on top of a salary of about &euro;210,000.  That means there is an income inequality in this situation of 55:1.  The new Secretary General will earn 55 times the income of student nurses and student staff on the front lines of our hospitals in the most critical health crisis this country has ever witnessed.  Annually, the Minister for Health earns 34 times the income of a student nurse working on the front line.  Many people watching this debate will feel that ratio should be reversed if fairness was in place.  If the Minister realised or experienced for one minute what student nurses are enduring mentally, physically and psychologically on a daily basis, he would not be putting forward the amendment he is bringing before this House today.  That amendment has the objective of destroying the opportunity of paying student nurses and student midwives a proper wage.  I ask the Minister, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party to cut out the cheap words and the patronising hand-clapping and actually to pay student nurses and student midwives what they are entitled to, which they are earning every day in the service of the people of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000015#N00300","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611141900,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak.  I thank the Members who brought this motion to the House and in the main, I fully support it.  Student nurses and midwives must be treated fairly, with respect and above all, with dignity.  Student nurses and midwives who are working on the front line are no different to other essential workers on the front line and this has never been more apparent than during the current pandemic.  The bottom line is that they are front-line workers and as such, must be treated as front-line workers in all aspects, including that of pay.  In other industries, apprentices in professions like those of electrician and plumber are paid as they train.  A fourth-year apprentice electrician or plumber is paid 80% of the full rate of pay.  Student nurses, at the very least, deserve to be treated in the same manner.  We can all stand here in the D&aacute;il and applaud them, which I know the healthcare sector appreciates, but we must also stand up and demand they are treated fairly.  This is not happening at present and I challenge anyone in this House to prove otherwise.  Words are cheap and it is actions that matter.<\/p> <p>The Government must stand up and be counted on this issue.  Without further delay, it must introduce measures to ensure that our student nurses and midwives are treated fairly.  These students nurses are already paying substantial fees if they do not qualify for grants.  They also must pay for their accommodation during placements, along with any travel expenses.  To cap it all off, they have been asked to pay a &euro;100 registration fee for the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland because they have gone to the front line to help prevent the health system from collapsing during the Covid pandemic.  This Government must get real and support our student nurses.<\/p> <p> Looking at this another way, the Government could be accused of exploiting cheap labour under the current scheme.  As has been said before in this House, there is no other way of describing this.  It is a case of cheap labour being used to carry out essential front-line healthcare.  Let us look at the facts.  Student nurses work on average 15 weeks per year for the first three years of their degree.  These student nurses on clinical placements receive an allowance of &euro;50.75 per week.  It should be noted that student nurses who are not on clinical placement receive nothing.  I put it to the Government that the allowance granted to those who are fortunate enough to receive it does not even cover the cost of travel expenses, never mind the cost of tuition fees and accommodation costs.  Yet these student nurses have been put directly on the front line during the past 12 months while we have been fighting this terrible pandemic.  Let us be clear.  Student nurses and midwives are being asked to fill essential roles in our health system at this most critical time.  The very least we owe these wonderful people is that they be treated equally as other members of their profession.  An apprentice electrician or plumber is entitled to a rate of pay that is 80% of a fully qualified tradesman.  Surely the very least a student nurse or midwife deserves is to be treated the same as an apprentice tradesperson.<\/p> <p> I have spoken to many student nurses over the past six to eight months and the message is clear: they are at breaking point and feel that they are not being treated fairly or with due respect.  The bottom line is that they are working beyond what is normal for student nurses.  They are in fact working as full-time nurses.  It is also not surprising that not one of the student nurses whom I spoke to has considered leaving the profession.  They are not in it for the money.  They have a genuine passion for their work and want to help people to the best of their ability.  Many can only continue to study with the help of their families and friends.  That is disgraceful in this day and age.<\/p> <p> The Minister thanked all nurses, midwives and healthcare workers for their dedication and commitment as we continue to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.  He noted that Irish nurses and midwives are internationally sought-after graduates and are included in the priority group for vaccination.  The student nurses and midwives need the support of the Minister now, more than ever.  I fully support any measures that will ensure that our student nurses and midwives are treated fairly and with proper respect during their studies. Surely this is not much to ask for, considering the heroic efforts these students have made to keep our health service from collapsing during the greatest crisis that this country has ever experienced.  I ask the Government to support our student nurses and midwives at a time when they need it most.  When I speak of supporting them, I mean that they should be treated in same manner as their peers in other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000016#O00200","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611142200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak in support of this motion.  I know that the student nurses have been exploited to a large extent during this pandemic.  They have had to work long shifts, some up to 13 hours a day, and have been exposed to traumatic scenes in the hospitals, including treating seriously ill patients and comforting the dying and their families.  Despite all that, these student nurses were not paid.<\/p>  <p>  Student nurses work amid a tsunami and are utterly under-resourced.  Meanwhile, the Government has approved an &euro;81,000 salary top-up for the new head of the Department of Health.  Surely that extravagant increase could have been set aside for a number of years so that the Government could look after the student nurses first.  It was reported that the Minister was bringing a proposal to Cabinet to pay GPs and pharmacists &euro;60 per Covid vaccine administered.  If this is the case, the total cost of the roll out of the vaccine to 1.5 million citizens via pharmacies and primary care centres would be a staggering &euro;91 million.  The &euro;60 per dose payment is over 400% higher than the &euro;14.15 paid per two shots administered in the UK.  Why is the payment to GPs and pharmacists here four times higher here for exactly the same job?  The point I am making here is that money can be found for everyone but the student nurses.<\/p>  <p>  The abuse of these students continues right through their years of studying.  I was contacted by a fourth year general nursing student who was due to start their internship recently.  They told me that at the start of the pandemic, the Government increased the wage of nursing interns to &euro;14.10 per hour, and rightly so.  However, they were told recently that because the pandemic was apparently under control, their wages were being cut to &euro;10.60 per hour.  Good God, it is clear that the pandemic is far from under control at the moment.  Even worse, these nurses were going to work in hospitals at the forefront of this crisis.  They were appointed because many of the other nurses were absent due to Covid-related issues.  It is only fair that they are paid the correct wage for putting themselves on the front line.  These students are more than willing to play their part for the health service and the people.  They are just looking for a fair wage for doing so.<\/p>  <p>  The treatment of those at the forefront of our health service must be looked at closely.  Those working in home help services in west Cork are calling door to door to look after those who desperately need help.  These home helps, whether they are from Schull, Castletownbere, right through to Dunmanway, Clonakilty, Bandon or Ballinadee, need to be respected, by being offered the vaccine immediately, or they should at least know the exact date on which they will be offered the vaccine.  At the moment, they go from door to door, putting themselves and the patients they care for so professionally at risk.  I urge the Minister to let us know today in the House when these home helps are going to be offered the vaccine. They are probably as at risk as doctors and nurses, or even at greater risk, as they are on the move every day in carrying out their duties.  The student nurses should be treated in a just and fair way when working on the front line during the Covid-19 pandemic.  They should receive a just rate of pay per hour.  The recommended rate of pay of &euro;100 per week is nothing but an insult to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000017#P00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1611142200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I note that the Minister has left the Chamber.  With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, this happens all the time when my group speaks.  She is not interested in what we have to say.<\/p>  <p>  I am interested in the humanity of it.  The Government does not respect nurses in general, let alone the student nurses.  We saw Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party voting down a motion to pay and recognise the gallant work done by those angels of mercy.  We are so fortunate to have those young ladies and gentlemen who go into the profession of nursing.  It is a noble profession in Ireland.  The Taoiseach has told us about how a new model and system for training nurses has been set up.  I wonder if it is any better than when we had matrons.  I do not think it is.  Nonetheless, this Government does not respect nurses.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has returned.  He is welcome.  I withdraw my remark.  He is back and I hope he listens to us.  He has a habit of leaving when our group speaks, as do the other Ministers.  It is yet another insult.  If they insult elected Members of Parliament, why would they not insult the nurses?  We have seen what has happened with Mr. Watt, the new interim Secretary General of the Department of Health.  He has been given a pay rise of &euro;81,000 a year, bringing his salary to almost &euro;300,000.  We have seen what has happened with the procurement scandal which has been going on day in, day out, especially during the pandemic.  Procurement contracts have been handed out without tendering.  Contractors can pay what they like.  We have faulty PPE and so much other stuff.  We have seen the mess, scandal and black hole that is the children's hospital and that may never rise out of the ashes.  The Minister was happy to go along with it, even though he voiced criticism of it when he was in opposition.  However, he would not vote against it and support our motions.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have behaved recklessly towards the health service.<\/p>  <p>  Student nurses have been mistreated.  It is an unbelievable scandal.  A good friend of mine, Niamh, is a student nurse on placement in Sligo.  She has gone into every situation in the Covid crisis, as they all have.  The have gone to the front line to help out and to work, despite the hours, the pressure, the danger and the risk.  As other speakers have said, they have often done this without senior members of staff to help them, because some of them have been on sick leave or have been self-isolating.  It is a crisis.  We can deal with everything by throwing billions of euro at it, yet we cannot pay the student nurses.  I believe in the saying \"mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh siad\".  Praise the young people and they will come with us and work with us.  The Government wants to stamp down on them, persecute them and show its disdain for them.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Watt has been given a pay rise of &euro;81,000 in the middle of a pandemic, when he does not have such a good record coming from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  One would wonder what he has to offer here.  It is nothing personal.  There is money to appoint three extra super-junior Ministers.  There is money for everything, but not for the student nurses, nurses, or front-line workers in any shape or form.  The Minister and the Minister of State should hang their heads in shame.  Look what has been done to St. Brigid's Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir.  It is on the Minister of State's doorstep.  It is shameful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000017#P00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1611142200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>First, I thank Sinn F&eacute;in and its Members for bringing forward this very important motion on the pay, or lack of it, of student nurses and midwives.<\/p> <p>I want, first, to acknowledge the work they have been doing.  However, in keeping with what I have continually said in this Chamber, I do not want praise for these people who are doing excellent work; I want them to be paid.  One of the most insulting things was when front-line workers saw politicians and others standing up and applauding them.  That was ridiculous.  It was actually an insult because what the Government should be doing is paying people for their work, not praising them.<\/p> <p> My office is inundated with this issue at present, which is being brought to us by student nurses and their families.  To think of the workload and burden that is being placed upon them, while, at the same time, the Department, Minister and Government do not see fit to pay them for the work they are doing, is unbelievable.  At a time when we are struggling and when we need people to work with us, it is outrageous that they cannot be paid fairly, honestly and properly.  Is it any wonder that young people, when they get their qualifications, look at going abroad because they see the possibility of a better way of life and they see governments, departments and politicians elsewhere willing to accept that they have worked and put effort into their education and getting qualified?  Here in this country, they will not be paid for that.  They will go abroad, we will lose all that talent and I am very sorry about that.

Young boys and girls, when they choose to become a nurse, see it as more than a career.  It is a vocation for them and they deserve fairness and respect.  A payment of &euro;100 for a young nurse when his or her work is so demanding is not fair.  We hear stories that many of them have to choose between the bus fare or food.  That is not right and we cannot allow it to continue.  Other tradespeople, including plumbers, plasterers, mechanics and electricians, all get paid as apprentices.  We see what student nurses have to go through, working with all the different health problems patients present with, including cancer, heart problems, respiratory problems and people who are broken up and mangled after an accident.  It must be very traumatic for those young nurses to see people dying in their arms.  They have to go home and keep all of that within themselves because confidentiality does not allow them to discuss their job or their work with family members or other people.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleading with the Minister and the Government to ensure that fairness will apply.  The &euro;100 the Minister is thinking of giving student nurses is not adequate.  He will have to stand up to the mark and pay these people for doing the very important work they are doing on our behalf, especially during the Covid crisis, and the sacrifices they are making and have made on behalf of each and every one of us.

I also thank the People Before Profit Members who brought a Bill before us on 2 December last.  On both occasions, and particularly today, the Government speeches utterly failed to deal with the proposals that were presented.  I cannot imagine how one could disagree with the motion that is before us today.  What is the problem with publishing the Collins review immediately, as is proposed?  The motion also proposes that the March agreement be reinstated while the Covid crisis lasts.  I am not sure what the problem is with that.  I understand that the Collins review, part of which was leaked, makes the same recommendation.  How could one disagree with the proposal to advance the second review urgently?  The motion further proposes that the second review be expanded to ascertain the extent to which students performing their work are doing extra work.  How could one possible disagree with that?  If the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, disagrees with it, I cannot understand how the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, would not take a different view given the gender of the people we are talking about, a factor with which we are very familiar.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister talked once again today, as he did in the speech he gave on the previous occasion, about the exciting and attractive career that is nursing.  He used his time to talk about that but he did not address at all the despair, despondence and disgust felt by nurses in our hospitals.  The message from the Government from day one of the Covid crisis was that we were all in this together.  I welcomed that message.  Indeed, the Government did well in rolling out supports for businesses and unemployed people.  That gave the message that we were all in it together and it gave a sense of solidarity.  That has gone completely.  It went in the way that the Government dealt with the nursing homes and direct provision facilities.  We knew then that we were no longer in it together and that some were more important than others.<\/p>  <p>  That has really been brought into focus this week and last with the news that the salary of the new Secretary General of the Department of Health, which is currently held as an interim role, will be increased by &euro;81,000, as referred to by other speakers.  Really and truly, what kind of message is that to give out when we are all in this together?  The nurses certainly are being treated utterly differently.  This week, we learned that GPs are going to be paid a set fee for rolling out the vaccines.  Interestingly, they will be paid more than pharmacists for doing so.  That is a reflection of the market.  I understood we were changing all of that in terms of the market, learning from the Covid crisis and learning how important society is.  I understood there would be transformative change.  There has been no transformative change.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the nurses, particularly the student nurses, and how they have been treated, they have put forward very basic requests.  They are an essential part of the health service, as are all the other nurses and doctors.  So too are the cleaners and porters.  However, we have seen from the vaccines roll-out that some healthcare workers are treated differently.  We have seen family members of doctors, in one instance, getting the vaccine before anybody else.  That particular doctor apologised and that is welcome, but I am not sure why he is apologising.  He made a very considered decision on the night in question in the absence of information from the Government.  I am not sure of the nature of that apology.<\/p>  <p>  The figures are astounding in terms of people on waiting lists.  Galway is a disaster zone.  I want to put that on the record.  In 2017, two theatres were leaking.  One was re-established and the other was not, and here we are in 2021.  The figures for orthopaedics are nothing short of shocking.  People are waiting one year, two years, three years or four years to get a first appointment, not to mention surgery.  All of that was known to the Minister because he was in opposition at the time and he was fully familiar with the figures.  He knows the nurses went out on strike in 2019.  He knows we had one of the worst performances in Europe in terms of capacity for beds and services.  We knew all of that.  The epidemic, which became a pandemic, came on top of that inadequate service.<\/p>  <p>  I am really tired of the speeches telling us that this or that has been done.  They are the most basic things that would have to be done in a pandemic.  We are looking for transformative action.  Today, however, we a are simply looking for a recognition of what the student nurses have done on behalf of all of us.  I was one of those who stood up and clapped for our health service staff.  I have said publicly that I am ashamed of that clapping.  I did it because I felt they needed a clap but what they really need is action.  We do not need any more reflection, as the Labour Party has asked for.  We need action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000018#Q00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1611142800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak briefly on the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion regarding pay for student nurses and midwives.  The Covid-19 crisis has shone a spotlight on our health service and front-line workers.  Last year, we had a number of debates and discussions on the issue of the pay and conditions of student nurses and midwives, who have been putting their lives on the line during this unprecedented global pandemic.  On 10 December 2020, the T&aacute;naiste said during Leaders' Questions:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI do think that student nurses should be paid where they are acting up, filling in for staff nurses or doing the work of staff nurses because wards or clinical areas are understaffed. <\/blockquote> <p>During oral parliamentary questions on the same date, in answer to a question from Deputy Gino Kenny on the cancellation of supervision for student placements, the Minister said that during the first surge of Covid-19 it was not possible to facilitate student placements from April onwards.  This was due to the redeployment of staff, including senior nurses who would ordinarily be supervising the students.  There was a particularly high rate of absenteeism and the directors of nursing in the HSE said they could not ensure clinical placements were protected.  There were fears hospitals could be over-run.  At the time, there were up to 900 Covid-19 patients in hospitals.  Thankfully, the situation improved and, as of Sunday, 6 December, there were 232 patients in hospital.  It is now 20 January 2021 and we are still in the grip of our expected third wave of the pandemic.  On Monday of this week the number of people in hospitals with Covid-19 surpassed 2,000 with almost 200 in intensive care units throughout the country.  There have been reports that approximately 7,000 healthcare workers were out of work due to Covid-19 and that people who were asymptomatic but identified as close contacts were told to come back to work in hospitals.  The situation is far more dire than it was last year.  Maybe the Minister will use that as an excuse for the supervision of student nurses to be curtailed as well as the rise in numbers.<\/p> <p> The expression \"all in this together\" has been the mantra for the Government since the start of this unprecedented pandemic in March last year.  However, \"all in this together\" has been found to have a hollow ring to it.  As the business lobbyists pushed for the economy to be reopened despite ongoing health risks to the public, to our most vulnerable and to front-line workers, the Government ignored the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team prior to Christmas.  Ireland is now being used as a cautionary tale internationally for valuing business over health services and the health of the public.<\/p> <p> The Government commissioned two reviews into the pay of student nurses and midwives.  The form of this Government is to leak information before allowing for proper debate, scrutiny or discussion.  We first heard about the recommendations of the review on pay for placements during the Covid-19 pandemic carried out by Dr. Tom Collins on RT&Eacute;, where we see all business done in respect of the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> In the meantime, there are over 4,500 student nurses and midwives completing clinical placements that require them to work 12-hour shifts per day for no pay.  The Government is reportedly to offer &euro;100 per week payment based on this review.  How can the Opposition, unions and interested parties examine this recommendation when we have not seen the review?<\/p> <p> People putting their lives on the line might be given a &euro;100 per week payment.  At the same time, as has been said previously, the new Secretary General of the Department of Health is reportedly receiving a &euro;81,000 pay rise, increasing the salary for this position to &euro;292,000.  Who sanctioned this?  Where did this idea come from?  Why is it being pursued when Mr. Watt has already been working as Secretary General in the interim?  The Department said it was a highly complex role with a challenging brief, especially in the midst of a global pandemic.  Was this increase requested as part of the contract negotiations?  We need to know that.<\/p> <p> Has the Secretary General of the Department been involved in the vaccination strategy?  This week has seen reports of family members of hospital management, construction workers and others receiving leftover vaccinations.  What involvement has the Secretary General and the Department had in the vaccination strategies?<\/p> <p> I am also wondering about the &euro;14.1 million paid out to a company called Roqu for ventilators from China that have not been and will not be used - a waste of vital resources.  The T&aacute;naiste talked recently about all these ventilators and said we have them but we do not have the personnel to use them.  Was the T&aacute;naiste referring to a warehouse full of usable ventilators?  I understand that globally we have been experiencing an unprecedented pandemic, but it is amazing that such money can be found when deemed necessary within this Government.<\/p> <p> While major pay increases are being discussed at Cabinet, like the Tories, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il last year encouraged the public to clap for our healthcare workers.  Applause will not pay rent, put food on the table or pay for transport to and from work.  Maybe the Minister could ask his landlord friends whether they would accept bualadh bos in lieu of the rent from their tenants who are student nurses and midwives.  Rather than simply and simplistically applauding our front-line staff, we must support, appreciate and value our workers and listen to the unions.  I saw a tweet the other day stating that Ireland responded more coherently to the Covid-19 pandemic at the start when we had no Government.  The consistent undermining of people from within Government ranks has shown the public that we are most certainly not all in this together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000018#Q00400","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611143400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>It is clear from the debate this morning that Members across the House share the gratitude to, and have paid extraordinary tribute to, student nurses and midwives and all their healthcare colleagues who have provided, and continue to provide, care across the entire service.  The Government will not be opposing this motion.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to offer my deepest sympathies to everyone who has lost a loved one.  In particular my thoughts are with the families of the 93 people whose deaths were notified yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that Irish nurse and midwife graduates are in great demand worldwide.  As we have heard today, the main reason for this is our four-year degree programme.  As the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, stated earlier, the graduate education approach these programmes offer to our student nurses and midwives is a hands-on learning approach as students.  An essential part of their learning and the approach to building their skills is actively taking part in patient care.  Clinical placement learning is on a supernumerary basis for years 1 to 3 and the first part of year 4.  The placements of between eight and 15 weeks in each year of the programme cover the wide variety of clinical environments students need to learn in.  The clinical placement in the fourth and final year of study is through an internship paid placement.  This unique learning period focuses on the assimilation of skills, knowledge and professional behaviours learned over the programme to enable the critical thinking and decision-making required to be a nurse or midwife.  In addition, an important element of this clinical placement is the built-in four-hour period of reflective learning per week for the student to reflect on the placement.  Clinical placement for all student nurses and midwives is the clinical learning environment in which they gain, incrementally, the practical experience, necessary skills and professional behaviours required to become members of the nursing and midwifery professions.<\/p>  <p>  Members will be aware that this clinical placement education time comprises 50% of the student nurse and midwife undergraduate programme.  This significant proportion of learning time is prescribed by an EU directive and translated into the education and training standards and requirements by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  Maintaining a student's supernumerary status and offering the full student experience to achieve these standards is a proven success factor of all the nursing and midwifery programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Members will be aware that due to the current pressures on the health service as a result of the latest surge of Covid-19, in particular on critical care, a decision was made to suspend all supernumerary clinical placements for first to third year nursing and midwifery students.  This suspension is for a period of at least two weeks from 18 January 2021.  This was a necessary decision and, as with so many decisions in managing care through a pandemic, it was in immediate response to the particular clinical care demands at the time and the requirement for qualified staff.<\/p>  <p>  It is regrettable that placements had to be suspended.  We are aware it will cause an unavoidable temporary delay and inconvenience for many nursing and midwifery students.  The staff who support student placements are experienced and have the skills and knowledge to support the current surge requirements.  The Department is currently working with the HSE, the higher education institutes, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland and clinical partners to ensure students affected by the decision to suspend clinical placements will not be disadvantaged in the completion of their educational programmes on time.<\/p>  <p>  The clinical oversight group in place since the beginning of the pandemic will continue to review the impacts of Covid-19 on the provision of clinical placements.  This group will be an important part of supporting the safe reintroduction of supernumerary placements as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2020, following the first surge, when all placements for all healthcare students, not only nurses and midwives, were suspended, clinical placements for all nursing and midwifery students were fully reinstated.  As the Minister for Health explained earlier, while Covid-19 continues to impact our communities and health services, each surge has impacted on the students' clinical placement education differently.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to this current surge, additional supports had been put in place for students to assist them in maintaining their clinical placements and continuing this key part of their learning.  The additional supports are in recognition that there are additional demands on students due to Covid-19 and the need to comply with public health requirements.  Such demands may include getting additional and alternative modes of travel to and from placement locations, finding alternative accommodation in some instances and making changes to living arrangements.<\/p> <p>I will outline the relevant supports in a moment.<\/p> <p> All healthcare workers have access to PPE, training and occupational health supports.  Students are also fully supervised on placement by qualified staff with the skills and knowledge to support their safety in the clinical environment.  There has been ongoing engagement between health sector management, the student nurses and midwives and their representatives unions, and this continues, including with the oversight group.  Maintaining student nurses and midwives on their education programmes and protecting their student status remains a priority.  I wish to reiterate the supports currently available to student nurses and midwives.  They include access to the pandemic unemployment payment for those students who may have lost part-time employment due to Covid-19.  This is a specific exemption the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, secured for our student nurses and midwives.  The supports also include enhanced illness benefit for those students who work part-time but who have fallen ill due to Covid-19.  The accommodation allowance of &euro;50 per week towards alternative accommodation while on placement in clinical sites away from the base hospital is maintained.  Additional travel expenses associated with clinical placements are also reimbursed.  Other welfare schemes to assist with financial hardship due to illness, subject to qualifying criteria, include the supplementary welfare allowance and the urgent needs payment.  There is also access for eligible students to the national access plan and the student assistance fund.  There is a &euro;250 top-up for those in receipt of the SUSI grant or a &euro;250 contribution to fees for eligible students.<\/p> <p> We have heard the Minister tell us that in order to ensure supports were in place for student nurses and midwives while on clinical placement during this time, he appointed Professor Tom Collins to carry out a short-term independent review of clinical placement allowances.  He received this report on 31 December 2020.  The key recommendation in the report is to implement a pandemic placement grant of &euro;100 per week for each supernumerary placement week during the pandemic.  This is on top of the supports in place for all clinical placements and the additional supports referred to a moment ago.  The Minister has accepted the recommendations and is keen to progress the implementation of this additional support.  In addition, the Minister has committed to a longer-term review of allowances for student nurse and midwife placements and work on this is due to commence.<\/p> <p> The collective feedback we have heard from the students, the clinical placement support staff, the group directors of nursing and the heads of school in the higher institutes of education reflect the investment by the profession in educating their students and the importance to them all of supporting the education programme.  We have also heard the challenges outlined, the difficulties and, in particular, the impact the pandemic is having on students and their education.  The variety of supports in place, financial and non-financial, to continue to support students at this time remain under review to ensure safety and maintenance of the learning environment.<\/p> <p> I again commend the student nurses and midwives on their commitment to continuing their education to becoming nurses and midwives.  The pandemic has shown us all the importance of having a highly trained, highly skilled and adaptable health workforce.  Supporting our students to continue their education, protecting the graduate programme and maintaining their student status to do so remains a priority for the Government, the Minister and the professions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000019#R00200","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611144000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Towards the end of last year I asked the Minister for Health the number of unpaid hours worked by our student nurses and midwives since the outbreak of the Covid virus here.  I also requested a breakdown of the percentage of student nurses who worked in Covid-19-related care and for his views as to why so many feel so unappreciated that they opt to work abroad.  The response indicated the Government's policy of downplaying the contribution these healthcare workers make towards our understaffed and under-resourced health services.  Instead of answering these questions, the Minister opted to hide behind a comment on how reviews on nursing and midwifery were taking place.  At the time I suggested that if the true extent of their contribution to keeping the poorly resourced health services afloat were clarified, the Government would be admitting to its own failure.<\/p>  <p>  Today I want the Minister to hear the reality of what he tried to ignore.  These are the words of a nurse who was working as a fourth year intern during the first wave: \"I will either emigrate or return to college because it is not worth working as a nurse in this country because the government does not value my work nor my health.\"  We know that students have been performing pandemic-related work with others, filling either staffing gaps or related work as part of placements in hospitals.  As I speak there are seven fourth year students in South Tipperary General Hospital doing clinical placements.  We are now demanding clarity on this and the extent to which it is beyond the requirements of their degree and that they are appropriately compensated.  With this in mind, the Collins review of student nurse and midwife pay during the pandemic must be published immediately.  Hiding behind unpublished reports in order to avoid acknowledging the long hours and the physical and emotionally draining work with which they are faced ends now.  The decision to pay students lies with the Minister for Health.  Suggesting they be paid &euro;100 per week is an insult to those who are playing a vital role in keeping our health system functioning.  This penny-pinching does not apply to the Department of Health Secretary General, for whom the Government has sanctioned an &euro;81,000 pay rise.<\/p>  <p>  To provide some context, I wish to return to the nurse to whom I referred earlier.  She spoke of how she was paid even after having contracted Covid-19: \"For all of that, I got nothing,\" she said.  \"An allowance of &euro;50 per week and a travel allowance of 25 cents a mile paid two months after placement finished or, if you lived close by, nothing at all.\"  The Minister can address this and must do so now.  Vaccines started to be made available in Nenagh hospital after the staff shamed the Government into getting the programme running properly.  That is an example of how an unacceptable situation can be resolved if the political will is there.  This is why we are demanding an immediate assurance is given that the March pay agreement returns in order to pay fourth year interns at the healthcare assistant rate, to allow first to third years work on temporary healthcare assistant contracts and to ensure that those who do not take up temporary healthcare assistant roles are paid a fair intern allowance which recognises the work they do on placement.  The Covid crisis does not wait for the Government to act; neither should our student nurses and midwives.  I call on everybody here to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000020#S00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1611144000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Many stories will be told in the coming years about 2020 and 2021.  This pandemic is a time of fierce challenges, loss and sadness.  We must not, however, let it go down in the annals as a time of unfairness and inequality.  I ask the House to imagine how we will be judged by future generations if we do not help the very people who put their lives at risk for our sake and theirs.  Instead we turned our backs and refused to help them with a small financial reward and suspended placement.  This is what the Government is doing by failing to pay student nurses and midwives.  It is entirely unacceptable.  The 18 students on placement in Wexford General Hospital and the other 4,000 deserve better.  Throughout this pandemic student nurses and midwives have worked hard and tirelessly every day to protect our families and communities from Covid-19 while coping with a healthcare service hampered by years and years of austerity cuts.  These problems are down to chronic underinvestment that began long before this pandemic and illustrate the type of pressured environment in which our student nurses, midwives and radiographers are coping.  It is no wonder we have a recruitment and retention crisis and so many of our young nurses and midwives emigrate to Australia, New Zealand and Canada.<\/p>  <p>  Let us remember too those on the front line who have paid the ultimate price.  Only this week we have had the death from Covid-19 of a nurse in County Wexford.  Our thoughts are first and foremost with his wife and young child.  We cannot imagine the grief they are going through.  Anyone who took the time to read the way he was spoken about in the local media reports will see he was a much-loved and respected family man.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot lose sight of what our people are facing out there and the truly unimaginable suffering and loss.  This is why we are putting forward Deputy Cullinane's motion today.  The public are ahead of the Government.  They are calling for our student nurses and midwives, who are giving everything they have in this most unequal contest, to be paid for their work. It is not too late for the Government to change the chartered course in order that we can look back and say that at least we properly paid those on the front line for the personal sacrifices they made to protect us all.  The Minister should not forget that we will all be remembered by the tracks we leave behind.  I urge all Deputies in the House, including my fellow Deputies from Wexford, to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000020#S00300","speaker":"1621"},{"type":"speech","time":1611144000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I will finish where I started my first contribution by again reading to the Minister some of the first-hand testimonies I have received.  When I read them out I want him to bear in mind that I have spoken to hundreds of student nurses and midwives directly.<\/p> <p>I am not sure how many the Minister has spoken to.  The following are some of these accounts and the first reads:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn three weeks, I will find myself yet again in a ward rampant with Covid and severely understaffed for nothing.  I left a paid job because I could not put my children at risk of having no one to take care of them if I got sick and now I am being asked to do so for &euro;3 a week.  Miche&aacute;l Martin wants to talk about real work and how we should pull up anyone expecting us to do anything on our own.  Well, as you already know, the healthcare system would be even more on its knees without the free work of student nurses and it is not fair. <\/blockquote> <p>A second contribution reads:<\/p><blockquote>\tWe are highly insulted by the proposed &euro;100 weekly payment that has been proposed as payment for our time on placement.  As we work 31 hours per week this payment equates the value of our work as being worth &euro;3.22 an hour.  It only adds further insult to injury.  This does not equate adequate pay for adequate work. <\/blockquote> <p>A third student said:<\/p><blockquote>\tIt is important to progress as a country in order to keep the already lack of healthcare staff we have from becoming an even more critical crisis.  Most of the people I know are refusing to stay in this State once they are qualified, which means once the nurses who are working now retire, most of the younger generation of nurses will have no choice but to leave if we are not treated fairly. <\/blockquote> <p>The final contribution was a plea from someone who said:<\/p><blockquote>\tI love my job.  I always have and I always will.  I love being there for people during those dark and difficult times in their lives.  I love being able to care for and to look after the sick and frightened people.  It is a blessing and I feel privileged.  It truly shocks me how our Government and our Minister for Health still think it is acceptable to deprive an adequate allowance and a fair wage for those interns, and those first, second, and third years. <\/blockquote> <p>That is what I am hearing first hand from student nurses and midwives.  <br\/><br\/>A previous Taoiseach and a previous Minister for Health once described the Department of Health as Angola.  It has always been seen by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael as a poisoned chalice.  The reason for that is that none of them are interested in building a world-class public health service, a free and equal health service so that people can be treated fair and equally, a national health service.  I have a message for the Minister.  I do not see the health service as Angola or as a poisoned chalice.  I see it as a unique opportunity to transform healthcare in this State and to build a much better, decent, world-class and egalitarian health service.  If the Minister and the parties in government are not in the business of building that health service or do not want to treat those on the front line with respect, then I ask them to move over and to leave it to somebody who does want to do that job.  <br\/><br\/>I have already said to the Minister, and I say it again in speaking directly to all of those wonderful student nurses and midwives that I have spoken to who are hugely talented people, our country is in safe hands when one listens to what they are telling us of their experiences and what they want to do in our healthcare system.  They will not be here to do it, however, if the Minister does not act.  They will emigrate.  Listen to this message and pay them.  The Minister said he would support this motion.  I ask him then to go further than that and to meet with the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, with SIPTU and with others and resolve this issue now.  With the stroke of a pen the Minister can do this.  There should be no more excuses, hiding behind reports or talk.  People want to see us act.<br\/><br\/>The Minister and his party have an opportunity today to deliver and to be the Minister for Health who speaks directly to those student nurses and midwives and tells them that they are respected, valued, wanted and paid fairly and reasonably for the work they do during their internships and placements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000020#S00400","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1611144600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1611144600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1611144900,"counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000022#U00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1611144900,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Due to the limited time that we have, I appeal to Members to adhere to Standing Orders and the times allowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000022#U00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1611144900,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I extend my thoughts and sympathies to the families of the 93 people whose deaths from Covid-19 were reported yesterday and to all those who have been bereaved in the course of this pandemic.  We are living through what are difficult times for many families.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has abandoned plans to reopen special education schools and facilities this week.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, has twice promised that they would reopen.  She has twice failed to deliver.  The promises have fallen apart due to Government incompetence.  The Minister's approach in the media over the past 24 hours of finger pointing and seeking to scapegoat SNAs and teachers is fooling no one.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone wants to see children and young people with additional needs back at school.  That has been and remains a shared objective because they are the cohort of students that missed out most when schools closed in the spring.  The regression that was experienced by many as a result of the loss of their supports and routines was alarming.  It caused incredible distress to them and their parents.  Now, these children and young people are losing out again and their parents are distressed once more.<\/p>  <p>  The responsibility for this mess lies squarely with the Government.  It told anyone who cared to listen that education during the pandemic was a priority, yet it has failed to put together anything resembling a plan B.  No thought was given to how education would continue if schools had to close due to high rates of infection.  Such a plan B could have been, and should have been, on the shelf, having been discussed with all stakeholders - unions, management bodies, students and parents.  The Government has had since August to put in place these contingencies.<\/p>  <p>  By the way, special education is up and running in the North and across Europe.  People are left wondering how and why it is that the same cannot happen here.  The truth is that, instead of being prepared, the Government scrambled at the last minute to put together a plan.  It fell apart because there had been no consultation and the Government sought to bounce stakeholders.  The Government has a tendency to dictate policy by press release.  We saw the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, racing to gazump each other in the media.  That approach has resulted in serious implications for children and young people and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister now claims that her plan collapsed because of bad faith.  Let me tell the House what bad faith is.  It was bad faith to give these children, as she did, the impression that they would be back in school when the work was not done to ensure that schools were safe and all the people involved in delivering the plan were on board.  All of this happened because the Minister made a big promise and has not done the work to deliver it.<\/p>  <p>  Children with special educational needs should be priority No. 1 in education.  They should be the first back into the classroom, but that must happen on the basis of agreement and of ensuring that schools and staff are safe.  The talks that I hope are ongoing today need to take some serious shape now.  SNAs and teachers want to be back in school.  I recall clearly how, in September, they moved heaven and earth to get their classes open again with little notice.  The Taoiseach might advise the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, that comparing these professionals - teachers, SNAs and others - to mother and baby homes is not just crass and clueless, but a vain attempt to shift blame.<\/p>  <p>  The truth is the outstanding concerns have to be addressed.  The other truth is this cannot go on forever.  We need to see a result.  We cannot allow this to drift into the general reopening of schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000022#U00300","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1611144900,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

It illustrates the extraordinarily devastating impact that the virus has had on our entire society and community.<\/p>  <p>  May I also take the opportunity briefly on behalf of the Government and on behalf of the Oireachtas to wish President-elect Joe Biden the very, very best as he begins his journey as President of the United States?  He is a very loyal friend to Ireland and has made no secret of that affection for this country.  We look forward to welcoming him to Ireland during his Presidency.<\/p>  <p>  It is with regret that I heard Deputy McDonald's contribution.  I think it is overly partisan.  It is overly political.  It seeks to attack the Minister and the Government for seeking to work in good faith with all the partners in education to provide for children with special needs and their families.  When we closed all schools at once, the Government took the decision originally not to reopen schools because we did not want 1 million people on the move, given the very high level of community transmission of the virus and the high levels of it in our community, but we wanted to provide for children with special needs.  Everyone in the House did.  I can quote every Deputy, and every spokesperson, saying we must do something to provide for children with special needs and that it cannot be all closures and no openings.  Some Deputies suggested that maybe we could open on alternate days or particular parts of the week and that we needed to make some provision.  The Government worked in good faith to do that.  I can go back through what Deputy McDonald and other Deputies said during the first lockdown in terms of the necessity of having schools open for children with special needs.  Everyone commented after the first lockdown on the degree of regression and the very negative impact on families.  That idea or principle was shared by the education partners on good faith as well.<\/p>  <p>  It is absolutely untrue to say there was no consultation.  I just do not understand how Deputy McDonald can stand up and say something like that.  It was just so untrue and it illustrates that this is a partisan political attack by Deputy McDonald, not a helpful or constructive approach to this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I can go through it.  Even last week on the public airwaves, the general secretary of the INTO said there would definitely be schools open this week and there would be members of the INTO and F&oacute;rsa in the schools.  I think he said that in good faith.  I think the leadership of the unions genuinely wanted and were anxious to try to get some provision for children with special needs.  There has been an extraordinary degree of consultation on public health.  That the webinar saw up to 14,000 or more participating illustrates the concerns and interest out there and the genuine contribution of many special needs assistants and teachers across the country.  My sense of it is that there is a real and genuine anxiety out there.  Notwithstanding the sharing of the objective of opening schools for special needs children, the wherewithal was not there to get a critical mass back into our schools right now.  That is my sense of it without apportioning blame to anybody, but I can go through all the quotes.  I can go through all the meetings that have taken place between the Department and the education partners.<\/p> <p>I can go through all of the responses-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000022#U00600","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611145500,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.

Schools reopened in September through partnership involving the parents, the unions, the Department and the Minister, and with a lot of resources provided by the Government.  It was a successful reopening from September to Christmas.  Public health played a very significant role in that, in particular Dr. Kevin Kelleher and Dr. Abigail Collins from the HSE, who were available every week to consult with leadership teams in education in respect of public health guidance and responses.

I also join the Taoiseach in congratulating, if I may say, one of our own in becoming President of the United States on his inauguration today.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party is attempting to de-escalate the tensions that have been involved in the special education issue.  We do not feel at this point that it is going to benefit anybody to point the finger, to blame or to join the attempt to create division between special education teachers, SNAs and parents.  However, I put it to the Taoiseach that it is now time for him to get involved because it is clear that the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, have lost control of the situation.<\/p>  <p>  We were quite supportive of the Minister and the Minister of State in investigating the possibility of reopening schools, as the Taoiseach rightly said, for certain cohorts.  We believe that the closing of schools is a profoundly negative thing to happen to children and it profoundly negatively affects the most vulnerable children, including those with additional needs and those in areas of disadvantage as well.  However, from the start of this year, 6 January, an announcement was made on school reopening with no consultation.  The Taoiseach should please not make liars of trade union leaders who say that they were not consulted about the flat announcement on 6 January.  On 14 January, another announcement was made, before an education debate in this House, on the reopening of special schools and special classes.  Again, there was no agreement.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 January, at 8 o'clock on a Friday evening, a letter was sent to every school in the country on the reopening of special schools.  Again, there was no agreement.  Even since last night, we had an extremely ill-advised communication from the Department, with quotes from both Ministers, pointing fingers all over the place.  Both unions issued a joint communication saying that they were still at the table and willing to talk.  Comments from the Minister, Deputy Foley, this morning, suggested that comments made about one of the union leaders was disingenuous.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, made a comparison between this situation and the mother and baby homes, and last week she made a comment about non-SNA students being normal.<\/p>  <p>  We have been doing our best as a political entity to try to be constructive.  In the spirit of being constructive, could I ask the Taoiseach if his office would get centrally involved in this situation?  Does he appreciate the severity of the situation and how dangerous it is for young people to be out of school for this length of time?  Does he recognise that the entire reopening of schools is now in jeopardy because of the bad faith that has been shown by Ministers in their public comments?

I believe the Minister, Deputy Foley, has successfully led the reopening of schools in September to the Christmas period, and did so in partnership with management bodies, the teacher unions, the unions of special needs assistants, the representative body of students, and all of the stakeholders in education.  It worked very well.  There was a strong underpinning of that by the public health advice from the Health Service Executive dealing with the many anxieties various school communities had.  It must be said that 75% of all schools in the country did not need to avail of public health support during that period.  That said, it must be acknowledged that there is a very high level of community transmission right now and we are in a different phase of this pandemic in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  It is not fair to say there has been no consultation.  There has been extensive consultation between the Minister, Department officials, the unions and the representative bodies.  Last week, various spokespersons were of the view that we would be in a position to open schools on 21 January.  This was said publicly by some of the union representatives.  Comments have been made about the Minister, which do not stack up, in terms of this being a rushed decision.  It was not.  What emerged on Friday was a shared agreement on the guidance framework.<\/p> <p>If we reflect on the webinar, with perhaps 16,000 people participating, what does it show?  It illustrates the genuine anxiety out there among quite a number of the workforce, and we must take that on board.  It has filtered its way through to the representative organisations as well and a reassessment from their perspective and a recalibration of their approach.<\/p> <p> I accept that we need to go forward on a shared basis.  The Minister for Education will lead that with her Department and continue the engagement.  I know that today the Minister, Deputy Foley, is meeting many of the groups representing the children with special needs and their families.  I take the Deputy's point that we must not allow divisive fallout from this involving those who provide education services and look after children, including various interest groups.  We must stand back from that.  One of the most effective things we can do now, given my observations, is for all of us to do as much as we can collectively to get down community transmission.  We are on the right pathway that way and in the next while, it might give us an opportunity to re-engage effectively and get the outcome that everybody in the House desires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000023#V01700","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611146100,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Taoiseach's response but he underestimates the damage that has been done in public commentary by the Minister and Minister of State.

It is responsible for hundreds of tragic deaths and these tragedies were avoidable.<\/p>  <p>  On 26 November, NPHET wrote to the Government and stated, unambiguously, \"NPHET therefore recommends that the hospitality sector remain closed ... over the eight-week period\".  The Government broke with that advice under the pressure of business lobbying and decided to open pubs and restaurants.  At the time I said this was a recipe for seeding the virus across Dublin for a couple of weeks and then spreading it throughout the country.  The Taoiseach ignored me and other socialist Deputies.  Most important, he ignored the public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  With cases then clearly out of control, Dr. Tony Holohan wrote to the Government on 21 December, calling for measures as set out in level 5, including the closure of retail.  On 23 December, after a NPHET meeting, he wrote again, calling for the \"full suite\" of level 5 measures to be introduced.  It was not until 31 December that retail was finally closed.<\/p>  <p>  The question is whether the Government will learn any lessons from the disastrous and deadly mistakes it has made so far.  Will it finally abandon its failed living with Covid strategy which has resulted in yo-yo lockdowns?  Instead of delivering us a fourth and fifth lockdown before we have sufficiency vaccination, will the Government seek to ensure this is the final lockdown by implementing a zero Covid strategy to eliminate community transmission while investing in finding, testing, tracing and isolating to deal quickly with any cases that occur?<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach agree to ban non-essential travel to Ireland and implement a 14-day mandatory quarantine for those people who must travel here, with all the appropriate safeguards?  Preventing the import of the virus has been a crucial approach of those countries that have successfully implemented zero Covid strategies.  It is especially important now, given the different strains of the virus.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach ensure the recommendation that workers who can work from home are allowed to do so is actually implemented?  We have very many reports of workers who are not being allowed to work from home by their employers.  When they contacted the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, about it, they were told this is at the employer's discretion.  This is simply not good enough.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the HSA must be empowered to enforce working from home, and employers who refuse to allow their employees to work from home should be fined?<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach take action to close the loopholes in the list of essential services, which means that many workplaces closed in the first lockdown have been open in this third lockdown?  An example is the national car test centres.  I speak particularly about non-essential construction sites, including Intel at Leixlip, that continue to open and put workers in danger.  I wrote to the Taoiseach about that on 8 January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000024#W00400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1611146100,"counter":82,"content":"<p>On the zero Covid approach, the Deputy has been very clear that the advice of NPHET should be followed, and the advice of NPHET and the Chief Medical Officer has been consistently against a zero Covid approach on the basis that they do not think it practical or that it could work.  The most recent discussion on that was between Deputy Boyd Barrett and the Chief Medical Officer at the leaders' briefing that we had the week before last on the Covid strategy in general.<\/p>  <p>  I have been very clear and open on the specific strategy I believe we should adopt.  I do not believe in the herd immunity approach, for example, and I think no one in the House does.  I also said I did not believe we could achieve a zero Covid strategy and deliver it.  Even now, in the context of dealing with Covid, the situation in Northern Ireland is problematic.  For example, even when we banned flights from the UK to the Republic of Ireland, people flew into Belfast.  The prospect of sealing the Border between the North and the Republic of Ireland is not a reality or something anyone has suggested we should do.  It would be the only realistic way of having a zero Covid strategy.  Alternatively, there could be a two-island approach between the UK and Ireland.  We are so integrated into the EU and UK economies that there are practical considerations around the application of a zero Covid strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has followed, broadly speaking, NPHET advice from the get-go.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Ireland has been in a phase of restrictions with different levels of severity from the beginning, except for the summer months.  That is the reality.  The Deputy spoke about his correspondence, and I am open to a full evaluation of all of this, from the beginning to the end of the pandemic, when it is over.<\/p> <p>My absolute priority now is to focus on managing and dealing with the impact of Covid-19 on our society, our hospitals and our critical care systems, as well as on the vaccination programme, which is the light at the end of the tunnel.  That programme will enable us to get back to some normality towards the latter part of this year.<\/p> <p> The extraordinary levels that we witnessed over the Christmas period, with 6,000 new cases per day, were not predicted by anybody.  Even the letter quoted by the Deputy makes it clear, based on the modelling, that if the R number was maintained at 1.2 the numbers would remain low but if it went above 1.4, we would exceed 400 cases per day in January 2021.  The letter also says that threshold would be reached sooner if we started with higher case numbers.  The letter also refers to the UK SAGE evidence on hospitality in terms of reducing the R number by between 0.1 and 0.2, which accords with our national data, and points out that the prevention of mixing between households might have an equivalent effect on the R number.  We decided not to have mixing of households from 1 to 18 December which everybody forgets.  To suggest that the problem was hospitality alone is to miss the other elements relevant to this particular wave of the pandemic.  Seasonality was a factor, as was the new variant.  Undoubtedly, socialisation was a factor as we moved into level 3 from a six-week lockdown at level 5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000024#W00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611146700,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I find the defence that nobody said it would be this bad to be bizarre.  It is like saying, when one's mother tells one not to put one's hand into the fire, \"Mummy, you just told me I would burn my hand; you did not say my whole body would burn\".  The Government was warned about what would happen.  It is simply not true to say that the Government broadly followed NPHET's advice.  The Government broke from that advice in October when it refused to go into lockdown and the T&aacute;naiste set out to undermine NPHET publicly.  It also broke from the advice in a very serious way at the start of December when NPHET said it should not open the pubs and restaurants but the Government proceeded to do so.  The Government also broke from NPHET's advice close to Christmas, when the team recommended the closing of retail but the Government failed to do so.<\/p>  <p>  On the zero-Covid strategy, my understanding of what Dr. Holohan said to Deputy Boyd Barrett at the meeting is that NPHET would like to see the elimination of the virus and if we could pursue that, it would be excellent but he did not believe it was politically feasible.  On 4 August, NPHET wrote to the Government pointing out that the team had previously recommended mandatory quarantine for all passengers travelling to Ireland from overseas and that this remained NPHET's preferred recommendation.  NPHET has been arguing for mandatory quarantine but the Taoiseach did not answer the questions I posed on that and on workers working from home.  Current traffic levels are way above those seen in the first lockdown.  What is going to be done about it?  Are employers going to be allowed to flout the laws or will there be enforcement of the rules?  The Taoiseach should not hide behind the North when he is not even in favour of a zero-Covid strategy.  Such a strategy can be implemented even without agreement with the North, although it would be better with such agreement.  The starting point is to agree it here, argue for it and then argue for it in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000025#X00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1611146700,"counter":85,"content":"<p>All workers who can work from home should do so and all employers should facilitate that.

He said very clearly, and repeatedly, that the practicality of going to a zero-Covid strategy was something that he could not see.  That has been the consistent position for quite some time, if not since the onset of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  People are adhering to this lockdown but the Deputy makes a very important point.  Irrespective of what restrictions are in place, whether on households or particular sectors, adherence to the guidelines is key.  There were many superspreader events that had nothing at all to do with hospitality, although hospitality had a few too, no question.  There is a need for all of us to adhere to the guidelines.  Thankfully people are doing so and the numbers are coming down but with the UK variant, the issue will be how low they can fall.

She co-ordinates a large team of nurses and carers.  The professional services they provide make it possible for elderly and often terminally ill patients to remain in their homes rather than being admitted to hospital or to a nursing home.  These community-based workers carry out their work alone, without the assistance of other professionals.  Not only do they care for patients, but they also provide support and guidance to family members.  Their work is invaluable but these highly committed workers feel totally abandoned.  The nature of their everyday work takes them from house to house.  Increasingly they are faced with cases of Covid-19.  Numerous times each day nurses and carers have to put on PPE gear in their cars or in house porches.  It has become impossible for them to get back-up support from other medical services.  If a housebound patient displays Covid-19 symptoms and requires a test, it can take up to seven days for paramedics to arrive to carry out that test.  Family members are instantly quarantined in the house or forbidden to enter if they live elsewhere, yet the community nurses and carers must continue to visit, provide care to the patient and support their families.  As it stands, these private-company nurses and carers have not been notified of when they will be vaccinated and neither have the hundreds of family carers in every county across the country.  These are front-line workers in every sense, except when it comes to vaccination.  Community healthcare would collapse without these people and they must be protected as a matter of urgency.  Older people living at home are terrified.  They have heard nothing from their doctors about when they will be vaccinated.  Family carers and those who provide home help feel forgotten.  Residents in sheltered housing at Sue Ryder House in Holycross and Nenagh remain vulnerable.  It is imperative that these people be given the same level of priority as those living in nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  To counteract this destructive virus, which has caused havoc, we need a deliberate, calculated and co-ordinated plan to vaccinate as much of the population as possible in the shortest possible timeframe.  This is the most urgent and crucial task to be undertaken since the foundation of the State.  It is a major project but the roll-out of the vaccine lacks scale and ambition.  We are in the midst of a national crisis or emergency which is having a disastrous effect on our society and economy.  Restrictions and lockdowns give only temporary relief.  The policy of suppressing and containing the virus has failed in Ireland and across Europe.  We need to break the cycle of opening and closing and the only lasting solution is inoculation.  However, there are already serious doubts and reservations about our vaccine roll-out programme.  Many people are concerned that the vaccine programme is sluggish.  While we can now be more confident about vaccine supply, big questions remain around the number of vaccinators available.  The projected time it will take to vaccinate 70% of the population is deeply disturbing to many people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000025#X00400","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1611146700,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue but I assure him that there is no need for people not to have confidence in the vaccination programme.  It will be very comprehensive and will be ramped up as further vaccines are authorised and made available to us.  The only limiting factor at the moment is the supply of vaccines.  The only significant volumes we have received to date are from Pfizer BioNTech, which have enabled us to prioritise front-line healthcare workers and residents and staff of long-term care facilities.  That will be the priority up to the weekend.  By Sunday, all staff and residents in nursing homes and long-term care facilities will have been vaccinated with their first dose, as well as potentially up to 70,000 front-line healthcare workers.  My understanding is that we have received approximately 152,000 vaccines and by next Sunday, 142,000 of those will have been administered.  We are literally getting the vaccines out as we get them in to the country.<\/p>  <p>  We have a much more comprehensive and detailed plan for ramping up the volume of vaccinations in the next phase, particularly after the authorisation by the European Medicines Agency of the AstraZeneca vaccine which, all going well, should be on 29 January, with delivery expected in mid-February.<\/p> <p>This will be followed by the Janssen vaccine, which we expect to be authorised a month later.  We will also be getting more supplies from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.  There will, therefore, be a very significant ramping-up.  The Deputy has correctly identified the workforce issues.  GPs and pharmacies are now ready to distribute the AstraZeneca vaccine and others.  We are also working to expand that workforce so there can be a full national campaign to vaccinate the nation as soon as possible.  The Deputy should be in no doubt about that.  The workers he has represented and whose concerns he has articulated are on the front line, particularly in home care settings.  I will feed his comments back to the national task force.  We take advice on clinical priorities from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, which is headed by Dr. Karina Butler, and from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  It is on the basis of this advice that we decide the sequencing and priority of those who are to get the vaccine.  The evidence base suggests that the existing vaccines reduce illness and mortality.  It is necessary to vaccinate the eldest and most vulnerable in our society, as well as those on the front line.  If we do that, we will reduce mortality, risk and illness.

We need to assemble a task force of vaccinators.  We need to recruit outside the obvious circle and build a national team to dispense the vaccine.  We need a battalion of vaccinators working around the clock.  We need to utilise community centres in every town and parish as vaccination centres.  If people are asked to turn up for appointments during the night, so be it.  They should get the jab and get the job done.

We therefore have to ask whether they have time to be central to the campaign.  I welcome the agreement reached with the pharmacists.  Has the Government considered using the resources of the Army, particularly its medical resources?  Has it considered inviting all retired doctors and nurses to answer the call?

The Taoiseach must wake up and take serious action to ramp up the vaccinations because that is what is needed at this time and no more lockdowns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000029#BB01500","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1611148800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>We are in the middle of a global pandemic and the virus is wreaking devastation on many industries, on many sectors and on society at large.

In the four and a half years since the decision was taken in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, there has been no guarantee that a future-oriented agreement would be reached.  The intervening years have been bruising and uncertain.  For Ireland, Brexit has been and is an unequivocal negative.  It has caused considerable disruption and upheaval.  While the Government led efforts to prepare for what was to come, it was difficult to do so against a background where a no-deal outcome on the future relationship remained a very real possibility.  The withdrawal agreement reached in November 2019 meant that at least the United Kingdom's departure would take place in an orderly way.  It provided certainty to European Union citizens living in the United Kingdom and their United Kingdom counterparts living throughout the European Union.  It settled the financial terms on which the United Kingdom would leave.<\/p> <p>Most importantly, through the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, it brought certainty and clarity on the most acute risks to Ireland, banishing the spectre of a hard border on this island.  It protected the Good Friday Agreement and the common travel area.<\/p> <p> The withdrawal agreement was one part - an important part - of the complicated jigsaw puzzle of Brexit.  It opened the way for negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and the UK, and it started a period of transition that would end, one way or the other, on 31 December last.  Progress in those negotiations was slow, at times painfully so.  The EU team, ably led by our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, sought to achieve an ambitious and comprehensive outcome that would pave the way for deep and close partnership into the future.  As the endgame approached, the largest divisions remained on issues including governance, establishing a level playing field to ensure fair competition, and fishing.  A breakthrough on all three was essential to reaching a deal.  Given the essential need for trust in the process, and trust that any agreement would stick, Ireland and the EU were very clear also that the elements of the then United Kingdom Internal Market Bill that breached the withdrawal agreement had to be removed.  All this was against the stark backdrop of Covid-19, and the ticking clock heralding the end of the transition period on 31 December last.  Throughout, I expressed my belief that with political will, and a willingness to compromise, a deal was within our grasp.  It was certainly in all of our interests.  A no-deal outcome would have represented an historic failure of politics, with potentially irreversible political and geopolitical consequences and economic repercussions over a sustained period.<\/p> <p> Today, therefore, it is right that we reflect on the positive significance of the motion before us.  There was nothing inevitable about the agreement reached between EU-UK on Christmas Eve.  The finalisation of the trade and co-operation agreement, together with the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, means that all of Ireland&rsquo;s key objectives in the negotiations were achieved.  In particular, these agreements ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process; avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland; facilitate the maintenance of the common travel area; enshrine the best possible outcome, given UK choices, for trade and the economy, notably tariff-free and quota-free trade with the UK; protect Ireland's place in the Single Market; protect the Single Market itself; and ensure fair competition and a level playing field for Irish businesses.<\/p> <p> The trade and co-operation agreement creates a new stable relationship with the UK for the Irish transport and energy sectors and ensures co-operation between police services on these islands can continue, based on protecting fundamental rights and the rule of law.  Importantly, it allows EU-UK relations to move forward into 2021 from an agreed starting point, rather than from a point of division and rupture.  I want today to put on the record of this House my gratitude to Michel Barnier and the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, for the resourcefulness, determination, integrity and composure which were the hallmarks of their approach to the negotiations with the UK throughout.  They both represent enormous grace under pressure.<\/p> <p> The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which was agreed politically some 15 months ago and has been in law since 1 February last, only came into practical effect on 1 January 2021.  During the final months of 2020, there was intense engagement between the EU and UK to agree a shared approach on all aspects and issues related to the interpretation and implementation of the protocol.  I want to recognise the immense work of Commissioner Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic and his team for their attentive, flexible and constructive approach to the operational decisions that were required to ensure the effective implementation of the protocol.<\/p> <p> The decision of the UK to leave the Single Market and the customs union brings about considerable disruption for business in Northern Ireland, with new processes and obligations to be undertaken and respected.  The protocol, however, ensures that Northern Irish traders continue to have access not only to markets in Great Britain, but also to the EU Single Market of 450 million consumers.  This access for NI traders is also vital for all-island supply chains.  That the trade and co-operation agreement puts in place an arrangement with no tariffs or quotas has had the important effect of making the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol less complex.  The successful conclusion of the new EU-UK agreement has also created a positive stepping-off point for the future EU-UK relationship, which can feed in positively to the ongoing work of the joint committee and specialised committee on the implementation of the protocol over time.<\/p> <p> The commitment by other EU member states, the European Commission, Ireland, the British Government and, in recent days, the Northern Ireland Executive to put in place a PEACE PLUS programme of real scale for the period from 2021 to 2027 is really significant.  PEACE PLUS will deliver crucial community supports and vital cross-Border investment that will help to mitigate some of the negative consequences of Brexit.  We thank all involved for all their work and support for this initiative.  We are particularly grateful for the responsiveness of the Commission to our continuing efforts and our advocacy for such a fund, which as been well matched by all of the other stakeholders, including the UK Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and our own Government, and will be significant into the future.<\/p> <p> Despite the significance of the new trade and co-operation agreement, and the withdrawal agreement including the protocol, there remains a sizable gap between what trade and co-operation looked like during and after the UK's membership of the European Union.  At an early point, the UK decided to leave the Single Market and the customs union, even if it sometimes baulked at what the inevitable consequences of this choice would be.  Simply put, in choosing that path, the UK stepped outside the seamless trading environment of the EU.  Being outside means friction - they are now in a market of one country, not 28 countries.  While there are no tariffs and quotas under the agreement, there are new procedures and checks that apply to the movement of goods between Great Britain and the EU.  This means greater complexity and greater expense.<\/p> <p> The Government has worked hard to support businesses exposed to the British market to prepare.  I pay tribute again to the efforts that many people have made despite the unprecedented difficulties 2020 presented.  We are now experiencing the reality of the new arrangements.  In particular, our agriculture sector, our small and medium-sized enterprises and all those involved in getting goods to market, including logistics, haulage and shipping companies, are working under new rules.  The fishing sector is particularly affected by the compromises on fish quotas that were necessary to secure a deal.  Therefore, I warmly welcome the European Commission's proposal in recent days for an allocation of over &euro;1 billion to Ireland from the Brexit adjustment reserve &ndash; a fund which has been put in place to support those member states and sectors most affected by Brexit.<\/p> <p> The Government has been working for several years to prepare for the real and substantive change that Brexit brings, with intensive efforts across many Departments and agencies.  This has involved the development of necessary legislation, through two Brexit omnibus Acts; the provision of financial, upskilling and advisory supports for business; extensive stakeholder outreach; and a multi-year public communications campaign to promote readiness.  The most visible element of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit preparations is the substantial investment in infrastructure, systems and staffing at Dublin Airport, Dublin Port and Rosslare Port.  In Dublin Port alone, 140,000 sq. m of building work has been completed involving 500,000 hours of effort.  These facilities include new inspection bays, import and export facilities and over 300 parking spaces for HGVs.  The capacity of customs and other ICT systems has been greatly enhanced to assist in managing the expected twelvefold increase in annual import and export declarations from approximately 1.6 million per annum to in excess of 20 million from 2021.  Provision has also been made to deploy some additional 1,500 staff to support and carry out the increased customs, sanitary and phystosanitary, SPS, and food safety checks and controls.<\/p> <p>Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the HSE all have 24-hour operations at Dublin Port.<\/p> <p> Taking budget 2021 into account, our total Brexit-related expenditure since the United Kingdom referendum on EU membership is now in excess of &euro;1 billion.  Over recent years, the Government has put in place extensive financial supports for sectors to assist businesses to prepare for and mitigate the impacts of Brexit.  This includes a &euro;100 million scheme to help the agrifood sector adapt, with investments in new products and market diversification to make the sector stronger and more resilient and to reduce our reliance on exports to the United Kingdom.  There is also a range of Government-funded Brexit loan options to assist business with potential cash flow issues arising out of Brexit, including the Brexit loan scheme, the future growth loan scheme and the Brexit business loan from Microfinance Ireland.<\/p> <p> We listened to demands from business for support with new customs arrangements.  The Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 provides for a postponed accounting for VAT.  The ready for customs grants assist companies to prepare for the new customs requirements, with up to &euro;9,000 available per eligible employee placed in a customs role.  We have continued to engage with stakeholders, representative bodies and businesses through the Brexit stakeholder forum, the retail forum, the enterprise forum, the Revenue consultative forum and the Brexit stakeholder consultative committee for the agriculture and fisheries sector.  In recent months, with the added challenge of the Covid crisis, we have made great use of virtual platforms and webinars to connect and communicate with those groups and beyond.<\/p> <p> We have also engaged with traders, hauliers and ferry companies on their preparations and to encourage the market to look at increasing the capacity on direct routes to Europe.  A significant number of new direct ferry services with additional capacity between Ireland and the European Union have now come on stream.  In fact, the number of ferry services running between Rosslare and mainland Europe has trebled in the past year.<\/p> <p> Of course, it is not just business that will experience changes.  We have been advising individuals on issues that will impact them, from driving licences and car insurance to pet travel and online retail.  All of this work has been supported by sustained and intensive communications and the stakeholder outreach programme.  Countrywide, people will have come across our Brexit advertisements on the radio, while watching television and in their newspapers and social media feeds.  Accepting that there is no such thing as a good Brexit, my aim as Taoiseach has always been to mitigate the risks and reduce the impact on our economy and citizens to the extent that it was possible.  The most important step towards that goal was the achievement of an agreement at the end of the negotiations, and that has now been achieved.  As I said at the start, this outcome was by no means inevitable.  Meanwhile, domestically, we have used every possible tool at our disposal, legislative, financial, administrative and advisory, to manage this change as best we can, to limit the disruption and to assist all who need help as they adapt to the new realities.<\/p> <p> Ireland has chosen our path and it is the path of the European Union and of multilateralism, where countries play by the same rules, co-operate freely and fairly and try to raise all boats.  Never has our choice resonated more than it has over the past four years as we have seen the value of the solidarity that comes from being a member state of the European Union.  I have always said that, though I regret it, I accept the choice that Britain has made and I wish it well as it embarks on this new chapter in its history.  Our relationship with our nearest neighbour will always be close and special.  The ties between us are so extensive and so strong.  No country has more to gain than we have from positive and stable European Union-United Kingdom relations.  Therefore, I welcome today's motion and the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, which provides the essential stability on which we will continue to build in the years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000030#CC01500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611150600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to recommend the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement to the House.  Brexit is not good for Ireland, Britain or Europe, and Brexit was not our decision.  It was a decision of the British people, one we regret but one we respect.  From day one, our policy was to protect Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement, citizens' rights both North and South, jobs and businesses, to avoid a hard border and to ensure that Ireland's position in the European Union and its Single Market was not undermined.<\/p>  <p>  After four years of hard work and careful diplomacy and alliance building, I believe we have achieved our aims.  First, with the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol, we ensured there was no hard border, with any checks taking place in seaports and airports instead, that the all-island economy would not be damaged and that the Good Friday Agreement would be respected.  Through unilateral action, we have protected the rights of citizens of Northern Ireland, including access to the ERASMUS programme and the EHIC scheme, and also ensured that European citizens in Northern Ireland can continue to work, travel and study anywhere within the European Union.  Through bilateral agreement with the UK, we have reinforced the common travel area and the reciprocity of citizens' rights that goes with it.  I am very grateful to the UK Government for facilitating that.  With the EU-UK TCA, we ensure that market access and tariff-free and quota-free trade are still available to Irish businesses, thus protecting jobs, businesses, farmers, rural Ireland and exporters.  Overall, it is as good an outcome as was possible in the circumstances and much better than many thought possible.<\/p>  <p>  I want to record my thanks to European governments and institutions and their representatives for the solidarity they showed to Ireland, especially Michel Barnier, Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and the Heads of State and Government across the 27 member states.  I also want to record my thanks to the British Prime Ministers, Mrs. May and Mr. Johnson, and their officials, who, notwithstanding the difficulties, honoured the promises they made, Prime Minister to Taoiseach, sovereign state to sovereign state.  I want to thank our officials and diplomats in Dublin, Brussels and around the world for their professionalism and patriotism, former Taoiseach Enda Kenny and, particularly, the support of Irish America, which was crucial, especially at points of decision and difficulty.  I also want to record my thanks to this House for the general support that all parties - or, at least, most parties - gave the Government in representing the national interest abroad.<\/p>  <p>  I do have some regrets, particularly as I see difficulties now play out in Northern Ireland and, indeed, on trade between Ireland and Britain as a consequence of Brexit, and the border in the Irish Sea, as some people refer to it.  This is, of course, primarily a consequence of Brexit.  We never wanted any barriers to people or trade, North-South, between Britain and the Republic Ireland or between GB and NI.  It is those who supported Brexit who must accept responsibility for that.  However, we also must accept that it could have been mitigated and that some of the problems we face today could have been avoided.  The backstop solution, for example, would have kept all of the United Kingdom in a single customs territory with the European Union, and that proposal could have passed the House of Commons had enough Northern Ireland MPs been willing to vote for it.  Another alternative was a customs union involving the UK and the EU, which was also possible at one point.  Let us not forget that it was defeated by only one vote in the House of Commons.  Had one DUP MP or one Sinn F&eacute;in MP voted for it, we could have seen an even softer Brexit and a milder one for Northern Ireland than we have today.  I do not say any of that to score political points but merely to speak the truth, and history will record it as fact.  Nonetheless, what is done is done and we will work with the Executive in Northern Ireland, the European Commission and the UK Government to make the Irish protocol work better and more smoothly to minimise the disruption to GB-NI trade.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit has few upsides but it does present a few opportunities, certainly for foreign direct investment into Ireland.  Any British, American, Chinese or foreign firm seeking a base in the eurozone with access to the Single Market will certainly consider Ireland, and that is the case we will make as we fight for more FDI for Ireland.  Absent Britain, Ireland can become a bridge between the US and the EU to help rebuild the Atlantic alliance, particularly now as a new Administration takes office there.  It also creates the opportunity for us to build new alliances with like-minded EU countries away from the shadow of the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement, with its many parts, creates a framework for the new EU-UK relationship into the future.  It creates a new stable relationship with the UK for the Irish transport and energy sectors.  It ensures co-operation between police services on these islands can continue.  It will protect the Single Market, which is so important for our future prosperity, and ensure fair competition for Irish businesses.<\/p> <p>Some of the key positives from my Department's perspective include the market access provisions, tariff-free and quota-free trade as well as provisions aimed at preventing unnecessary technical barriers and requirements.  In addition, it is welcome that there will be a memorandum of understanding on the handling of equivalence in financial services and decisions taken on data adequacy.<br\/><br\/>The agreement, however, does not replicate the <i>status quo<\/i>.  Even with this agreement, Britain is still outside the Single Market and customs union and there are now a range of customs and regulatory controls at Irish, EU and UK ports.  These checks are necessary to protect public health, food safety and the integrity of the Single Market.  In no way do I want to underestimate the challenges that these new requirements have brought for business, especially small business.  The evidence is that despite some initial difficulties systems are gearing up, with over 80% of goods imported into Dublin Port from the UK being green-routed.  I acknowledge though that trade volumes into Irish ports from the UK are only approximately half of what they would normally be at this time of year.  This is due to a combination of pre-Brexit stockpiling and Covid-19 restrictions.  Many traders are using increased direct routes to and from continental Europe.  This cuts out all the new customs and regulatory controls for Irish traders.  Ferry companies have stepped up in delivering flexible capacity and I wish to thank them for this.  There is approximately three times the capacity now on routes between Ireland and the Continent than there had been hitherto.  There is also some evidence of trade being displaced to Northern Ireland ports.  This requires further investigation and understanding.<br\/><br\/>The outcome on fisheries was a difficult compromise for us.  I share the disappointment felt by many other member states on this matter.  The Government will work to ensure that the fisheries sector and the coastal communities who depend on it are assisted through the period ahead.<br\/><br\/>We will work with all sectors as they experience the fall-out from Brexit by analysing the agreement in further detail to identify particular issues or gaps and we will put appropriate measures in place.  This will be important to ensure the Irish economy withstands these major challenges.<br\/><br\/>As part of this response we will avail of the European Commission Brexit adjustment reserve to help those sectors worst affected.  The Commission proposal to allocate &euro;1 billion or 25% of the initial allocation of the fund to Ireland is welcome and is a good result.  Unfortunately, however, it recognises that we are the state most affected.  The allocation under the BAR is a further example of solidarity that Ireland has seen from the EU throughout the Brexit process.  We know that supply chains will take time to adjust to their new arrangements and documentary requirements and we are actively engaging with logistics companies, retailers and wider stakeholders to deal with the issues arising to ensure the continued flow of goods.  There is positive and reassuring feedback.  Those in the retail sector are assuring us that due to the strength of their supply chains they do not anticipate shortages.<br\/><br\/>One point I wish to emphasise is that there are operating requirements to avail of the zero-tariff rate under the agreement.  It does not happen automatically.  Importers must show that the imported goods are proven to be of UK origin and actively claim the zero rate through import declarations.  Similarly, Irish exporters need to show that their goods are of EU origin when exporting to the UK to qualify for the 0% tariff.  It will not be assumed.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Damien English, has been communicating and trying to raise awareness on this point.  For consumers, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Robert Troy, recently issued a reminder about the new arrangements now in place for online retail from the UK.  It includes the possibility of additional costs by way of VAT and customs charges that may apply depending on the value and origin of goods in question.<br\/><br\/>While the immediate focus is on the short-term logistical issues that have arisen from the interpretation of the agreement's provisions, we need to plan for the medium and long terms by continuing to diversify into new markets and growing our share in existing ones.  The United Kingdom will always be an important market for Irish business.  It is right next door and has 60 million people.  However, it is not the only market available.  The Single Market is not much farther away.  It is far bigger with 450 million people and offers vast opportunities for business, especially SMEs.<br\/><br\/>I commend Mr. Michel Barnier and all those who contributed to this agreement and I thank our EU partners once again for their unwavering solidarity throughout the negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000032#EE00200","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611151200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>This year on 1 January we saw the single largest change in relations between the EU and UK for many decades as the transition period ended and the new framework of the EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement took effect.  This House knows all too well that Ireland is the EU member state most affected by this change.  I warmly welcome that Deputies today have the opportunity to make statements on this important issue that affects all Irish citizens and businesses throughout the country.  I look forward to engaging with Deputies in a questions-and-answers session tomorrow on these issues in more detail.  Next week, this House will be invited to vote on a motion in support of the agreement reached.  I sincerely hope we will have strong support from all parties in this House for the motion.<\/p>  <p>  With that in mind, it is important to recall how we got to where we are today and what the agreement means for Ireland.  It might seem difficult to believe, but this time last year the EU had not yet finalised our shared negotiating mandate.  The negotiations began in earnest only in March, leaving nine short months for the vast task of creating an entirely new legal framework for our relationship with the UK.  This was no easy task, especially when the EU and UK approached these issues with what were often different levels of ambition and preferred outcomes and given the severe logistical challenges occasioned by the pandemic.  We have been extraordinarily fortunate in the leadership provided to the EU negotiating team by Michel Barnier.  I am delighted he will be recognised later this week by the European Movement Ireland organisation as \"European of the Year\".  I am also keen to recognise, as others have, the extraordinary solidarity Ireland has received from other EU leaders and the role this Taoiseach and his predecessor have played to get this outcome.<\/p>  <p>  For long periods of the negotiations the two sides were so far apart on many issues, including key issues of principle.  Some doubted whether it would be possible to bridge the gap at all.  I said on a number of occasions that a failure to reach agreement would have been a failure of politics and statecraft.  Now that an agreement is indeed in place, it is perhaps too easy to forget how damaging the alternative of a no-deal scenario would have been, especially for Ireland.  Both sides worked hard to find arrangements that respected our different approaches.  The agreement reached is fundamentally in our interest, not least because the alternative was effectively a breakdown in relations that would have been fundamental.<\/p>  <p>  As the Government motion notes, with the trade and co-operation agreement, the withdrawal agreement and the protocol now in place, Ireland's key Brexit objectives have been achieved.  We have protected the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  The trade and co-operation agreement has ensured the best possible outcome for trade and the economy, including tariff-free and quota-free trade for qualifying goods, strong provisions to protect fair competition and the protection of Ireland's place in the Single Market.  We have a platform for continued co-operation in key areas such as policing, energy and transport as well as the UK's continued participation in important EU programmes, including PEACE PLUS.  The maintenance of the common travel area is also explicitly recognised in both agreements.<\/p>  <p>  There are areas in which we would have wished to have closer co-operation and greater levels of ambition, not least with the outcome on fisheries.  The EU offered a much closer trading relationship - others have referred to this - and a continuation of existing fishing arrangements.  The UK preferred otherwise.  The challenges some stakeholders face today are a consequence of this British choice.  I assure people that we will continue to work closely with those impacted negatively to ensure they can navigate the new arrangements successfully and are supported in every way possible.<\/p>  <p>  No agreement could ever have replaced the UK's membership of the EU.  As we have said for many months, the UK's insistence that it was leaving the Single Market meant that certain things were inevitable and unavoidable.  Even with this agreement, there are new layers of complication in the EU-UK relationship that many - those in industry in particular - are now having to adapt to, especially around processes for moving goods, SPS checks, health certificates, customs declarations, safety certificates and more.  This means trade is far from as smooth as it would have been previously.<\/p> <p>We worked for several years to put the most comprehensive preparations possible in place for this change, from infrastructure to financial supports to step-by-step guides for the new rules.  Now that these changes are upon us, we continue to work hand in hand with stakeholders to manage the disruption and the new realities they face.  Brexit means change and challenges, but we face these together and with the support and resilience brought by our continued membership of the EU and its Single Market of more than 450 million consumers.<\/p> <p> After several years of sustained and unprecedented political and sectoral focus on Brexit, we must now look forward.  We must play a leadership role in shaping and developing our common European Union.  We must promote and protect the values that are at the core of our shared European project.  We must collectively deepen our alliances and friendships with our fellow member states.  We must build a thriving, innovative and sustainable economic model though which our people can achieve their full potential.  We must also reinvent our relationship with our closest neighbour, the United Kingdom, and the Government will be focused on that as well as the EU challenges we will face in the future.<\/p> <p> I commend the motion to the House and I look forward to the questions tomorrow.  I know there is a proposed amendment to the motion.  I ask Sinn F&eacute;in to reconsider this approach.  The Government is more than happy to talk to all parties about what we are trying to do to ensure we provide all the supports we can to the fisheries sector, but the idea that we would support an amendment today which calls for an effective redesign of the Common Fisheries Policy distracts from the core message we are trying to deliver here, which is that the Irish Parliament is united in supporting the deal that has been struck when everything is taken into account.  Nobody is working harder than me and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, to try to ensure there is a fair burden-sharing approach towards lost fishing opportunities and that there are the necessary financial supports and compensation for fishing communities that have lost fishing opportunities.  I strongly encourage those who propose to amend the motion to think again.  We have been strong because we have been united as a country on the clear messages we send to others in the European Union and to those in the British Government about what Ireland is achieving and has tried to achieve through these negotiations and the deal that was struck.  Let us try to continue in that mould and to work together to ensure we protect fishing interests as best we can in the context of this deal.  I look forward to Members' questions and comments tomorrow.  I am happy to provide more detailed answers if they are necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000033#FF00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611151800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo insert the following after &ldquo;of a no deal scenario&rdquo;:  \t&ldquo;notes that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; the outcome of the Brexit trade deal amounts to a 15 per cent overall cut to the quota of Irish fishers and a much higher percentage cut for some quota species; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the proposed compensatory financial assistance on offer is nowhere near the levels of financial loss to Irish fishers that will arise from this deal; and <\/blockquote>calls on the Government to urgently engage with the European Commission and their EU member state counterparts to renegotiate the Common Fisheries Policy to ensure a fair and sustainable allocation of fishing quota to the affected Irish fishers from the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone and other waters.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>  <p>The completion on Christmas Eve of the EU-Britain trade and co-operation agreement was the culmination of four years of intense, difficult and extremely fraught negotiations.  It is very important to acknowledge the efforts of all concerned, particularly those in the public and civil service, and I offer a special commendation to Michel Barnier and his team for their immense work and dedication over this period.  I have always said there is no such thing as a good Brexit for Ireland and that the achievement of a trade agreement was critically important for the future of our island.  Clearly, an agreement is better than a crash Brexit.  It is regrettable, however, that Boris Johnson and his negotiators ensured that the outcome is still a hard Tory Brexit that will cause serious problems for workers, business and trade in Ireland and in Britain.  The outcome reflects the approach taken by the Tory Government since the Brexit referendum of 2016, one characterised mostly by intransigence, belligerence and cynical brinkmanship and game-playing.<\/p><p>Of course, Ireland, North and South, is uniquely exposed to the very real threats and challenges that arise as a result of the route taken by the British Government.  The full implementation of the Irish protocol is all-important as it is clear that the agreement marks the beginning of a new trading relationship built on permanent negotiation, dispute and recrimination.  These bottom-line safeguards ensure that there is no hardening of the border, that the Good Friday Agreement is prioritised and that our all-Ireland economy is protected.  These special arrangements for Ireland were hard-won through tireless work with our allies in Europe and America and they cannot be eroded by post-agreement trading and political frictions.<\/p><p>As the bluster has now died down, the realities of the hard Tory Brexit have already become all too apparent.  Businesses and traders across Ireland are now being exposed to incredible levels of disruption and some confusion.  We see disruptions to supply chains that have been built over decades.  This was not an inevitable outcome of Britain leaving the EU.  This is a result of the choices made by the Tory Government, including its refusal to remain in the customs union, its failure to negotiate sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, equivalences and its rejection of co-ordination with the EU.  These choices have impaired businesses on both sides of the Irish Sea.  Irish supply chains have also been impeded by the British Government's failure to provide sufficient information and preparation concerning post-Brexit arrangements to its traders.  The complexities regarding new paperwork and IT systems have also added to the problems faced by businesses.  It is of the utmost importance that the Government brings all these groups together to identify the main difficulties and to put solutions in place before the current public health restrictions are relaxed and trade naturally increases.<\/p><p>There are also massive challenges to trade as a result of the North not being counted as EU-origin for the purposes of EU trade agreements with other countries.  This is something to which the Irish Government must seek a common-sense solution through proactive engagement with our EU partners.  We must work to have the North included by the EU in all existing and future trade agreements.<\/p><p>The Government must also stand up for Irish fishing communities.  The recent incident at Rockall highlights the stark realities for the Irish fleet.  The outcome of this Brexit deal amounts to another 15% cut in quota and income to our Irish fishing fleet, which was already struggling to survive.  For the Irish fleet to be further ripped apart while there are immense fishing resources around our coast is unacceptable.  It is time to revisit the EU Common Fisheries Policy quotas as they apply to Irish waters.<\/p><p>It is undeniable that we are now in circumstances in which the need to plan for constitutional change is irresistible.  Brexit and the outcome of these negotiations have demonstrated once again that reunification and the ending of partition is the very best idea for the future of our island.  That conversation is now live and an Irish unity referendum will happen.  It is the duty of any Irish government to prepare for that change, to foster that conversation and to do everything possible to ensure that this process is inclusive of everybody who calls Ireland home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000034#GG00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1611151800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>All sides were both exhausted and contented when a trade agreement was finally reached between the European Union and Britain at the end of December.  The decision to leave the EU was one taken by the British people, or more specifically by people in England.  That is their democratic decision, but it would be more palatable to many in this House if they were not dragging parts of our country out of the EU with them.  Businesses and exporters have been contending with the new trading terms between the EU and Britain which came into force on 1 January.  Unfortunately, these businesses are now being exposed to the realities of a hard Tory Brexit as we witness significant disruption to trading and supply chains that have been built over decades.<\/p> <p>In negotiations, assumptions on the practical outworking of a deal are made by the negotiating teams.  This was most certainly the case with the new trading arrangements.  The reality is, however, that assumptions made in negotiations are often theoretical, abstract and academic compared with how the realities of the situation express themselves in practice on the ground.  The current situation at ports and airports is an example of this, as businesses and exporters have battled to familiarise themselves with the new trading terms between the EU and Britain, the outworkings of which are significant disruptions to trading and supply chains that have been built up over decades.  While it was important to get a deal, it is also important that the deal works for the State, for the whole island, for businesses, and for our fishing communities.  There is an urgent need to renegotiate the Common Fisheries Policy, and I urge all parties to support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  It is not intended, as the Minister tried to characterise it, to be divisive but rather to give this House an opportunity to unite behind our fishing communities, to stand with our fishers, and to express collectively our solidarity.  It is the very opposite of division and is intended to unite people.<br\/><br\/>This means that the Government and the EU, where we have a direct say, have to iron out imperfections in how this new deal is operating.  Naturally, with new systems, new customs officers and a whole new way of trading, there are issues which will rectify themselves over time.  However, there are other areas where the State will have to push the matter and get involved in coming up with rapid and necessary solutions.<br\/><br\/>The low level of freight entering and exiting the State during the early days of 2021 have masked the serious problems which are developing due to the complications of the new trading arrangements.  In recent weeks these complications have caused havoc for the export and importation of goods for Irish businesses.  These problems are as a result of the complexity of the new trading arrangements and the paperwork and ICT systems which now exist to deal with this new post-Brexit trade deal.  The Government must pull stakeholder and business groups together, as well as the State agencies such as Revenue and customs, so that the existing problems can be identified and rectified quickly.<br\/><br\/>However, there are other problems such as rules of origin issues, where goods sent from Europe to Ireland or<i>vice versa<\/i>stop off in Britain as part of the delivery process, are unpacked and then repacked, resulting in the goods losing their free tariff status.  These matters have to be ironed out and resolved as quickly as possible.  Similarly, we have to work with every sector to ensure issues with groupage transport are ironed out.  Currently, groupage transport is only as strong as its weakest link.  If a trailer has 30 consignments on it and the paperwork is correct for 29 of those loads but wrong for one, then that trailer is stuck in the port until the whole issue is rectified.  Now that we have three weeks of experience in the new arrangements, businesses need to be reached out to again about the new trading systems, and if improvements can be made, they need to be made and made urgently.<br\/><br\/>We must also assess the evolving situation for opportunities for Irish businesses under these new arrangements.  Inevitably, trade voids will appear due to Britain&rsquo;s exit of the EU and the new trading relationship.  The State must be prepared to invest in our SMEs and family businesses to help them expand to capture the lion&rsquo;s share of this trade, especially the trade in goods.  We should be requesting an elongated period of relaxed state aid rules so that we can invest in high productivity, high growth, and high value-added sectors which can see good jobs created in manufacturing and exporting.  There are other areas where we do not produce the necessary ingredients or goods that we need, such as sugar and flour.  I know that my colleague, Deputy Carthy, has raised this issue on a number of occasions.  The State needs to look at investing and restoring these industries.<br\/><br\/>The deal is welcome and more welcome than no deal, but let us not be afraid to focus on the difficulties we now face and let us not rest on our laurels and think that the  EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement brings this situation to an end.  This is only the beginning and we now need to respond diligently and effectively to the new difficulties that are being faced by our businesses and, indeed, by our fishing communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000034#GG00300","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611152400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Following an initial period in the immediate aftermath of the 1 January deadline, when haulage traffic was much reduced, primarily due to stockpiling by companies, we are now facing into the full implications of Brexit and the withdrawal agreement that was designed to avoid the chaos that a no-deal scenario would have introduced.  Measured against the undoubted catastrophe that the failure to secure a deal would have produced, it was and is too easy to overlook the fact that, in any guise, Brexit is bad for Britain, for Europe and for the whole island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The initial high-profile casualty of the agreement was the fishing industry.  Ireland and Germany are set to face the worst hits to their fresh fishing industries.  Compared with the 2020 figures, both countries will face a cut of 15% to their fishing quotas.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this will equate to an estimated loss somewhere in the region of &euro;43 million to the fishing sector.  This is an astonishing figure and one that will present enormous challenges to the entire sector.  The Government needs to put in place specific targeted supports for our fishing industry to protect against these losses.  We have already witnessed Irish fishing vessels being prevented from fishing by the British Navy in what are clearly Irish waters, even if Fine Gael would have us surrender these waters to the British, as it has attempted to do under the 2013 agreement with the British, one that has not been ratified by the D&aacute;il.  The Government needs to sort this mess out and to defend our fishing rights.<\/p>  <p>  While we have entered a new paradigm in our business relationship with our nearest neighbour, one that we anticipated would introduce substantial challenges, that we all agreed would require substantial preparation, and that our Government argued that every effort had been made to address, it has nonetheless become clear that not all Irish businesses were prepared for Brexit.  This factor, combined with the difficulties customs and Revenue staff have to face and come to terms with in preparing new computer systems at our ports, is hampering the running of our supply chains.  Every effort must be made by the Government to ensure that businesses get a handle on this with immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of Brexit is being felt severely in the North of Ireland.  The empty shelves in the supermarkets resonate with the echo of the empty promises of the champions of Brexit.  We in this House must continue to challenge those who seek to blame the impact of Brexit and of Tory folly on the parts of the final agreement designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  There is no doubt that the responsibility for the effect and consequences of Brexit lie firmly and solidly at the door of the British Government.  The solution to the impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland is, quite simply, the unification of the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Scottish people are very clear and becoming increasingly vocal in their belief in the independence of Scotland as the quickest and most correct route to get from under the yoke of Conservative Party mismanagement.  It is apparent to the Welsh people, awake from their slumber, that the days of the union are clearly numbered.  It is not, however, enough to give voice to aspirations.  All of us, and the Government in particular, must put concrete plans in place, plans which are needed to respond to the challenges of Brexit and which involve all of the island of Ireland.  We need to see the development of the infrastructure which will support and facilitate an all-Ireland supply chain.  There is a need for all-Ireland systems, all-island corporate bodies, and above all an all-Ireland strategy designed to maximise the potential of the entire people of this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000035#HH00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1611152400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak briefly on this important issue.  We were not sure that we would ever arrive at the point when we would actually have a trade agreement between the European Union and the UK to debate.  It became a very close-run thing.<\/p> <p>Although the details of this complex agreement will be unravelled over a period of time, a few points are clear from the outset.  As I have done as our spokesperson on this issue for the past number of years, the Labour Party strongly welcomes that we have a deal and will support it today, but we cannot escape the fact that it is what others have described as a very thin deal, one that is much weaker and more insubstantial than any we might have hoped for at the outset when there was at least a hope that the UK might stay within the Single Market or the customs union.  Unfortunately, that opportunity was lost over time and the hardness of Brexit was firmed up month after month.<br\/><br\/>This is a unique deal in all the trade deals the EU has transacted, in that it is one that is characterised by divergence between the contracting parties rather than convergence.  In every other trade deal, the contracting parties have sought to come together, remove barriers and free up trade.  This agreement is a unique set of proposals that puts additional barriers in place to make it more difficult to have trade.  We will have to parse and analyse many parts of it as their actual effect is focused upon.  As such, this is far from being the end.  There will be ongoing and deep negotiations for a protracted period - forever in fact, because all of our trade agreements and trade interactions with the UK will be subject to ongoing evolution and negotiation.<br\/><br\/>Like other Deputies, I wish to thank those who argued for our interests.  We have unique interests in this matter and a greater interest than anyone else in the EU.  I pay tribute to Mr. Michel Barnier and his team, our Government and the civil servants who negotiated with great dexterity and patience over a protracted period on a dossier that was never of their making.  I should also make mention of European Commissioner Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic, who has done sterling work in understanding our unique issues and taking them as his own as a representative of the European Commission.<br\/><br\/>Obviously, we nailed down the Northern Ireland protocol in advance of this trade deal and issues like the common travel area and so on are protected, but there are difficulties with fisheries.  Our view from the start, which was also the Irish Government's view as expressed years ago by the Minister, was that we should settle the fisheries issue first and get it off the agenda so that it would not be the last item, given that it would be a difficult one for us to address.  Unfortunately, that was not achieved and it became one of the two or three last issues, if not the actual last issue.  There are serious difficulties for the fishing communities, some of which I represent in the constituency of Wexford, that need to be addressed.  The loss of quota that will result from the agreement will have to be addressed by the Government.  I would like to hear specifically what proposals it has to deal with the matter.<br\/><br\/>In future discussions, I will deal in some detail with the specifics of trade in goods, how tariff free and quota free trade is subject to the rules of origin standards and how they are to be implemented, and how limited the trade in services is in comparison with any other agreement that the EU has contracted with third parties, but because I want to be forward looking, I wish to focus on something else in the few minutes available to me today, namely, the outworking of the agreement as it is in place right now.  By this I mean how it is impacting on our communities, businesses and people's lives.<br\/><br\/>I will take one instance of that in the form of an issue that my office dealt with yesterday.  A truck arrived from Wales on the Irish Ferries Pembroke-Rosslare ferry line on the <i>MS Isle of Inishmore<\/i>on Monday evening.  It was carrying medical supplies destined for Swords.  Its driver was held up from 7 p.m. on Monday to 11 a.m. yesterday morning.  The issue was a discrepancy of approximately &euro;400 on a VAT invoice for a number of wheelchair parts that were going to a health centre in Dublin.  The driver offered to cover the cost himself, but that was not accepted.  Having overnighted there, he was eventually allowed to proceed.<br\/><br\/>The driver has allowed me to set out his views on this matter because he asked me to.  I will put what he said on the record of the House.  He did 206 crossings from Rosslare to Wales last year and his company did well over 300.  They helped in the fight against Covid during the difficult times, sometimes with five trucks per week delivering essential medical supplies like hospital beds, mattresses, oxygen concentrators, wheelchairs, power chairs and so on.  He prides himself on getting the goods delivered on time every time and he has never once failed regardless of storms, issues with boats, etc.  He found a way to get the goods over.  However, to be stopped delivering his goods that morning due to a technicality that could easily have been rectified was unbelievable to him.  He understands that everyone has a job to do at this time of uncertainty and the new Brexit regulations, but to be held for more than 16 hours at a customs point in Rosslare even though he had explained the situation was crazy to him.  At 9 p.m., he was told that if he had a particular document, he would be free to go.  They sorted that problem within two hours, but then there was another issue relating to commercial invoices that had not been mentioned previously.  He is passionate about what he does and what he delivers because he knows it makes a difference to many people.<br\/><br\/>We need flexibility in such matters.  The Minister is listening and taking note.  I accept that we did not create these problems and that we must protect our Single Market, but we must have some degree of flexibility.  This is happening at a time when the number of trucks coming to Ireland from Britain is slightly less than half the normal supply.  That supply will ratchet up and these issues will be compounded.  The Minister will say that all exporters from the UK must be up to speed, but we need to help by alerting people to what is needed.  In the interim, we need flexibilities for at least a short time so that the frustrations that I just instanced from one driver are not replicated for hundreds of drivers over the coming weeks.  As we work out a new paradigm of a relationship with the UK, one that we did not want and do not welcome, we must do so in as flexible a way as we can so as not to disadvantage ourselves.  I hope that, in responding to this debate or during the questions and answers session that will be available to us tomorrow, the Minister might show us the type of interaction he is having with all State agencies, in this instance Revenue, to ensure that people who are doing their best and need a technical fix can have one provided for them and that we are not just saying &quot;There is Brexit for you, there are the consequences and live with them&quot;, which would not be in our interests.<br\/><br\/>While the Labour Party will support the agreement as the best that could be done and commends those who were involved in defending our interests, there is a great deal more work to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000035#HH00400","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611153000,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Cairns.<\/p><p>I welcome that there is a deal.<\/p> <p>I thank Michel Barnier and his EU negotiating team for working so hard to conclude a deal in very challenging circumstances.  It is worth noting that it is a very unusual situation to have a reverse trade co-operation deal in place.  None of us knows exactly how much damage it is going to do because there is no precedent.<\/p> <p> I wish to address three points relating to key weaknesses I see in this deal in terms of the level playing field provisions, increased costs to Irish households, in particular low-income households, as a direct result of Brexit, and the impact of the cost of steel to the construction industry.  We know that steel being imported into Northern Ireland is being hit with a 25% tariff.  Given that the two ports on the island of Ireland that are best able to receive large imports of steel are located in the North this could have an effect on the construction industry here.  The fact that steel destined for the Republic has been hit with a 25% tariff could have major implications in terms of costs for the construction industry.  This is an area on which the Government needs to take action to avert the increased costs that would affect the cost of construction and have knock-on effects on the cost of new homes.<\/p> <p> Regarding the impact on low-income households, a couple of years ago the ESRI did a study on the potential impacts and costs of Brexit and it concluded that in the worst-case scenario, with a deal like this in place, we would be seeing increased costs for households of approximately &euro;900 a year.  We do not know the exact cost impact on households.  We do not know how much costs will be absorbed or how much households will be able to avert them by switching to different products and the difference in supply chains, but we know there will be increased costs.  There will be an increase in disruption and bureaucracy, resulting in increased costs.  We need the Government to monitor this very carefully to see what the impact is and for that to inform any decisions on what measures it needs to take to mitigate against costs for low-income households.  I am concerned that in almost an hour of speeches by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, there was no mention of that at all.  Is it on the Government's radar and are low-income households invisible to the Government?  I ask that because three of its most senior members have come into the House and not addressed the potential impact.<\/p> <p> In terms of the provisions of the deal on the level playing field, we have seen Boris Johnson already talking up the fact that he will use Brexit as a way to redraw regulation to give UK businesses a competitive advantage.  He has said that they are considering ripping up the working time directive and the corresponding legislation in the UK, including bringing an end to the 40-hour working week and changing rules around rest breaks.  We know that in the OECD the UK already has one of the lowest protections for workers.  The UK is already looking at doing that.  Ireland is exposed given that the UK is our largest trading partner and because we are right next door to the UK.  Previously, the European Union has been very slow to enforce any arrangements on labour standards in bilateral agreements.  We also know that the level playing field only applies to workers' rights, climate change, environmental standards and state aid, but it does not apply in other areas and the onus is on industry to prove material effects from a lowering of standards by the UK.  We need very active monitoring by the Government of changes in the UK so that we can look for fast action from the European Union if any lowering of standards affects Irish jobs and industries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000036#JJ00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611153600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I echo Deputy Cian O'Callaghan in welcoming a deal.  Brexit has added considerable uncertainty and worry to families, farmers, fishing communities and small businesses across Ireland.  The EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement is a welcome alternative to a no-deal Brexit, as is the Minister's work in prioritising the Good Friday Agreement and the common travel area.  Small independent producers in west Cork are contacting me because they are worried about the impact of the agreement and the ongoing uncertainty and they need more reassurance.  The Government must put in place targeted supports to help these sectors transition through this period and continue to push such supports at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  With the UK leaving the Single Market the agrifood sector is facing additional costs.  It is essential that families, especially low-income households and local enterprises, are not the ones to bear the brunt of these changes.  The beef barons and industrial-scale players can adapt, but the likes of inshore fishermen, small farmers, artisan food producers and low-income households simply cannot afford to bear the brunt of excessive barriers.  The absence of mutual recognition of sanitary standards is resulting in more controls on goods of animal and plant origin.  The Government needs to pursue agreement in these areas to ensure that agrifood trade is as seamless as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Fishing communities are disappointed with the agreement, which sees a total loss &euro;43 million, with Ireland surrendering a greater percentage of quota than most other EU states.  The Minister referred to it as a sacrifice.  It is essential that the Government puts in place schemes to support the sector.  The process for designating ports for landings of UK-registered Northern Ireland boats was poorly handled.  It should have had more consideration, planning and troubleshooting to reflect the realities of the industry.  The designation of additional ports is welcome, but it should have happened sooner.  More needs to be done to assist those impacted by Brexit and its fallout, both directly and indirectly.<\/p>  <p>  Smaller fishing communities are left wondering how this came about, and whose interests are being served.  The excessive re-registering costs, amounting to hundreds of thousands of euro in some cases, is simply not an option for many without assistance.  In addition, 24-hours' notice of landing is unworkable for some.  There are more and more bureaucratic barriers for smaller fishing operators.  The further designation of additional ports if necessary and the use of exemptions to notice periods until fishers have a chance to adapt to the new arrangements should be considered while the impact of new requirements is being assessed.<\/p>  <p>  For many in the industry it feels like the Government is working against them rather than fighting for them.  I am sure that is not entirely the case, but that is sometimes how it seems and looks.  Small-scale fishers represent the type of sustainable fishing that has been practised for generations in places like west Cork, the islands and coastal communities.  It is the kind of fishing we should be prioritising.  However, successive Governments are only focused on the larger and more damaging types of fishing, which is more lucrative for the few rather than the many.  That is evident in that these are the only ones being represented by producer organisations, POs.  Many of these issues can be connected to how decisions are made and whose interests are being served.  That is incredibly problematic and must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The fishing sector is complex, with fishers of different types and scales working in the industry.  However, the Government and the media rarely reflect this nuance.  This is evident in the disconnect between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and many fishing communities.  It is essential that the Minister grants PO status to other representative groups, such as those representing the islands and other inshore fisheries groups, to better represent all of the sector, especially small-scale and family businesses, which are often overshadowed by the larger players and their producer organisations.  The organisations that are actively seeking PO status should be urgently assisted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There can be no more delays or excuses.  This is such a crucial time for the industry, and we need to hear all their voices in order to fix the situation.<\/p>  <p>  In the tourism area, small businesses are worried about the effect on them.  The imposition of VAT and customs duty and the bureaucratic barriers can be met by large corporations but are prohibitive for family enterprises.  These obstacles are a serious threat at a time when we are attempting to foster campaigns to buy local and to promote online trading for small-scale businesses.  The Government's change to the retail export scheme, which allows non-EU tourists to claim back VAT on purchases made in Ireland, is a particular blow to the tourism and craft industries, which are a significant source of employment for younger people especially in rural areas.  I urge the Minister for Finance to immediately reverse the increase to enable VAT relief on the majority of purchases to help support local enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  The EU-UK agreement is the new trading reality, which will have considerable impacts on agrifood, fishing and small businesses.  The Government must engage directly with those involved in these sectors and prioritise the voice of small and independent producers to ensure practical and more equitable solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000037#KK00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1611154200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Barry.  For British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Tory right, Brexit was always about a reckless drive to accelerate the race to the bottom, undermine standards in worker rights or the environment, for example, and, no doubt, to further enhance the role of the City of London as a centre for financial speculation and emulate this country in trying to develop a tax haven model that would reduce corporate tax obligations on multinationals in order to encourage investment to the United Kingdom.  It was about whipping up anti-immigration sentiment and tightening what are essentially racist immigration laws in the UK.  In pursuit of that ultra-neoliberal and right-wing race to the bottom agenda, Boris Johnson was reckless and willing to run the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and the erection of a hard border, which would have been a disaster for this country.<\/p>  <p>  Europe was also very concerned about protecting the Single Market and insofar as the protocol or agreement guarantees no hard border, it is very much to be welcomed.  I have no doubt many officials worked very hard on the details of this arrangement on many levels.  Ultimately, the greatest credit must go to the majority of people, North and South, in this country who utterly reject the Johnson ultra-neoliberal, right-wing, reckless and, frankly, racist agenda and, equally, who have opposed any notion that there should be a border erected between North and South.  That was pressure from ordinary people, with a majority in the North and South recognising that a border would be an absolute disaster.  That pressure guaranteed that we got the protocol.<\/p>  <p>  That is very much to be welcomed and I go further in saying it opens the possibility we should pursue actively of trying to get rid of the Border altogether.  The logic both around Covid and the possible consequences of a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit opens the real possibility of ending the disaster of partition and we should actively pursue a border poll to bring about that end to partition.  It should be one of the key lessons we take out of this.<\/p>  <p>  Having said all that, we should be absolutely clear that the Scottish Parliament voted against this deal.  The Stormont Assembly voted against this deal.  The left in Britain voted against the deal.  Apart from the protocol and guaranteeing no hard border, it is a terrible deal.  It is a terrible deal for fishing communities, for example.  This is not just because of the recklessness of Mr. Johnson but the historic mistreatment of the fishing industry and communities in this country at the hands of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  It is a terrible deal in that it looks to hold on to prohibitions on certain types of state aid.  State aid in Europe and the UK seems to be fine for banks, for example.  They can gamble and wreck the economy but we will have state aid for them.  If we tried to have state aid for public enterprise, public infrastructure or services that ordinary people need, Europe would cry foul, as would the Johnsonites and ultra-neoliberals.<\/p>  <p>  What about the Mercosur deal?  The EU opposes protection against a race to the bottom deal but it has signed up to a rotten Mercosur deal that will flood Europe with cheap beef, damage the interests of small farmers and do immense damage to the environment.  It is good we will not have a hard border, and that has been achieved, but let us not paint this deal in overly rosy colours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000038#LL00100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1611154200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>This agreement ends a chapter in the Brexit saga but it does not bring to an end the tensions between the capitalist powers.  The agreement sets a framework in which ongoing tensions can be increased.  The deal was negotiated and drawn up by representatives of British big business and their European counterparts.  Such an agreement can never be in the fundamental interests of working people in Ireland, Britain or the EU.<\/p>  <p>  On the EU side, Brexit is a major blow but this agreement will allow the Union to protect its Single Market and, by extension, its imperialist trade policies.  On the British side, the deal will allow the Tory Government to move towards its bargain basement Brexit dream of a Singapore-on-Thames, a low-tax, lightly regulated economy that would have a competitive advantage over EU economies.  The Tories do not want to break free from EU state aid rules in order to launch nationalisation, save jobs or redevelop the economy.  Instead, they want to use state aid to boost the profits of British business and boost their competitive edge against competitors in Europe, Japan, China and the US.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement sees a major attack on worker and democratic rights.  Many of the rights enjoyed by ordinary people in Britain and Ireland in each other's jurisdictions have been given some assurance.  Nevertheless, the agreement sees a major attack on the rights of other EU and British citizens in each other's jurisdictions.  These include attacks on the right to live and work, the right to study, the right to social protection and pensions and access to public services.  All these have been diminished.<\/p>  <p>  This is part of a plan to drive a race to the bottom and undermine worker rights.  The deal will also provide for the undermining of consumer rights and, crucially, important environmental standards.  These plans must be met with organised opposition by working people and trade unions, including international solidarity across Britain and the rest of Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The endorsement of the Northern Ireland protocol will be met with relief by many people in Border communities.  A hardening of the North-South Border would have been a major imposition on these communities, causing much economic hardship.  It would also have served as a reminder of the Troubles and partition, thereby increasing sectarian tensions.  However, it must also be noted that the agreement will see a hardening of the east-west border, particularly as the British economy and its regulations diverge.  The deal will add to the legitimate feeling of insecurity of many ordinary Protestants about the future and the sense that they are being coerced into an economic united Ireland.  Socialists are opposed to coercion and stand for a solution to the conflict and the differing national aspirations based on shared worker interests.<\/p>  <p>  Under the protocol, the Northern Ireland Assembly will vote every four years on the arrangements.  This is a blueprint for sectarian conflict and tensions that will be stoked by the likes of the Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and other sectarian forces.  We also note the threat of food shortages in the North and increased food prices North and South.  Workers must not pay the price and the trade union movement has a responsibility to ensure they do not do so.  The calling of a conference of workers' movements, with representatives from communities and workplaces to push back on that threat, would be an important step.<\/p>  <p>  Under capitalism, a system based on competition and cut-throat profiteering, we have seen international relations increasingly being marked by imperialism, conflict and division.  As a socialist and internationalist, I, along with the Socialist Party and Solidarity, stand for a fundamentally different way of organising society.  We stand for a society based on co-operation and we want to register our opposition to this agreement.  Instead of an agreement providing a new framework of imperialist, nationalist and sectarian tensions, we stand for a very different road, where the interests of working people are placed at the forefront.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000038#LL00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1611154800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>As a Member of the Irish Parliament, I would like to congratulate Joe Biden today on his investiture as President of the United States of America.  I hope he will continue to foster and promote the strong relationship and ties between Ireland and the US.<\/p>  <p>  After four years of intense discussion and political posturing, a negotiated future trade agreement between the EU and the UK is very welcome.  The major issues with respect to Ireland's trading and political relationship with the UK appear to have been largely settled in principle, but in practice the new regulatory constraints are fast becoming apparent.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge the work undertaken by our European offices and Government Departments which ensured the continued support of the European Commission for a fair resolution of the UK withdrawal agreement, particularly with respect to the implications of Brexit for Ireland.  The UK has been for many years one of our largest trading partners and is our most accessible market, particularly for our agriculture and food sectors.  The fact that the UK is now considered to be a third country has completely changed what was a frictionless trade relationship.  In the area of food and agricultural exports, this poses the greatest risk in terms of a loss of competitiveness due to the increased regulation and transport costs being forced on the sector.  <\/p>  <p>  Our fishermen face a significant reduction in access and catch over the coming years in UK and EU fishing grounds.  The Government must now liaise with the fishing sector in respect of financial assistance to offset future quota losses.  I call on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to include Dunmore East as a designated port for UK-registered vessels to offload their catches.  Dunmore East harbour has processing facilities on site as well as fisheries protection officers to provide the necessary oversight following inclusion on the list of approved landing ports in Ireland.  This is needed to shorten landing times and reduce the carbon footprint of those vessels accessing southern fishing grounds.<\/p>  <p>  As a consequence of delays in accessing the UK land bridge, exporters are now looking to new direct routes to the Continent.  I welcome the additional services provided at Rosslare by DFDS and Stena Line.  I also remind the Government that we have a very viable bulk port in the south east at Belview, Waterford.  The potential exists here to develop rail freight from this port through a western rail corridor, and I hope to see capital investment in Irish Rail in the near future to achieve this strategic objective which would benefit so many business that require additional import and export options.<\/p>  <p>  One of the new learnings that has come to light is the incredible amount of regulation governing the movement of agricultural base products to and from the UK.  It is apparent that we do not have enough trained customs clearance agents.  Furthermore, phytosanitary checks and origin certificates are causing major delays and imposing additional costs on Irish exporters.  I have been informed that up to eight different software systems, which are not integrated, are now being used to develop documentation for food exports to the UK.  These systems are not integrated with Revenue either.  This is a perilous situation for our food and agricultural sectors.  I urge the Government to convene immediately a specific task force to look at these issues and provide resolution.  We have lauded our export performance for many years, and rightly so, but indigenous producers in this country cannot make up the ground that will be lost by a failure to resolve these logistical and clearance issues as soon as possible.  The Government regularly reminds us that it does not create employment but rather sets the policies to assist market demand.  These new constraints and restrictions have arisen as a result of policy changes, and we need to see Government agencies and Departments responding to these transport issues with appropriate urgency and attention.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of Brexit contingency funding has also been raised by the Government, and many sectors will need support over the coming months to adapt to the new trading conditions.  I hope that in framing its policy response, the Government will support the primary producers in our food, agricultural and manufacturing sectors who will, ultimately, pay the largest price in terms of this new policy implementation.  Everyone who has been following the Brexit saga will feel, on balance, that Ireland's position has been vindicated and supported by our EU colleagues and that the agreement reached is probably as good as we could have hoped for given the political circumstances in the UK.  The UK was and still is our biggest trading partner, and it is to be hoped that will continue to be the case as we learn to manage new ways of doing business and of progressing our relationship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000039#MM00100","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1611154800,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for bringing this motion before the House today.  I will support it reluctantly and with a heavy heart because I recognise that this is part of the formal ratification process by this Parliament of the new EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement.  It is difficult in such a short time to convey adequately my feelings on an event that is so solemn and serious for this country.  The UK and Ireland have been companions on the same European journey for many years, and it is very sad to see that we are parting company now, especially under these circumstances.  Perhaps it is fitting that we are having this debate in this very large and empty chamber because the vacant seats emphasise the fact that we have lost our nearest neighbour and closest friend at EU level.  If we are all honest, the European Union is much worse off because the UK is no longer involved.  It is like <i>Hamlet<\/i>without the prince.  All that the deal before us today does is ensure that there is parity of pain across all of the parties and that all sides to this agreement will be diminished to the same extent.  That is all it achieves and the Minister is aware of that fact.<\/p><p>While I accept the collective and sovereign decision of the entire population of the UK, I am also mindful of the fact that 48% voted to remain.  Remain voters were predominantly those in the younger generations.  Furthermore, Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain but they are being wrenched out of the European Union against their explicit and democratic wishes.  That is an issue that must be resolved.  On top of that, many of those who voted for Brexit did so under false pretences.  They were sold the allure of a Brexit dream which is rapidly becoming a Brexit nightmare.  The truth is starting to emerge now that free trade does not mean frictionless trade and that free travel does not mean frictionless travel.  All of the certainties of the past that we took for granted are no longer in place.  This is another issue that needs to be resolved.  I look forward to Scotland and Northern Ireland returning to their rightful place in the European Union as soon as possible.  I very much look forward to that day.<\/p><p>I compliment and commend all of those on team Ireland who engaged in the Brexit project over the past four years.  Our diplomats and officials and even our politicians tried to strike a deal with a country that seemed hell-bent on an extraordinary act of self harm, which was a very difficult endeavour.  The deal that we have in front of us is not perfect, of course.  It causes huge difficulties for our hauliers, exporters and our fishing and coastal communities, but on balance it is probably the best deal that could have been struck in that it prevents a hard border on this island and ensures that we have direct access to the Single Market.  It also prevents the catastrophic economic consequences that would have resulted from a no-deal, hard Brexit.  On that basis, I will support this deal.<\/p><p>In 1921 a deal was struck that allowed Ireland to withdraw from the United Kingdom.  It is quite ironic that almost exactly 100 years to the day, a new deal is struck that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from Ireland and the wider European Union project.  It is a very, very sad day.  It is sad day for me personally.  I have a lot of contacts all across these islands, and in my previous profession I learned as much on Salisbury Plain as I did on the Curragh Plain.  I wish my British friends the very best for the future but I hope that, in whole or in part, they will return to the European family.

I am really quite sad.  The Minister and I have spoken about this several times.  Indeed, I attended a number of briefings with him and the then Taoiseach throughout 2019 and earlier.  I know the Minister has put endless hours, including hours of debate, into this matter.  It is a massive blow to our economy, our agriculture and fisheries sectors and trade more broadly.  Shortly before Christmas, Deputy Verona Murphy, who was formerly involved in the road haulage business, and I raised the issues facing us.  It was like it was getting dark towards nightfall.  The Ministers and their officials told us blatantly that everything would be hunky-dory, that everything was in order and that everything that needed to be in place was in place.  Sadly, very little was in place.<\/p>  <p>  I heard a lady from Revenue the other morning giving out about how the hauliers did not have all their paperwork in order.  Hauliers, and all other businesses, are snowed under with paperwork.  I believe that the issue of paperwork and bureaucracy was one of the main reasons the British disengaged from the EU.  Our mandarins here are exemplary at putting more paperwork, rules and regulations on top of all of that.  We do not have access ports and we have not thought of new initiatives and ways to get our goods to the UK.  We were all informed by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and others that everything was going to be hunky-dory.  Officials told us that.  Is there any accountability for the officials who told us that and let us believe it?  They put their heads in a bag and decided everything was grand.  A multiplicity of problems was staring us in the face.  <\/p>  <p>  The fishing industry was traded and sold out.  It happened in 1973 when the Minister's late dad was in the D&aacute;il - God rest him - and it has now happened again.  It has been the sacrificial lamb and has been destroyed.  Mr. Barnier, who was supposed to be the EU's trade commissioner, was looking after the French fishermen at the expense of the Irish fishermen.  Deputy Michael Collins asked from where the percentage of the fishing quota being spoken about was to come.  It was our fish that was being talked about.  It was Irish people's fish and Irish people whose livelihoods in the fishing industry were to be decimated.  It has happened as sure as night follows day and as sure as it gets dark and there is a morning after.  We have such a bureaucratic system.  What do we do?  We allow one of our senior civil servants to take over the Department of Health and reward him with an extra &euro;81,000 a year.  It is time they were held accountable to the people and had to face them.  They are not fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  We had plenty of warning.  The British people decided.  The previous Deputy said that he was sorry and that they had made a mistake.  They are sovereign.  Unlike Ireland, where we were made vote twice for the Lisbon and Nice treaties, they respect democracy over there.  They gave us plenty of warning but we did not heed it and we now have a mess to engage with.

Obviously, we in this country wanted a Brexit deal to be agreed.  It is certain that nobody here wanted a hard border.  We did not, however, want a deal at the cost at which it has come for certain sectors.  I put the blame for how the Irish fishing sector has been affected firmly on the Irish Government.<\/p>  <p>  I have consistently called on the Government to be straight with the fisheries sector and the public as to why it sold out the entire sector during Brexit negotiations.  The Government and its Ministers have attempted to downplay the impact on, and damage to, the Irish fisheries sectors through constant spin.  For instance, on Christmas Eve, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, claimed that the total loss to Irish fishermen would be &euro;34 million following the agreed Brexit deal.  The Minister shockingly spun this to suggest that it somehow represented a fair deal.  Not only is the Minister's position astonishing, but it also represents a deep betrayal of the entire sector and every coastal community.<\/p>  <p>  The latest analysis released by officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine illustrates how out of touch the Minister really is on this issue, as are all Ministers for that matter.  The preliminary analysis now confirms that the transfer of quota shares from Ireland is a staggering 27% higher than the Minister initially announced.  The official report indicates a total loss to Ireland's fishermen of &euro;43 million by 2026, with the mackerel sector, which is the most vulnerable element of the Irish fleet, hardest hit.  This sector faces a 26% cut in quota share, which is worth &euro;28.6 million.  Approximately 60% of this cut will emerge in 2021 so the impact will be felt immediately.  The enormity of the difference between what the Minister stated and the actual figures merits a full investigation.  Such gross incompetence is intolerable and will cost thousands of jobs as it ends livelihoods around the coast.<\/p>  <p>  I pleaded with the Minister, with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and with the Taoiseach in the run-up to this deal to get involved with the negotiator, Michel Barnier.  Unfortunately, while Emmanuel Macron was fully involved in negotiations in terms of what was going on, our Deputies and Ministers were completely out of touch and they have now done a shocking deal.  The deal on Irish fish represents a dreadful loss to Ireland.  I again put on the record of the D&aacute;il that I have called for a minister for fisheries.  I have been ignored and so has the fishing community of Ireland.  History will show that this Government has sold our waters and our Irish fish again.  Unfortunately, I have run out of time.

Perhaps other Deputies might get a chance to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000040#NN00400","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1611155400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I have to put on the record that I acknowledge the Trojan efforts and work of the Minister and his officials.

Regulatory barriers are a problem.<\/p> <p>This is one of them.  We hear much about data protection.  We must look after our businesses here; they are bad enough with the coronavirus and everything else.  These invoices should not need to be shown.  There should be some other way such as a customs clearance certificate not specifying the value of their goods or how much they paid for them.  I ask the Minister to ensure that problem is sorted out.<\/p> <p> There is agri-friction in respect of the British bringing beef and other food into their country.  That will definitely have a negative impact on our farmers and we must do our best to ensure that we do not accommodate those outside sources in the European Union in order to counteract them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000040#NN00600","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611156000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>We have only been dealing with Covid-19 and its impacts for a year now, whereas Brexit feels like the never-ending saga.  It is almost five years since the Brexit vote.  It has taken five years to get us to this point where an EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement was finally agreed by negotiators on Christmas Eve 2020 and was provisionally applicable from 1 January 2021.  At that time, the EU was given until 28 February 2021 to ratify the agreement.  This involves the complex legal text being translated and there are reports that an extension will be sought until the end of April.<\/p><p>One of the pieces of literature available online is the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement - A New Relationship with Big Changes - Overview of Consequences and Benefits.  It is a two-page bullet-pointed synopsis of EU-UK relations.  In the Trade and Goods section, for example, it states a consequence of the UK leaving the EU is that the &quot;UK goods no longer benefit from free movement of goods, leading to more red tape for businesses and adjustments in EU-UK supply chains.&quot;  However, it points out that a benefit of there being an agreement means &quot;Zero tariffs or quotas on goods traded, ensuring lower prices for consumers - provided agreed rules of origin are met.&quot;  It seems as childish as the &quot;Good Idea - Bad Idea&quot; skit on &quot;Animaniacs&quot;.<\/p><p>The agreement is necessary for both the UK and members of the EU.  Much of the conversation about the impact of Brexit on our island is rightly about the threat to peace and the return of a hard border on the island.  Many of the day-to-day impacts are on the people working in the fishing industry; people who did not swop over their drivers' licences; websites with a &quot;<i>.ie<\/i>&quot; domain which use a UK company for distribution; and NGOs reliant on EU funding etc.  These are just a few examples of issues that have been highlighted in recent weeks.  The wider impacts have yet to be seen and we also have the double-whammy of Brexit plus Covid-19 level 5 restrictions to deal with.<\/p><p>Regarding security and thematic co-operation, the two-page document states a consequence of the UK leaving the EU is that the &quot;UK no longer participates in or shapes rules of EU agencies for police and judicial cooperation (Europol, Eurojust) and no longer benefits from privileged cooperation amongst police and judicial authorities&quot;.  However, it lists benefits of this agreement including &quot;Arrangements for a strong cooperation between national police and judicial authorities of the UK and Member States, including on surrender.&quot;<\/p><p>Late last year, Dr. Vicky Conway, produced a very useful paper on Brexit and cross-border policing.  In the paper, Dr. Conway raised excellent points about the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI and the mechanisms which have been used to strengthen cross-border policing and security co-operation on the island of Ireland, particularly in areas such as child protection.  How will these now be impacted by Brexit?<\/p><p>A very worrying part of the impact of the trade deal is the fiasco that we have seen this week regarding UK-registered fishing vessels operating in Irish waters.  How could the Government in the three years since the Brexit deal not have considered this issue?  It has meant that fishermen have had to push and lobby to have a realistic operating procedure put in place.  With the announcement on Monday, the Minister has moved to allay some of the problems but is this all that he could come up?  This will go on for a long time yet.  When we consider that fishing and quotas were to the fore in every discussion about Brexit over the last three years, how did this situation arise?  In what other Departments and areas could other problems arise?  What has the Government been doing over the last three years if this is what we get? <\/p><p>When we look at how the quota situation was dealt with, we see that the problems are even bigger with the Government and the Department.  It seems that the fishery organisations decided to team up with the coastal states to protect our fishing rights.  The State also seems to have done so and that really worked out well for us and our fishing communities, as we can see.  We have ended up losing 15% of our fishing quotas which translates to 24% of mackerel which is particularly bad because we could have caught all our mackerel quota within Irish waters if we wanted too.  However, the Government and fishing organisations insisted that we could not mention that.  Let us now consider where it has got us. <\/p><p>At least if the Government had the guts to say that we are going to sell fishing down the tubes to get other things, we might have some respect for that stance.  If our so-called partners had said if we had wanted them to support the Good Friday Agreement, they wanted our fishing to go, it might be explainable.  However, the Government is constantly selling the line that we are all in it together, which is simply not the case.  If the Minister were serious about that, he would announce today that he would push for a complete renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy, but I doubt he will do that.<\/p><p>For this reason, I will not support this deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000041#OO00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1611156000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>As a Member of the European Parliament for about three years during the Brexit negotiations, I had a dual perspective.  As an Irish MEP, I worked with others to ensure overwhelming support in the European Parliament for the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and no hardening of the Irish Border.  Equally, from a distance as it were, I could see Brexit through the eyes of MEPs from different member states.  Throughout that entire process Irish politicians and officials in Dublin and Brussels were efficient and coherent.  They were on top of the issues and crucially worked hand-in-glove with the EU negotiators.  I believe we took the right decision and I was proud as an Irish MEP to see how our national politicians and officials played such an important role in negotiations.  We often talk about punching above our weight and we certainly did that with Brexit.<\/p><p>In his departing address last night, President Trump spoke of the importance of luck.  We were lucky with Michel Barnier as lead negotiator.  Apart from his abilities and his sound judgment and that of his team, Michel Barnier had context.  As Regional Affairs Commissioner, he oversaw the setting up of the PEACE funds.  He knew the history and the background; he had context.  That was very important when it came to issues like the Good Friday Agreement.  All of that filtered through the negotiations and was vital.  I am delighted that he is to be honoured by the Institute of International and European Affairs.  Commissioner Sefcovic also hit the ground running.  I also recognise the role of Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's lead negotiator, who fully supported Ireland's position.  I was delighted to be able to welcome him to Ireland for a few days during those negotiations when he got a real sense of the impact of Brexit and the Border on local communities, SMEs and agriculture.<\/p><p>However, we are where we are.  Earlier the T&aacute;naiste spoke about the Brexit fund and how well we had done from that fund.  However, how we spend that money will be crucial.  I have read the Commission's proposal on the fund.  At 41 pages, it is not a long document.  The word &quot;territorial&quot; is mentioned 14 times and the word &quot;cohesion&quot; is mentioned 31 times.  The Commission's intent is clear.  I will quote one short sentence from the proposal:<\/p> <blockquote> \t...it is appropriate that Member States, when designing support measures, focus in particular on the regions, areas and local communities...most negatively impacted by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom [from the Union]. <\/blockquote>  <p>It is crucial that the Government takes that into consideration.  As the greatest negative impact is being felt in the north west and the Border region, that is where the bulk of this fund must be spent.<\/p> <p>The Government must commit to territorial balance, which is what is referred to in the EU regulation.  The fund, therefore, has to be largely regionally-specific.  It is a fund which will support the agrifood sector, SMEs, retraining and upskilling and, hopefully, Internet access so we can be part of the digital economy.  I reiterate that the Brexit support fund must be spent in a way which will help support those regions worst affected.  Enterprise Ireland figures released this week show that the drop in employment nationally was 0.4% in 2020, but the highest drop in any region was in the north west, where it was 2.9%.  Some of that loss of employment was because of Covid-19, but some of it was also because of Brexit.  The north-west and the Border region had also been previously downgraded from a development region to a region in transition.  When the Government is deciding where and how to spend these funds, I ask that it keep to the original territorial cohesion objective of the Commission.  In other words, that is balanced regional development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000041#OO00300","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611156600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies from all sides of the House who participated in today's session.  The trade and co-operation agreement and indeed the broader questions regarding our bilateral relationship with the UK, are vital issues for everybody on this island.  It is appropriate that the D&aacute;il should be fully engaged in considering the issues arising.  I echo the call made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs for unity today.  There will be a question and answer session tomorrow, when the Minister and I will be here.  There will also be a question and answer session with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue on fisheries.  There is no end of time for any motions which parties might want to table regarding Europe, fishing and-or any other aspects.  Today, however, is a day on which this D&aacute;il should show a united front.  The united front which all parties showed in recent years was a major source of strength to both Governments in their negotiations.  The eyes of Europe are watching the D&aacute;il today.  I take this opportunity to thank the parties for co-operation which we have seen, and which I have referred to, in recent years.  It has been appreciated.<\/p>  <p>  The changes to our relationship with the UK are comprehensive.  Generations of citizens, including me, were born during the period of our shared European Union membership.  We never had to think about the invisible web of co-operation implicit in membership.  For the first time in almost 50 years, however, we are engaging with the United Kingdom outside of that shared framework.  A new framework is in place, however.  Imperfect though it is, it is there and it is what we will have to work with.<\/p>  <p>  We are fully aware, and Members have outlined this aspect in great detail, of the challenges of the new situation, especially for the business and trading communities.  I have heard first-hand from traders who are finding real difficulty in adapting to the requirements of the co-operation and trade agreement and the requirements arising from Britain's decision to leave the Single Market and the customs union.  The Government is listening closely to what Deputies and industry representatives are saying, and we have been doing that for quite some time.  I remember the Taoiseach outlining that aspect.<\/p>  <p>  We see the difficulties occurring directly as a result of Britain deciding to leave the European Union.  Those difficulties are multiplying daily, particularly in Britain.  We will continue to work with business and other stakeholders to ensure that they have all the information they need to comply with the requirements of the new situation.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach referred to the considerable supports available to businesses.  Fundamental change has occurred in the way the European Union does business with the United Kingdom.  We would have preferred if that had not happened, and we said that all along.  All these changes, however, are direct consequences of decisions made by the British people and, subsequently, the British Government.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, the European Union offered a much closer comprehensive trading relationship.  Britain took a different path.  This is regrettable, but it is a reality of that decision made by Britain and we have had to adapt to it.  The quicker that we adapt, the better our interests will be protected.<\/p>  <p>  We already see huge adaptations in transportation to the Continent.  Our ambassador to France, H.E. Patricia O'Brien, was in Cherbourg several days ago.  She was told that normally 35,000 Irish trucks go through that port, based on the 2019 figures, but that up to 9,000 or 10,000 Irish trucks have already gone through Cherbourg this year.  We have also seen the establishment of many new services going directly to the Continent.  Rosslare Europort has seen a trebling of services, including daily services to France.  Brittany Ferries has a weekly service, Stena Line has a service from Dublin and we have also seen the announcement of the load on, load off service from Dublin to Amsterdam.  Stena Line has also put a new ship running from Rosslare, a ship which I understand came off of a British ferry route.  DFDS has launched its Rosslare to Dunkirk route and CLdN has established routes from Dublin to Zeebrugge, Santander and Portugal.  That may not be a comprehensive list, but a raft of new services has been created.  By the way, if any company is thinking of putting on services such as those I mentioned, all those new routes are heavily booked and there is a strong market in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  We have invested significant resources, as the Taoiseach outlined, to ensure we have been as prepared as possible for the new arrangements.  We will continue to work hand-in-hand with industry.  I thank all the officials at every level of the public service who have worked really hard in recent years.  I refer not only to those in the areas of diplomacy and trade, but also to officials in Customs, the HSE, the Office of Public Works, OPW, and had many other Departments, who have been working hard to ensure that the requisite infrastructure is in place.  That infrastructure can be seen by driving just five minutes down the road to Dublin Port.<\/p>  <p>  The challenges we, and Britain, are facing are a direct result of Britain's departure from the European Union.  This shows us how valuable the Single Market is to us and why it was first put in place, with Britain as the driving force in that process.  It is a tragedy to see delays and food rotting with truck drivers and importers bypassing Britain and trying to come directly to Ireland.  All the hassle and bureaucracy now being experienced had been stopped by the Single Market.  We are part of that Single Market, however, and we can continue to avail of it.  Our place is at the heart of Europe.  Our European Union partners have been our closest allies throughout this process and they will continue to be.  This has been clearly shown in the way they made it their priority to ensure that the unique ways in which Brexit affects this island would be recognised in the withdrawal agreement and in the trade and co-operation agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier, the Taoiseach touched on the importance of the protocol for Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Together with the trade and co-operation agreement, the protocol plays an extremely important part in mitigating, but not eliminating, the effects of Brexit on this island, North and South.  Ensuring its effective application in a way that works for those on the ground is our priority.  We will be engaging with the European Union in that regard, including as part of our membership of the specialised committees on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.<\/p>  <p>  Right from the start, even before the Brexit referendum took place, the D&aacute;il has consistently played a central role.  This engagement has ensured that the complex issues involved have been fully understood and communicated to citizens.  The D&aacute;il has demonstrated to our external partners how seriously Ireland takes these issues in respect of engagement at the heart of our democracy.  We gave public voice to a cross-party commitment to protecting Ireland's interests as well as is possible during what has been a challenging process.  Ensuring that the D&aacute;il and the Oireachtas remained properly apprised of developments arising from Britain's departure from the EU has been, and is, a priority for the Government.  I thank our civil servants who did several direct briefings with Members of the Oireachtas in recent weeks.  That can happen again, if necessary.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs made clear, and as has been underlined by many interventions, we all regret that the structures of our relationship with Britain can no longer be as close as they were.  The agreement, however, represents a firm commitment from all of us, the EU and Britain, to work together comprehensively and it is an implicit recognition that our prosperity, our businesses, our citizens' lives and our futures will remain intertwined.  After the challenges, frustrations and delays which have characterised the Brexit process, a new chapter is beginning.  The trade and co-operation agreement gives us some of the most important tools we need to navigate the challenges ahead.  Many of those challenges will remain and we will never eliminate them.<\/p> <p>Britain has decided to leave and has left the Single Market and the customs union.  Those challenges that have arisen will remain.  We can mitigate those challenges but we cannot eliminate them.<\/p> <p> I thank businesses for the role they have played in this over the past years.  I believe they are, even still, learning a lot.  This is welcome and we do understand their concern.  Please bring forward the concerns to me or to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about issues that may arise.  Some issues have arisen over the first few weeks of January, which is natural with a new system.  The Revenue Commissioners in particular have responded in a very pragmatic way.  Undoubtedly, the Government is remaining in touch with the European Commission about the application of the agreement to ensure the agreement does what it is supposed to do and that we can get every possible benefit from it.  That benefit, however, will never be the same as Britain being a member of the European Union.<\/p> <p> I was struck by Deputy Cathal Berry's sadness at Britain leaving the European Union.  I am sad too, and I want this on the record.  It was a bad move by Britain and I believe they are now coming to see the consequences of that.  They remain, and always will be, a very important partner for Ireland.  The Taoiseach is absolutely committed to rekindling that crucial relationship between Britain and Ireland.  I am aware that Britain is keen to do that too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000042#PP00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1611157200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 18; N\u00edl, 27; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies P\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn and Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Murch\u00fa; N\u00edl, Deputies Jack Chambers and Marc \u00d3 Cathasaigh.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000043#QQ00200","aye":["1478","1625","1525","1495","1461","1579","1449","1506","1605","1487","1463","1466","1550","1467","1498","1547","1504","1513"],"nay":["1549","1523","1503","1483","1480","1475","1570","1457","1481","1601","1584","1562","1600","1552","1620","1609","1472","1568","1511","1554","1516","1477","1521","1617","1484","1514","1596"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1611157500,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Motion put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes: Statements (Resumed)","time":1611157500,"counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000044#RR00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1611157500,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Troy.  Last week, the report of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes was published.  Following this, the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, offered our apology and asked for forgiveness for the failings of the Irish State, failings that repeated over decades and which had the most horrendous consequences for our most vulnerable citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The report is an enormous piece of work, and it will take time for all it discloses about what happened in these institutions to be fully understood.  Today, Deputies have the opportunity to reflect on the many failings on the part of both the State and individual religious congregations, and, most important, to reflect on the devastating impact these failings had on mothers and children.  In my contribution, I will outline in more detail elements of the Government's action plan in response to the report and update the House on progress on key issues like the right of access to personal information and restorative recognition.<\/p>  <p>  In the discussion of the commission&rsquo;s report over the past week, it is clear that survivors have been left disappointed by aspects of the report, particularly the tone and language used in the executive summary.  They have cited sections where a strictly legalistic approach is taken to describing the profoundly personal impacts of what happened within the institutions, as well as sections where the commission&rsquo;s conclusion that it could not find evidence of what happened could be interpreted as a denial of the experiences of survivors.  I understand that disappointment.  As I stated yesterday in the Seanad, when I read the report the aspect that had the greatest impact on me was the chapter on the confidential committee.  It is the clearest possible account of the suffering of mothers and children.  It tells of the lived experience of those who spent time in these institutions.  It makes it clear that women were compelled by circumstances, over which they had no control and no choice, to put their children up for adoption.  The words of the confidential committee represent the truth of what happened in these institutions over so many years.<\/p>  <p>  When the Taoiseach made his apology last week, he made it on behalf of the State.  Having had the opportunity to read through the report in its entirety, it illustrates gross dereliction of duty by the Irish State across decades.  The State&rsquo;s failings are unambiguously demonstrated, and this is especially so because the report shows that serious concerns were brought to those in power time and again but without action ensuing.  Our own officials were flagging the conditions within these institutions, the high infant mortality rate and the poor health of children.  There was not complete silence.  Repeatedly, warnings were raised but they were ignored.  As I referenced in the D&aacute;il last week, Alice Litster was an inspector for the Department of Local Government for 30 years, between 1927 and 1957.  From reading the chapters on the individual institutions, it is clear that Ms Litster tried valiantly to improve the conditions within them.<\/p> <p>She raised concerns about the number of young children within them, highlighting the number of school age children who were being denied an education, and demanded that local authorities provide suitable care and foster homes for these children.  Miss Litster cautioned about the level of adoptions to the USA.  In an undated memo on adoptions from Sean Ross, she noted that:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe babies so sent are the best of our children in the Home, the prettiest, the healthiest, the most promising.  The restrictions on sending children out of the country, to be incorporated it is hoped in an Adopted Children&rsquo;s Bill, will doubtless put a stop to this export of children. <\/blockquote> <p>In 1947 Miss Litster commented that many Tuam mothers received no antenatal care.  She criticised the county manager for issuing an order that prohibited the admission of expectant mothers, chargeable to Galway County Council, prior to the seventh month of pregnancy.  She suggested that this would place a good deal of hardship upon women whose condition must become a matter of common knowledge before they are admitted and whose efforts to conceal their condition must have a bad effect upon the health of their infants.<br\/><br\/>Miss Litster issued constant warnings of overcrowding and how this was a feature of all &quot;special institutions&quot;, highlighting the severity of the situation at hand and the detrimental effects this was having on women and children.  In 1943, Miss Litster provided a detailed report of the children&rsquo;s nursery in Bessborough.  In this, she described how:<\/p><blockquote>\t  \tThe greater numbers of the babies were &lsquo;miserable scraps of humanity, wizened, some emaciated and almost all had rash and sores all over their bodies, faces, hands and heads&rsquo;.   <\/blockquote> <p>Miss Litster was determined, and although few improvements were happening, she persevered.  It is from her reports that we have undeniable evidence of the failure of the State to intervene, even after the horrors of these institutions were made known.  Her efforts on behalf of the vulnerable mothers and children in these institutions should be remembered.<br\/><br\/>The failings of the State is not just represented by Government Departments ignoring the evidence of what was happening.  The report shows that local authorities were intrinsic to the running of these institutions, in terms of paying for many of the mothers who entered them.  County homes were a direct arm of the local authority.  We know that meetings of Galway County Council actually took place in the buildings of the institution in Tuam.  Many of us here in this House have served in local government and we are all conscious of the real the real commitment of those bodies to improving their local area.  I found it striking to think just how directly complicit these bodies were in the regime that existed for so long.  I understand that a number of local authorities are currently considering making apologies for their involvement and maintenance of the system of treatment of women and children demonstrated in this report and I think such steps are necessary and important.<br\/><br\/>The scale of these failures by the State requires a response that is comprehensive and meaningful.  It must represent a transformation, not only in the State&rsquo;s engagement with survivors, but also in its supports for them.  The relationship of trust between former residents and the State has been broken.  The Government must now begin the process of rebuilding that relationship.<br\/><br\/>The Cabinet has adopted a whole-of-government response to the commission report.  This contains 22 actions based on eight themes many of which directly address the concerns and needs of survivors today.  All of us have received representations regarding the importance that many former residents place on access to personal information.  Progressing information and tracing legislation is an absolute priority for me, for the Taoiseach and for the entire Government.  I have been engaging extensively with the Attorney General on this issue, approaching the matter in a manner grounded in GDPR, where the right of an individual to access personal information about themselves is central.  My Department and the Office of the Attorney General are working with a view to have heads of a Bill on information and tracing legislation by the end March or early April 2021.  This can then proceed rapidly to pre-legislative scrutiny.<br\/><br\/>Information and tracing legislation will allow for access to wider early life information.  It would also allow the National Contact Preference Register to be put on a statutory footing.  However, I want to emphasise to Deputies that our work on this legislation will not delay other efforts to provide earlier access to personal information.<br\/><br\/>My Department is working intensively to prepare for receipt of the commission archive at the end of February.  I wish to ensure that people can access personal information contained within the archive in line with GDPR.  We have established a dedicated information management unit, headed by an official with data protection and legal expertise who will be supported by an archivist in advancing many of the important record-related recommendations put forward by the commission.  I have also engaged with the Data Protection Commissioner and have met with independent international experts in the area of GDPR.  This intensive work will continue with a view to having robust policies and procedures in place for managing subject access requests.  Following further consultation with Data Protection Commissioner, I hope to publish our policies and procedures prior to 28 February so that people can understand the processes that we will apply.  My Department will also continue to work to ensure that GDPR compliant policies are appropriately applied to all access points for personal information.<br\/><br\/>Beyond the issue of access to personal information, another core commitment in the Government&rsquo;s response is the creation of a restorative recognition scheme to provide financial recognition.  My Department will lead an interdepartmental group which will develop such a scheme and bring forward proposals for it by the end of April.  I have already written to relevant Government Departments seeking nominations for membership of this group.  While the group will consider the three categories of former residents the commission highlighted, the Government took the significant decision that its considerations are not restricted to just those three groups.<br\/><br\/>This interdepartmental group will also assess the provision of a form of enhanced medical card for everyone who spent more than six months in mother and baby homes and county homes.  Further health supports include access to counselling through the National Counselling Service, within which former residents of mother and baby homes and county homes are now considered a prioritised group, meaning they will not be put on a general waiting list.  The National Counselling Service has specific professional expertise with past trauma and childhood trauma, and can offer crisis counselling, or counselling services on a short-, medium- or long-term basis.<br\/><br\/>Legislation to allow for the dignified exhumation of the site in Tuam and in other sites, if required, and providing for DNA identification will be brought for pre-legislative scrutiny soon.  I have written to the joint Oireachtas committee asking for it to be prioritised on its agenda.  It is important that proper memorialisation of Ireland&rsquo;s history of institutionalisation and institutional abuse takes place.  It is particularly important that the testimonies of women are heard, among both our generation and the generations that will come after us.  We have committed to establishing a national memorial and records centre related to institutional trauma and will be engaging with survivors, as well as professional archivists and historians, to determine how best memorialisation should happen.  This includes both the location of the centre as well as how best records should be handled, taking into account the sensitivities of people&rsquo;s personal information.  We will also ensure that Departments and State bodies prioritise the transfer of original files to the National Archives so that they can be publicly accessible.<br\/><br\/>The overarching theme is that this action list will be progressed in a survivor-centred manner.  An enhanced model of engagement with former residents, their representative groups and with the wider survivor diaspora will be established, following consultation with the collaborative forum.  This week I have written to the collaborative forum, seeking two meetings with it in the near future to discuss these issues.<br\/><br\/>Other commitments from the Government's response are: the incorporation of elements of this report into the second level curriculum; research on terminology, representation and misrepresentation with NUIG and ensuring that this research informs our commitments on memorialisation and national archives; local and national memorialisation and commemoration events; the creation of a specific fund which supports children who experience disadvantage in memory of the children who died in these institutions; and the creation of a number of scholarships researching childhood disadvantage.<br\/><br\/>In regard to this last point, I have written to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and have asked if he would consider naming a scholarship after Alice Litster, to mark her efforts to shine a light on what was happening in these institutions over many years.<br\/><br\/>As I said at the outset, trust between the State and former residents has been broken because of the State&rsquo;s failures.  It is up to the Government, acting on behalf of the State, to start to rebuild that trust.  This means acting comprehensively and acting rapidly, aware of the age of many of former residents and their need to see the tangible benefits of the actions that have been committed to.  As a Government, we are aware that our apology and the apology delivered by the Taoiseach will ring hollow if it is not backed up by concrete actions.<\/p> <p>I have outlined timelines for progression of some of the actions above and I will outline further details to the House in the forthcoming weeks.<\/p> <p> As Deputies know, there will also be engagement with the religious congregations and charities that were directly responsible for running these institutions.  I have sought meetings with a number of bodies specifically on the issue of an apology, the issue of their contribution to restorative recognition and the provision of institutional records which would be beneficial to survivors.  The State has recognised, and seeks to atone for, its failures in a meaningful way.  We all, in this House, share the belief that others need to do the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000044#RR00300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611158400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>The report of the commission of investigation into the history of these institutions has provided the Irish people of the present day with a shocking insight into a very harrowing chapter of our nation's past.  It is a buried past, a past that was buried live and buried for too long.  The report has revealed to us that Ireland was a very cold and harsh place for women who found themselves in a certain situation.  It was a situation, in a lot of cases, that was outside their control, a situation in which the women and girls did nothing wrong only to fall pregnant.  They did nothing wrong and they have nothing to be ashamed of.<\/p>  <p>  The report finally gives survivors and their families what they have been denied for decades.  It finally gives these women a voice.  No longer will they be silenced.  No longer will they be stigmatised.  No longer will they be looked down on.  No longer will they be made to feel worthless.  No longer will they be made to feel like they are a stain on society.  What did these women do that was so wrong?  They fell pregnant out of wedlock, some as young as 12, some of them rape victims, some victims of incest, some in love with their partners but with no family acceptance when they became pregnant.  They were forced into mother and baby homes, homes that showed no respect, no care, no support, no encouragement and no compassion.  Instead, they were shamed, abused verbally and emotionally and stigmatised.<\/p>  <p>  During this time, society, the church and the State stood idly by.  They looked on, they ignored the issues and they swept them under the carpet.  For families, it was easier to see their daughter in a mother and baby home than to face the stigma of the church.  There is a very disturbing contrast in what happened then when one considers the boundless joy and happiness that the news of a pregnancy brings to a couple, their families and friends in today's Ireland, regardless of the circumstances and regardless of their marital status.  The former residents of these institutions did nothing wrong and they have nothing to be ashamed of.  I am hopeful that those survivors who are with us today know this in their hearts.  For those who may not and who are still struggling on that journey in any way, I truly hope that they may some day find peace in the realisation that they are not to blame and they did nothing wrong.<\/p>  <p>  We must acknowledge and respect that the publication of this report would simply not have been possible without the contribution of former residents of the homes who undertook such a difficult task and revisited what must have been a very painful chapter from their own personal history for the greater good.  I know many are not happy with the report's findings.  They feel it does not accurately reflect their testimonials and their lived experience.  We must accept their criticisms.  These are the women who lived in the homes.  These are the women who gave birth in the homes and saw their babies die or be taken from them.  It is hard, as a woman, to read the report, knowing what childbirth is like, and to think of the fear, pain, hurt and desolation these young women and girls, some of them only teenagers, went through and what childbirth was like for them, only to have their babies wrenched from their arms.<\/p>  <p>  Some babies were adopted into good homes in the US, Canada, the UK and here at home.  Some were educated, had siblings and had opportunities.  Many others did not get those opportunities.  Young boys and girls were boarded out to work on farms or in service as servants, with no education and no family home.  They were punished for their birthright.  Those children had their lives stolen from them, with many still paying the price.  It is hard to comprehend the findings of the report regarding the 9,000 babies who, sadly, died in these homes.  The report states that the children of unmarried mothers were hidden from the public gaze.  There was no national outcry in regard to the high infant mortality rates, except from a small number of medical professionals, as the Minister indicated.  The report states, \"It is particularly disquieting that the high mortality rate was known to the authorities both local and national...\"  I believe it is more than disquieting.  I believe it is an absolute scandal and outrage that no one said a word and that 9,000 babies were never given a chance.<\/p>  <p>  Where to next?  I welcome the apologies last week from the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on behalf of the State.  I welcome the apology from the church and the Bon Secours order, but I also await their actions because actions speak louder than words.  An apology on its own is not good enough.  These women need action now, they need redress, they need recognition and they need remembrance.  Most of all, they need their records.  That is why the information and tracing legislation has to, and will be, a priority.  I accept that a balance must be struck in this in order to respect birth mothers who may not wish to be identified publicly.  We need to respect these women.  They have been through enough.  Now is the time to make it right and to say again that they are not to blame.<\/p>  <p>  I want to reiterate what the Taoiseach and the Minister said when they reassured survivors, their families and the country that the Government is determined to act on all the recommendations of the report and to deliver the legislative change necessary, at least, to start to heal the wounds that endure.  As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I believe there is a responsibility on all of us who have been affected by the publication of the report, and it is hard reading, to apply what we are feeling and what we have learned to help the many vulnerable people who are enduring shame and stigma as a result of personal issues in our society today.  We must strive to be more inclusive and understanding of those who are suffering or struggling for whatever reason.  Such understanding and compassion were in short supply in the mother and baby homes.  The women who gave birth there did nothing wrong and they have nothing to be ashamed of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000046#TT00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1611158400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I often drove by a former mother and baby home in Castlepollard in my county.  Ignorantly, I never really thought deeply enough about the history associated with buildings like it.  Mother and baby homes were large, prominent places.  Like industrial schools, Magdalen laundries and mental institutions, they were where Ireland hid her unwanted in plain sight.  What could not be seen behind those walls was the hurt, humiliation and abuse inflicted on so many.  Inside the institutions, those experiences, while not universal, were definitely widespread.<\/p>  <p>  The leaking of the report of the commission of investigation, before it was subsequently published, was partly a continuation of that hurt.  In plain sight and in a considered act of contempt, the report was leaked to one media outlet before it was shared with survivors.  That was wrong and the person responsible should be identified and sanctioned.  When it was shared with survivors, it was provided electronically only.  Again, this was wrong and I do not accept that a hard copy could not have been provided to each survivor.  I understand that efforts are now being made to do so.  There was a conspiracy involving at least one person in leaking the report.  There was none in the manner in which it was shared.  Very simply, official Ireland, with a thoughtlessness that was inadvertently cruel, treated it as just another business document and proceeded on a business-as-usual basis.<\/p>  <p>  For those who survived these institutions, and for the memory of those who died in them, the commission's report was not business as usual.  It was the story of their life and of their death.<\/p> <p>On my behalf I apologise to them for the events of the past ten days.  I share their anger and distress.  Survivors deserve better from those of us in government.  Politicians are not an annex to official Ireland.  Our vocation is to lead by challenging consensus and doing things differently and better.  On this occasion we failed, and that is unacceptable.  It is an irony, having historically established a consensus that shuttered people by their tens of thousands - people who were abandoned at their most vulnerable - that we would re-enact by design and default those same attitudes today.<\/p> <p> Much discussion during the past week has been about where blame lies.  Unfortunately, the role and responsibility of individual families in this dark part of our social history cannot be wished away.  The role of the fathers - the men who fathered the children - cannot be wished away.  I will leave to historians the complex circular conversation about where, between the prevailing popular culture, the unjustified power of the Catholic Church and the political responsibility, the ultimate cause lay.  The truth I want to speak about today is the responsibility of the State, on behalf of all the people, to step forward now.  I am certain responsibility for what happens next lies with those of us in government, with those elected to the D&aacute;il and with our leaders in the church.  The concern in government and for all Members of the Oireachtas must be about what we do next, how quickly we can deliver on the comprehensive range of supports identified by the commission and how sensitively and appropriately we can do so.<\/p> <p> Countless apologies from men across the House may run shallow in the ears of the survivors, but I must add my voice to them.  I too am sorry.<\/p> <p> As members of the Government it is our duty to make life better for survivors.  That can only be based on a real relationship of respect.  This respect begins by truly listening to our survivors.  We have a duty as a Government to explain in detail how we will advance the rights of survivors to their own information.  I am delighted the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, whose sincerity is not in question, has confirmed that this is now possible.  This must be immediately advanced.  In parallel, deep thought and appropriate resources must be provided for facilitating contact between children from the homes and their parents.  Survivors must have access to their testimony to the commission.  An appropriate forum should be provided for those who wish to put on record their dissatisfaction with the commission's report.  Mothers from the homes must have access to their files.  A system of compensation must be brought forward quickly.<\/p> <p> Irish history has long been his-story.  Women were and remain completely absent from all decision-making roles in the Catholic Church.  They were almost as absent from the deliberations of the State.  As a practising Catholic, I am deeply ashamed that such a system could exist, let alone be inflicted on the vulnerable in the name of mercy.  I say as much today not in my name, or in the name of my neighbours who I meet at Mass, or in the name of priests and nuns - now old and few - who have served and continue to serve faithfully and compassionately.  We live in a society where half of our population still face pay discrepancies and difficulties in accessing healthcare, access to work and access to childcare.  They are considered as token candidates on a ballot paper.  They face a litany of targeted, gender-based abuse on social media.  They are not part of the decision-making process on areas that have a direct impact on their lives.  They are not fully part of decision-making processes full-stop.<\/p> <p> I genuinely believe our apologies today are futile unless we learn from these mistakes.  The time for words has seriously passed and it is time for action.  Unless equality is truly achieved and the rights of women, men and children are respected equally, we will have failed.  Unless we have equality in our governance, in the boardroom and in our institutions of faith, then we are not truly sorry.<\/p> <p> I know I cannot speak for the church today, but I truly believe the time has come for the church to recognise women as equals.  The report, welcome but flawed in some respects, does commit to a comprehensive range of supports.  So too had previous reports but they have remained at best partially implemented.  There is a justified sense by some that little will change.  Our task in government is to realise that and act on it.  Things can change and it is our job to make sure that they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000046#TT00300","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611159000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>By now most of us have had the opportunity to read and digest the commission's report into the brutal and shameful operation of mother and baby homes in this State.  More importantly, the survivors themselves and their advocates have had that opportunity.  The publication of this report ought to have been a moment that brought recognition, some relief and some comfort to survivors, who are well aware that they did nothing wrong.  They know full well that they were wronged.<\/p>  <p>  There is absolutely no doubt, however, that the majority of survivors feel deeply hurt and let down.  Some have referred to it as a \"whitewash\" and as an \"incomplete cop-out\".  They have articulated powerfully a sense of abandonment after waiting six long years.<\/p>  <p>  It is not difficult to understand why survivors feel this way.  It is because they presented their testimony so that they would be believed.  Yet, the report has disregarded much of the testimony of survivors and, in so doing, has reached some breathtaking conclusions.  The first is that there is no evidence of forced adoptions and the second is that there is no evidence of abuse.  Let me be clear: the testimonies of the survivors are the evidence and they represent the best evidence.  To treat this testimony merely as anecdotal statements is wrong and scandalous.  I believe it needs to be put right.<\/p>  <p>  On her visits to Ireland two years ago, the UN special rapporteur on the sale and exploitation of children highlighted in her submission to the commission the issue of forced adoption and the falsifying of birth records.  The Clann Project did the same in its submission.  Survivors are aghast at how their testimonies have been treated.  They have been selectively edited, paraphrased and used as quotes to summarise specific issues and points.<\/p>  <p>  Survivors naturally assumed that their full testimonies would be included in the report.  They are justifiably appalled that this did not happen.  So badly have some of their testimonies been handled that many survivors are finding real difficulty in identifying their own evidence.  Survivors have yet to receive transcripts of their evidence.  This is absolutely unacceptable and it needs to be rectified now.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the flaws and shortcomings of the report are in large part due to the limitations of the commission's terms of reference.  I make the point not to excuse in any way those erroneous findings to which I have referred and to which I will return.  The terms of reference have been a cause of concern all along, so much so that over 120 individuals and groups lodged submissions with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs before they were finalised by the Government in early 2015.  The Government was aware of the shortcomings.  Now, regardless of what is written in the report, the people of Ireland know who they believe.  They believe the survivors.  Forced adoption was a significant feature of the mother and baby homes and the whole apparatus of oppression and the adoption system throughout the island.<\/p> <p>Those incarcerated in these places were routinely abused mentally and physically.  They were degraded.  These allegations of physical, emotional and mental abuse need to be investigated properly because this report, just like the McAleese report into the Magdalen laundries before it, has played down significantly the evidence and the reality of these experiences.  It has been very frustrating for survivors that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has said the language of the report, while legalistic in nature, in no way invalidates the testimonies of survivors.  That is exactly what it does, and the Minister needs to recognise this fact.<\/p> <p> Survivors are deeply hurt by any contention that responsibility lies with the whole of Irish society, that somehow it was everybody's fault, because nothing could be further from the truth.  The Ireland of the time was controlled and run by a \"church-State\".  From education to healthcare to social services and even to enterprise and trade, the Catholic Church was hardwired into every facet of public policy.  The State and the Catholic Church and other churches and organisations coalesced in the establishment and the running of these cruel religious prisons.  It is the State, however, that bears ultimate responsibility for outsourcing its responsibilities to these religious orders and organisations.  It is responsible for what happened and for the violation of women's most basic rights.  It is but one chapter in the catalogue of how this State has so badly failed women and girls, a heartbreaking litany of failure that runs across generations.  It is evoked by the names of Joanne Hayes, Ann Lovett, Brigid McCole, Savita Halappanavar, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and Irene Teap.  It underlines the bravery of women such as Vicky Phelan.  Then there are the names we do not know: the single-parent families so badly treated and the homeless families swept into emergency accommodation and living in poverty, inequalities of which women bear the brunt.  The State's failure of women is not only history; it is the story of today too.  We should not forget that as we speak the State still maintains a system of direct provision.  We simply cannot sleepwalk the Deputies of 30 years' time into a repeat of what is happening now and an investigation into that inhumane system.<\/p> <p> The recommendations of the report relating to survivors having access to their information and records are also flawed.  The right to a birth certificate is especially important for survivors and their families.  Yesterday my colleague, Deputy Funchion, published a Bill that will allow for adopted persons over the age of 18 to access full information on their birth.  This is a crucial first step, and I urge all Deputies to support that legislation when it comes before the House.<\/p> <p> It is the view of many survivors and their advocates that the scope of the commission, only 18 institutions, prevented it from uncovering the full extent of the horror of the mother and baby homes, and I share that concern.  There are 182 identifiable institutions.  From the 18 homes covered in the report, we know that 9,000 children perished in these places.  We also know, however, that this is but a glimpse of the full horror.  All identifiable institutions must be fully investigated and provision must be made for excavations at sites where survivors and families know that their children or relatives are buried, even if they cannot pinpoint the exact spots.  Every mother and every family has the right to know where their child or relative is buried.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will address these sensitive but crucially important matters when considering the general scheme of the certain institutional burials Bill.  A rights-based redress scheme is absolutely essential in ensuring a survivor-centred approach.  I know that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, yesterday met with the Oireachtas children committee to discuss a framework for that scheme.<\/p> <p> All those impacted by the report must have access to redress, and no restrictive criteria should be put in place that exclude any survivor.  The message to the Government must be this: get this right and get it in place as soon as possible.  The Government must listen clearly to the calls of survivors.  The obvious starting point is to implement the extensive recommendations of the collaborative forum that have been on the shelf in the Department gathering dust since 2018.  It is a source of real anger among the survivor communities that this is the case.  The failure to act on these recommendations only further erodes trust in the Government.  Survivors want action and real supports.  These have to include dedicated access to counselling and well-being services as well as dedicated support workers to facilitate access to health and housing services.<\/p> <p> In the coming weeks the Executive in the North will receive the report of the investigation into the operation of mother and baby homes in the Six Counties, the Gillespie report.  Joint First Minister Michelle O'Neill has made it very clear that she will do whatever is required to deliver truth and justice to survivors, and I hope and I firmly believe that all colleagues on the Northern Executive will follow her lead.  Of course, we await publication of the report.  I believe, however, that the very best interests of the survivor community will be served by a joined-up, co-ordinated, all-island approach in dealing with this awful legacy.  Women, girls and children were brutalised in mother and baby homes, county homes and other institutions.  Many perished.  Many survived and made it out.  They are with us today and they are strong and inspirational people.  Their words are evidence in the purest and most reliable form.  Their testimonies and their voices demand accountability and justice.  Now is the moment and now is the duty of the Government to see that that is what they have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000047#UU00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611159600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>When I had the opportunity to speak on this report last week, I was extremely mindful that many survivors, their families and their representative groups had not yet physically seen the report, let alone had the time to read any of it.  Now, a week later, many of us have read it, many of us are still working through it and some survivors and their families are still awaiting it.  Unfortunately, I have to say with absolute honesty that it is undoubtedly one of the greatest miscarriages of truth ever produced.  Survivors had so much expectation and perhaps optimism that this report would right some wrongs, hold to account those responsible for so much hurt and injustice, open up honest and truthful dialogue on a shameful chapter in our history and begin a process of healing for survivors and their families.  Unfortunately, the report is a disgrace.  Not only is it a collateral disappointment for survivors; it is also disrespectful in the extreme as it attempts to contradict their accounts.  In the report of the confidential committee the authors set out to warn the reader that not all survivors' stories can be believed, stating that clearly they did not always recount their experiences correctly.  All week survivors have taken to the airwaves to tell us their real and truthful accounts of life in Ireland's mother and baby detention centres.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday I spoke to a lady, one of the bravest women I have ever had to the privilege to know, who told me she spent over two hours with a transcriber.  As this lady spoke the transcriber carefully tapped out each word on her machine.  This lady told me that as she retold her painful and distressing story in intricate detail, the flood of emotions was so vivid and so distressing that she had to take a break.  She spoke of being ripped from her family as a young girl, finding herself pregnant, alone and in a mother and baby institution.  She spoke about the excruciatingly painful birth, being locked in a room alone throughout her entire labour and birth and being denied pain relief or any medical attention throughout the whole process.  She recounted how the nuns removed the baby from her while she was breastfeeding and bonding with her new child.  Not one word I have just read out was included in this report.  Her story and countless other stories have been sanitised and misrepresented.<\/p> <p>The lady asked me what was the point of the report and of the commission and why she even bothered  She said it seemed that everybody else's human rights were important except hers.  At every point in the survivors' lives, in their long and painful journey, they have been lied to.  They have been tricked, some of them beaten, and some have still to tell their stories, such is the pain of reliving this part of their lives.<\/p> <p> What did the State do to these brave women?  It discredited and retold their stories.  How can there be trust and hope?  Words must be followed by action.  Survivors, their families, and their representative groups have been very clear in what needs to come out of this report, however disappointing it is.  The Government must bring forward access to information legislation that gives survivors unrestricted access to their own records and data, and, as has been mentioned by my colleague, we published legislation yesterday with regard to accessing birth certificates, which is at least the first step that should happen.  We also need to ensure that survivors have support and access to housing, dedicated support workers, counselling and medical supports, and a comprehensive redress scheme.  I also add that I believe there are possible grounds for a criminal investigation given some aspects of the report.<\/p> <p> I know that there are many survivors listening in today and I take this opportunity to say to them that I will, in my power as a legislator, as an Opposition spokesperson, and as an Irish woman, work tirelessly to ensure that survivors' voices are at the centre of every action we take, every piece of legislation we introduce, and every measure we recommend to ensure that they are not forgotten and that their real stories are heard so that they can, perhaps, finally begin the process of healing.  As a final word, I say that I am proud of these women for their courage and I believe their stories.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000048#VV00200","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611160200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>The long-awaited report of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes is, unfortunately, not what many expected.  Survivors have waited for five years for this report and so many are disappointed that, after all that time, they just feel let down.<\/p>  <p>  One survivor contacted me on Monday to thank my party for all the work that it has done to support survivors.  She told me that it took her almost a week to contact me as the publication of the report meant she relived the horrors of everything that had been done to her.  Without realising it, she had personally buried it in the recesses of her mind, but it all came back to her this past week as if it was yesterday.  She told me that she was one of the lucky ones because her daughter found her after years of looking.<\/p>  <p>  Not everyone has been so lucky.  One man told me that he was denied access to his personal information and lied to by social workers.  When he finally, after years, managed to trace his birth mother, it was too late because she had passed away.  He felt cheated of an opportunity to get to know his birth mother.  This cannot be allowed to continue to happen.  Access to information is a must.  I commend my party colleague, Deputy Funchion, on introducing the Civil Registration (Right of Adoptees to Information) (Amendment) Bill 2021 which will guarantee the right to people to their own birth certificate and personal information.  I am urging all Deputies in this Chamber to support that legislation.<\/p>  <p>  One would imagine when thinking of the church, nuns in particular, that love, dignity and respect would be high on its agenda and that the church&rsquo;s preaching that we should treat others as we would like them to treat us should be its mantra.  For the women who spent many months in these institutions, punishment, abuse, shame and trauma were visited on them regularly.  Women, many of them children themselves, were forced to go through giving birth to a baby without any sort of pain relief or support.  In fact, many were verbally abused while they endured the pain of childbirth.  Nowhere in the equation were men made to take any responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt that the State is the one to blame here.  The State allowed itself to have its policy dictated by the church and then left it to the religious organisations to cater for what it saw as Ireland&rsquo;s dirty little secret.  Shame on the State for treating its citizens and allowing them to be mistreated in this way.  Do not tell me that those in power did not know what was happening.<\/p>  <p>  To blame society is totally unfair.  Many people throughout the decades of this new State were just trying to make ends meet and were not aware of what was happening in these institutions.  Women who endured this mistreatment did not talk about it.<\/p>  <p>  What is needed now is inclusive, constructive and collaborative engagement with stakeholders.  Survivors of these institutions need to be kept informed of what is happening in respect of this report.  They need access to information and have a right to their birth certificate, and they must have the correct information about their own care.  Support for survivors, such as counselling services, access to housing, therapies and a medical card, and a redress scheme which does not differentiate between the women need to be put in place.<\/p>  <p>  All the little children who lost their lives in these institutions and were coldly buried in unmarked graves need to be properly reunited with their families, if at all possible, and given a proper Christian burial.

This report found little evidence that politicians or the public were in any way concerned about the children or mothers in the homes, despite the horrific level of infant mortality.  I again pay tribute again to the survivors&rsquo; determination, bravery and courage in fighting to ensure that their voices are finally heard.  Like several of the reports that have come before us, this report must prompt the Government to act urgently to ensure the human rights of survivors are protected and that their voices are at the very centre of the Government&rsquo;s response.  Survivors&rsquo; voices have been ignored for far too long, and it is high time to let these survivors know that they were never at fault.<\/p>  <p>  The narrative that society was as much to blame as the church and State is incomprehensible.  Society does not collectively decide to banish its women to cruel institutions unless powerful and influential forces such as the State and church facilitate such actions.  It is very clear from this report that there is potential for criminal investigation, and this must be examined.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s next steps are very important, and these must include survivors being able to access their own records and data, including their own birth certificates and adoption files, dedicated counselling financial redress, therapy and other supports.  This process could be started by legislation that was published by my colleague, Deputy Funchion, yesterday which would give adopted people a legal right to obtain a copy of their own birth certificate.  This is a crucial step in actively dealing with the asks of survivors.  How we move forward must be about survivors and their families.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that the publishing of this report was and still is very distressing and upsetting for survivors.<\/p>  <p>  The true worth of a compassionate Government is measured in how it treats those who it has grown gravely wronged.  I urge this Government, please, not to be found wanting at this critical moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000049#WW00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1611160200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I read the Minister&rsquo;s speech as he was delivering it.  I ask him to consider the Labour Party Bill, which was also published yesterday, entitled the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2021.  If it is passed, it will provide adopted persons with the right to access their birth certificates.  I note the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill of Deputy Funchion and that Senator Bacik has contacted her office yesterday to consider this Bill.  If a Bill emerges from these Bills which we can all support that deals with this issue finally and in a timely fashion, this will provide some confidence to the many people who have been advocating on this issue for many years.<\/p> <p>I take in good faith the Minister's statement that we will have the heads of the Bill on information and tracing by the end of March or early April.  Is there a way of shortening that time, given that the Minister's predecessor had been giving consideration to this matter for a number of years and the issue has been in the system for too long already?  We feel strongly that the legislation to speak to the issue of the right to access birth certificates could be implemented tomorrow if the political will was there.  We ask that the timeframe be addressed again.  This is an issue on which people want to see closure or progress.  I accept that there is a process, but it is one that has been ongoing for a number of years and was on the Minister's predecessor's desk for a number of years as well.  It is not a new issue.<br\/><br\/>We owe a debt of gratitude to many people, but I wish to mention two whose material I have read extensively.  They have been instrumental in raising consciousness about these issues.  I am referring to Mr. Conall &Oacute; F&aacute;tharta, a journalist who wrote for the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, and Mr. Donal O'Keeffe, a documentarian, historian and commentator.  Mr. O'Keeffe was responsible for putting together the list of names that appeared in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>last week.  I thank the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>for carrying the list on its front page.  That mere act raised consciousness about this issue among many people for whom it otherwise would not have been brought home so starkly in these times of Covid.  That front page was an important piece of work.  It is now an historical document and has done much to raise awareness of the issue.  It has done a great duty in bringing home to us the reality of the sheer number of young babies who died in such horrific circumstances.<br\/><br\/>Deputy McDonald was right, in that if our generation of politicians does not deal with this now, we will not be able to look our children and, hopefully, grandchildren in the eyes when they ask us what we did about mother and baby homes without casting our gazes downwards.  We have to address these issues now.  Based on his words to date, I believe the Minister is willing to do so.  I do not say this in a condescending way, but if I may, I implore him to ensure that we do not go down the road that has been taken before with reports of this nature where we have seen evidence of internal memos written by senior people in Departments where sympathy was expressed for the issue but cost became a determining cause for inaction.  We cannot be a generation of politicians that become part of the edifice of historical issues not being dealt with because cost was a factor.<br\/><br\/>I respectfully ask the Minister that, as a first step, when the interdepartmental group meets to assess the provision of a form of enhanced medical card for anyone who spent more than six months in a mother and baby institution, the timeframe should be considered because anyone who spent even an hour in such an institution should have that right.  Six months is too arbitrary.  If the Minister started with this gesture, it would build confidence among the many people who have been hurt and traumatised by their experiences.  It would be a meaningful gesture for many.  I have raised two issues - the information and tracing Bill and medical cards.  If they could be dealt with immediately, it would build confidence in what will be a long process.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge the workload lying ahead of the Minister.  We will work with him as a committee.  I stand as a member of the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration.  We will do everything we can to help the Minister and his colleagues in whatever process needs to be undertaken.  This is not a partisan issue, but one that we all must deal with collectively.<br\/><br\/>A few minutes are left to me.  I noted the Minister's reference to Ms Litster and the experiences in Tuam.  I wish to acknowledge the role of Dr. James Deeny, the former Chief Medical Adviser who was active in respect of Bessborough.  Between 1922 and the end of 1946, 674 children were officially certified as having died at that home.  That was not the sum total of children who died at the home.  One report - I am sorry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle - stated that &quot;the greater number&quot; were &quot;miserable scraps of humanity, wizened, some emaciated, and almost all had rash and sores all over their bodies, faces, hands and heads&quot;.  Dr. Deeny visited and inspected the home in Bessborough.  He noted that it was spotlessly clean.  He wrote: &quot;I marched up and down and around about and could not make out what was wrong; at last I took a notion and stripped all the babies and, unusually for a Chief Medical Adviser, examined them.&quot;  As he recalled in his 1989 memoir, &quot;Every baby had some purulent infection of the skin and all had green diarrhoea, carefully covered up.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Forgive me for getting upset, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but this has to be dealt with.  We have to deal with it.  We have to acknowledge face on that it happened and we have to find a mechanism for every woman, child and family member who had any contact with any home throughout the State.  Justice will be served when they feel they have received some acknowledgement of the hurt that was caused to them.  We can achieve that through redress, proper mechanisms and a revision of the executive summary, which was an insult to them - the Minister described its language as cold.  The first point of departure should be the report itself.  It has caused trauma and hurt again.  That is not a good starting point and I ask that the executive summary be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000049#WW00500","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611160800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I understand that Deputies O'Dowd and Lahart are sharing time at six and a half minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000050#XX00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1611160800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>This is an important report and an important debate.  I have listened carefully to what Members have said.  I do not disagree with the fundamental point that an appalling crime was visited on all these families, in particular children.  Something in the report struck me more than anything else, namely, the unacceptably high infant mortality rate in the first year of life, which was higher than anywhere known in the world at the time.<\/p> <p>More than 9,000 children, or more than 15%, died in the mother and baby homes.  The report goes on to say that in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s the percentage rose to the high 40s.  It was a holocaust of death.  I agree with Deputy Sherlock's descriptions.  The horror and evil that was visited on these innocent women and children is appalling and unacceptable.  I refer to the wonderful work that has been done on the Tuam babies by Catherine Corless.  When the remains of children were found, it was asked whether it was true that they were buried in a sewage pit.  The answer is that yes they were.  The report says that was done with the knowledge of the religious congregation there.  It goes on to say that there are people in Tuam and in Galway who know more about what happened there but do not speak about it.<\/p> <p> I also came across a reference to my county of Louth.  In 1961 there was an intervention by the manager at the time.  The reference was to unacceptable and appalling personal inquiries into whether the families of two mothers who were going to an institution had the funds to support them because they were supported by the county council.  I believe that was a criminal act as well.  All over the country there are lots of people still in these county councils and there are lots of corners and reservoirs of information and books with dust gathered on them that could tell us a lot more.  At the heart of the then Department of Local Government, was the wonderful Miss Alice Litster, who worked there and wrote reports.  I acknowledge the praise afforded to her by the Minister and others.  Were the reports just dumped on the shelf or were they brought before management meetings?  Were they discussed with Ministers?  They must have been discussed by senior officials.  We cannot accept that we can just draw a line through it and say that it happened and that that was the past.  It needs further investigation.  We need more accountability.  It is entirely unacceptable if, as the commission believes, there are other people with records that have not come forward yet.<\/p> <p> I got a call during the week from one of my constituents who is in his 80s.  He asked me if I could tell him where babies were born in Drogheda in such and such a year.  This was before the maternity hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, was built.  I said I would try to find out.  I found out that there were two places.  One was the Cottage Hospital and the other was St. Mary's, which was known as the county home.  He said he was born in St. Mary's.  I asked him what was different about that.  He said he was illegitimate.  I will not say the word he used, but it was very upsetting for him to use it in his life.  We should remember that he is 80 years of age.  He said that everywhere he went he was treated as a second-class citizen because he was born out of wedlock.  He said that his mother fled the nursing home on the day of his birth to save him from being taken from her.  There are other people whose needs must be addressed.  I welcome the Minister's commitment in that regard.  Even at this late stage in their lives, there are other people who should benefit from adequate advice and counselling.  We should address special circumstances of health and other issues.  The other problem for this man is that at 80 years of age he still does not know who his father is.  He firmly believes that he has an absolute right to the integrity of who he is, but he cannot get that information.  Whatever legislation is necessary to make that happen should be introduced.  I know the commission recommends that there should be a referendum if necessary.<\/p> <p> At the heart of our country at that time was the control by the Catholic Church.  We can say what we like now because we are free to say it, but 40, 50 or 60 years ago one could not say it because the church controlled everything.  It controlled education, schools and recreational amenities.  It was in control of every part of society.  The politicians of the day bent their knee to it.  We bent our knee to it so much that we gave the Catholic Church a special place in the Constitution.  That is how strong its power was.  I am not talking about Christianity; I am talking about the institution of the church.  The churches are accountable and must be held accountable.  I know my time is up.  I believe they should be accountable.  If we get an opportunity later, when this legislation comes in, I will expand on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000050#XX00300","speaker":"1598","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611161400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I would appreciate if the record could show that I echo all of the sentiments that have been expressed by the speakers who immediately preceded me.  I made a contribution in the D&aacute;il last October or November when this subject was last raised and rather than just repeat it, I state that it was a very fair reflection of my sentiments, sympathy and support for the survivors of the mother and baby homes in the context of what we were talking about then.<\/p>  <p>  Generally in society there is a lot of anger and frustration in January 2021 and into this has come the commission of investigation's report into the mother and baby homes.  I am reading my way through the report, which is long.  I commend anybody who has completed it at this stage and digested and reflected on it.  All I can do is add my own voice to the voices of colleagues.  We have a limited time in which to speak.  I hope that we can come back to the report again in a few weeks when we have had an opportunity to digest it.<\/p>  <p>  I know there are those who want to set the report of the commission aside and I understand the reason for that.  When I was reading the executive summary, I had questions in my own head that I wanted to ask, but I wonder if it is a knee-jerk reaction.  I say that for what I hope are good reasons.  I understand the impulse behind wanting to set it aside, because in the minds of some it does not reflect accurately what the narratives of the survivors told us.  I cannot believe that everybody has read right through the report to completion.  Fair play to people if they have, and not only completed it but taken time to reflect on it.  It is an incredible body of work.  It has clearly been compiled painstakingly and thoroughly over a period by professional, highly capable and competent people.  I know that it has not been fully faithful to some of the narrative of some of the survivors and I acknowledge the pain that has caused them.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to focus on the aspects of parts of the executive summary which suggested that there was no evidence on the role of the church in regard to specific issues.  I know that has caused anger and pain.  I wish to look at the commission's report from another perspective.  This is not a defensive perspective; it is a reflective one.  I am not here to defend anybody.  To blame the church completely is appropriate if it is accurate.  Very often what we do is to blame the church or churches completely and let so many others off the hook, and very often we walk away.  The authors of the report were being much more provocative than this.  The role of the church was predominant, central and authoritative.  To blame it exclusively is convenient also and allows the rest of the stakeholders to walk off the stage feeling exonerated.  This is where the report is at its most provocative.<\/p> <p>The commission's report points out that there are other significant players on this stage, and Deputy O'Dowd just mentioned some of them.  We cannot allow them simply to exit stage left or right.<\/p> <p> It can appreciated from a distance of time that poor, uneducated people could find themselves subservient to authority.  What of the intelligentsia, including journalists, politicians and writers?  What about the senior civil servants and highly educated people at the top of Departments?  What about the doctors, lawyers, visiting committees, local authorities and others?  What stopped them from challenging this?  Perhaps the answer is the church.  The commission's report does not exonerate the church, and that is laid out pretty clearly in the entirety of the document.  We must not miss the opportunity to look closely at the other players and demand answers for their action and, most of all, their inaction.  The unparalleled high mortality rate of babies and children appears not to have aroused the attention of anybody.  Why did this not get people's attention?<\/p> <p> What should our legacy be to these women in 2021 and in future?  I add my contribution to this.  Having met some of the survivors with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, two years ago, I was struck by how frugal some of their requests, needs or demands were.  People have spoken about how we can make amends with reparations, and I absolutely support that.  I will support any legislation that can assist them.  My words may be clumsy but one of the legacies we can leave is an overdue conversation that this country needs to have about the relationship between church and State.  That conversation could be initiated through a citizens' assembly.<\/p> <p> Finally and in a mature and intelligent way, we should be able to talk about this subject and acknowledge the role of the church, whether it was destructive or whether it contributed richly to society.  We should move eventually but not too far in future to embracing what we need from the church as a society.  We should let go of what we need to discard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000051#YY00200","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611162000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>In my constituency of Meath West, in north-west Meath, is the Castlepollard mother and baby home.  The Castlepollard home opened in 1935, but without a purpose-built maternity unit initially and with widespread overcrowding, it recorded an alarming rate of baby mortality in its first five years, with 60.2% of all infants dying.  There were 4,559 babies born in Castlepollard between 1935 and 1971 and 247 of those infants died.  Several women told the commission of investigation they witnessed nuns leaving the hospital with up to ten dead babies in shoeboxes and bringing them for burial on the grounds nearby.<\/p>  <p>  I visited the site recently and it is very sad to think I was walking on the graves of hundreds of babies with no headstone or properly marked grave and only a rusty nail in the wall to remember them.  It has been revealed there was a demand for a public inquiry and the closure of the mother and baby home in Castlepollard within the first ten years of its operations after soaring levels of baby deaths were regarded and allegations of the cruelty to and abuse of women were made.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the women who had their babies delivered in Castlepollard spoke to the commission and said it was like living in a jail.  They were told by senior nuns when they arrived that they had been really bad people, although many women told the commission they became pregnant after being raped.  Some also said they signed adoption papers under duress.  Most of the women who had their babies in Castlepollard were between 16 and 24 years old.  They came from every county in the country.<\/p>  <p>  The past few weeks have been very difficult for survivors and their families.  I commend the bravery of the survivors and their families, who time and again have been let down by church, State and society.  There is a private Facebook group for people affected by what happened in the Castlepollard mother and baby home, with more than 700 members.  I commend the people involved and thank them for the work done in sharing photos and information and working together with survivors and families, helping them to obtain information.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Funchion has stated, the State has failed these survivors.  It did not listen or care.  It turned a blind eye and it must now accept responsibility and come good for survivors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1611162000,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The Castlepollard institution was owned and run by the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts from 1935 to 1971.  By 1937, it was already grossly overcrowded, and by 1941, women and children were sleeping in unheated lofts above stables.<\/p>  <p>  I have real concerns about the numbers relating to Castlepollard in this report, particularly those relating to infant mortality.  The report states nine babies died between 1968 and 1970, yet this is contradicted by the midwife who worked there at the time.  How can this be explained and where is the truth?  How can survivors have confidence that this report gives a true reflection of events when even basic details are incorrect?<\/p>  <p>  There is information on the discharge of 4,072 children relative to a mother, leaving 487 children unaccounted for.  If we take deaths into account as established in this report, that leaves 240 children who have no record I can find in this report.  That is not acceptable.  This couples with the testimony of resident A, who stated she saw deceased babies in shoeboxes being sent for burial.  That statement was disregarded in its entirety because of a lack of corresponding records, which is beyond belief.  The report states there are no burial records but it also states that it seems likely the children who died are buried in designated burial grounds.  That is not fact but supposition.  I ask the Minister to take all steps to establish if there are unrecorded deaths and burials on the grounds of the Castlepollard institution.<\/p>  <p>  There are many aspects of the report that are deeply concerning and which relate to Castlepollard.  What sticks out most is that 13% of the women, or 646 of them, were below the age of 18 when they entered the premises.  There were 278 between the ages of 12 and 16.  These are children who went there to give birth.  The question must be asked if any of these were reported to the Garda at the time, given the age of consent as established in 1935 was 17.<\/p>  <p>  There can be no doubt the State has failed these women repeatedly.  I, for one, commend them on their bravery in coming forward to tell their truth and relive what could only be horrendous experiences.  In that regard, this report must be the first step and the catalyst to ensuring these survivors receive proper redress through recognition.  This State should now see these women, hear them and support them in their requests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000052#ZZ00300","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1611162000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Last week our radio waves and newspapers were flooded with life stories and lived experiences of the survivors of the mother and baby homes and their accounts of loss and trauma, sadness and anger.  The stories were very difficult to listen to and I cannot even begin to imagine what it was like to have lived and be still living through it.  I hope that telling those stories helped even a little bit.<\/p>  <p>  This has certainly gone some way to helping us, as a nation, understand what many had to suffer in the name of our State and church.  I am hopeful we are ready as a country finally to deal with these matters and make amends for all the wrongs that were done to innocent children and women.  It is time to lift the veil of guilt and shame that has shaped this nation for so long and work with the survivors to provide what they need for us to make amends.<\/p>  <p>  I have three requests of the Minister and his Government.  The first deals with the report and its framing.  The second relates to the next steps and what is needed to rebuild trust with survivors.  The third deals specifically with accountability, whether this is financial, criminal, individual or institutional.<\/p> <p>Last week I, along with many others, including the survivors themselves, was shocked by the contents of the commission's report and by its tone.  I was shocked by the coldness of the words that were used, the victim-blaming that sounded loudly from the pages and the disconnect between the stories of the survivors and many of the conclusions that were drawn from them.  The choice of language, the tone used and the narrative construed about women at that time almost seemed to belong to that time, as if we had not actually moved on in our discourse at all.  If we have learned one thing from this experience, it is that we must all speak out and name it when we see people being treated badly or being spoken about unfairly.<\/p> <p> To remain silent is to be complicit.  While I recognise that this is an independent report, the Government's opinion of it should be on the record.  Otherwise, the Government runs the risk of survivors believing that the sentiments of the report and of the Government are one and the same.  I acknowledge that the Minister mentioned the tone of the report in his statement when he said it was clear that survivors have been disappointed by the tone and language, citing sections where a strictly legalistic approach was taken, but I want to know how he feels about the tone, content and findings of the report.  Do he and his Government agree with the document, its recommendations and the narrative it has spun?  Does he agree that responsibility for the harsh treatment rests mainly with the fathers of the children and their own immediate families?  Does he agree that there was no evidence that women were forced into mother and baby homes by the church or the State authorities?  Does he agree that there was no evidence of abuse?  I urge the Minister and the Government to outline clearly on the public record their opinion of the report.  They do not need to set it aside but I want to know - and the survivors deserve to know - what they think of what is in that document.<\/p> <p> Regarding the next steps and actions the survivors need to see, we now face a difficult balancing act.  Survivors have waited for years for successive governments to make amends for what happened and to implement the measures that are needed so there is a need to address these issues quickly.  However, many of them are complex and sensitive and will require significant consultation to ensure that we get it right.  Never before have I felt that the words \"make haste slowly\" take on such an appropriate meaning.  This needs to be done deliberatively, collaboratively and with compassion.  There is no room for any further undermining of the trust of survivors or for broken promises.  It will take time to get it right but survivors need to see that the Government is taking its responsibilities seriously and is demonstrating its intent to act in their interests.  There are things that can be done in the short term to ensure the Government is travelling in the right direction and that will help to rebuild trust with the survivors.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that the Minister said that GDPR legislation and the requirements thereunder will be made clear to both the agencies and survivors.  That is an important first step.  The Government should reassert this right by making a simple legislative amendment to the Civil Registration Act to ensure that everyone can retrieve their publicly registered birth certificate.  I note that some of the other parties have said that they will publish such legislation, which the Social Democrats will support if it achieves that end.  The Government must also move quickly to nationalise all data and records relating to the mother and baby homes and similar institutions.  We must immediately protect and secure this data.  The time for voluntary engagement is past. <\/p> <p> Regarding redress, the Government must learn from past mistakes.  It must not retraumatise survivors with questions or interrogations - it must be transparent, it must prioritise the rights of survivors over the costs to the State and it must not allow years to go by without redress being made.  History has shown that our institutions have not only caused hurt in the past, but can cause hurt and pain for survivors well into the future and this is what must end. <\/p> <p> Finally, survivors need to see accountability, which can be financial, criminal, individual or institutional.  It is important that the intent of the Government is clear from the start, which is why I am concerned by the heads of the burials legislation which will be scrutinised by the Oireachtas Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration shortly.  This will be a litmus test as to how closely the Government will listen to what the survivors need and to their wishes.  Unfortunately, I have already been made aware of a number of limitations inherent in the Bill which I will be discussing as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  The Bill as currently drafted does not improve much on the 2019 general scheme and could limit the potential for holding inquests and declaring certain burial sites to be crime scenes.  I will be working closely with survivor groups during this process because it is so important that we get this right.  This must also happen quickly so that certain sites can be exhumed.  We know where many babies' bodies are buried and we need to do everything in our power to enable swift movement onto these sites to put names to those children.  We also need to make sure that people are held accountable.  Critically, we cannot allow any action to happen over the coming weeks and months that could put justice out of the reach of survivors.  That is why the Government must act quickly to secure lands at Bessborough.  Along with my colleague, Deputy Cairns, I am calling on the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to use his ministerial powers under the Planning Act to halt the development of those lands and to work with Cork City Council to pursue a compulsory purchase order of the site as a place of national importance.  Anything less is a further insult to the survivors and their families.<\/p> <p> It is time for the Government to do the right thing and to stand with survivors.  Its actions over the coming weeks and months will give a clear insight into how responsive it will be to the needs of survivors and into whose side it is on.  Will the Government be on the side of a culture and institutions that hid, sanitised and minimised wrongdoing or the side of justice for the women and children who were so badly treated, through no fault of their own?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000052#ZZ00400","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611162600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>In the brief time available, I wish to touch on two aspects of the Minister's opening statement.  He referenced the interdepartmental group which will assess the provision of a form of enhanced medical card to everyone who spent more than six months in mother and baby institutions.  I join Deputy Sherlock in urging the Minister to lift the six-month limit.  The trauma of those who spent a week or a month in those institutions is no less than the trauma of those who spent more than six months there.  A reduction in that time limit would be massively welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue is the type of medical card that will be made available to survivors of mother and baby homes.  In that context, we already have a gold standard as recommended on foot of a previous apology to the survivors of Magdalen laundries.  The first recommendation of Mr. Justice John Quirke was that survivors of Magdalen laundries would receive the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 card, known as the HAA card.  This card entitles the bearer to a wide variety of provisions including access to both public and private healthcare.  If one believes in the State then one must acknowledge that Governments become custodians of promises made by their predecessors.  The Minister and the Taoiseach apologised last week but they have become custodians of apologies that were made previously.  Shamefully, the recommendation of Mr. Justice Quirke has yet to be fulfilled.  The suggestion that a full HAA card be available to all victims and survivors of Ireland's institutional past is extremely worthy and should be seriously considered.  The card would entitle survivors, victims and their family members to a full counselling service, alternative therapies, a complete range of dental services and a full range of chiropody services.  These are just some of the entitlements under the HAA card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000053#AAA00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1611162600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Before I begin, I wish to take a moment to congratulate the most Irish US President since JFK, Joe Biden, and the Vice President, Kamala Harris, on their inauguration and wish them a successful term in office.  In a speech yesterday Mr. Biden said \"To heal, we must remember...it's hard sometimes to remember but that's how we heal\".<\/p>  <p>  The report, which is 3,000 pages long, is a map but there are pieces missing in what is a very complicated journey.  The survivors should have been given printed copies of the report and enough time to read it.  That was a serious disservice to the survivors, especially those who had given testimony and I hope this has been rectified now.<\/p> <p>Careful analysis still needs to be done and it is important that we say that here today.  It is only the beginning, only part of understanding what came before and only a partial account of what the women and children lived through.  Noelle Brown, an adoption rights advocate who was born in Bessborough mother and baby home, believes her testimony was shoehorned into the report and that the transcript contained ten glaring inaccuracies.  She criticised the report and the commission for failing to put the survivors at the centre of the investigation and described her involvement as a waste of time.  That is not the survivor-centred approach that was promised and we need to fix that through our actions here and now.  <\/p> <p> It is important to applaud Catherine Corless for her work.  Her research was instrumental in prompting the investigation.  The commission interviewed, or gathered sworn affidavits from, more than 550 people during its investigation but some 56,000 mothers and 57,000 children are documented to have been resident in, or to have been born in, these homes.  A number of homes failed to keep any records of the burials of children who died in them.  The stories of rogue adoption agencies were not covered by this report.  Records of thousands of well-documented adoptions do not appear in the report.  We have read and seen in documentaries the stories of babies who were not on any aeroplane's manifest arriving from Ireland to the then Idlewild Airport in New York to be adopted but no records of these adoptions exist.  Stories of women being dragged across the thresholds of their homes by clergy or garda&iacute; were not enough for the commission to say that these women were forced into these homes.  The records were not complete and these are not conclusions.<\/p> <p> Unmarried mothers and their babies had many different experiences in the Ireland of the past.  Some of these experiences involve institutions while others do not.  Only a portion are included in this report.  Only a portion of survivors were able to give testimony and only a portion of the story is told.  There are valid criticisms of how those stories were related in the report.  Some women never came out of those homes and some were abused so badly that they were scarred for life.  Some survivors tell us that they were advised never to tell anyone of their shame.  We can imagine that many still live their lives while holding onto dark secrets.  Some go to their graves having never told a soul.  It is just horrific. <\/p> <p> While we can say that these women were badly treated, that horrible things happen and that children were taken, never to be heard from again, we need to know why such homes were set up and why Ireland demonised these women and babies and sent them to work in institutions which were paid for by the State.  While we know that some 15% of babies born in these homes died, there a number of death certificates missing.  Many children simply disappeared.  <\/p> <p> We have a lot of soul-searching to do and we owe it to the survivors to do it.  Ultimately, human rights violations occurred and it is now vital for us to get a full picture and to ensure that any records which exist about any mother and baby facilities or any persons who took mothers into their private homes are found and that any stories of survivors or institutions that are not heard in the report are heard and documented.  Such records should be handed over to the archives and anything which warrants criminal investigation should be handed over to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I welcome the fact that some such information has already been handed over.  Continuous engagement with former residents and their representative groups will be paramount, as will public access to original State files.<\/p> <p> I have written to the chief executives of Carlow County Council and Kilkenny County Council, the Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, Denis Nulty, and the HSE regarding their archives in the aftermath of this report.  I requested that local bodies search their archives for documents pertaining to their county homes and their workhouses, including information about cemeteries and any other relevant information regarding Carlow and Kilkenny, which could be released to the relevant authorities.  This is important to my constituents living here or further afield.  It is vital that we now open up all State and church archives so that adopted people, survivors and natural mothers can read first-hand documents about the system as a whole, even if this opening of records is not, by itself, justice.  Like Germany, we need to open these archives so that researchers can document what happened to women and children in 20th century Ireland.  Only this type of transparency will offer solace to survivors.<\/p> <p> This is not all we must do.  It is also important that those who have contacted us in the few days since publication feel heard and that those who never spoke of what they went through feel heard through their silence.  We need to immediately legislate to provide unconditional access to birth certificates for adopted people and access to records through the proper implementation of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  We do not need to give people's addresses out but people need to know that they can get their information.  Denying people access to personal information about their early lives does not adhere to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that every child should have, as far as possible, the right from birth to know his or her parents and to preserve his or her identity, including nationality, name and family relation.<\/p> <p> In October, misinformation spread that we were somehow sealing records of this kind for 30 years.  That is not the case.  When we voted, we voted to protect this vital and important information.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to advance legislation on access to birth information and tracing.  I very much look forward to working with him on this.  It is urgent and I am glad that we are all able to work together on it.  <\/p> <p> The survivors are first and foremost in my thoughts.  We must not place any barriers before anyone seeking redress for his or her time in a mother and baby facility.  We should give redress to anyone who spent a week in these homes and anyone who arrived after 1973.  This should be done case by case until everyone has received redress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000053#AAA00300","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611163200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Last night I sat still, writing these words and struggling to decide what to say to describe this report of the women who came before me and the rest of us and of the lives they and their children lived.  I fought to find the words until my small son came and kissed me goodnight in his pyjamas.  I knew then that the only way to approach this trauma of motherhood was to speak in that way.  The only thing to do was to speak to the women who had their babies taken from them and to beg forgiveness; to speak to the women excluded by every element of our society and who were given no protection by the State and to hang my head in shame on behalf of that State; to really think about the many children lost through death, through not knowing where or how they were buried or through being found gone when someone went to the nursery to feed them; and to acknowledge at this remove and in this inadequate way the unbearable and unrelenting trauma of those losses.<\/p>  <p>  Of all included in the report and in the discussions since its publication, one image sticks with me above all others.  It is the scream described by Terri Harrison on RT&Eacute;'s \"Prime Time\", the scream when she went back to the nursery to find her five-week-old baby, Niall, gone.  She also described the screams of the other girls in the home and how they all knew such a scream meant another baby gone.  There are women among us today who know that scream for different reasons.  They know the guttural animalistic scream that comes with the loss of a child but many of those who now know that scream also know love and care.  They know arms wrapped them to comfort them at their loss, they know the support of their partner or family, and they may know the care of psychologist or counsellor to help them find their first blurry steps through indescribable grief.  The women and girls in the mother and baby institutions knew no such kindnesses.  They had no support and had nothing to help them.  They knew nothing but abuse, exclusion and exile, at best.<\/p>  <p>  We know now, as we knew before, that these women and young girls were condemned.  Again this week I have heard them described as second-class citizens but I do not buy that.  Married women in Ireland were second-class citizens.  Mothers who happened not to be married - and I say this not meaning one iota of disrespect to the survivors but simply to state the situation as it is - were not even second-class citizens.  Sometimes stripped of their very names and given house names, they were a caste apart.  They were untouchable, even by their own parents.  As it says in chapter 12 of the report, \"In Ireland it&rsquo;s a sin you pay for all your life\".  That was the law of this land, the unwritten rules of the squinting windows and the respectable walk to church of a Sunday.  Parents used language to their children such as \"If we had heard that you had cancer it would have been easier to accept\".  These are not the words of anything but exclusion.  <\/p>  <p>  Do we really think that these thoughts and ideas were independently formed or that many of these families did not bear their own long scars from the forced exile of their girls?  Who told them how to think?  There is only one true answer.  There were instances of bravery, generosity, kindness and goodness shown within families and to the girls of other families and there were good people everywhere, some of whom bravely spoke up or acted differently, but when the social custom was to step off the street and let the priest pass, when it was considered a mortal sin to step on the grounds of a Protestant church and when the church dictated every moral, thought, action and Cabinet meeting for a substantial period of the history of this State, it is truly hard to entirely blame our grandparents rather than the dogma of the dominant church and the State that should have guarded against it instead of completely facilitating and legitimising it.  Neither, however, do I accept that society had no role.  People in towns knew these homes existed and ignored it.<\/p> <p>Decent Irish people knew these things happened and decided it was acceptable or necessary to ignore it.  I accept that a priest-ridden society told them to denounce it, but it was nothing to do with them.<\/p> <p> As we look around and wonder how it could have happened, we need to look especially at the State.  The very essence of the State, as a constitutional democracy, is to protect the vulnerable individual from the tyranny of the majority.  It was a plain fact that religious and social dogma was enabled by many political representatives - though not all - and by the State bodies which knew it was happening and failed to protect the women and girls and their children.<\/p> <p> We can respond.  The first response is the need for strong legislation on the basic right to information and identity for adoptees.  We already recognise the fundamental right to identity in our approach to assisted human reproduction.  The constitutional dial has moved before and can move again.  We need other responses, as the Minister has said, such as full acknowledgement of the real experiences of survivors, appropriate memorialisation, financial recognition and, crucially, help for many of those with trauma.<\/p> <p> Finally, and linked, we need to look today at what we are doing that we know is wrong.  We are not immune from our own mass hysteria.  It is easy to stand here and pass judgment on the past.  We also need to look closely at ourselves.  For example, we can work to find meaningful, creative and therapeutic access between children in long-term State care and their parents.  We need to acknowledge that our system of direct provision is wrong and that it is contributing to trauma and damaging parent-child relationships, thereby subjecting parents to unwarranted restrictions.  I could also mention our ongoing failure to have a national education strategy for Travellers.  However, today is not about those things.  It is about the people who survived, the mothers and their children.  Today is about hearing their scream, acknowledging their hurt and our wrongs, and asking for their forgiveness.<\/p> <p> While I was not going to say this today, following the comments of my colleague, Deputy Lahart, about the church, it is important to say that the timidity of the State in the face of the church has ended, but not its interdependence.  This week a pregnant lady contacted me to say she was upset about the report and upset that the maternity hospital she attends is still into the sisters who used to run it.  It is wrong that a woman sitting vigil beside her child in intensive care is approached by a chaplain and not a counsellor, and that parents today still need to fight for admission for their second child to a local school not with the Department but with the archdiocese.  Today we began our proceedings in the Parliament with the words, \"Directly we beseech thee, o Lord\".  I mean no disrespect to anybody of the church or practising in the church, but we need to take a hard look at this interdependence and the delivery of safe services by the church.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000054#BBB00200","speaker":"1480","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611163800,"counter":222,"content":"<p>This was another incredibly difficult week for survivors and their families.

They were given this power by a State and a political system that absolutely failed everybody.<\/p>  <p>  We now need to deliver for those survivors.

The publication of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation report has brought to light the hidden shame of a nation.  Unfortunately, the report has failed to fully address or sufficiently acknowledge the wrongs done to these survivors.<\/p>  <p>  The report has made some findings that are at variance with the accounts of survivors.  It even contradicts survivors' testimonies.  The proof anybody needed as to the nature of the mother and baby homes can be found in the survivors' testimonies.  They are the witnesses to this dark period in the history of the State and the churches.  Their testimonies have exposed how the State and the Christian churches allowed, encouraged and were complicit in what can only be described as the systematic cruelty, neglect and abuse of young women and their babies.  Many survivors still bear the scars and open wounds of the psychological and physical cruelty they suffered in these institutions.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the extent of evidence of survivors' testimonies it is undeniable that many of the babies born in these institutions were removed from their mothers without the mother's consent or even her knowledge.  There can be no other conclusion than that this was being done with the collusion of both the State and its religious institutions.  The mothers were forced to bear the incalculable and unnecessary grief of the loss of a child and many have suffered years of mental anguish, never knowing the fate of their children.  The children lived for decades after their separation from their mothers, without the knowledge of who their biological mothers were.  Those who sought out their mothers' identity found that every State and institutional obstacle was put in front of them to deny them this basic knowledge.<\/p>  <p>  We must not now add to the grief and pain of the survivors of these institutions.  We cannot compound their suffering or retraumatise them by an inadequate State apology and a defective report.  The survivors have courageously opened their hearts to the commission, not only to let others fully understand the horrors they endured, but also in an attempt to find some form of justice.  The survivors will never have closure or a path to justice if the State negates the realities of the abuse they suffered.  The State has failed them once before and it must not fail them again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000055#CCC00300","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speech","time":1611163800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>As somebody who is a political activist, but also somebody who was adopted and born in a mother and baby home, I have very mixed feelings about this debate and report.  I suspect that is true of many survivors and those who went through mother and baby homes.  In my case, my outcome was relatively benign in that I was adopted by a wonderful family and I was lucky enough eventually to be reunited with my biological family.  However, I am acutely aware that for many other people the outcome was not so benign.<\/p>  <p>  I am really upset that at a time when women and children who suffered at the hands of the church and State finally had their turn to have their voices heard, to reclaim their history and identity, to change the narrative and to put the people who lived that history back in their rightful place at the centre, that has not happened with this process.<\/p> <p>Survivors' fears that official and political Ireland would bring its influence to bear on the history, the story and the narrative, and put its interests first, have been realised.  I refer to this report, and the commentary surrounding it.  It is incredibly disappointing that this has happened after we had the debacle in respect of the legislation and the seal on records before Christmas.  Surely, warnings were given to the Government and to the people putting the report together that this must not happen.  Yet, that is exactly what has happened.<\/p> <p> Even before the debate last week during Leader's Questions, following the publication of the report my gut instinct led me to say that I thought the report I had read was \"beginning to look like a sham, an insult and a whitewash\".  I wondered then whether I was being unfair.  I realise now that my gut instincts were right and our fears have been realised.  I say that based on how much more we have now read about what happened and how much more we have heard from survivors.  We have heard much more about how the testimonies taken were not given weight, were not considered evidence and were not even transcribed accurately.  We have heard survivor after survivor saying that this report is not what they expected, not what they wanted and not the vindication they expected.<\/p> <p> The point about this whole situation is that the official Ireland was never going to admit its crimes.  The report relied on official records, when it was precisely official Ireland - church and State Ireland - which presided over the shadow State and the abuse and neglect.  Everything was centred on the obscene concept of \"legitimacy\".  What an offensive term that is.  How could any report try to disperse that obscene concept onto people in general, and onto fathers and families, when it was on the Statute Book until 1987?  It was written in as part of the registration of mothers and when babies were born in the homes.  Some were characterised as \"legitimate\" and some as \"illegitimate\".  If people were deemed illegitimate, of course, then it was permissible to treat them as less than human and to allow them to suffer malnutrition, sickness and burial in unmarked graves.  The histories and narratives of those people could be stolen, distorted and twisted with a perverse ideology driven by the priorities of politicians and religious orders and institutions.  That is the reality.  This report whitewashes that reality and insults the survivors.<\/p> <p> I believe the Minister when he says he wants to put that right, but this process has failed so far.  The Minister now needs to put the survivors, and the real voices and histories which have been denied, at the centre of the process of redress.  He also needs to put them at the centre of efforts in respect of the archive and all the supports necessary to right the terrible wrongs which were done to the people in the mother and baby homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000055#CCC00400","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611164400,"counter":226,"content":"<p>One week from its publication, this report is widely discredited.

To state in the report that there was &quot;very little evidence that children were forcibly taken from their mothers&quot; or that the commission &quot;accepts that the mothers did not have much choice but that is not the same as 'forced' adoption&quot; is pretty grotesque when it is clear there was no informed consent.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael were the creators and the rulers of the Ireland in which these mother and baby homes flourished.

The Green Party received a big vote last February, and in large measure that was a vote for radical change.

Compensation should be insisted upon from the pharmaceutical companies which used the women and children as guinea pigs in their vaccine trials.  The funds so raised should be used to compensate the survivors of the homes.  Criminal prosecutions of those who committed crimes in the institutions should be pursued, including looking at the question which has arisen concerning forged signatures on adoption consent forms.

That is completely unacceptable.  Those orders must be compelled to contribute, including by seizing their assets where necessary.  The scheme must include all survivors, including women affected after 1973 and women and children who stayed in the homes for less than six months.  Survivors must also be entitled to redress for all the harm offered, including from the forced adoptions that the commission incredibly claims never happened, despite all the evidence from survivors.<\/p>  <p>  The Bon Secours Sisters ran the Tuam mother and baby home.  That order is the second largest provider of private healthcare in the State, with revenue in 2019 of more than &euro;300 million, including &euro;5 million in public funding.  Will the Minister compel that order to provide redress?  Will he nationalise the hospitals owned by the Bon Secours order and bring them into the public health service?  The religious orders identified in the report also include the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, which ran homes where thousands of children died and thousands of women and children were forcibly separated.  Disgracefully, that order is still refusing to disclose where the Bessborough bodies are buried, while ploughing ahead with plans to sell off lands reportedly valued at &euro;10 million.  On top of that, representatives from that order make up the entire board of the Bessborough Centre, which, according to its website, \"continues the work started by the sisters in 1922\".  The centre receives State funding, including from the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  Is that not wildly inappropriate?<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, well over 90% of our primary schools and a large majority of our secondary schools are under the control of the Catholic Church.

I wish him every success.  In some ways, we could say we are almost seeing one of our own being sworn in.  President Biden definitely has Irish blood running through his veins.  Last night, he recalled his grandmother once said: &quot;Remember, Joey Biden, the best drop of blood in you is Irish&quot;.  Hopefully, therefore, we can all look forward to good relations with the United States during the four years of President Biden's tenure.<\/p><p>The real topic I wish to raise this evening is the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  It is a report absolutely riddled with pain and hurt, and volumes of it.  I will home in on several aspects of the report.  The most striking thing was the really high mortality rate.  Some 15% of all children born in mother and baby homes did not survive.  They died.  Many of them were not even afforded a Christian burial.  Some 9,000 children died in mother and baby homes, and 168 of those deaths were in my home county of Clare.<\/p><p>Last week, the two newspapers in Clare, <i>The Clare Champion<\/i>and <i>The Clare Echo<\/i>, ran front pages with that figure of 168 deaths.  Those were 168 young babies from Clare who should have grown through childhood and be adults now, probably with their own children and grandchildren.  However, that was a future they were never to see and fulfil.  These are the people we need to consider in bringing about a story of justice and redress.<\/p> <p>With regard to Kilrush in my county, the report states that there were \"continuous requisitions\" for coffins.  What does that say?  Again, it harks back to that hugely high mortality rate of 168 Clare lives lost.  The report also quoted inspector reports that said there were appalling living conditions.  Children were sleeping in \"every habitable corner\".  It is good and welcome that we now have the report, but there are so many unanswered questions such as how, why and what happens next.<\/p> <p> The way the Tuam babies were buried was perverse.  They were not given a Christian burial.  It is a perversion that the religious organisations of our State, whose very premise is based on the birth of a baby child in Bethlehem and whose whole belief and faith system is based around that, which is a faith system I hold, would administer these mother and baby homes and not afford the most basic of Christian burials to some of these babies.<\/p> <p> There was demonisation of women, dehumanising of children and commodifying of life and forced adoptions, which, frustratingly, for so many who testified still seems to be somewhat disputed in the report.  There is nothing more perfect than the life of a baby child.  On three occasions I was blessed and fortunate to sit beside my wife as she gave birth to our three children.  It is disgusting and stomach churning to think that State, church and society would use horrible terms like \"illegitimate\" and \"born out of wedlock\" from the very get-go.  As these children breathed their first gulps of oxygen and cried to the world, the State and the instruments of the State did not recognise their legitimacy, calling these children horrible terms such as \"bastards\".  That is wrong and disgusting.  The real measure of the State now in the year 2021 is not so much what has come out in this report but about the redress and the justice that we must fight for and deliver for the victims and survivors of these homes and for the many children who never lived to tell their tale fully.  For anyone who lived in a mother and baby home and for any mother who gave birth in a mother and baby home, we all must say to them that they did nothing wrong.  They have nothing to be ashamed of.  They did not bring any shame on their families.  The church let them down, the State let them down and society let them down.<\/p> <p> This report is meaningless unless there is effective justice and redress.  I fully believe, and I think every Member in the House believes, that children should have a right to know who their birth parents are.  Every child should be entitled to an accurate birth certificate, which is the very document that verifies a person's identity and legitimacy.  That term now needs to be used.  Everyone is legitimate.  The church and the State must pay up with redress.  Many of the children born into these homes had lives that went in a certain trajectory from the moment they were born.  Many of them remained disadvantaged for their whole life.  They need effective redress.  In that regard, church and State must pay up with no ifs, buts or \"Will you pay up?\".  They will pay up.<\/p> <p> On the issue of the GDPR legislation, I welcome that the Minister has a modern take on all of this.  I am aware that, before entering D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, was a law lecturer and he has really cast a cold eye on all of this by seeing how this information can be freed up and used in the right channels.  I believe that GDPR legislation is good.  It is a way of accessing information but, as I said the Minister yesterday, GDPR legislation deals with the documents relating to oneself and we need more than that in this regard.  For this reason, every effort to advance tracing information legislation should be undertaken by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p> This went on until 1987.  I am a child of 1982, and if Google is correct, I believe the Minister is also a child of 1982.  This was happening in our lifetime.  It was not something that happened just in the 1920s or in black-and-white films.  This was happening in our lifetime and it is very conceivable that when I was a child going to primary and secondary school, I sat in a classroom with children who had come from a mother and baby home and had lived through this whole experience.  Nobody, be it society, State or church, can cast aside the fact that this all happened in living memory and is not some relic from the past.  We need to deal with it in this way.  It is a very current issue.  It is a real stain on our State.  We are about to approach 100 years of statehood.  The redress and the justice we deliver for these victims will be the litmus test for how good our State really is in the year 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000056#DDD00400","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611165000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of the report into the mother and baby homes.  Its publication brings to the surface the many dark and extremely oppressive, depressing and aggressive actions of many of these so-called homes.  This report is an important document which gives voice to the experiences of some of the most vulnerable in our society across many decades.  The survivors showed immense courage in giving their testimony.  We know that almost 9,000 children died in the institutions under investigation, which was about 15% of all the children who were in the care of those institutions.  This is a dark stain on the record of our State, the religious congregations and the society, which must be put right.  The publication of this report is the first step in that process.  It is an important one.  We must ensure that the many recommendations from it are seen through.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s unequivocal apology on behalf of the State.  I also note the apologies issued by just some of the religious congregations to date.  The apology is a key part of the 22 actions the Government is taking in response to the commission&rsquo;s report.  The Government has committed to a comprehensive response to the commission&rsquo;s recommendations, rooted in a survivor-centred approach.  This comprehensive response to the report is centred on eight themes, including a survivor-centred approach, the State apology and providing access to personal information.  My colleague, Deputy Cathal Crowe, has already referred to the birth certificates.  The rights of the women and their children to, and their need for, that information is crucial for health and personal reasons, as the Minister is aware.  Other themes of the Government response include the archives, which we have discussed with many people over recent months, the databases, to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks, education and research, memorialisation, redress and providing a dignified burial for all the children who died in these institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work and dedication of Catherine Corless and, equally, the five-year work of the commission, led by Judge Yvonne Murphy, supported Dr. William Duncan and Professor Mary Daly, in preparing this report.  It is also important to acknowledge feedback from survivors.  They have heartfelt and legitimate concerns about some aspects of this report that must be addressed, and soon.  I would welcome a commitment from the commission to engage with survivors and survivor organisations in this regard.  I ask that the Minister would clarify and confirm, perhaps in his closing remarks, that survivors who want a paper copy of the full report will be facilitated.  For too long, these people have been left in the dark when it comes to information.  It is their own information and it is imperative, as I said earlier, that the basic and simple action of access to the initial compilation of survivors' stories in this report and in the investigation must be made available to them.<\/p>  <p>  The report considers a number of institutions, some of which operated in my own constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, including the Magdalen laundry at St. Patrick&rsquo;s refuge, Crofton Road, which operated until the 1960s when it became St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital and convalescent home, the Cottage Home on Tivoli Road, Racefield House on Lower Mounttown Road, Smyly's Home on the Monkstown Road, Bartres Children's Home in Kill O&rsquo; the Grange, known as the Grange Linden convalescent home, Blackrock and now part of an apartment complex, St. Joseph&rsquo;s Orphanage on Tivoli Road, and the Bird&rsquo;s Nest on York Road.  Many of these buildings are familiar to the locals of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, but the history of what happened at many of these institutions may have been known only to survivors and their families.  There are other homes and institutions that fell outside of this report and these must be examined too.  No woman or child should be left out of any future investigation or redress.<\/p>  <p>  This report rightly puts the testimony and the stories of the survivors on the historical record.  It is important that these testimonies are recorded for future generations.  All religious congregations of all denominations and State institutions and organisations, both local and national, have a part to play in the reconciliation for these women and their children.  The publication of this report is a first step on a very long road of national reflection, redress and reconciliation along with atonement for the wrongs and injustices committed against the most vulnerable and innocent in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000057#EEE00200","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1611165600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I genuinely believe the Minister wants to do the right thing and I appeal to him now as I have done before.  He is the captain and manager of this team and when things change, it is time to go back and talk to the team before coming out for the second half and tell them they are taking a different approach for a better result.  I spoke to many survivors and adoptees over the last week.  My phone has been hopping.  They are disappointed in the report.  I spoke to good close friends of mine and as has been mentioned already, many things that people wanted to be in the report are not in it.  These people did not speak to the commission for glory.  They did this because they wanted to tell the truth.  They wanted it out there so this would never happen again.  While the report is lengthy and I am trying to get through it, there is not a lot in it that is shocking to me personally, as I have had experience of this issue for many years.  Five or six years ago I walked into Bessborough for the first time for a memorial.  I said to one of the survivors that the pink and blue balloons looked beautiful, and she told me they were markers for the boys and girls in those graves.  That was a shock to my system.<\/p>  <p>  There have to have been cover-ups because we have heard of them.  Let us be honest here.  It was the church, the State, the councils and the undertakers.  They were all involved in this and it was not for the goodness or the health of babies.  It was for profit.  People were sourced out.  So far, I have not seen a mention in the report about coloured babies.  We have spoken about illegitimate babies but coloured babies were classed as mules.  That is how they were recorded.  There is a lot to be done.  I ask the Minister to please not let this go.  This is only the tip of the iceberg.  We need to get some swift stuff going to start supporting survivors now because they do not have the time.  The Minister should not let the investigation slip now because this is only the tip of the iceberg and much more has to come out. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000058#FFF00100","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1611165600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Our response to the publication of this report must be constructive and based on the views of those who matter, namely, the survivors, those adopted through these institutions, their families and their advocates.  The report goes some way to giving voice to the histories that have been hidden to date but it is by no means an exhaustive account.  Survivors have described it to me as rushed, incomplete and unrepresentative.  Many aspects of the investigation were either inconclusive or were not adequately followed up on.  For example, based on my discussions with survivors, I spoke in the D&aacute;il about money changing hands for children.  At that time, I called it human trafficking and I still claim that to be case.  As was acknowledged in the report, a full account of financial transactions or a money trail could not be given.  For Sean Ross Abbey, records of deaths, births, admissions and other registers were made available to the commission but there was an absence of financial records.  A money trail could have informed survivors better about what went on in this institution and about themselves and those they lost.  Like other aspects of the report, this should have been more thoroughly examined with the congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, the local authorities concerned and the records of the relevant Departments.  This investigation must continue without delay.<\/p><p>The testimonies of the women concerned, as well as those of local communities, should also have been treated with the importance they deserve.  Witness accounts of money changing hands for children, like so many other accounts, were described as anecdotal.  This is an appalling under-representation of the importance of survivor's accounts.  There are also concerns about how accurately some of these testimonies have been reproduced in the report.  Again, this requires further investigation and accountability where needed.<\/p><p>Many questions have been raised here today by Members across the House and every effort must be made to fill those gaps in our knowledge through further consultation with survivors and ongoing investigations.  For example, the chapter of the report on excavations at Sean Ross Abbey clearly notes:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe total number of infant deaths which [are] recorded as having occurred here are 1078.  Without complete excavation it is not possible to say conclusively that all of these individuals are buried within the present site of the Children&rsquo;s Burial Ground.  There may have been dense concentrations of burials in other areas of the site that were not excavated. <\/blockquote>  <p>This is clear evidence that the Government must order new scans of that site and act quickly in shining a light on the many other unanswered questions for institutions raised elsewhere in this report.<\/p><p>The publication of this report does not wash the hands of the church or the State of their involvement in these decades of injustice, patriarchy and discrimination.  It only confirms that they are bound to provide further transparency about these years.  They are also obliged to address these wrongs through an examination and acknowledgment of our past.  Our survivors have been ignored and let down for long enough.  They cannot be failed any more. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000058#FFF00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1611165600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>First, I acknowledge the role my former colleague, Katherine Zappone, played in supporting the commission throughout her term of office, which was not easy at times.  Most important was her engagement, in a respectful manner, with the survivors and their families.  History will show that the Independent Ministers in the previous Government fought against the systemic bias towards sweeping issues under the carpet and just hoping they would go away.  This is, at least in part, the reason we ended up with the institutions such as mother and baby homes and many more institutional scandals, which at the very least were known to official Ireland and were at best just ignored and swept under that very same carpet.<\/p>  <p>  The commission's report has provided new information and in the case of the vaccine trials, provided some answers to the children involved.  It has also raised many other questions.  For those who criticised the work of the commission, I want to put on record that it has provided information and hopefully secured documentation that the State had conveniently brushed under that carpet by turning a blind eye to the failure to comply with the most rudimentary standards for vaccine trials.  The State willingly returned personal medical documentation in the past without considering the implications for the people, then innocent children, involved.  The Ryan commission records of the vaccine trials were returned by the State to the congregations involved nearly a decade ago, without giving access to the individuals who had been impacted by them.<\/p>  <p>  While the commission has reviewed the medical records available to it and concluded that there was no evidence of injury to the children involved in the vaccine trials, such a conclusion is simplistic.  These children were treated as little more than human pincushions by the companies and clinicians involved, due to the large number of injections they received and the blood samples that were taken.  How can we be sure that there were no delayed immunological impacts from these particular formulations if no guardian was in a position to tell the clinician treating that child after the end of the trial that he or she had previously received an experimental formulation?  The child as an adult would also not be in a position to inform his or her treating doctor that he or she was involved in an experimental trial.  Each of these children must be contacted and provided with medical records and these, combined with their medical history, must be independently reviewed and a full and transparent report published on the conclusions.  This should happen immediately and the full cost must be born by GlaxoSmithKline.<\/p>  <p>  The commission did, however, flag the issue of consent and the failure to secure it.  Why is the issue of consent so important?  It is primarily because we all have a basic human right to our own bodily integrity.  There is a need for informed consent in advance of any medical study.  This was not sought despite it being the legal and regulatory requirement at the time.  Without engaging with the parents or guardians of the children, a clinician could not deem them to be suitable for inclusion in any trial.  For example, paragraph 34.121 of the report, on the 1968-1969 measles vaccine trial, states that the trial should have excluded children \"with a personal history of convulsions, or allergy, asthma and eczema, or strong family history of same\".<\/p> <p>Without consent, how could this have been ascertained in respect of these children?  At least in some of the homes, consent was a standard procedure for vaccinations outside of clinical trials at that point in time.  Paragraph 34.71 states:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe Dunboyne institutional records contain completed written consent forms relating to instances where infants resident there were presented for immunisation at the public health clinic.  These consent forms were signed by either the mother or the matron. <\/blockquote> <p>However, there were no consent forms available for the clinical trials.<br\/><br\/>It is also clear from the report that the Department of Health had serious problems with the use of children in these homes for clinical trials, similar to concerns raised in the UK.  However, paragraph 34.92 states:<\/p><blockquote>\tA Department of Health document dated 13 December 1963 dealing with this application noted that, in April 1962, Professor Meenan had asked to field-trial an Oral Polio Vaccine in Pelletstown.  In that instance, it was noted that the Department of Health had no objection to the trial itself but raised concerns regarding the selection of Pelletstown: 'While the procedure proposed appeared to be a safe one, the selection of the group to participate was open to objection and approval was not given on that occasion.' <\/blockquote> <p>The Department did not want clinical trials being carried out on children in homes.  However, it did not seem to make any difference to the clinicians involved whether the Department gave consented or not.  Indeed, paragraph 34.163 notes that permission was sought to field trial an oral polio vaccine on children in Pelletstown and was refused.  The report goes on to state: &quot;The Commission takes the view there is a high probability&quot; that Pelletstown was in fact used in the trial, despite the refusal to grant approval by the Department.<br\/><br\/>GlaxoSmithKline has many questions to answer.  Why did the scientific publications on UK and Nigerian trials specifically make reference to consent, yet these references were conveniently left out of the very same publications on trials based on Irish children?  Why was Ireland seen as a soft option for trials involving children in institutions?  Clearly, such trials could not take place in the UK.  That would that have been the case in Ireland, based on the regulatory and legal system that was in place at the time.  However, because of a lack of enforcement in Ireland, they were happy to proceed.  Paragraph 34.122 states:<\/p><blockquote>\tOn 5 September 1968, Dr Coffey told Dr Burland [from Glaxo Laboratories] that she had come up against 'the usual complications' while trying to arrange to field-trial Glaxo&rsquo;s measles vaccine in Dublin. <\/blockquote> <p>The response from Glaxo was very interesting.  According to the report:<\/p><blockquote>\tDr Burland advised Dr Coffey to liaise with Dr Hillery as &lsquo;she may be able to suggest a way in which you could overcome the problems you have encountered&rsquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>In other words, there could be a way to get around the law of the land and the refusal of the Department of Health to sanction this trial.  GlaxoSmithKline needs to clarify why these formulations were not placed on the market on a commercial basis.  Was it because they were not effective in actually preventing the diseases that they were supposed to?  If that was the case, it would have impacted on the subsequent immunity of the children involved in these studies.  Were children outside of homes, either in Ireland or the UK, subjected to the battery of needles that the children in these homes were?  There was multiple administration of vaccine doses, and multiple blood sampling procedures took place.  As a matter of urgency, there must now be an engagement with GlaxoSmithKline on behalf of the children who were involved in these trials.  As a very first step, it must provide a clear and unequivocal apology and forthright answers.  It must also put in place financial support package in place for those exploited by ignoring their basic fundamental right of bodily integrity.  GlaxoSmithKline benefited financially from this research.  It was happy enough to ensure that those who conducted the trials also benefited from it.  It needs now to live up to its responsibilities to the victims.<br\/><br\/>There was a clear benefit to the clinicians involved in these trials.  Direct payments are referenced.  At the very least, funding was provided for research facilities, which would assist those researchers in securing scientific publications.  Many of the researchers were also involved in scientific publications which helped them secure promotions and status within the scientific community and would also have been of benefit to the universities involved.  We must now see an apology from the two universities involved, namely, UCD and Trinity College, Dublin.<br\/><br\/>It is also important to point out that these scientific publications were peer-reviewed in advance of publication.  In the <i>British Medical Journal <\/i>and <i>The Lancet<\/i>, interestingly, publication of the British trials include an outline of the consent and confirmation that consent was obtained in line with the law and ethical standards, but not when it came to the publication of the Irish studies.  Why was this not set as a precondition of publication?  It should have been.  If it had been and the academics were told that they must provide that, maybe then, those particular children would not have been exploited and those institutions would not have been used again and again.  There must be an explanation as to why this did not happen and an apology from both the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>and <i>The Lancet<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>As I said at the start, there was a cover up right to the top.  The attitude was one of brush it under the carpet and it will go away.  Paragraph 34.153 of the report states that the Department of Health had flagged it in 1968 that Professor Meenan had conducted vaccine trials without the authorisation of the Minister for Health.  There are many questions here.  The victims must be supported to get answers and apologies right across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000058#FFF00300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611166200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>We are debating a report about an intolerant Ireland and a very dark period in our past.  I have not read a whole lot of the report, but from what I have read of it, it smacks of the intolerance of society.  We can blame many factors in society for that, but that is what comes through.  When I am looking at reports of this nature, I am taken back to July 1989, when I was working on my uncle's farm with John Joe Bradley.  He left school at 13 years of age and worked on farms all over the place.  He talked to me about his own life and the challenges facing his own family.  He also talked about people and the way they were treated.  He outlined to me the stories of three women within the community, and what had happened to them.  I remember quite distinctly when he looked at me and said: \"Michael, can I put it very clearly to you.  When we were at our most Catholic, we were at our least Christian.\"<\/p> <p>I have heard many fine speakers, in the 30 years since that conversation, talk about the scandals that have been thrown up in Irish society, but nobody has put it as clearly as John Joe Bradley did.

We delivered an intolerant society that was based on where people fell in a pecking order.<\/p> <p> It is important that we debate this report and that we find redress for those who suffered.  Church, State and all of us must look within our hearts.  I challenge us all today to look around at our society in 2021, 100 years on from the founding of our State, and to seek to weed out intolerance.  We have to look at where intolerance is causing huge pressures for people today.  When we look at what is happening on social media and various platforms, and the polarisation that is there, we see that the middle is afraid to speak out because of the powerful voices of intolerance on either side.  Our legacy as Members of this D&aacute;il must be to ensure that, in 50, 60 or 70 years' time, nobody will say we turned a blind eye to the intolerance that is within our society today.  That is our challenge and it should be our response to the horrific suffering of women in the intolerant society of the past.

The report outlines the difficulty the commission experienced in providing its executive summary.  In drafting my words today, I have some understanding of that difficulty.  However, it is fair to say that the independent commission has failed to provide an executive summary that does justice to tho people who were uncared for in these institutions.  In fact, in reading the full report, I feel the commission has done a disservice to its own work in the executive summary it presented.  In particular, the statement that there is \"no evidence that women were forced to enter mother and baby homes by the church or State authorities\" has proved offensive.  It does not take into account the impact of the society which the report condemns.  There may not have been a court that sentenced women to these institutions but the court of public opinion dragged them there without mercy.<\/p>  <p>  In preparing for this debate, I tried to see how I could contribute in a way that would add to the overall discussion.  As Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on local government, I would like to highlight the role of many local authorities in the running of the mother and baby homes, as set out in the report.  Before doing so, I want to make clear that, in so doing, I let no Government or church off the hook.  The fount of judgmental dishonour that flowed from the fonts of religious churches, particularly the Catholic Church, poisoned Irish society at every level.  It infected every decision of the State and the people within it.  I am not a member of any church but I am a Member of this House and I am particularly cognisant of the role of the State in this matter.  In issuing a State apology, An Taoiseach acknowledged the failure of the State in this regard and the failure of all those individuals involved in the State.  It is hard to pin guilt on a society but it is clear that people at every level - I refer in particular to office holders - were guilty of failing to ask the hard questions, even when the evidence was in front of them.  As a people, we did not ask the hard questions.  Right from the very top, with few exceptions, from Ministers responsible for local government and public health - I wish I had time to name each one of them - right down to inspectors and local authority officials, few questions were asked.<\/p>  <p>  I was taken aback by much of what is in this report but particularly the evidence that when the payment for unmarried mothers was finally introduced in 1973, not one Member of this House spoke on that occasion other than the junior Minister who introduced it.  That is an indictment of the body politic, the media and the society of that time.  Post independence, many local authorities inherited a system of workhouses.  They relied on religious orders to staff them, paid members of those orders as staff of the local authority and funded and expanded the institutions.  Councillors and officials even met within the walls of those institutions.  When presented with evidence of neglect, local authority staff often were deferential to the Catholic hierarchy, sometimes allowing conditions of neglect to continue as they waited out the departure of a difficult bishop.  Some of the homes provided decent burials and burial records but others failed to account for where the innocent dead were buried.  When I and other Members of this House say that local authorities should have more power, we should not forget this chapter of our history.  When local authorities had power, remit and governance, they let down women and children.  Every local authority mentioned in the report should hold a special meeting to debate and reflect on their role in this history.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the only way we will make this right is to implement the findings of the report and provide redress for all who suffered, not just for those who fall on one side of an arbitrary decision in 1973.  It is important, in particular, that we provide access to birth information.  The heat of the debate on the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters) Records, and Another Matter, Bill 2020 is still with us.  My motivation and that of the Minister and many people on this side of the House in voting for that legislation was to protect that information and the database which holds it in order that the Government could legislate to enable people to access it.  That trajectory will be vindicated only when people have access, and that must be the priority of the Government.  In 50 years' time, the record of this House will show that we did not stay silent on this issue today.  I hope we will likewise not be silent on the contemporary issues of injustice that face our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000060#HHH00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1611166800,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the debate on this report.  I begin by suggesting that serious consideration be given to having a national remembrance day for all those who died in the mother and baby homes.  It is something that should be considered over the next few months.<\/p>  <p>  I want to touch on one or two issues that were raised earlier today.  Back in 1974, the former President and then Senator, Mary Robinson, made an unsuccessful attempt to abolish the status of illegitimacy when she introduced a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad.  In the early 1980s, I was involved in a broad-based campaign to abolish the status of illegitimacy.  Our campaign faced opposition within my own party and, indeed, the wider community.  We estimated that it would take us ten years to change the law.  However, we continued to maintain the pressure and the Government of the day eventually published the Status of Children Bill in 1986, which became law in 1987.  That was an important social and legal change in terms of children's rights.<\/p>  <p>  From the foundation of the State in 1922, part of the Irish struggle was to establish an identity at home and abroad, with a strong emphasis on an Irish exceptionalism centred on family and Catholic moral values.  Respectability was highly valued and, in effect, church and State worked together to establish a type of theocratic society where the dominant ideology was that of the Catholic Church.  Throughout the period from the 1920s to the end of the 1960s, we continued to suffer economic hardship, population decline and high levels of emigration.<\/p> <p>Emigration, rather than change, was also the safety valve for poverty, disease and death, especially infant deaths.  The records of the register of births, deaths and marriages show that, during the first 50 years of the Irish State, the total number of infant deaths was 160,000.  In fact, the worst year was 1944, when more than 5,000 infants died.  The annual number of infant deaths began to fall substantially from 1948 onwards, but it was not until 1979 that the number of infant deaths fell below 1,000 in a single year.<br\/><br\/>The prevailing ideology for more than six decades was that single mothers and their children were seen as a threat to families.  Society placed an extraordinary burden of guilt and shame on them.  In most cases, the fathers of these children abandoned their responsibilities.<br\/><br\/>There is no doubt that the vast majority of women who entered mother and baby homes were coerced.  Social workers referring to this group of women said:<\/p><blockquote>\tThere is a cohort of women about whom we know very little, and for whom we must have great concern.  These are women who we, as social workers, believe were so shamed at the time of pregnancy and birth by the system and by those from whom they might have wished for support that they have never told anyone (including husband and other children) of the child or children to whom they gave birth and who live in fear of being found out and feeling their lives could be destroyed. <\/blockquote> <p>We must, however, balance their rights with the rights of those who want to establish their identity.  The children who were born in mother and baby homes have rights.  They received no support from the State from the day they were born and many did not even get a basic education.  It is important that everything possible is done for them at the earliest possible date.  They have travelled a difficult road and the State must now prioritise their needs in the best possible way.<br\/><br\/>I do not have a simple answer to the complex issues surrounding the balancing of rights to personal privacy and the right to information on personal identity.  However, I would encourage everyone to read chapter 36 of the report, in particular from section 70 onwards, before they come to any conclusion on this complex issue.  There is an understandable urge for immediate action and the media is reflecting this urgency.  Yet, as we move to put right some of the wrongs previously committed, let us be mindful of the danger of hurting those who have already been badly broken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000060#HHH00300","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611167400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>The right to identity, to know who we are, is fundamental.

There is instituted indignity.  For example, the report could not be couriered to the survivors because the Minister did not have the addresses.  Yet, he had time to film a handy video presenting their suffering as content.  That is not to mention the leaks given to the newspapers.  It really falls short of what the survivors deserve.  What has the State learned from this?  I do not believe this disrespect to survivors was due to the fact that the report was such a blatant disappointment.<\/p>  <p>  We have to give the women and children what they did not get back then or last week.  They need dignity.  This is not over.  This State has to make the apology relevant.  I do not mean only redress, although that is certainly needed.  The stories of these women and children need to be put into our modern history curriculum in schools so that our young people can learn about the State's dysfunctional relationship with women, especially poor women.  Young people need to learn how ugly 100 years of patriarchal rule looks.  These women and their children - our fellow citizens - deserve no less.<\/p>  <p>  Each of us is a link in the human chain.

It was a regime which incarcerated women and girls, degraded and dehumanised them and forcibly removed children from their mothers.

The report was never about compensation or redress.  It is about recognition of unnecessary feeling of stigma that women such as Alice McEvoy suffered.  She spoke passionately in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  She said she does not need the money but she knows many others who do.  She said it was appalling that the authors excluded those in the post-1973 cohort and I agree with her fully.<\/p><p>I strongly believe GlaxoSmithKline should be asked to contribute financially to the mother and baby homes redress scheme.  I believe GlaxoSmithKline has a significant moral obligation to contribute.  The involvement of the company in vaccine clinical trials was to its financial benefit overall.  The company's engagement with the mother and baby homes and their residents was at best dubious, but in real terms it was unethical and illegal.  For example, the Bessborough institutional records show that at least five mothers of children resident in Bessborough who participated in trials had mental health issues.<\/p> <p>Another mother was only 17 years old.  There was another.  I will quote from the report, \"It is abundantly clear that ... [this trial] did not comply with the regulatory and ethical standards in place at the time.\"<\/p> <p> These are just two examples, and there are so many others in the report, that paint GlaxoSmithKline in a caring or professional manner.  If anything, it is the total opposite.  The findings of these trials were of huge financial benefit to what is now GlaxoSmithKline, a major pharmaceutical operation that had turnover of &euro;40 billion in 2019.  GlaxoSmithKline should contribute.  It has a moral obligation to do so.  This Government should immediately start dialogue in that regard.  Between 1975 and 1981 GlaxoSmithKline gave &pound;240,000 annually to Irish veterinary research.  If it gave triple this figure for each of the 40 years it conducted unethical vaccine trials on children, that would be a proper contribution to the redress scheme by GlaxoSmithKline.  A figure in the region of &euro;500 million would be what is expected.  The company made &euro;6 billion in profit in 2019, and &euro;500 million represents 1% of its profits over the past ten years.<\/p> <p> What I do not want is for these pharmaceutical companies, the Government, the State, the local authorities and the church to bury this in paperwork.

It took all the evidence from these survivors but did not represent it properly in the report.  The leaking of this document by the Government was wrong.  There has been enough wrongdoing.  It is now time to stand up and to make some contribution to these survivors.  These people need to be taken to task for their illegal actions, but we do not need this to go on for years upon years.  It is now time for the Government to act and to be counted to make sure these survivors get something now that may improve their lives now.  I ask the Government not to let this go through years of millions being wasted through legal challenges.

It is very important and right that we acknowledge and go through this very important report, which has shone a light on such a dark time in our history and in our society in a way that, we all have to be honest and perfectly frank, we have to be ashamed of.  The awful and inhuman way in which young girls and boys and children were treated by the institutions of this State, which were aiding and abetting one another at the time, is beyond belief.  One saying that often comes up in conversation is \"that was then and this is now\".  We have to be so careful that in our society at present we do not allow wrongs to continue, whether those wrongs are, for example, children being homeless or other people being homeless and not being taken care of properly by the State.  We have to be so mindful.<\/p>  <p>  I listened very carefully earlier to my good friend and colleague, Deputy Moynihan, talk about social media.  We have to be careful about what is going on in that regard and careful that in a number of years' time we will not look back and say there were young people whose formative years were scarred or they were upset or treated badly because of social media.  That could be the new form of bullying.  What went on in the past in these institutions, where people were inhumanely treated, was a horrible type of degrading behaviour.  Of course, it was also bullying because those people saw themselves as being so awfully powerful, with such God-almightiness in them, that they could do whatever they wanted to other human beings.<\/p>  <p>  It should be remembered that there is nothing in this whole world as nice as a small young child, be it a little boy or a little girl, and seeing them coming into the world.  Wherever or however they come into this world is totally immaterial; the fact is that the person is a human being.  Children are so welcome into the world, and we should all be willing to do everything we can to mind, nurture, protect and educate them and get them ready for life.  Unfortunately, there were people, whether in the education sphere or in those awful institutions that were called homes, who treated people in a way that was so wrong.  We have all heard on local radio in recent years survivors, as we will call them, coming out and telling their stories.  It is so important that we get educated and that we know their stories because in many instances we would not otherwise know the truth of the enormity of the wrongs that were done to them.  Of course they should be compensated.  I am not saying they are looking for compensation.  The less people look for it the more they should actually get it because they are entitled to it.  The institutions that hurt or harmed them should be made recompense them, not that all the money in the world can buy back their youth or the years they might have gone to bed upset, hungry, tired, cold or weary, with nobody to give them a squeeze, to tell them they are a great little boy or a great young girl or to mind them and be kind to them.  It is an awful thing to think they were robbed of that.<\/p>  <p>  I have a very strong message to the people who survived.  I thank them for telling their stories and letting us all see that shameful time.  I have a strong message to the bullies of today.  I will give the House an example.  When I sit down here tonight, I will more than likely get a message from a person who is very fond of messaging me continuously when I stand up in the D&aacute;il.  This person berates me personally and my family and tells me what a horrible person I am.  I say to that dirty, rotten coward this: come out into the open and face me like any normal person would face me and have a debate.  It is fine for this type of horribleness that goes on to happen to me.  That is no problem because I am able for it, but what about young people who are not able to take that type of nastiness?  I say to those cowards this: go away and do a bit of work and do something normal in life rather than looking into a computer screen and trying to figure out how to say horrible words to somebody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000062#KKK00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1611168000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000062#KKK00250","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1611168000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>This is an important point to finish.

I regret to say that although everyone in this House praises Irish independence, it is unfortunately the case that the role afforded to Irish women by the new State was very limited and very sexist.  This is particularly surprising when one thinks of the revolutionary era.  Everyone in this House is aware that during the revolutionary period Cumann na mBan played an extremely important part in the struggle for Irish independence.<\/p> <p>I think of all those valiant brave revolutionary women who subsequently became Members of this House and who fought not just for Irish independence but who were also fighting for the rights of women.  I am thinking in particular of people like Kathleen Clarke, Kathleen O'Callaghan, Mary MacSwiney and Ada English.  We are all aware of Constance Markievicz.  It is surprising that a revolution that took place in this country and which produced so many fine revolutionary women as them ended up becoming a Free State which degraded the image of women in society.  We need to ask ourselves why is it that a revolution that promised such equality for women in Irish society ended up resulting in a State which discriminated against them and did not treat them in a way that could be described as anything other than sexist and perhaps misogynistic.<\/p> <p> In order to understand why there has been that change, we have to look back to Irish history.  One historian has noted that those revolutionary women seem to have disappeared from Irish public life by 1926.  The only time that they are referred to or are identified publicly after that is when they are commemorating a deceased male relative.  Why is it that a revolutionary movement in this country translates into a Free State that is discriminatory and sexist against women, when such an important part had been played in that revolution by women, who not only espoused the cause of an Irish Republic but also espoused the cause of equality and rights for women?  <\/p> <p> We have to look to what happened after the Civil War.  It was clearly the case then that the bishops of the Catholic Church in Ireland stated publicly that they were concerned about the moral fibre of society, about what was happening in dance halls and about the immodest attitudes of women.  There was clearly an attempt then to try to present a new image of Irish women in the new Irish State.  Regrettably, that was not to be the image of Constance Markievicz, Kathleen Clarke or, indeed, Ada English, but was instead to be an image of Irish women which was to be exclusively concentrated upon motherhood, virginity and purity.  There is nothing wrong with those three characteristics but when a State turns around and imposes those characteristics on one section of society, it is very suffocating.  When a State says that this is the ideal image of what an Irish woman should be it can only have a very negative impact on those very many Irish women who did not want to fit within that stereotype.  <\/p> <p> When we look to see what happened with the Free State, we note that W.T. Cosgrave decided to adopt Catholic social mores into the laws of the State.  We know of the very deferential attitude that the first independent Irish Government adopted towards the Catholic Church.  We see legislation that this House enacted that we can now look back upon with a sense of embarrassment.  I looked earlier today at the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 1926.  At that stage women had the right to work in jobs in the Civil Service but that legislation, which was enacted by these Houses of the Oireachtas back in 1926, removed the opportunity for women to work in those jobs.  It specified that the jobs would only apply to one sex, namely, men.<\/p> <p> We also saw legislation enacted in 1929, the Censorship of Publications Act, which prevented anyone from accessing information in respect of contraception.  Those legislative manoeuvres and the actions of the new Irish Government indicated that the image of Irish women that this State endorsed was the one as presented by the Catholic Church.  Motherhood was at the centre of it.  Virginity, purity and compliance, however, were also an essential aspect of that representation of Irish women.  We see that subsequent to the 1920s, when Fianna F&aacute;il came to power in 1932, and in the Constitution of 1937, it is the case that there were significant objections from some revolutionary women about the inclusion of the woman&rsquo;s place being in the home.  Dorothy Macardle was a woman who sought to prevent that from happening but it continued and the representation of Irish women was always that of being motherhood.  Any image of sexuality was regarded as being negative and as something that was not appropriate in an Irish woman.  Unfortunately, all of that led to feelings of guilt and shame being imposed upon the large majority of Irish women in society.  It was fear, guilt and shame which made Irish people believe that an Irish woman who had a child outside of wedlock was in some respect evil.  We have to apologise for that.  This report goes some way towards apologising for that but it is important that we recognise and own up to the fact that the reason women were forced into mother and baby homes was because of the image of women that was put forward by this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000062#KKK00300","speaker":"1553","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611168600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman and the Ministers for the opportunity to say few words on the report of last week as this is my first opportunity to do so.  I agree with many colleagues in the many excellent points that have been made, none more so than Deputy Connolly, who hit the nail on the head for me on this issue.  I will make some points generally about the report towards the end of my contribution but I want to initially put on record the testimony and words of a very brave individual who is a friend of mine for 40 years.  He asked me to mention his name, which is Graham Monaghan.  He is in his 50th year and is a survivor of residential institutions' abuse.  He has been through the redress scheme that we had in the past and it is very important that we embrace his testimony as we set out to bring some level of justice to the victims and survivors of the mother and baby homes scandal.  These are his words:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI discovered that I had been the victim of repeated physical abuse as an infant in care and with legal advice set about making a submission to the redress board.  The original redress procedure was supposed to be non-confrontational but it appears that most if not all victim-survivors' experience was anything but that.  So many, including myself, were made feel that we were looking for something that we were not really entitled to.  The formula used to calculate your award was like something from a television quiz show.  Points made pounds.  The whole experience was cold, unfair and demeaning in so many ways.  We had to sign a gagging order to say that we would never disclose any settlement or we would face serious penalties.  <br \/><br \/>We are not equals in our own country and we are the innocent victims of someone else&rsquo;s circumstances.  We have no rights to access our basic information such as our full birth certificate and medical files, which for many of us, including me, we are led to believe no longer exist.  I have no idea what I was fully subjected to as a defenceless baby.  For the State to continue treating us different within society and not as true equals only helps to promote prejudices which do exist, which others like myself have had to endure and to this day have to deal with.<br \/><br \/>In my experience, and I am sure with so many others too, we have to try and defend ourselves against extended family members who do not regard us as real family and that you were not really the son or daughter of your parents.  It is horrible.  <br \/><br \/>Despite the fact that both of my elbows were destroyed while I was in care, I still know I am one of the lucky ones because I was adopted by two incredible people and I feel a deep guilt for all those who were not as lucky as me and that is a guilt that I carry with me every day.  I do not trust the State on any of these issues that have affected so many of us badly because the State has such a shocking track record on these matters.  The time for talking and making apologies has to stop.  It is time to listen not just hear our voices.  <br \/><br \/>Only those of us who have lived and have experienced these lives, along with those loved ones and friends who have watched and supported us go through so much pain, hurt and frustration, can really and truly understand just what our lives have been like with all the obstacles that can be put in our way.<br \/><br \/>In my case, having to go through the indignity of having to ask my dad to sign an affidavit to swear who I was and that he was my father just so I could go ahead with getting married.  The reason for this was despite the fact that I was baptised twice, once shortly after birth and second after adoption, no one had a cert which appeared to apply to me.  I will never get over the hurt of having to ask my dad to do that.  It will always be one of the very lowest points in my life. <\/blockquote> <p>He says all they are looking for is truth, equality and justice and that it is time for proper action to start, allowing them to come out, lift the shadows of the dark past under which they have lived their lives and for once feel like equals.  These are the words of Mr. Graham Monaghan and I am glad to put them on the record.<\/p> <p> Last week, the Taoiseach stated that a republic should be prepared to hold itself to account.  I agree 100%.  As we apologise to these people and promise redress, we should learn the mistakes of the way the Graham Monaghans were treated and not match what we did before, which was inadequate.  To this day, we do not hold ourselves to account.  I doubt that we would get the answer, but if someone tabled a parliamentary question to find out how many protected disclosures across Departments and State agencies were under consideration currently, I imagine they would probably number in the hundreds.  Is the State's approach to hold ourselves to account and give people justice?  No, it is not.  The entire system is rigged, supported by all of us in these Houses, to circle the wagons, delay, deny and defend.  The house must always win.  Ask Mr. Maurice McCabe, Mr. Noel McGree and the countless people who have gone public and who, with the benefit of \"Liveline\", some of us in these Houses, the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees, have got some justice.  The reality is that the Republic does not hold itself to account.  Only when we are dragged kicking and screaming do we acknowledge what we have done and set about putting it right.<\/p> <p> I hope we do not repeat mistakes in seeking to provide adequate redress and full disclosure to these people.  Last week, the Taoiseach told us that there was no constitutional barrier to the Graham Monaghans of the world getting their birth certificates.  The Minister should get on with it.  He has stated that he looks forward to the legislative scrutiny stage of the appropriate adoption and tracing legislation in the coming months.  He is a Minister, but he is relatively new to these Houses and, in my experience, what he said was Department speak for on the never-never.  I have participated in passing legislation at night that was written that morning.  For once, let us do what the Taoiseach said last week.  Let us be prepared as a republic to hold ourselves to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000063#LLL00200","speaker":"1606","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611169200,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Seo an dara deis at&aacute; tar &eacute;is a bheith agam bheith p&aacute;irteach sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo agus n&iacute; m&oacute;r dom a r&aacute; nach bhfuil maol&uacute; ar bith ar mo chuid feirge n&oacute; mo chuid d&iacute;om&aacute;.

My anger has increased, as has my sense of despondency.  Once again, I will take courage in my hand, with my privileged position and decent salary, and speak up.  If the Minister wants to put the survivors - I hate that word, but I will use it because they have used it themselves - to the fore, he might explain how there was a leak.  He has had time to investigate.  He might explain why the survivors have not got copies of the full report yet.  He might explain why Deputies did not have copies of the executive summary last week when they spoke in the D&aacute;il.  Does he think he could do that?  These explanations were not included in his speech.  He might confirm that those who had the courage to go before the commission and the confidential committee will be given copies of their full testimonies.  Could he do that?  It would be a start.  He might publish the report of the collaborative forum, which he mentioned in his speech.  God help us, but he also mentioned that he would set up a new interdepartmental committee.  Lord protect us from interdepartmental committees.  He will also engage with the collaborative forum.  Its recommendations were published in April 2019 but not its report.  Perhaps he might balance the power between an interdepartmental committee with no representation by a collaborative forum or survivors and the collaborative forum and the people on the ground.  He might confirm that he will make full copies of the commission's report available to all of us who want them, beginning with the survivors.  He might explain how half of the &euro;23 million that was allocated was used last October, although not to print a single copy.  He might say that the Government made a mistake in having a webinar without giving out the report in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  Enough on that for the moment and I will now turn to the report.  The report refers to all of society.  For a change, I will quote a philosopher rather than a poet.  When one attributes blame in that manner, one has no responsibility.  I touched on this point last week.  I will cite Dr. Hannah Arendt, who was speaking in a different context but whose words are equally applicable to this report.  According to her, the person who says that we are all guilty, as was the case in Germany, is unknowingly covering up for the ones who did it.  That is why we should not generalise guilt because doing so would be to cover up for the guilty.  I do not believe that this finding has been laid out in the report unknowingly.  I will bow down to anyone who has read its 3,000 pages - it is not possible.  I have spent hours spending 500 to 600 pages.  I have read the whole executive summary and what I was given by the Department.  I have read the chapter on Tuam, the statistical analysis of Tuam, the chapter on discrimination and the chapter on vaccines, to which I hope I will have time to return.  I glanced at a few other chapters.  All of this has taken hours and hours.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister gave his speech, some of which I welcome in terms of the specifics for urgent legislation and access to records, including birth certificates, which is a basic human right.  We did not need a report to tell us that, but I welcome it anyway.  However, when the Minister follows other recommendations without even listening to the people on the ground who have not had a chance to read the report, then he is doing exactly what was done to these mothers and children before, in that he is patronising them and carrying on a patriarchal mode.  Let us halt that for a minute and do what the Government should do, that is, legislate and provide access to records.  It should set up an archive and so on, but bear in mind that the National Archives have been under-resourced for years.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Minister now making a distinction between the 18 institutions in question and the other institutions where mothers and babies were kept?<\/p>  <p>  The report tells us that it is unrepresentative because it has only taken a sample.  That is good.  This point should have guided the conclusions, but the commission seems not to have followed it.  As such, we have an unrepresentative sample and the report makes strong conclusions that are at odds with witness testimony.  The report then adds insult to injury on page 12, which shows a beautiful picture in autumnal colours, but all colour disappears quickly when one reads the witness testimony.  That testimony jumps off the page - sexual abuse, rape, babies taken and an absence of any sense of understanding of the bond between mother and child.  This testimony should be preserved and acted upon, but the conclusions were that there was no evidence of forced adoption - I could not possibly accept this - and no evidence of pressure to put people into mother and baby homes.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan reinforced the myth that society was responsible.  It was not society, but the powerful in society, led by the church.  I am not here to scapegoat nuns because the nuns reported to the bishop, who reported to the archbishop, who reported to Rome.  What did our Governments do?  They bowed down in deference.  The Minister mentioned what our local authorities did.  The county managers played a powerful role.<\/p>  <p>  All of this has been set out in the report, but we are then told that the evidence from some of those who came forward - only residents, mind you - is \"contaminated\".  Sin an bhfocal - \"truaillithe\".  Imagine telling people who had the courage to come forward that some gave evidence that was contaminated.  How many is \"some\"?  In what way was their evidence contaminated?<\/p>  <p>Equally, was the same measuring stick used for the professionals that came before the commission?  I refer to the doctors, priests, nuns, social workers and the witnesses from the county councils?  The reason it was contaminated was because the former residents spoke to each other.  Presumably, the nuns and the county managers did also, but their evidence was not contaminated.  I am not sure if the Minister read it.  I am openly telling him that I have not read the report's 3,000 pages.  Our former President tells us that she read it, and as a result of reading it she tells us it is scholarly and profound.  With the greatest of respect, I fundamentally disagree that this is scholarly and profound.  If somebody has read 3,000 pages then he or she must have had the report before the Minister published it.<\/p> <p> We will again look at the conclusions.  There is a conclusion regarding vaccine trials.  Deputy Naughten went through this forensically today.  I have read that chapter.  There is a paragraph in the summary that tells us that the trials did not comply with the regulations or the law at the time but, magically, there were no ill effects.  If one reads the chapter on the vaccine trials, one sees children getting sick with diarrhoea, convulsions and so on, not to mention the 10,000 deaths at a minimum, yet this commission of three people tell us there were no side effects.  They do not even pose a question on whether there could have been side effects or if more money changed hands.  It was pointed out that it went to the doctors.  Did more money change hands?  What about the other trials?  We only looked at seven institutions.  Were there trials in other institutions?  Does the Minister think the commissioners might have raised a question in regard to that?<\/p> <p> Will the Minister indicate whether any of the three commissioners sat and listened to the 500 or so residents who came before the confidential committee?  I know there was a tiny overlap of fewer than 100 between some residents who went to both.  Did the commissioners sit in?  This reminds me of paint-by-numbers pictures.  Does the Minister remember that?  One was allowed a little discretion in what colour one put into the number, but the picture was predetermined.  The picture was predetermined here because on page 2 the commissioners tell us that it might disappoint somebody that they are going against the prevailing narrative.  That is to add insult on top of injury because they confirm the prevailing narrative of the powerful, which is that all of society was to blame.  They add insult to injury by even twisting language.  The Minister has a golden opportunity to lead and to bring about transformative action and language.  I will back him every step of the way, but he has got to lead.  He must break away from the four and a half pages that he delivered here today, which is more of the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000064#MMM00200","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611169800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000065#NNN00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1611169800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>It is a mixture of good and bad that confirms the narrative.

In short, approximately 200 hard copies of the abridged report have been sent out to date.  Of those, 75 were posted on the day of publication to the survivors and their representatives and to select Members, Deputies and Senators.  Since then, 123 requests for the abridged version have been received to date and a copy has been posted to all of those who requested them.  There have been 247 requests for copies of the full report.  They are in stock and the distribution company is organising the distribution at the moment.  Any of the survivors who would like to get a copy can contact the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the report will be sent directly to them at no cost whatsoever.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p>  <p>  It is my second time also to contribute on this matter.  I welcome the opportunity to address the House a week after a landmark moment of truth for the State and for the people.  I thank everybody who brought responses, stories and feedback from their constituents into the Chamber today and for the ongoing engagement with the survivors, which is critical.  Many questions have been asked throughout the past three and a half hours and I do not have the answers to all of them, but the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has sat through the entire debate, and between him and the Department, answers will go back to Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  There is a strong onus on us now not to do further damage to a community of people who have been so desperately let down time and again.  To speak about survivors as one group, a singular entity, and to suggest that all of them have had the same experiences and currently have the same needs and desires is yet again to ignore them, demean them and refuse to acknowledge their precise individuality.  During my years holding clinics in Galway East I have met so many survivors from mother and baby homes and county homes across the constituency.  No two of them have had the same experience and no two of them have the same ideas about what redress means to them.  There are as many stories as survivors.  We have an obligation as a Government to listen and to meet their needs.  We are going to do so in the following ways.  The most common thread we have heard is that people want to share their stories, to tell the horror and trauma of their past and to be believed.  That is the reason the commission was set up in 2015 and its report has now been published online without editing or redaction.<\/p>  <p>  I spent the past week listening to the responses of survivors and their families and I have no doubt that it must have been a gruelling, exhausting and traumatising week for them all.  While many were happy to be moving into the next phase of addressing the past, many others were upset at the tone and language used in the report.  We have heard in the Chamber today that it was awful that some of the witnesses felt that their stories were misrepresented or that the lack of evidence reported made them feel they were not believed or that they were lying.  I assure them that nobody thinks they were lying.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to highlight some of the stories.  One woman's son was three and a half years of age when a nun said to her, \"It's happening.\"  She did not have time to say goodbye but she had enough time to run up to the top of the stairs to see her son as he was being driven away.  It broke her heart that he was parted from her.  Another woman was brought into a shop in town and told to sign a document that was half covered.  What she was actually signing was an adoption and when she returned to the home the baby was gone.  Another witness told the committee that she had told a nun of her plans to go to England with her baby.  The nun responded, \"That doesn't happen here.  You'll do what we tell you and that's it.  You're not keeping that baby.  You're going nowhere with that baby.  You're going home and the baby is going somewhere else.\"  An 18-year-old had to hand over her baby like a parcel while her father forced her to sign her name on adoption papers.  One woman said she was told to shut her mouth and sign.  In the case of another woman, when her child was three weeks old, a nun walked into the nursery and snatched her baby from her.  This is the language used to describe these adoptions: \"snatched\", \"ordered to give away\", \"made to hand over\", \"gave me no choice\", \"without consent\".  There is no doubt that these are simply replacement words for being forced.  We believe their stories.<\/p>  <p>  The language used by the commission is officious and technical.  The evidence, perhaps, that the commission means is the documentation that the nuns and organisations should have kept to assist people in tracing their lineage and their families.  If we take evidence as meaning documentation and physical evidence, it is a hard thing for us to get our heads around.  It is possible for two conflicting things to be true at the same time.  It is possible for someone to have been forced to give up their baby for adoption and it is possible that there would be no evidence of that.  It is possible for someone to have been abused and for there to be no evidence of that.  Unfortunately, the people who committed those acts must have known what they were doing was wrong.<\/p> <p>When people commit wrongdoing, they very rarely keep robust documentation and records of their actions.  We believe these women and we want to help them.<\/p> <p> One of the areas not discussed in the public arena to date, and again today, is the matter of those people with disabilities and how they were treated in mother and baby homes.  Much can be learned by the chapter title under which this matter is dealt, Chapter 31: Discrimination.  It highlights the extent of the limited knowledge of the professionals at the time, as well as the wider struggle of State and society with how to support those with disabilities.  The language used at the time is hard to read, with women or children with disabilities often referred to as \"slow\", \"backward\" or \"mentally deficient\".  These people were truly \"othered\".  The commission notes that regardless of one's place of birth, incidence of discrimination for those with a disability was significant.  The commission adds that it heard no representation by or on behalf of people with disabilities, who it states were probably the mostly badly affected by being in an institution.<\/p> <p> To all who passed through these mother and baby homes I must say this evening that the unrelenting darkness through which they have lived, the shadow cast over them, the lack of information and the lack of acknowledgement is something we want to end.  I am conscious that it is disappointing that the report does not answer all the deeply personal questions about burial arrangements for many of the children who died in these institution and in many cases the burial locations remain unknown.  It is my deep regret that we cannot provide all the information needed.<\/p> <p> The commission finds that many adopted people think there is considerably more information about them in institutional and other records than is the case.  Having examined the records closely, the commission states that the information is very limited in most cases.  There are no burial records for a number of large institutions, where significant numbers of infants were known to have died, including at Tuam, Bessborough, Castlepollard and Sean Ross Abbey.  It breaks my heart that this information is not there and it is another failing on the part of the institutions to do the right thing and document the decisions made to allow people to know who they are and who were their mothers and siblings.<\/p> <p> We are aware that this does not come close to healing the pain of those involved but the Government is committed to creating a dignified remembrance and memorialisation where there is currently nothing in place.  As a Government, we are fully committed to legislating for people's rights to access information that is there.<\/p> <p> A person's right to identity is an important human right.  Medical information and adoption records compiled at the time of adoption should be made available, and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is working intensively with the Attorney General on the development of information and tracing legislation to support a person's right to access birth and early life information.  The Government has agreed to make this a priority.  The Minister is also working with the Department to establish a restorative recognition scheme for survivors, which will involve suggestions from survivors that will make a real and measurable difference.<\/p> <p> It would be remiss of me not address the matter of Galway County Council.  Next week Galway County Council has its monthly plenary meeting and I am horrified to think No. 8 on its agenda happens to be statements on mother and baby homes.  The whole county council meeting should be given over to apologising to those who were in that mother and baby home.  We have heard Deputy Connolly's contribution and both of us are from Galway and we understand much of what went on in the mother and baby homes because we have spoken with the affected people.  I was very disappointed to learn about this last night and I appeal to Galway County Council to amend what it has set out.  I also know my colleague in the Seanad, Senator O'Reilly, has raised the matter as well and Galway County Council should follow the Government's lead in apologising if it wants to bring about change and give a good example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012000065#NNN01000","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1611170400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 7.25 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Thursday, 21 January 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
