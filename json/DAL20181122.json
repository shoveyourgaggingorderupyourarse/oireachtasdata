An open recruitment campaign was undertaken in September and attracted more than 3,000 applications.

Therefore, the commitment we have regarding the 600 staff will have to be fulfilled.  We have made progress on it, even since the last time the Deputy questioned me.

Specifically in respect of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to which Deputy Doherty refers, there is a commitment to \"work with the Central Bank to amend the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to include an obligation on providers of mortgage credit to provide a range of sustainable arrears solutions\".  As Deputy Doherty will be aware, in March this year I requested the Central Bank of Ireland to carry out a review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, otherwise known as the CCMA, to ensure it remains as effective as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I published a very detailed and comprehensive report last week.  In carrying out the review, the Central Bank sought the views of consumer representatives and advocates who are working to assist borrowers in financial difficulty.  They engaged with statutory bodies and industry stakeholders.  The bank conducted inspections of one retail credit firm, two credit servicing firms that represented 79% of principal dwelling home loans serviced by credit servicing firms, and one bank.  Finally, the Central Bank gathered and analysed data relating to arrangements being considered and being put in place by banks and other entities.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy can see, the report was specifically examining the treatment of mortgage loans by banks and non-banks to which the Deputy refers.  No evidence was found that borrowers whose circumstances have not changed are being moved off existing arrangements by credit servicing firms who act on behalf of so-called unregulated loan owners during the term of the arrangement.  Furthermore, there is evidence that such entities are considering more arrangements within their suite of arrangements under the CCMA compared with banks and retail credit firms but the report does observe that banks and retail credit firms are putting in place a more diverse range of such arrangements.   It is important to note that retail credit firms and unregulated loan owners account for a significantly higher proportion of accounts in arrears in the 720 days past due category, so this could account for differences in the range of arrangements that unregulated loan owners are putting in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200004#B00600","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1542883200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The whole point of the commitment given was that the code of conduct had to be changed because of the new environment where vulture funds owned loan books including family home loans.

There have been tens of thousands of mortgage cases over recent years and not one firm has been sanctioned.  Perhaps the Minister believes that is evidence that the code works.  My take on it is that it is evidence that the code is not robust enough and is not fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  It is two and a half years since the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, stood exactly where the Minister stands today and told me: \"I am willing to review it again to make it mandatory on lenders to provide the more effective of the range of options that are now in the system to their borrowers.\"  He went on to say: \"I can confirm that in conversations around the time of the negotiation of the programme for Government there was an agreement that we would continue to have the code of conduct on a statutory basis and that it would be extended to cover certain options that borrowers are not statutorily bound to offer.\"  That is a Fine Gael promise to make it compulsory for vultures to offer split mortgages and mortgage-to-rent that has been abandoned.  That is wrong because people are very concerned that the suite of options available is not being implemented.  We still see today the thousands of people in mortgage arrears.  In my home county there are 1,200 people in arrears for a quite a long time, yet these vultures do not offer split mortgages or mortgage to rent.  That was promised and has been abandoned.

I understand the anxiety and the concerns that people have when dealing with their mortgages on their homes.  It is important to state the figures on how this issue has been dealt with in Ireland to date.  At the end of 2012, the number of mortgages and loan accounts in arrears was 143,851.  At the end of June of this year, it was 66,479.  The number of mortgages in arrears has halved from 18% to 9%, from just under 38,000 to just over 21,000.  It has come down by a third.  Every repossession is one that I wish was not happening.  That is why we have a code of conduct for mortgage arrears.  In 2015, the figure for repossession stood at 113, and then it went to 166.  In 2017, it was 77, and for the first half of this year it stood at 18.  They are the figures for non-bank entities.

Of course they have to fulfil the terms of the agreement made on any loan that is sold to the vultures, but they do not offer that as a rule.  They do not offer that to people who are in trouble.  As we see more and more loans being sold while the Minister sits on his hands and allows State banks to sell their loans to the vultures, we will see more legal routes taken.  That is without doubt.<\/p>  <p>  AIB has announced that it will sell another &euro;1 billion worth of loans which will end up in the hands of vultures.  The Minister should do the right thing.  He should not sit idly by.  He should say very clearly that the State-owned banks should not be selling loans to vultures but that they should be doing the heavy lifting themselves, working through these loans on a loan-by-loan, case-by-case, basis, offering split mortgages and mortgage-to-rent and the full suite of solutions that the banks do not offer on what is allowed under the Central Bank's rules.<\/p>  <p>  This is a commitment and much was said about this at the time of the negotiations for the partnership Government, which the Minister has completely abandoned.

I would like to reiterate briefly the key points I have shared with the Deputy.  A significant change I am making this year relates to the potential for inflated claims.  I am legislating to change the way companies claim the tax credit to provide that they will have to apply for payment of the tax credit under the self-assessment system.  This will bring the operation of the credit within the normal penalty and prosecution provisions for incorrect claims.  I am introducing a further amendment to the film tax credit as an important first step in addressing concerns that have been raised with regard to training.  The splitting of the certification process between Revenue and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and the requirement for the production company to apply to that Department before the commencement of the main production, will allow for earlier engagement on the training requirements associated with the credit.

He said:<\/p><blockquote>People are terrified of rocking the boat in any way, shape or form when they are in a precarious situation in work.  One of the questions on the survey asked whether respondents had ever experienced or observed any form of bullying or harassment.  Something in the region of 65% to 70% of people said yes.  The next questions asked if they reported it.  Of that 70% of respondents who had said yes, roughly 70% said that they did not report it for fear of not getting the next job.<\/blockquote><p>He went on to attribute this low level of reporting to the &quot;precarious&quot; nature of the industry.

BDO requested some additional information from this family relating to their mortgage account.  This concerned the family because the request indicated that BDO either had not read the mortgage account file or did not have a copy of it.  Two weeks ago, the couple posed the question of whether BDO was capable of adjudicating on the appeal fairly and stated they had lost faith in the appeals process.  The appeals board finally came back to them and confirmed that, as an independent secretariat, it only has access to the mortgage account details provided to it.  In the case of Ulster Bank, this means BDO only has the compensation letter.  It does not have the mortgage file or any other documentation.  This raises serious questions about the whole point of the independent appeals process within Ulster Bank and possibly other banks.

The three boys went off to America to find someone to put up the money and found a company called Clairvue.  They then set up a shelf company in Luxembourg called Clairvue Nantes and installed another director of Avestus, Mark Donnelly, as a director of the Luxembourg company.  He had been a director of Avestus since 2010 and became a director of Clairvue in 2012.  The company bought Project Nantes for &euro;26.6 million, with a discount bringing the price to under 10% of the original value.  This sale is in breach of the NAMA Act for multiple reasons.

However, the revelations dating from last January of complaints of sexual assault made by a woman in 2009, when she was 18 years old, have opened up a new insidious and grotesque litany of sexual abuse cases over many decades in the scouting movement.  The abuse occurred mostly when children were on trips.  Scouting Ireland's handling of the initial allegation was, in the words of Mr. Ian Elliott, one of the experts in this area, deeply flawed.  The initial allegation has been followed by a full review of historical cases which found that there were 71 alleged abusers and 108 victims between the 1960s and 1980s alone and that there were also incidents in more recent times.  We must remember not to focus on the numbers but rather on the fact that each one represents a person or a family who has been affected.  Mr. Elliott confirmed all of this to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs yesterday.  He also said the work was incomplete and that the numbers were likely to rise.  Everyone in this House agrees that this is reprehensible and the sooner we can get the full facts the better.  One in Four, a group with expertise in this area, has described the figures as astonishing.  <\/p>  <p>  A huge number of people are affected.  They were much younger when they suffered the abuse and may not have come forward with their story and are holding on to what happened to them.  They have held on to it for many years.  Mr. Elliot outlined how 14 of the alleged perpetrators had multiple victims.  He discovered that there was one serious perpetrator, of whom Scouting Ireland had no knowledge and on whom there was no file.  There have been many enforced changes to Scouting Ireland since the initial inquiry.  We hope the initial Government arrangements are robust enough to ensure any further allegation of abuse will be reported under the current legislation and that those who make reports under it will be given the support they need.  Families and the children involved want this to happen to allow them to have security and their voices to be heard in this debate.  It will also help them to come forward.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the seriousness of this issue, is the Minister satisfied with the process involved, how the allegations were examined and that known victims have access to full counselling services and any other support they require?  What processes is the Government putting in place to allow people to come forward who might not otherwise come forward and are they being allowed to do so on a confidential basis?  Has the Minister, Deputy Zappone, met him to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be involved at every level to assist and support victims?

As my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, said, Scouting Ireland informed her office late on Tuesday that, as part of a review being carried out by Mr. Ian Elliott, evidence had been found of 71 alleged abusers and 108 alleged victims to date.  Scouting Ireland has advised that most of the cases relate to the period between the 1960s and the 1980s.  It has advised that some of the alleged victims and abusers became known to it separate from the examination of historical files.  Several victims have come forward recently, as the Deputy acknowledged.  The Minister has further been advised that none of the alleged abusers is still working with Scouting Ireland.  It has been confirmed that reports have been made to Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other police forces in jurisdictions in which many of the alleged abusers are in residence.  I acknowledge that in recent times the Minister reinstated funding for Scouting Ireland for a period of six months, until April next year.  Like her, other Ministers and I are extremely concerned about the very high number of alleged cases of abuse.  In that regard, the Minister is seeking additional information from Scouting Ireland.  Funding has been restored on an interim basis only and the matter remains under examination.  <\/p>  <p>  Every support will be made available to the victims to ensure they can and will come forward and that they will be assisted in that pursuit.

Everyone here knows parents and families who are struggling to access care for their children.  We have all heard from staff acting on the front line who find that drastically inadequate staffing levels make it impossible to meet the demand for the care they want to provide.  Figures provided by the HSE for my colleague, Teachta Louise O'Reilly, show that midway through the year the waiting list for CAMHS stood at more than 2,700 children and young adults.  That is not the waiting list for treatment but for the very first step of initial assessment.  Many young people have been waiting a year or more to be assessed.  These are the young lives that are in limbo.  There are families who are at their wit's end.  The State is failing children.<\/p>  <p>  In some parts of the State the waiting lists are absolutely shocking.  In the area covered by community healthcare organisation, CHO, 1 which includes my constituency of Donegal there was a waiting list of 203 children at the end of last year.  In the area covered  by CHO 4 which includes counties Cork and Kerry there was a waiting list of 737 children for an initial assessment for mental health services.  It is an absolute scandal.  We cannot continue to allow these lists to grow and grow putting more children at risk.  That is what it all boils down to.  Children are at risk because the State is failing to make sure the care for which they are reaching can be provided.<\/p>  <p>  CAMHS simply is not meeting the needs of young people who are often in desperate need of immediate care.  It is primarily the result of a failure to recruit the staff needed to fully operate CAMHS teams.  For some time about half the positions in CAMHS teams have been vacant across the State, yet when my party leader, Deputy McDonald, raised the issue of the recruitment and retention of nurses, including psychiatric nurses, the Taoiseach simply dismissed our concerns.  An immediate response is needed, particularly in areas where the problem is at its worst.  Earlier this year the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care outlined a raft of measures to improve the recruitment and retention of vital staff.  By filling vacancies quickly and improving conditions we can improve services, attract more staff and keep the excellent staff we already have.  Let me state that when CAMHS is able to assess and care for young people, the service does an excellent job, with very good results.  However, we cannot allow a situation to persist where if a child or a young person needs care, he or she faces an extended period of waiting that will put him or her and his or her mental health at serious risk.  We need to see dedicated action to attract new staff and keep the excellent staff we already have.  Promises were made by the Government last year that the disastrous staffing levels in CAMHS would be addressed, but they have not been.  Will the Government recommit to doing so and ensure it will actually happen this time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200013#L00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1542888600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The answer to the Deputy's question is \"Yes\".  We will ensure every effort is made to deal with the issue, which I acknowledge is a challenge.  I acknowledge the importance of the issues raised by the Deputy.  Improving all aspects of CAMHS nationally is a priority for the Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, in particular.  An additional &euro;84 million will be provided for mental health services in 2019, which will bring the total available for mental health services to &euro;1 billion, which represents an increase of 9%.  That, however, is not the whole issue.  I acknowledge what the Deputy has said about staffing and the recruitment challenges.  I also acknowledge that there is a difficulty not only in recruitment but also in retention.  That applies across the health system but particularly in the mental health service.  Every effort is being made by the HSE to address the issue.  <\/p>  <p>  I note that primary care capacity has been further developed recently through the funding of a further 114 assistant psychologists and 20 senior psychologists.  This will help to manage the demand for psychiatric services, but I acknowledge that it is more than just that.  There is also an issue in meeting the demand for psychiatric and psychological services.  The HSE and other agencies are working closely with appropriate recruitment agencies, not only in this jurisdiction but also on the international stage, to find suitable and appropriate consultant psychiatrists to deal with this issue.  One the one hand, we have increased the resources and, on the other, it is important that every effort be made to attract a proper and adequate coterie of individuals to deal with what is a very serious problem across society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200013#L00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1542888600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I have listened to what the Minister has said.  I could go into detail, distilling the figures and examining how much was spent on agencies and how much was pre-committed in 2017.  However, the reality is that parents listening to this interaction will not take any comfort from what the Minister has said.  I know some of them personally, as I am sure the Minister does, too.  They tell me that they phone the service on a weekly and sometimes daily basis, that they are in tears, pleading, demanding, asking and begging for their child to gain access to a service in order that he or she can have a diagnosis and receive wraparound supports he or she needs.  They are telling healthcare professionals that they are worried about their child's mental health.  They are worried because their child who is sometimes as young as eight, nine or ten years old is self-harming or could take more drastic action.  We have heard these commitments given by the Government before.  Last year the waiting lists grew longer.  The number of children waiting to be seen has grown and the time they have to wait has lengthened.  There is a failure in government.  This is a microcosm of how the Government is failing to plan to fulfil the health needs of our society.  Every single party represented in this House supports full implementation of A Vision for Change.  It is included in the programme for Government.  When will we be able to come into the House and say this objective will be realised?  When will we be able say to the 2,700 children waiting and their parents that their mental health needs will be met by the State?  This is not cherishing the children of the nation.

On 16 November, staff who were seconded to Irish Water from local authorities received a letter from Irish Water management stating that the service level agreement under which they work, which is due to expire in 2025, will be renegotiated and all negotiations concluded by the end of February 2019.  This is the result of a report commissioned by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in May 2018 when he asked the Workplace Relations Commission to review the service level agreement, consult all sides and produce a report on the matter.  The report was submitted to the Minister in September.  All of the bodies that contributed to the report, namely, the Local Government Management Agency, the relevant trade union, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Irish Water utility, acknowledged that the arrangement of seconding to Irish Water workers who had spent their working lives employed in local authority water services has been brilliant.  The experience, skills and depth of knowledge they brought to Irish Water was found to be indispensable and very much welcomed by the utility.  When one reads the report, one finds that all the relevant bodies share this view.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is rushing to change the service level agreement, which is supposed to last until 2025.  He wants to change it in 2021 and wants the negotiations on same ended by February 2019, which is three months away.  I have noted the co-ordination in this campaign.  The report was published in September and shortly afterwards, a report is published setting out excess charges that will be implemented in 2020 and how much income they will generate.  Shortly after that, the Environmental Protection Agency produced a report showing that local private water utilities are poisoning people because they are not delivering a proper service.  We the get reports that the Government proposes to undermine a Bill introduced by Deputy Joan Collins and supported by many parties providing for a referendum to prohibit the privatisation of Irish Water.  It will do so by amending the Bill to allow for an element of privatisation known as public private partnership, PPP.  What will happen to the jobs of Irish Water workers who do not want to transfer to a utility that may privatise water in the future?  Will the Government get over itself and, once and for all, tell people that water will remain in public hands and will never be privatised?  It must make that clear because the messages are extremely confusing and extraordinarily worrying for communities and, in particular, the workers in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200014#M00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1542889200,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith for her strong support of Irish Water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200014#M00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1542889200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>That is not what the Deputy said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200014#M00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1542889200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>It is the first time that I have heard it and I welcome it.

At the heart of the problem is the time it takes to get approval for nursing home support under the fair deal scheme and the growing numbers of people waiting for approval for home help under the home support service.<\/p><p>The knock-on effect of this is that people on the waiting list for operations and other procedures cannot get into hospitals because there are no beds available for them.  In many cases, it has taken several weeks for applications for the fair deal scheme to be approved.  There are people occupying hospital beds who have recovered sufficiently to be discharged but who cannot manage on their own at home.  Pending approval of their application, they are expected to pay &euro;900 or more per week to stay in a nursing home, money that they often simply do not have, so they must be kept in hospital until approval comes through.  It is not where they want to be.  It is widely accepted that people need to get out of hospital as early as possible to avoid the risk of infection.  There are many others who could go home if they had sufficient support in the form of home care services but, unfortunately, there are long waiting lists for home help in many areas.  The most recent figure concerning the number of people awaiting approval for home help is more than 6,200.  My home county of Galway has the worst record in the country with more than 670 people waiting for home help.<\/p> <p> Thankfully, our population is living longer but that also means that the demand for home help services and nursing home care will continue to grow.  Unless sufficient resources are allocated to meeting this demand, the problem of hospital beds not being freed up will also continue to grow.  This in turn will lead to growing numbers of people on waiting lists for treatment waiting for beds to become available and growing numbers spending nights on trolleys in our emergency departments because they also cannot be moved to a bed in the hospital.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that some progress has been made this year regarding the number of people on waiting lists for inpatient or day case treatment.  However, more than 72,000 people were on waiting lists for inpatient and day care treatment at the beginning of this month, almost 12,000 of which had been waiting a year or more.  Galway University Hospital has the highest number of any hospital at almost 9,400.  The same limited progress is not evident in respect of outpatient waiting list, which currently stands at more than 516,000 people.  The total went over the half million mark for the first time at the end of last year and has remained above that extraordinary level every month of this year.  Again, Galway has the highest number of people awaiting outpatient treatment at just under 40,000.<\/p> <p> What further measures does the Government propose to take to ensure that people are released from hospital more quickly into the proper care they need and to ease the worry, stress and even physical risk to vulnerable members of our society?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200014#M01200","speaker":"1313","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542889800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Grealish not just for his question but also his expressed acknowledgement that progress is being made on this matter.  I assure the Deputy and the House that the Government will continue to make progress on what is a particular challenge.  It is a challenge that faces us as we come into the winter season.  I assure the House and Deputy Grealish that the primary focus of Government is on reducing delayed patient discharges.  We can do this through the mobilisation of additional resources.  As the Deputy acknowledged, the aim is to ensure that social care measures are effectively deployed, which will have the effect of enabling older people to leave hospital and return to a more appropriate care setting, including primarily their own home, as quickly as possible.  If they are returning to their home, they will need adequate supports.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the House that as part of its preparation for winter, the HSE has been requested by the Minister for Health to focus efforts on initiatives to enable hospital settings to de-escalate before the Christmas period, including supports of a social care nature.  The HSE has commenced a range of measures to support older people's transition from acute care before Christmas into the new year.  These measures were welcomed yesterday by the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Jim Daly.  This includes an allocation of 550 additional home care packages over the winter period.  This is one of a number of initiatives that include additional transitional care beds and &euro;4 million for aids and appliances that will assist older people to come home from hospital before Christmas and remain in their homes over the new year or for longer periods.<\/p>  <p>  The importance of transitional care must not be understated.  If it is appropriate, it is arranged through utilising the patient and family choice of provider.  The use of transitional care has proven to very valuable in the hospital system.  It has benefited and continues to benefit the transfer of large numbers of patients to more appropriate settings.  Information of a preliminary nature, which I am happy to share with Deputy Grealish and others, will show that there have been more than 9,800 approvals for funding to date this year of which 830 were in Galway University Hospital.  I assure the Deputy that the Department of Health expects the details of the winter plan to be finalised over the coming days.  It will be published later this month and I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, along with the Minister, will continue to keep the House and Deputy Grealish fully informed of developments in this challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200015#N00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1542889800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I am aware that there are many and often complex reasons for thousands of patients occupying hospital beds for longer than is ideal every year.  I am familiar with many of these cases.  The fact remains that the delays in approving fair deal applications for nursing home care and delays in funding for home care packages create some of these hold-ups.  As I mentioned earlier, a hospital is the last place one would want older family members to be in if it is not necessary.  International research has shown that every extra day in hospital increases the risk of acquiring an infection, having an adverse drug reaction or developing problems like bed sores.  New Irish research published in the British Medical Journal found that older people were 72% more likely to be given prescriptions that were not appropriate for them.<\/p>  <p>  I call on the Government to speed up the application process for the fair deal scheme.  This would free up hospital beds and get people out of hospitals.  There is a significant delay in approving home care packages.  I welcome the announcement made by the Minister, but bringing a loved one home when there is no care at home for them is a significant worry for families.

I am very keen to ensure it is delivered in the right place and within an appropriate period of time.  Older people wish to be supported in their homes and in their communities.  The additional investment in social and community care measures will support this objective in the winter ahead.  The net budget for the nursing homes support is in excess of &euro;960 million.  The scheme supports approximately 23,300 people in respect of long-term residential care.  The waiting time for funding approval is three to four weeks, but I assure Deputy Grealish that the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Jim Daly, is focusing this winter on the issue of delayed discharges and social care measures, including the investment in home support, which will assist people in returning home to their communities as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200015#N00400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Gn\u00f3 na D\u00e1la - Business of D\u00e1il","time":1542889800,"counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200015#N00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1542889800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Before moving to Questions on Promised Legislation, the Government Chief Whip has a business proposal to make arising from the agreement of the Business Committee this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200015#N00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1542889800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in the Order of Business of 20 November 2018 or in Standing Orders, that the order of today&rsquo;s business, following the sos, shall be as follows: Finance Bill 2018 - Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage; Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2018 - Order for Report, Report and Final Stages; Social Housing Bill 2016 - Second Stage; and the Topical Issue debate.

However, many clients are still waiting and being left without payments as a result of simple errors being made by the Department.  One such applicant, who has had his payments delayed for three or four weeks, was assured by the Minister's office via my office last Monday that his payment would be issued in two to three working days.  His payment was not received this morning and when we inquired about the matter we were told someone had not pressed a button.  This is outrageous.  This morning, we learn that the Taoiseach has spent &euro;1.74 million on communications and spin in the past 17 months, whereas the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, spent only &euro;116,000 on spin in 15 months.  It is all about spin and image.  What about the people who cannot get their payments?  It is a disgraceful reflection on the Department's performance that someone did not press a button.  That is little good to a family that cannot put food on the table, while the Taoiseach spends &euro;1.74 million on his image and spin.

I appreciate the House affording me the opportunity to do so.  The purpose of the Bill is to prevent any further awarding of contracts of public transport passenger services for a period of five years.  A total of 10% of Dublin Bus and 10% of Bus &Eacute;ireann contracts were awarded without tender under direct award contracts, with Go-Ahead winning the full 10% of Dublin Bus routes and some of the Bus &Eacute;ireann contracts.  The need for this legislation was further highlighted to me when I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, about his powers in respect of licensing and he confirmed that he had no role in this licensing and, furthermore, had no intention of having any role in it.  The powers were left to the National Transport Authority, and the Minister views this as appropriate.<\/p><p>The original decision to put 10% of routes out to tender was taken to provide a comparative basis on which we might ensure not only that we are getting value for money for taxpayers, but also and of equal importance that we are getting an effective, efficient service for the passengers who use our public transport.  A recent decision by the NTA to announce its intention to increase by a further 10% direct award contracts is premature, to say the least.  We have not been able to assess the service being operated by Go-Ahead, so its performance has not been measured.  The reason for this is that in some instances the direct award contract has yet to commence.  As such, the NTA's intention to tender out further routes is premature.<\/p><p>The routes being considered for tender include one which has recorded growth of 14% since 2017 and another which has recorded growth of 50% since 2016.  Bus &Eacute;ireann showed its capabilities in respect of efficiency, public service, value for money and customer service when it recently won a tender for Waterford routes.  It won it against other competitive tenders both domestic and international.  This tender process, as I said, was initiated by the NTA.  This is evidence that Bus &Eacute;ireann can operate and compete successfully and offer value for money and a quality customer service.  At this stage, without knowing the value of the 10% of services that were originally put out to tender or how they are operating, it would be premature to tender out any further routes.<\/p><p>I hope the D&aacute;il will support this legislation to prevent further tendering of these routes for, at least, a minimum of five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200017#P02700","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542891600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200018#Q00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1542891600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200018#Q00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1542891600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1542891600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>As this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200018#Q00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1542891600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200018#Q00600","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1542891600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2018: Referral to Joint Committee","time":1542891600,"counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200018#Q00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1542891600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Regulations in draft:Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2018,copies of which were laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 20th November, 2018, be referred to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in accordance with Standing Order 84A(4)(<i>k<\/i>), which, not later than 29th November, 2018, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 90, and Standing Order 89(2) shall accordingly apply.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200018#Q00900","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1542891600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Shared Maternity Leave and Benefit Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1542891600,"counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200018#Q01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1542891600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division on Second Stage of the Shared Maternity Leave and Benefit Bill 2018 which was taken on Thursday, 15 November.

It is one I raised for a number of years with the Minister's predecessors.  It concerns the need for bookies, those placing bets and the industry as a whole to pay more tax.  That there is a need for a larger contribution is accepted across the industry.  Currently, the rate is 1% rate.  A 2% rate is proposed in the Bill.  During the years I have examined the accounts of many independent retailers.  The increase would have a dramatic and, possibly, drastic effect in that it could move them from profitability to loss making and, therefore, lead to the closure of some independent retailers, with the associated loss of jobs which are mostly in rural Ireland.  That would only be to the advantage of some of the larger operators and possibly move more people to bet online.  For a long time we have been arguing for a 3% rate to be placed on the punter, not the industry which would face a challenge in absorbing the increase, given its profitability.  The Minister has not agreed to that proposal.  We debated the issue on Committee Stage, which is why we, in Sinn F&eacute;in, have tabled an amendment to delete the lines that increase betting duty.  I am doing so reluctantly, as I believe the industry should pay more tax, but at this stage in our discussions on the Finance Bill, it is clear that there is no other option but to seek to delete the lines.  Otherwise, the Bill will have a drastic effect.<\/p><p>I am conscious of the damage a gambling addiction can inflict in our society and have long argued for an increase in betting duty, but it is being done in a way that will hit the smaller, independent bookies far more.  There is a proposal from the industry on methodology.  I understand that, although there was not universal acceptance of a gross profits model in the past, there is now.  It is similar to the model operated in Britain.  The industry has argued in favour of rates of 10% and 20% on different sectors.  This model is worth considering.  Despite our position on the imposition of a 3% tax on the punter, we are open to considering the proposed model.  I, therefore, urge the Minister not to proceed with the measure proposed in the Bill at this time.  On Committee Stage he acknowledged that every tax increase could have an impact, but this one could have a very clear impact.  Sometimes, it is up to us to weigh the impacts and benefits.  We are also conscious that the costings are just a multiplier of the increase from 1% to 2% without any real extrapolation of the effects on independent retailers.  For that reason, I will oppose this section of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200021#W00700","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1542893100,"counter":224,"content":"<p>We had a good discussion on this issue on Committee Stage.  It is widely acknowledged that the change will have a significant and detrimental impact on independent bookmakers, in particular.  I support Deputy Pearse Doherty's point about the wider context, which is why we have been calling consistently for progress on the Gambling Control Bill 2018 to deal with problem gambling.  The industry needs to play a full part in dealing with such issues because problem gambling can destroy lives.  However, that is not the subject of this discussion.<\/p>  <p>  Whenever the Minister proposes a tax increase, I imagine vested interests, including those directly affected, make arguments to him on its likely impact.  He has to assess whether they are crying wolf or whether what they are saying is borne out by the evidence.  That is a judgment we have to make, too.  We must assess the information and feedback we are getting.  It is my judgment that the change will have serious consequences for the independent bookmaker sector.  Bookmakers have opened their books to many of us and we have examined financial statements.<\/p>  <p>  By its nature, a turnover tax is crude, but that is the model that has been in place for some time.  The sector has proposed a gross profits tax.  From the bookmakers' perspective, the proposal has been fully costed and is supported generally across the industry.  They submit the view that such a tax would be likely to bring in more money than the projected yield from the Minister's change under the Bill, which is in the region of &euro;40 million in 2019 and just over &euro;50 million in a full year.<\/p>  <p>  These claims need to be evaluated thoroughly.  The sector contests many of the claims the Minister has made, including on Committee Stage, about its engagement in the period during which this issue has been discussed.  However, all of that is academic at this point.  We are at the eleventh hour and there is a proposal contained in the Finance Bill.  We have an amendment, No. 21, which seeks the making of an economic impact assessment of the change on the independent bookmaker sector.  Given that the first stream of payments of betting duty in 2019 will be in April, is there any window of opportunity to conduct the assessment while progressing a comprehensive evaluation of the proposal that has been made for a gross profits tax?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200021#W00800","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1542893100,"counter":225,"content":"<p>The entire profits of the retail betting sector are in the region of &euro;35 million per year.  Doubling the tax from 1% to 2% constitutes a 100% increase which will wipe out all of the sector's profits.  In the past ten years there have been 515 closures.  If the 2% rate had remained in place, there would have been more.  Currently, there are approximately 850 betting shops throughout the country.<\/p><p>Bookmakers are only starting to see a slight increase in business.  If this increase goes ahead, it is estimated that it will lead to between 350 and 400 more closures, resulting in job losses of approximately 2,500.  This will cost the Exchequer approximately &euro;35 million, with a further &euro;1 million in commercial rates lost.  If these shops close it will have a serious effect on families and on subcontractors, window cleaners, local newsagents, plumbers, electricians, shopfitters, computer and IT services, printers and so on.  It is estimated that another 900 indirect jobs will be lost.  The total number of jobs lost could reach 3,400.  <\/p> <p> In my town of Dundalk Boyle Sports employs more than 400 people.  It is making profits and paying its taxes.  It makes no sense to tax turnover and makes far more sense to tax profits.  All over the world, bookmakers are taxed on their profits and I do not see why Ireland should be any different.  The Minister cannot ask bookmakers that are not making profits to pay tax.  He must go after the bigger bookmakers that are making bigger profits and get them to pay more tax.  It is important to ensure that small bookmakers survive.  This provision has been described as an anti-gambling measure but if we lose 2,500 direct jobs and another 900 indirect jobs, I do not know what will happen.  Years ago there was a black market in gambling and the last thing we want is to see that returning.  It does not make sense to tax turnover.  We should do what every other country does and tax the profits.  We must think of the jobs that will be lost and the families that will be affected by that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200021#W00900","speaker":"1441","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542893700,"counter":227,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im chun d&iacute;ri&uacute; i dtosach ar leas&uacute; Uimh. 21 maidir leis an tuairisc mar t&aacute; buairt i measc geallghlacad&oacute;ir&iacute; ar fud na t&iacute;re, go h&aacute;irithe na comhlachta&iacute; beaga &aacute;iti&uacute;la.

We must acknowledge the role played by bookmakers in our communities.  They provide much-needed employment.  In the early years, bookmakers were mainly associated with horse racing but they have now expanded into all types of sport and many provide direct sponsorship.  Some of the funds from the increase in the betting tax will go directly into the pocket of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, but if one goes racing these days one will see that the crowds are small except when the bookmakers provide sponsorship.  That is how the tracks attract customers.  I have noticed that at certain festival meetings but also in my own backyard in Cork.  Paddy Power recently sponsored a race and gave out free tickets.  If the HRI got the money for that race meeting, there would not have been any additional people at it.  Sponsorship entices people to go to meetings and is an invaluable resource.  This in turn generates other indirect revenue through spending at the courses on hospitality and so on which also benefits the Exchequer.  We recently got rid of one source of sponsorship for sport by way of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and the sources of funding for such sponsorship are drying up.  This tax will further reduce sponsorship options for communities and sporting organisations, large and small.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to consider, as part of this review, the proposal made on gross profits.

I am fully aware of the negative effect it can have on individuals and on children in particular.  Gambling addiction is a very serious issue and some people find it very hard to cope with gambling.  However, in the context of the proposed tax increase from 1% to 2%, we must ask how we can minimise the damage done to employment in the domestic economy.  This will be a major blow to the many men and women who work in the sector.  There is a genuine fear that hundreds of betting shops, including many in my constituency, will close as a result of this tax increase.  I fully endorse my party colleague's very constructive amendment which calls for a review of the increase in three months' time to assess the damage it has done.<\/p>  <p>  I would like the Minister to make a move on the online betting market, which has exploded in recent years.  It is now possible to pick up a smartphone, download an application, get an upfront allowance and bet away to one's heart's content.  I believe we should be targeting the online market.  There are lots of local bookmakers that do not operate on a big scale and which play an important role in the context of social isolation in rural areas.  Some people go along to the local betting shop in a small town or village and they have a chat, a cup of tea or coffee and have a small flutter on a horse or on the lottery.  There is a degree of social engagement attached to it.

It has been laboured in this Chamber and also at committee.  As I understand it, it has also been laboured at Fine Gael Parliamentary Party meetings.  I am very conscious that what I say here is restricted in the sense that Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies are constrained in what we can do and what amendments we can table under the confidence and supply arrangement.  We cannot ask the Minister to stop and refrain from doing this.  We can, however, ask him to press the pause button and reconsider.  My understanding of the responsibility of Government is to pursue policies that will assist in job creation.  Fine Gael had its annual Ard-Fheis last week at which it claimed it is the party of jobs but what the Minister is doing with this tax increase is far from pursuing a policy that will support job creation.  This policy will cost jobs, not in multinational companies but in small indigenous family bookmakers.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has admitted the Department did not conduct a proper analysis of this proposal.<\/p><p>The Minister has admitted that the only reason he cannot press the pause button and change his mind on this is because he is afraid that it will unwind the whole budgetary process.

The serious gambling issues occur online which the Minister is not addressing.  The areas where there is an element of supervision and control is in the small family-owned bookies where they know their customers, and that is where the Minister is focusing his attention.  It is wrong.  The Minister has the opportunity to be a bigger man and admit he got it wrong on budget day and say he will review it within three months, as my colleague has suggested.  He will see at that stage that it was the wrong decision and he will have the opportunity, within three months, to implement the proposals that have been put forward by the industry and signed up to by the multinationals and, indeed, by the small, family-owned businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200022#X00500","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542894300,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I outlined the rationale as to why I am making this move on Committee Stage.  I thank Deputies Fitzpatrick, O'Keeffe, Aindrias Moynihan, Troy and Butler for the points they have brought in at this point.<\/p>  <p>  There a couple of points I would make.  Every decision that I make, particularly in taxation, has consequences, and I have no doubt at all that if I had followed any of the other suggestions that have been put to me, and Deputy Pearse Doherty outlined a number of them, each of those would also have had consequences that would have been raised in the Chamber.  There is no taxation decision I can make that does not have consequences in some part of our economy.<\/p>  <p>  This betting duty is at 1%.  It is at the lowest level it has been since 2006 and I ask colleagues to reflect as to whether we have any other levies or taxes that have not changed since that point given the kind of change that has happened since, where all parts of our economy and all forms of enterprise were asked to contribute more in response to the significant difficulty that we were in.  Given the situation we are in now and the objective that I understand is shared by all Deputies who have spoken, or at least by their parties, of trying to broaden our tax base and find ways to make tax revenue more sustainable, surely we should be looking at the appropriate level of tax contribution that different businesses can make.  I repeat that this is a levy that is nearly unique, out of all forms of contributions that different areas of our economy have made, in not changing at all for more than 12 years.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies are right.  Some of them have made the point that I have acknowledged that there are consequences for this decision, as I have acknowledged for every other tax change I have stood over.  The challenge I face, which is shared by some of the Deputies but is unique to me, is that I have to try to make decisions on the basis of information that is available to me, conscious that every decision I make can have negative consequences in certain parts of our economy.  I have to try to calibrate that level of consequence.  I stand fully over the decision I have made to date and I am standing over it in this Finance Bill.  We need to be asking different areas of our economy to make contributions to the funding of public services.  All parties here, at this point, have advocated the need for this sector to make more of a contribution, and I assure them that, for any of the different options they would put forward, they would face similar considerations to those I face today.<\/p>  <p>  On the particular issue Deputy Michael McGrath has put to me, I have indicated on Committee Stage that I will keep this measure under review to see what impact it has in the sector across 2019.  The challenge I face in considering the Deputy's amendment is that the deadline he places on it is to lay a report within the first 12 weeks of this measure being implemented.  The specific challenge for that proposal is that the betting liability itself, the duty liability, does not fall to be paid until on or before 15 April.  It is paid after the quarter.  What I am happy to do, as I would do with any measure, is to look at the implementation across next year, especially when we get information from tax about it, and I will engage constructively with the sector on the proposals that are put forward.<\/p>  <p>  When measures such as the proposals that are now being put to me, whether relating to a levy to be paid by the punter, the person pressing the wager, or relating to the gross profits tax, were looked at before, many different voices also had issues about them.  I am happy to look at the implementation of this measure or the effect of this measure, particularly when we have information as we move through next year, but I am not in a position to accept the amendments that have been tabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200023#Y00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1542894300,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I have rehearsed on many occasions that I can remember going into the bookies with my father when the betting duty was 20%.

In effect, the Minister is asking me not to press the amendment, so I have to ask what exactly he is committing to.  We have asked for a report on the economic impact assessment of this measure.  The context is clear.  The trend is accelerating.  The move to online gambling is very evident for all of us to see, and the concern is that we will quickly see closures, people will be put on protective notice, and there will be redundancies.  We are all aware of the level of costs that the retail bookmakers, with a physical store, have to carry, so they are at a significant disadvantage.  An alternative proposal has been put forward by them.  I fully accept that has to be examined and probed rigorously by the Department and Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister makes the point that the first returns under the betting duty are in April 2019.  I acknowledge that, but my overarching concern is that it will be too late and we need to know if this alternative proposal that has been made stands up.  We need to know if it will deliver a yield equal to or greater than the yield the Minister has projected from the increase in betting duty, which the industry would strongly assert will not be delivered because of the impact on jobs and so forth.<\/p><p>I hope the Ceann Comhairle will allow the Minister in briefly - I am sure we will make progress very quickly after this - because I need to ask what exactly the Minister is committing to.

It will hit small independent bookmakers in provincial towns in particular and will make them unviable.  The Minister should consider initiating a review of this measure.  He and his officials should engage directly with the parties concerned to come up with an alternative that would raise the same amount of money that the Minister wishes to raise through this measure.  There is no doubt that the industry has done well over the years and that an increase in betting tax is merited to get more revenue from the industry, but it should be done in a different way.  This alternative proposal should be robustly considered and, if it is found that it raises the amount of money the Minister has outlined, it should be taken on board.  The only way to do that is to have a review, a report and engagement with the industry.

Deputy Michael McGrath asked me what I have said I will do.  First, I will evaluate the proposal that has been put to my Department in respect of a gross profit tax model.

That support was not there.  We would not be in the situation of trying to figure out how to broaden our tax base if we were not debating the levy now being introduced in the absence of agreement on how else this could be done.  That is the reality of where we stand.  Engagement happened and efforts were made.  There was engagement on a betting charge which would only be paid by the punter.  Let us be clear, a 3% change in that area would also have an effect on jobs and employment.  That would be raised with the sector.  Deputy Doherty has put forward that proposal in the past.  That change would also have an effect on employment.  We will evaluate this proposal.  I am happy to report back to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the proposal in the early part of next year as we evaluate it.<\/p>  <p>  On the second point, as I have reiterated, there was not unanimous support in the industry in respect of how any other option put forward could be implemented.

I will deal initially with the issues in the car rental sector.  During the Committee Stage debate the Minister made an estimate of the impact of the measure as being between &euro;1.50 and &euro;2 per vehicle per day.  That estimate has been examined.  The estimate presumes a pass-through spread across 12 months.  The nature of the car rental market and the movement of the fleet mean that typically the measure should be spread across a period of three to five months.<\/p> <p> The estimates I have seen, which were prepared by professionals, put the impact at a figure of between &euro;5 and &euro;8 per day for an average vehicle.  For a typical tourist or customer who rents a car for seven days the impact is estimated to be between &euro;36 and &euro;55, which is not insignificant.  North American tourists typically rent automatic vehicles or larger people carriers.  The impact will be far greater, perhaps between &euro;14 and &euro;23 per day.  The impact on the end consumer of this measure will be considerably greater than the estimate made by the Minister, which was based on certain assumptions.<\/p> <p> At a time when VAT is going up in the tourism and hospitality sectors, this is further blow in cost competitiveness and to the offering we make.  The nature of the car rental market has changed dramatically in the past 40 years.  It is rather seasonal but we now have five large operators within the market.  This is an extra significant cost.<\/p> <p> The car leasing aspect got less attention on Committee Stage.  The issue is that the change to VAT will impact on car leasing but will not impact on the other form of competition within that area, including hire purchase or people acquiring vehicles through loans.  The potential is that this would have a significant impact on corporate and small and medium-sized car leasing businesses by resulting in rather hefty increase of perhaps &euro;700 for an average vehicle in the sector.  The issue did not get a great deal of attention on Committee Stage but the impact is not insignificant.<\/p> <p> Again, I have looked at the background to this, which dates back to 1992.  The Minister has presented this as being a concession, a tax expenditure.  There is a strong argument that it was in fact a tax equalisation measure at the time, one not intended to be temporary in nature.  I call on the Minister to re-examine the matter and consider the amendment we have brought forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200025#AA00400","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542895500,"counter":251,"content":"<p>We are well aware that this was a temporary measure that has lasted in our tax code for a period of 25 years.  Anyone from the industry would be forgiven for thinking that it was always renewed, always in place and permanent.<\/p>  <p>  One of the main issues I see is the sudden shock to the industry and the way the industry operates.  I was rather impressed to see the size and scale of the sector and the number of cars leased when we were provided with documentation on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Several important factors are relevant.  There was no consultation whatsoever with the industry.  There was no economic impact study carried out before the change took place.  Arguments have been put forward to the effect that there is a lack of understanding of the consequences that this could have given the sudden introduction of the measure.  It is important that there should be consultation, that this should be delayed, and that we look at the impact of it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath referred to the range of time in which this cost could be absorbed.  The details have been presented to me as well.  Reference was made to a period of three to four months.  Arguments have been put forward by the Minister that mitigation is provided by section 39, but that does not really apply in the case of Ireland given that we have right-hand steering wheel vehicles.  Only two other European jurisdictions have the same type of vehicles and one of them is about to leave the European Union.  Thus the question of mitigation does not really arise.  I would encourage the Minister to rethink the timing of the proposal to carry out consultation with the industry.  I am not suggesting the Minister must accept the view of those in the industry, but it is important to consult and look at the economic impact.  Like many other Deputies I have been written to and contacted on this issue, including from representatives of the airport in Carrickfinn, which is an important economic enabler in our area.  They have outlined the potential harm this could cause given the abruptness, short notice, how this is being brought in and how it impacts on plans already afoot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200026#BB00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1542895500,"counter":252,"content":"<p>On Committee Stage I covered the rationale and why I am making the change.  The question I am posing to Deputies McGrath and Doherty is a simple one.  Do we think this is worth &euro;20 million per year of taxpayers' resources?  To my mind, the answer to that question is no.<\/p>  <p>  This measure has been in place since 1993.  It has been there so long that it appears many were not even aware of its existence.  We have to get to a point of asking ourselves about this.  If we go to the effort of raising taxes elsewhere for sums of money not far away from &euro;20 million, is it not legitimate to ask whether taxpayers' money is being well-used by putting it against an exemption or a change such as this?  To my mind, the answer is no.  I believe there are better ways of using the &euro;20 million.  We can use it to invest in public services or to fund changes we are making in taxes elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  We have covered the arguments in every debate.  For every tax change we make, those looking at the debate and those looking at what I say on budget day come forward with claims that a given measure has not been analysed, that the figures are not costed, that we will not bring in the revenue and that we are not aware of the consequences.  These arguments are sometimes a recipe for changing course, but if they were to be used to pause everything I am doing, then we would end up not having a budget.  My core contention to the House is that there are better ways of using &euro;20 million of Exchequer resources.  We have covered the rationale and need for this on Committee Stage.

First, this was not a budget day measure.  It was not announced on budget day.  It was not contained in the budget day booklet or within the summary of taxation measures.  Certain measures that brought in as little as &euro;2 million were singled out in the budget day booklet summary of tax measures.  The Minister says this measure will bring in &euro;20 million but it did not warrant a mention.  Presumably it was not in play at the time, but between budget day and the publication of the Finance Bill the issue emerged and was put forward in the Bill, as published.  There was no consultation and the out-of-the-blue nature of this is what has caused so much concern.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister needs to accept some facts and realities.  This will make our tourism offering less competitive.  It will increase costs in the car rental sector.  This affects not only tourists but also other consumers.  There will be an implication and a cost.  There is a potential impact when Ireland is being compared with other jurisdictions and no one knows what that is, but it will be taken in addition to the impact of the increase in the lower VAT rate.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to the car leasing sector, which is an important area for small and medium-sized businesses and corporate bodies throughout the country, car leasing will now be placed at a relative disadvantage to hire purchase arrangements, which is another manner of providing vehicles, as well as personal contract plan arrangements or indeed the provision of vehicles through debt loans.<\/p><p>Car leasing will be placed at a relative disadvantage to hire purchase arrangements, another manner of providing vehicles, personal contract plan, PCP, arrangements, or the provision of vehicles through debt loans.  There is a change within that stream of activity.  Car leasing will become more expensive, with an average car costing around &euro;700 more.  The Minister of State has mentioned the figure of &euro;20 million, but there is another side to the argument and it remains to be seen whether the &euro;20 million will actually be collected.  People deserve an explanation.

In summary, I am raising the issue of the application of VAT to children's footwear and clothes.  The current legal position is that children's footwear and clothes are exempt up to a certain age, beyond which VAT at the standard rate of 23% is applied.  The exemption applies to average footwear and clothes sizes for a typical ten year old.  We discussed this matter on Committee Stage.  The average measurements for clothes are given as up to a chest size of 32 inches and a waste size of 26 inches and, for footwear, up to and including size 5.5 or 38 in European measurements. <\/p><p>There are two problems.  Not every child is of average size and children are aged 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 years when they are also teenagers.  In retail outlets there is a completely different pricing mechanism for sizes that attract the VAT exemption.  This is most obvious in the case of footwear.  A pair of football boots or trainers up to size 5.5 might cost &euro;40, but above that size they might cost &euro;70 or &euro;80.  The application of VAT does not explain the difference in full, but it is being exploited by the introduction of a completely different pricing regime.  <\/p><p>I am aware of the rules and we do not need to rehash them, but, as things stand, I believe the Minister of State's hands are tied because he cannot introduce any new VAT exemption beyond what was designated when Article 110 of the VAT directive took effect on 1 January 1991.  I acknowledge that Revenue has done some work in looking at average clothes and footwear sizes for a typical ten year old.  It has not found any evidence that the current measurements are out of line, but there is not much evidence to back them up either.  There does not seem to be a lot of information available, which I can understand.  <\/p><p>We are aware of European Commission proposals to give member states more flexibility when it comes to VAT.  The press release states the European Union's common VAT rules which were agreed to by all member states in 1992 are out of date and too restrictive.  I could not agree more.  I am asking the Minister of State to give a commitment that the Government will raise this issue in the context of the changes at European level, with a view to achieving greater flexibility in order that we can bring about some changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200027#CC01000","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1542896100,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I add my support on this issue which we discussed at length on Committee Stage last year.  In fairness, Deputy Michael McGrath has brought it up on numerous occasions.  There are obviously anomalies.  I am the father of four children.  My eldest child is now 12 years old, but he wears a size 10 shoe and has done so for quite a while.  As has been said, not every person is of average size.  Some are taller than others.  There is an issue, but there is also a unique opportunity, given the forthcoming changes to VAT rules.  It is important, therefore, that we consider commissioning a report, not just on children's clothes and footwear but also on all VAT rates.  We are sick to the teeth of having to respond to those involved in emergency services who are out collecting money to provide vital equipment, be it defibrillators, mountain rescue equipment or adult bike helmets.  These items are all subject to VAT, but as they are important, it should not be the case.  The new list system will allow for the notification of certain items which will be limited to firearms and gambling, etc.  We will have huge scope to move VAT rates if we so wish.<\/p>  <p>  There are huge anomalies in the current system.

I will not go into the details, but I will mention the action plan for the future of VAT in the European Union.  In January the European Commission published a proposal for the reform of VAT.  The outcome of any discussion on the VAT rating proposal and the eventual adoption of the proposed legislation will clarify and establish the full scope available to Ministers and member states to alter the VAT rating of goods and services.  However, other than an initial discussion at Council working party level in March, the VAT rating proposal has not been tabled for discussion by the last two Presidents.  No reform of VAT rates can be based on the proposal until it is agreed to by Finance Ministers within the European Union.  We all know that there are anomalies and peculiarities within VAT rates and structures.  VRT on rescue vehicles falls into the same category.  Until the discussions are concluded at European level we will not be able to consider the matter.  It will also depend on the outcome of the discussions.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath was correct to say the analysis was carried out by Revenue of the average size of children.

There has been a very little push from any part of the clothing and footwear sector on the issue, although I accept that there are anomalies.  I have heard Deputy Pearse Doherty talk about how his son wears a size 10 shoe.  When I was 20 years old I wore a size 8 shoe and my feet have not grown since.  There are peculiarities.

It is clear that the Minister was considering legislative change in the Finance Bill to provide clarity to the sector but opted not to do so based on consultation with the Department of Health.  I am not sure in which direction he intended to move the legislation, but there is now no legislative provision in place, which means we must rely on Revenue's guidance and interpretation.  I accept that the food supplements and nutrition sectors are evolving and changing rapidly and it is not easy for Revenue to keep pace with them and apply law consistently because many of the products are composites of different components.  However there is a distinct lack of clarity.  The Minister says that vitamins, minerals and fish oils have a zero VAT rate.

The industry tells us it is taking a pragmatic view, supporting the proposal by Revenue and the Department of Finance to introduce a reduced rate of VAT across the board.

The reduced VAT rate was a welcome and necessary move at the time and it is still necessary.<\/p><p>I compliment Deputy Wallace, who apologises for his absence, on tabling this reasonable amendment.  It requests that an impact assessment of the VAT increase on the hospitality sector be carried out after six months.  This is seldom done in legislation.<\/p><p>This is a major issue, certainly outside the Pale.  The reduced rate was bringing people back into hospitality businesses for food, drinks, etc., and generating business.  It has proved successful.  While we may have accepted a 1% increase in the VAT rate for the sector, reinstating the 13.5% rate is ridiculous.  It was not expected by the industry as it had lobbied hard on the issue.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, must know that restaurants and other parts of the hospitality sector are on their knees and struggling.  The reduced rate was a big help to the sector because people started going out again in towns and villages, as well as the islands and other tourist areas, many of which had become economically depressed.<\/p><p>We want an impact assessment conducted on this measure.

In one fell swoop and without any analysis, the Minister turns it back to the previous rate.  Jobs must be sustained and money is committed in the context of the business to sustain those jobs.  What the Minister has done is take away that money that might have been relied upon to ensure jobs were not just created but sustained.  It is the one single issue that clearly demonstrates the difference between the big urban centres like Dublin and the rest of the country because the rest of the country is struggling desperately to keep jobs in their regions and to ensure that they are there to play a part in the economic upturn whenever that happens in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to take a fresh look at this.

This is a tribute to those entrepreneurs and workers who made such a success of it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection tweeted \"a job for everybody who wants one\", which was a huge insult to many people in my constituency.  More than 10,600 people in my constituency are on the live register.

The Minister owes an apology to the people who are busting their gut trying to seek employment, travelling long distances for interviews and sending in CVs.

There is no doubt that when the VAT rate was reduced to 9%, it had the effect of increasing employment, particularly in the restaurant sector.  We found restaurants that otherwise would have not survived were setting up in small towns and villages and were able to survive.  The message that is clearly coming back to me from those people is that some of them will close and some small hotels will reduce the number of staff.<\/p>  <p>  We can talk about the hotel sector all day, but a lady running a family hotel told me that this VAT increase was the equivalent of two well-paid workers.  While they may not be working full time, this measure will cost the owner almost &euro;50,000 extra, so her intention is to reduce the number of staff.  It is remarkable, because if any shop or business was surviving in rural Ireland, it was the hairdresser and the restaurant when many others had closed.  The pity of this is that at the very time when we are talking about rural regeneration and putting money back into towns and villages, which I acknowledge, some of these businesses will definitely close.

I do not know whether something could have been done with regard to turnover but we need to do something about this because it will cost jobs, especially in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  This matter is causing concern to many small businesses.  I know this because I still get representations about it weekly asking me whether anything can be done.  I know there was talk about investing &euro;35 million in the tourism industry.  I do not know where that is and whether anything has been done to ease the sting of this measure.  I do not know whether the Minister of State can tell us anything about this.  We should remember that those businesses were hit hard in the rates review in recent years.  Many of them had to pay extra rates on their small premises, so they have been hit pretty hard.  I think it was Deputy Howlin who said earlier that many of them had to survive through hard years and had to make many sacrifices during that period.  I would certainly support the comments of all my colleagues here.  This must be kept under review.  I would like to see something done with that &euro;35 million to help those businesses that will struggle because of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200030#FF00500","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1542897900,"counter":299,"content":"<p>The 9% VAT rate was introduced as a temporary measure in the Finance Act 2011 to cease at the end of 2013.

The review was published in July 2018 and the budget decision to increase the VAT rate was made following that analysis, which indicated that the majority of activity at the 9% rate is driven by income growth more than price and that the retention of the rate provides little additional benefit relative to its cost.  The review of the 9% rate found that tourism expenditure is more sensitive to income growth and economic cycle than to price changes.<\/p><p>The economy is performing well, with high levels of employment and strong demand in the tourism sector and growth expected to continue in the medium term.  This positive economic outlook means that the income channel of demand is likely to ensure that the economic activity within the sector to which the 9% VAT rate applies remains strong.  In this context, it is believed that the VAT rate applied to the tourism sector should not greatly impact demand or employment therein.  In this circumstance, there does not appear to be a case for a review of the impact of an increase in the VAT rate on the hospitality sector within the next ten months.<\/p> <p> A number of the issues raised are relevant issues but they are not relevant in terms of the VAT rate within the hospitality sector.  There are areas that are struggling and areas that are performing well.  There are pockets of rural Ireland that are performing well and other areas that are not doing as well but this is not due the VAT rate because the same rate of VAT applies in both instances.  It is the product available that brings people to particular areas.<\/p> <p> There are 2.27 million in employment in this State.  We have never had more people working.  When people are working, they are able to spend more and to pay a little extra VAT.  Taking the example of a coffee and a scone that costs &euro;5, the increase in VAT is 22.5 cent.  I do not believe a 22.5 cent increase would cause anybody to not buy a coffee and a scone.  There is a legitimate question about the regionality of the tourism sector but it is a different question than the VAT rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200030#FF00800","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542898500,"counter":303,"content":"<p>The Minister of State mentioned that a review was carried out last year.  Will he elaborate on what was reviewed and who carried out the review?  He also mentioned that pockets of rural Ireland are doing very well.  They are very scarce pockets because I do not know many areas that are doing well.  In my constituency, there are many cottage industries providing bed and breakfast services and catering services, such as the Carraig Hotel in Carrick-on-Suir, Hotel Minella and Leisure Centre in Clonmel, Cahir House Hotel in Cahir and Great National Ballykisteen Golf Hotel in Tipperary, and hairdressers, that will be impacted by this increase.  I hope it does not affect the beauticians or they will have to charge extra for the snake oil.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the review, there are pockets of Dublin where the hospitality is not doing well, with many establishments forced to sell a two-course meal for &euro;10 to try to encourage customers in.  That is a fact.  I was in one such place recently.  I could not believe the prices being charged.  However, rural Ireland is most impacted.  The reduced VAT rate was introduced by former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, for good reason.  I accept it was to be a short-term measure but it proved to be successful.  It was the spark that started new businesses and helped others to remain open.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said there had been a review of the reduced VAT rate.  Was consideration given to an incremental increase to assist the people mentioned by Deputy McGuinness who have made five-year plans, who have taken out loans from banks to generate their businesses, and who need to service their debt?  It is fine for the Minister of State to say that the cost of a coffee and a scone will increase by only 22.5 cent, but the increase on functions such as weddings, birthday parties and bed nights will be greater.  We are supposed to be the Ireland of a thousand welcomes.  This is the basis on which many in the hospitality sector operate.  The reduced rate helped them and it also helped new businesses to get up and running.  It helped to regenerate villages and towns.  The increase is a slap in the face for all of those people and businesses.  It is a huge increase, amounting to almost 40% of the cost.  It is too much too quick.  The tourism sector and our fledgling cottage industries will not be able to sustain this increase.

The biggest source of tax avoidance by corporations globally centres on this digital area.  We know these companies can, essentially, write their own tax bills.  In Ireland, that is because of loopholes that I believe we have helped them create.  We have worked with them on a nod and a wink basis to create a situation to allow them to write down their taxable profits.  That is done by having loopholes which allow the corporations to write-off the costs of payments for intellectual property or royalties on intellectual property.  They make payments to themselves for the use of their own intellectual property.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, things that would be profits become costs and then become tax deductible.  It is just a joke.  It is assisting in accelerating inequality in the distribution of wealth to extraordinary proportions.  These sorts of companies are leading the charge on this.  A digital tax is a reasonable response to try to get a bit of tax back from these firms which specialise in avoiding tax.<\/p>  <p>  If the Government has concerns that this might have a disproportionate effect on Ireland, then we should get out ahead of it.  We should acknowledge there is a serious problem with tax injustice and tax avoidance and state we have a better solution to it.  The starting point for that solution has to be acknowledgement of this serious problem.  It should also be stated that what these companies are doing is immoral and we need mechanisms to deal with it.  Then we go out and argue, in a positive way, for a way of dealing with that.  On the other side of this debate, the bigger countries may be playing for their own advantage.  I accept that.  We should not, however, be just as bad as they are by stating we care only about our little bit of advantage.<\/p>  <p>  There is a bigger picture here and that is of the big multinationals being parasitical in not wanting to pay their fair share of tax.

We regard the digital tax proposals as the first step towards tax harmonisation through the back door.  It is the thin end of the wedge and it does represent a transfer of taxing rights.  It will also represent a transfer of actual tax revenue from smaller member states, such as Ireland, to larger member states.  There is a need, undoubtedly, for further reform and changes to the way multinationals, particularly in the technology sector, are taxed.  It should be done on a truly multilateral basis, however, at the level of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  There should be no mistake about this.  Ireland would be a significant loser if this came to pass.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach heard from the Revenue Commissioners on this issue when we met with it earlier this year.  It was evident that there were many unanswered questions at that point as to how this would work.  I believe they remain unanswered.  It would, however, represent a transfer of taxing rights in the sense that where the service users are based is where most tax is going to be paid.  Given the size of our population and economy relative to the European Union, it would not take a genius to work out we will be a major loser in that context.<\/p>  <p>  The next step will be the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB.  The European Commission keeps resurrecting these proposals which would represent a firm step towards tax harmonisation.  Taxation is a national competence.  We should protect and safeguard it.  If we were to move towards CCCTB, there would be a system where profits to be taxed would be apportioned on the basis of where employees and assets are based and where turnover occurs.  Ireland would again be a major loser, perhaps the single biggest loser in the European Union.  We do have to be open to change and continue to co-operate with the OECD moves in this direction.  In my view, however, this proposal on digital taxation is an attempt by larger countries within the European Union to secure taxing rights from smaller countries like Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200033#JJ00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1542899400,"counter":311,"content":"<p>There are two reasons why I am not in a position to accept this amendment.  The first is the amount of work I and my Department have already done to try to meet the need to which this amendment refers.  Officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  On foot of those appearances we have already submitted a report to the committee laying out the different issues Ireland would face if this measure was implemented.  I contend we have already done the report for which this amendment calls.<\/p>  <p>  The second reason is that the taxation of the digital economy sector will change in the future.  It is going to change in the same way as we have seen how other forms of corporate activity are taxed.  The key point is how that change can happen in the safest way for Ireland.  A change in tax policy that creates a trade risk is a big challenge for a small open trading economy such as Ireland.  To avoid that happening, it is safer for our country and economy that agreement on this issue be reached with key trading partners, such as the United States of American and Japan, so that they have an opportunity to reach agreement with Europe on new ways to tax this sector.<\/p>  <p>  Absent that, my great concern is that we could see Europe and Ireland going in one direction and then our trading partners deciding to respond in turn.  That is quite a vista for us to have to face into.  My view on this is clear.  Taxation of the digital economy will change.  The proposal from the European Commission, however, does not deal with issues such as how it would interact with national taxation measures.  It does not deal with how exporting countries could be given comfort in respect of shifting the tax incidence into markets of consumption as opposed to where the value is created.  For those reasons, I believe it is a safer venue and avenue for these matters to be dealt with by the OECD.  On this amendment, as I discussed with Deputy Burton on Committee Stage, I have already supplied the key information for which this amendment calls.

I refer to how this digital economy and the digital sector, which is making incredible profits - it is the most profitable industry on the planet - can pay its fair share of taxes.  The amendment suggests we start that process in this jurisdiction.<\/p><p>We must participate fully in the OECD process.  The base erosion and profit shifting process was something we very much engaged with and we were certainly leaders in that field during Labour's time in government.  I presume that is continuing.  In the domestic economy we must still be prepared to look at issues as our own citizens and people in any forum I attend anywhere on the planet have a view that Ireland facilitates tax avoidance.  Whether we like it or not, that is the perception.  It is not helpful to our international reputation.<\/p> <p> I listened to Deputy Michael McGrath and in truth, past Governments facilitated the double Irish tax scheme and procedures we wound down because they were not acceptable.  In a world where people are impoverished, there is the notion that enormous corporations make enormous profits that are not taxed.  We cannot wash our hands of that.  I understand the Minister is of the view that this work is already done but I have not seen it.  Sending officials to speak to a committee of the House is not the sort of analysis I am talking about here.  Maybe the timeframe involved is too narrow but it is something we should engage with so we can be prepared to deal with the reputational issues we have already endured and robustly argue, perhaps not for the model that the Minister finds objectionable but another model of taxing the digital economy.

The dog in the street knows extortionate profits are being made in the property sector currently.  Much of this profit is being made by investors, asset management companies, vulture funds or however we might want to describe the likes of the real estate investment trusts.  They were invited here, it is fair to say, to buy property-related debt from NAMA and some of the banks we bailed out.  They bought vast amounts of property and building land at discount prices and they have now gained a major foothold in the Irish property sector, playing a very significant role in generating the current housing and homelessness emergency.  They are engaged in wholesale property speculation, land hoarding and efforts to evict and de-tenant properties bought off NAMA.  I have had to fight quite a few cases in my own area where Cerberus and Apollo Global Management have tried to evict people or get around rent caps.  All they are doing is trying to ratchet up the values of those properties and rents to extortionate levels.<\/p><p>Most of these people, particularly the outside investors, will benefit from this section 110 tax loophole if they hold their investments for a specified period of seven years.  As well as making profits from rents and capital gains, they will then pay no tax on it.  We could not make up that stuff.  It is absolutely shocking.  The public needs to know about this.  There are many losers in the housing and homelessness emergency but there is a small cohort of winners who are being facilitated by these kinds of tax loopholes and Government policy in general.  It is wrong and utterly shocking that when asked how much tax is forgone on this, the Government cannot or will not tell us.  It must be to the tune of billions of euro, without a shadow of doubt, if we consider what is happening in the rental and property sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200034#KK01400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1542900000,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 sets out the regime for the taxation of special purpose vehicles set up to securitise assets.  Securitisation is both useful for banks in freeing capital to allow them to continue to lend to all taxpayers and for the productive economy as it can underpin the supply of capital market financing to industries and companies in Ireland, Europe and further afield.  Ireland is not unique in having a specific regime for securitisations.  The importance of securitisation has been recognised by the European Commission through the work on the capital markets union, a main objective of which is to build a sustainable securitisation regime across the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Section 110 companies can hold certain qualifying assets.  Real property is not an asset that a qualifying company can hold but they can hold loans and other financial assets that derive their value from them.  Following concerns raised by the Revenue Commissioners and subsequently by Deputies on the finance committee as to the use of section 110 companies to hold debt secured on Irish property, the Finance Act 2016 made changes to the taxation of section 110 companies to ensure profits derived from Irish land and buildings would be subject to tax in Ireland.  Those changes took effect from 6 September 2016.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specifics of the report proposed by the Deputies I am advised the Revenue Commissioners do not and could not collect the type of information required to calculate the tax that would have been paid had the section 110 process not existed.  In the first instance, some of the business carried on through section 110 companies simply would not be carried on here, or it would have been carried on here differently.  There is no method to take account of how behaviour would have changed had the regime not existed.  Second, in the case of activity which would have taken place in Ireland in the absence of section 110, the hypothetical alternative tax would depend on exactly what the underlying business was and how it might otherwise have been structured, as a company, a partnership or an investment fund, for example.

I therefore cannot accept the Deputies&rsquo; amendment.<\/p>  <p>  I will correct the Deputy's statement.  The top 20 largest landlords in Ireland account for 3.8% of the total tenancies.

In the short time available to me, I will put it to the Minister this way.  It is an incredible fact that there are workers, such as pilots, construction workers and film workers, who are fighting to pay tax but are being prevented from doing so.  When we discuss tax reliefs, we usually refer to people who do not want to pay tax, avoid it and make lots of profit, but there is a cohort of working people who are fighting for the right to pay tax and are being frustrated in their ability to secure employment where they pay tax.  If they secured employment and, instead of being falsely classified as contractors or freelancers, were classified as PAYE workers, as they want to be, then everyone would gain.  They would get some sort of security and continuity of employment and Revenue would gain additional tax income.<\/p><p>It would be a win-win situation except for certain classes of company, employer and so on who would rather not have to take responsibility for their employees, pay PRSI or pension contributions, pay sick pay and holiday pay and so forth and are instead deliberately playing the system.  It gets even worse.  Many of these companies that are trying to force bogus self-employment on people are in receipt of large sums of public money.  We have discussed the film industry at length.  There are protests under way on Gardiner Street in the Minister's constituency - I have not been able to attend it this week because I have been so busy in here - where building workers at St. Mary's Mansions are fighting for direct employment on an approved housing body, AHB, site where social housing is being constructed.  Subbies are bringing people down who are working as bricklayers and classified as contractors despite in reality being employees.  There are workers outside the gate who are fighting for direct employment as PAYE workers.  That situation is wrong.<\/p><p>In all of these situations, be it in Ryanair, the film industry, the construction sector or other sectors, we need clear definitions of an employee.  They are not difficult to devise.  Does someone set people's working hours, tell them when to go on lunch and pay them certain moneys for certain hours?  If so, then they are employees.  They are not contractors or businesses.  Revenue needs to go into these places, be they in the film industry or construction industry, and say that someone will be classified and taxed as a PAYE worker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200035#LL01500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1542900600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>There is something that has not been addressed yet, namely, the new tax rules for self-employed people.  More people will be pushed into being subbies.  As I have mentioned, doing the paperwork under the new rules will cost employers &euro;450 per employee from next January.  That will put a small business in trouble.<\/p>  <p>  I will tell the previous speaker something about the building sector.  I have worked on construction sites and various road projects.  Often, a main contractor gets the job.  If I am from Galway, I price the blocklaying as a contractor.  I will probably supply the cement, ready mix, trowels and the whole shebang.  I take that job on price and I then employ people.  That is the way it operates.  Some people get confused and believe that the main contractor should be taking on everyone.  The main contractor will not.  A job may be for three or six months, after which people will be gone again.  In the construction sector, someone will not work on a site for 20 years and get a pension out of it.  That person is almost like a bird, flying from place to place.  In particular, people from rural areas come to the likes of Dublin and do the ground work, which is taken on price.  They employ others - I want to be clear on that front - and must do so under Construction Industry Federation, CIF, regulations.  The person who subs the work from the main contractor is not big enough to take on the full contract.  That is how we get subcontractors.  There will always be subcontractors because there has to be.  In every job around the country, there are subbies who do not have the turnover to take on the main contract.  They could be in Dublin building or laying foundations and then be building 50 houses in Galway two months later.  That is the nature of the business.  I need to make that clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200035#LL01600","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1542900600,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for raising this issue and Deputy Fitzmaurice for contributing to it.

We have also outlined a number of times the kind of work that the Revenue Commissioners are doing on dealing with the risk of tax evasion.  In 2017, for example, Revenue participated in 1,800 construction site visits and conducted more than 10,000 interviews.  Given the amount of work that the Revenue Commissioners are doing, the report that has just been published by two Departments on this issue and the recent campaign that was run by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection encouraging people who felt they were being exploited to come forward, this issue is recognised by the Government and a great deal of effort is being made.<\/p><p>This is an issue that is recognised by the Government and much effort is going into tackling it.

The Minister should pop down and talk to those involved in that protest.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice is correct in saying there may be legitimate reasons for subcontractors to be involved in projects.  However, we must ask whether the people who are working for the contractor or subcontractor are getting payslips, are being properly taxed and properly classified.  Is the subcontractor hiring lots of people who are all being classified as self-employed entrepreneurs?  Often these workers are not self-employed and are getting paid less than they would be paid if they were directly employed.  That is the main issue.  Similarly, I have spoken to people working in the film industry who have told me that a lot of problems in that industry could be sorted quite easily.  They suggest that officials from Revenue's joint investigations unit, JIU, or from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht visit film production sites before filming starts and obtain a list of all of the people who will be working on the project, including their names and grades and whether they are working on contract or are self-employed.  In that way, everyone will be properly classified and abuse cannot happen.  This would require additional resources for Revenue, or whatever body is responsible, in order to be effective.  Resources are needed, as is a willingness to do this properly.  We also need legislation which is why a report on this, as per my amendment, would be good.

We know it is necessary under base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, rather than a great initiative by this Government but, as usual, there is Irish exceptionalism when it comes to this exit tax.  This tax applies to gains made on assets onshored and then moved offshore, so it seems like a straightforward case where capital gains tax should apply at the normal rate of 33%.  If it is to be taxed as profit, then surely at least it would be on non-trading profit which, in our State, is a corporation tax rate of 25%.  Either way, the 12.5% rate in this Finance Bill does not make sense.<\/p><p>We know from the tax strategy group papers that: &quot;Responses to the Coffey\/ATAD consultation focussed primarily on the rate to be applied in calculating the exit tax, with the majority favouring a 12.5% rate for assets in use for the purposes of a trade.&quot;  On a quick scan through those submissions that came in, only KPMG suggested a 12.5% rate.<\/p><p>One could take that to the extreme and say that as KPMG was the only one it is the majority, but that is not a fair analysis or presentation of the facts.  The exit tax needs to be tightened up.  I welcome the fact that it is there; the issue we have is with the rate.  The Minister has failed to convince me or my party as to why the 12.5% rate should apply.  We have a capital gains tax rate of 33%.  That relates to gains and this is about gains.  It is likely that there will be depreciation in respect of these assets but any profits or gains should be taxed at the level at which we tax gains in this State.  As I said, if it is to match the corporation tax rate it should at least be based on the rate for non-trading income, which is 25%, as opposed to the rate for trading income, which is 12.5%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200037#NN00300","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542902100,"counter":355,"content":"<p>The introduction of the exit tax regime is an important development in ensuring that our corporate tax policy continues to meet the evolving international standards in respect of corporation tax policy.

I also made the point that, though many more countries have yet to bring in the regime, the norm in many of the other EU member states that have brought it in has been to anchor the exit tax rate to the existing corporate tax, which is what I have done.  They are the reasons I have made that change.  If they do not convince the Deputy, that does not take away from the fact that this is the argument why I have done this and why I believe it is the correct rate to use.<\/p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate to tax an unrealised gain at a higher rate as is suggested by the Deputy's amendment for a number of reasons.  The first is that the companies subject to the charge may have no intention of disposing of the asset and may, therefore, not actually realise any gain.  The second reason is that the asset that is migrating might fall in value following migration, in which case a high rate of tax could well have been paid on a temporary value fluctuation.

My amendment to oppose that measure has been ruled out of order.  There are serious questions around that and I would look for more detailed explanations of how some of these amendments have been ruled out of order.  I could go into that but my time is limited.<\/p><p>What I propose in this amendment is a tax relief equivalent to one month's rent for all renters in the State who are not already supported by the State.  This would therefore exclude those receiving a subsidy such as the housing assistance payment, HAP, for example.  As I outlined to the Minister in our alternative budget and on Committee Stage, this one month's rent back each year for three years would be accompanied by a rent cap or a rent freeze during that period.  The third leg of this stool would be an increase in supply.  We argued and advocated for a larger, much-increased capital programme which would see thousands more social, affordable and cost rental houses being built with direct funding from the State.<\/p><p>The great solution to the housing crisis the Minister came up with in budget 2019 was to increase landlord's tax relief on mortgage interest to 100%.  Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative, as I said, has been rent relief for the renters who are facing the great crisis out there.  The problem with the Government's proposal is that it is completely unconditional.  There needs to be large amounts of conditionality.  It should be ensured that landlords getting this very large tax break are providing affordable rents and security of tenure.  This relief provides no incentive to reduce rents in an environment in which supply is still restricted.<\/p><p>Many people out there are put to the pin of their collars and many young people can never aspire to what their parents had before them, which is the simple ability to own one's own family home.  That is particularly acute in the more urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Galway and elsewhere but it is also being felt more and more right across rural Ireland.  That is a clear example of how we are failing on the issue of housing.  The Minister likes to say that we are never returning to boom and bust but that is exactly what is happening here.  We went from boom to bust and now we are going to boom again.  There is a lack of ability to manage the issue of housing in this State.  Government has never got a handle on it.<\/p><p>Rents have risen for the 25th consecutive quarter.  Rents have reached an all-time high in each of the last ten quarters.  Every single one of those quarters broke new records.  Year on year we are seeing inflation of more than 10% and the Government is discussing accelerating tax relief for landlords.  We want to see tax relief for renters.  We want to see one month back for every person renting in the State for a period of three years.  That is what this report calls for.  It is about giving real relief to people and introducing a cap so that landlords cannot increase these rents any further.  It is about giving breathing space at a time when the Government needs to ramp up the amount of money it is putting into social, affordable and cost rental houses to deal genuinely with the supply issue rather than tinkering around the edges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200038#OO00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1542902100,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I support this amendment, particularly given the very generous tax reliefs we discussed earlier which are to be given to those who are making extraordinary amounts of money out of property, rents and, frankly, profiteering off the back of the current housing and homelessness emergency.

Rents of &euro;3,300 are proposed for apartments in a new block which has just been completed.  That is just wrong.  At this point surely the Government recognises that we have to do something in terms of real rent control.  I do not refer just to rent caps: we need rents to be set at affordable levels.<\/p>  <p>  This is done in other jurisdictions.  People from local authorities or some other Government or State body go in, look at places and at their size, take into account any reasonable factors and say that more than a given figure cannot be charged.  We have to have that now, otherwise this will be a disaster on many levels.  Even from the point of view of economic competitiveness, which may be more of a focus for the Government than the social and humanitarian side, we are not going to be able to get the people we need into this country to address labour and skills shortages or to keep our own young people from leaving the country if we cannot set affordable levels of rent.

It is a very small measure and it might help to stem the exit of domestic landlords from the market.  We have an inflow of very large institutional investor landlords but we need to have a rental stock spread throughout the country and within urban areas we need to have rental properties available in ones and twos spread across individual housing developments and along different streets.  The large institutional investors will not provide that model of rental stock.  They will buy large blocks within Dublin and perhaps other cities as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200039#PP00100","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1542902700,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.

That followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued.  The view of this independent commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation.  Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief could be seen as a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the pressure on tenants.<\/p>  <p>  In the normal course of events, a tax credit of this nature would be of little benefit to lower income workers, the unemployed and students who may have little or no income tax liability.  However, I understand from the discussion on Committee Stage that Deputy Pearse Doherty is proposing that the relief be in the form of a refundable tax credit.  An approach on the lines the Deputy suggests would represent a significant shift which could have major policy implications far beyond the question of financial support for rent costs.  It would take us into the area of income and welfare supports, which is currently the primary responsibility of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, this proposal, if it was accepted as outlined by the Deputy, would entail a very significant investment by Revenue to provide for it.  Likewise, it would involve substantial investment by employers and payroll systems providers to develop new systems and procedures to handle refundable tax credits.<\/p>  <p>  For those reasons, this is not a development that I am willing to consider at this time.  The actions that the Government proposes to take to address concerns about the cost of rental accommodation are set out in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  At the time of its abolition, the rental tax relief cost the Exchequer up to &euro;97 million per annum, and it is likely that there would be an even higher cost were a similar scheme to be introduced.  It would be higher again if it were on the basis of a refundable tax credit.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath asked about the extent to which the constitutional grounds may be breached.  We are satisfied that we are at the limit of the constitutionality to which we can go in terms of rent caps and other measures.<\/p>  <p>  I completely disagree with Deputy Pearse Doherty's view on the amount of money that was provided in budget 2019 for housing solutions.

They continued to tell us that everything would be okay.  We have heard all the different measures they introduced such as the help-to-buy scheme and now giving tax breaks to landlords.  The latter measure is not just supported by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It demanded that it would happen and it ensured it was written into the Finance Bill.<\/p>  <p>  We have a major crisis.  I have made this point time and again.  The homelessness crisis lies completely at the Government's feet.  Here and now in this Chamber and on Committee Stage we decide how to divvy up the resources of the State and year after year the Government has failed to invest the necessary funding for social and affordable housing.  The automatic consequence of that is we have a housing crisis.  As we speak here at 5 o'clock, families are walking the street.  Children have been picked up from school a couple of hours ago and they have nowhere to go.  They will go to their hotels tonight and in the morning they will be told to leave their rooms.  A total of 4,000 children are in that situation and 10,000 people in all.<\/p>  <p>  That is at the most acute end of the situation but, in addition, we have seen rents increase for 25 consecutive quarters.  The Minister told us the rent caps were supposed to solve this but landlords are breaching the rent caps.  The reality is that we have seen record levels of rent in this State for the past ten quarters.  Each quarter set a new record in the State.  We are saying the Minister must do something more imaginative.  We have offered a solution in terms of rent relief, which used to exist, which was abolished by Fianna F&aacute;il and only rolled its way out of the system last year because people were still able to avail of it up to then.  We need such a solution when we have the highest level of rent in the history of the State.  Rent should be refundable to all, including students.  People are being charged through the nose to share a bed.  That is the kind of crap that goes on.  It is unbelievable what is happening to students and other renters.<\/p><p>Now we are in a situation where because of mismanagement we need others to come into the country to build the houses that should have been built in a proper and managed way.  That will put more pressure on the housing sector which, in turn, will fuel house prices further.  Somehow, those in the Government think the people are going to manage, but they are not.  Therefore, we need measures such as this to be introduced, but I do not expect the Minister to introduce them because he does not believe in them.

In the 2016 general election Fianna F&aacute;il was the only party of which I am aware that campaigned on the basis that mortgage interest relief would be retained and provided for in the budgetary and fiscal projections made at the time.  I would have loved to have seen it retained at a rate of 100%, but the best we could negotiate two and a half years ago was that it would be retained at a reduced rate and tapered over a three year period.

However, when I seek to make a policy decision to alleviate the pressure on pricing, acknowledging the fact that the ESRI carried out a report in which it argued that demand side tax incentives such as this could add to the pressure on pricing in the market, the Deputy is also against it.  We are removing mortgage interest relief because increasingly it is being baked into the pricing of homes.  The Deputy acknowledges that Governments can do things that drive up the price of homes, but when we seek to remove a measure such as this, he also opposes it.  For clear reasons, we will not extend the relief.  This is a measure that currently is only available to a certain number of people within the State based on when they bought their homes.  We made an agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il that we would abolish it, but that it would be abolished at a slower rate in order to be fair to the people who benefited from it and acknowledge the affect it had on persons who did not have it.

Unless it is wholly, exclusively and necessarily required in the performance of a person's duties, a PAYE worker paying his or her own subscription does not get any tax relief.  The issue being raised by way of contrast in respect of trade union subscriptions is that in the case of the self-employed such a subscription is, in effect, tax deductible.  There is an issue of consistency here.  Employees who pay their own subscription cannot avail of a tax relief on it, unless it is a requirement of their job.  Generally, where it is a requirement of the job, the subscription will be paid by the employer and a benefit-in-kind issue may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200043#TT00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1542904800,"counter":395,"content":"<p>We have debated this matter on a number of occasions.

While we did discuss the issue on Committee Stage, I want to tease it out further.  There is general acceptance that we need to reduce the level of dependence on lending from the banking sector and so the more non-bank sources of finance there are available to small and medium enterprises, in particular, the better.  Peer-to-peer lending is an evolving sector, but it is growing.  Earlier this year, the Revenue Commissioners paid attention to it and I understand that in May last they issued an e-brief requiring borrowers to deduct a 20% withholding tax from their repayments.  This measure is to ensure tax compliance.  I would like to know from the Minister if this measure arises out a concern on the part of the Revenue Commissioners in regard to non-compliance.  Obviously, everybody involved in this sector, and every other sector, should be tax compliant.  The Minister is moving with the Central Bank towards regulation of crowd funding generally but, in particular, peer-to-peer lending.  My concern is that given the nature of how peer-to-peer lending works the imposition of a withholding tax will render it unworkable because each person contributing to the lending will be required to complete the R185 form and each loan in this sector can have over 200 different lenders involved in a transaction.  If this requirement is to remain, it will stop in its tracks the further development of peer-to-peer lending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200045#VV00100","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1542905400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>On the e-brief issued by the Revenue Commissioners, it was not in regard to a new policy.

As I said on Committee Stage, I am willing to examine what would be an appropriate tax regime for this sector but only after we have concluded our work with the sector in regard to how we can better regulate it.  Currently, this sector is not regulated.  The European Parliament is commencing work in this area, which when completed we can use to get a better idea of what our domestic regulatory regime might look like.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of sequence, we will make progress on the direction of regulation first and, as we are doing that work, we will engage with the sector on what might be a more appropriate taxation regime for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200045#VV00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1542905400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>The issue is that given the nature of how peer-to-peer lending works the administration of withholding tax makes it virtually impossible for the sector to function.

The Minister wants that issue to be dealt with before putting in place an appropriate system of taxation.  I ask him to continue to engage with the sector.  This is an important area.  We need to diversify further the sources of funding that are available to SMEs throughout the country.  The more competition we have in the area of credit the better value SMEs, as consumers, get and end consumers will get a better deal as well.

To recap very briefly on this issue, it relates to the exit tax on certain life assurance products, in particular long-term investment products.  Until recent years the exit tax rate was aligned with the rate of DIRT.  The Minister's predecessor announced a four-year cycle of 2% reductions in DIRT.  When the most recent reduction comes into effect in January, DIRT will therefore be down to 35% but the exit tax will remain at 41%.  In 2020, DIRT will be down to 33%, so the gap will get bigger because exit tax will remain at 41%.<\/p><p>There is a policy issue here which we have discussed a number of times in that the differential in the tax treatment of the return from both these products will essentially encourage consumers to put their money into bank-type savings products, on which the return at present is as close to zero as makes no difference.  We therefore need to examine the policy implications of this because we want to encourage longer-term saving, longer-term commitment to investment products and so on.  The Minister has committed to a report to try to tease out the policy implications.  Obviously, there are fiscal implications of doing anything, and I think this is why he has not done anything by way of trying to realign the rates.  I believe, however, that we need to give some attention to this in a policy context and then in future budgets to revisit the decisions that have been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200046#WW00100","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1542905700,"counter":403,"content":"<p>The report will be made available before the end of this year.

My tabling of this amendment is very much borne out of my personal experience as a Deputy dealing with queries from constituents.  When I raise and promote certain tax reliefs in newsletters and circulars that I send out, I get feedback, and it has become very apparent to me that there is a lot of underclaiming going on in that many people are simply not aware of some of the available credits.<\/p><p>For example, one of three I have cited in the amendment is the tax relief on third level fees.  It is widely misunderstood.  People think that if they are only paying the &euro;3,000, there is no tax relief.  This is true if they are only paying it in respect of one child.  If they are paying the &euro;3,000 in respect of more than one child going to college, they can claim tax relief because a single disregard of &euro;3,000 applies.  This is not widely known.  I have personally helped a number of people to work their way through this and they have benefited by way of a claim.<\/p><p>The home carer tax credit, which we discussed in the lead-up to the budget, is a similar issue.  We welcome the increase to &euro;1,500 to this credit.  Again, it is my experience that there is underclaiming of this simply because people are not aware of it.  We went through the numbers on Committee Stage as to why this may be.<\/p><p>The third example I have given in the amendment is the taxation options open to older people on the income tax side.  They can be taxed in three ways.  First, they can be taxed under the conventional system that applies to everyone else, with the application of bands and tax credits.  The second way is the income tax exemption limit - &euro;18,000 for a single person and &euro;36,000 for a couple - that applies to people aged 65 and under.  The third way is the marginal rate relief if their income is modestly above these thresholds.  Again, my experience is that people are not aware of this and it is very hard for people to try to assess for themselves which option is best for them.<\/p><p>The system should pick up these things automatically, and I think in many cases it does, but not in all.  It is my experience that these three reliefs in particular - there are other examples - are not being claimed or not being claimed properly because people are simply not aware of them or of the full eligibility criteria.  We all need to make a greater effort.  We have a role as Deputies, but Government and Revenue in particular need to play the lead role in increasing public awareness of the availability of these reliefs and how they can be claimed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200046#WW00600","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1542905700,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I understand that Revenue contacts PAYE taxpayers to remind them that there is a four-year time limit for claiming additional tax credits and reliefs.  In late 2017, Revenue issued 135,188 letters to all PAYE taxpayers who had not claimed additional credits or reliefs from 2013 to 2017, reminding them that they may be entitled to make claims on or before 31 December 2017.  An additional 291 claims were made for the home carer tax credit, 570 for the age tax credit and 746 for tuition fees.  On 1 November of this year 125,000 letters concerning this matter were issued.  The Revenue Commissioners pre-populate the annual tax returns of self-assessed taxpayers with the home carer tax credit where it was claimed in the previous year.  Revenue automatically grants the home carer tax credit and the age tax credit where it can identify eligible people whose circumstances would indicate that they would benefit from the credit or, more particularly, are eligible for it.  The Revenue Commissioners put in a lot of effort to ensure that taxpayers are aware of the reliefs and support they would be able to access.  I will encourage the Revenue Commissioners to continue this work, and for this reason I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200046#WW00700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1542905700,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.  I accept that where information is available to Revenue that leads it to conclude that a taxpayer is entitled to a credit or relief and not claiming it, it is provided automatically.  Sometimes, however, the relevant information is not available to Revenue.  It could be that there has been a change in circumstances, as is very often the case with the home carer credit, for example.  Circumstances in a home may change.  Similarly, regarding third level fees, a person may go from having one child going to college to two and people may not be aware of the change in that regard.  I do not think the Revenue systems would or could be expected to pick up on this automatically.  All these debates help to promote awareness of the availability of these tax reliefs and encourage the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister's Department to use every opportunity to highlight the availability of reliefs which may well be underclaimed - in my view, they are - and to promote them.  It is important that people are given the right and accurate information relating to themselves.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has touched on the four-year rule. I accept that Revenue is writing to certain taxpayers to remind them that the ability to claim for reliefs dating back more than four years will fall off if they do not submit returns by the end of the year.  This needs to continue because, again, people's awareness of this is quite limited.

I gave a commitment to Deputy Michael McGrath that my Department and I would work with him on his proposed draft Bill to find a way in which the policy objectives of the Bill could be delivered.  On Committee Stage, a significant amount of discussion took place on the Bill and since that time my officials and Deputy McGrath have worked to deal with some matters that have emerged.  In addition, full agreement was not reached on whether the credit servicing regime or the retail credit servicing regime was the most appropriate.  Between my Department and the Central Bank, we have been able to resolve some matters in this regard that emerged when the legislation was examined in detail.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has made it clear that it is satisfied with the approach taken to regulating owners as credit servicing firms.  It has clearly stated that there is no material difference in the standard of regulation between retail credit firms and credit servicing firms.  The bank has also clearly stated that neither category of firm is subject to a lower standard of regulatory scrutiny than the other.  Therefore, I can state that I support all of the amendments that have been proposed by Deputy Michael McGrath.<\/p> <p> The passage of this Bill also has to be seen in the light of the recent review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which went through all of the various supports that were available to citizens who found themselves in difficulty, pointed to the fact that more than 100,000 mortgages had been restructured, and pointed out that many different options were available, with the Insolvency Service of Ireland doing a great deal of work in this area in particular.  My message continues to be that those who find themselves in difficulty have to engage.  Help is available.  As I have affirmed to Deputy Michael McGrath, it is my intention that the Bill will be commenced as soon as possible after its enactment in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200048#YY00400","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1542906900,"counter":445,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2018: Report and Final Stages [Private Members]","time":1542906900,"counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200049#ZZ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1542906900,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200049#ZZ00400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1542906900,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>In page 4, line 8, to delete &ldquo;determining&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;determination of&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>I will start with some general remarks on the amendments that I hope will accelerate the process.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute on Report Stage of this Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members' Bill.  The Bill's purpose is to ensure that loan owners who hold legal title to credit, determine the overall strategy for the management and administration of a portfolio of loan agreements or maintain control over key decisions relating to such a portfolio are authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its regulation.<\/p><p>A small number of amendments are to be dealt with, and I will outline them in advance of their individual consideration.  Two are concerned with wording changes that have been suggested by the drafter to make the Bill read better.  I am happy to propose these.  Three are concerned with wording changes to reflect the securitisation regulation.  The Central Bank has been consulted to ensure that they do not give rise to any unintended consequence.  As far as we can see, the amendments will work to allow completely passive securitisation vehicles to continue operating without authorisation, since all activities will be undertaken by regulated credit servicing firms.  It was always the intention to exclude passive securitisation.  These amendments will not allow firms that undertake any of the newly regulated activities to structure themselves in such a way as to avoid regulation.  If they are undertaking any of the newly regulated activities, they will need authorisation.  Generally speaking, the activities will continue to be undertaken by the original lender.<\/p><p>The other amendments are aimed at addressing a concern of the Central Bank that was notified to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  The issue is that an owner transitionally authorised by making an application to the Central Bank within three months of the commencement of the legislation would be answerable to the Central Bank for the activities of its credit servicing firm.  The credit servicing firm in this case would no longer need to be regulated in its own right.  Without the amendments proposed, this may be prior to the transitionally authorised owner having a full presence in Ireland that can be pursued by the Central Bank for any breach.  The amendments will mean that the transitional authorisation only applies to the newly regulated activities and only for as long as the other activities are undertaken by a regulated credit servicing firm.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are drafting amendments aimed at ensuring consistency in the structure of the list of activities of credit servicing firms.<\/p><p>Before allowing other Members to speak on these amendments, it is important that I put the Bill in context.  From our party's point of view, there has been an obvious gap in legislation for a number of years in that we have witnessed banks increasingly selling on loan portfolios to so-called vulture funds that have been unregulated in the Irish market up until now.  The credit servicing firm, which is the intermediary or middle man, is fully regulated by the Central Bank.  However, it is essentially acting as a conduit, passing messages backwards and forwards, with all of the important decisions concerning the future of the mortgage, changing the interest rate, entering into a restructuring arrangement and taking enforcement proceedings made by the unregulated loan owner or vulture fund.  The same applies in respect of a growing number of SME or business loans, and farmers throughout the country are finding that their loans, taken out in good faith from retail banks, are being sold on to these vulture funds.<\/p><p>It is important that the Central Bank, as the regulator, has the statutory power to have direct contact with these vulture funds, inspect them, turn up at their offices, investigate them if necessary and take enforcement action against them if so required.  It has been evident to us for some time that these funds are making all of the important decisions.  They are sitting at the top of the pyramid, as such.  People find it incredibly difficult to deal with them because people are only allowed to deal with the intermediary, that being, the credit servicing agent.  They are not allowed to look the person in the vulture fund in the eye.  They are not allowed to sit down face to face and have direct engagement to see if there is a way of restructuring the loan, thereby preventing it from going down the adversarial legal enforcement route.  Bringing these funds fully within the ambit of the regulatory environment will facilitate direct contact between them and borrowers, which is critical.<\/p><p>I look forward to discussing the amendments and, I hope, dealing with them in an efficient way.  We look forward to agreement from across the House on the amendments and the provisions of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200049#ZZ00500","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1542906900,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and commend Deputy Michael McGrath.  Vulture funds are a nightmare for many people.  Those of us who have been representing people in mortgage difficulties have been going to middle men, with the issue then having to go on to the people who bought out the loans.  In the past week, a report that the Government had mentioned claimed that the loans' owners had ticked all the boxes.  They had.  Asset Services, formerly with Capita, would ring or send the mortgage holder a letter and that person would then go back and forth and make proposals.  At the end of the day, though, and while all of the boxes were ticked, the people who bought out the loans still called the shots.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath might clarify something that he mentioned.  He stated that people would have direct contact with the person who owned the loan.  Does that mean that the likes of Promontory will have to meet face to face the person who owes the debt?  There is only one problem with that.  There is a medicine, I will call it, whereby people earning under a certain threshold are eligible for the mortgage-to-rent scheme, but people in middle Ireland who are struggling do not qualify for it even though they tick all of the other boxes.  Where farmers and SMEs are concerned, their loans' owners are inclined to try to drive in the boot.  Someone who earns over &euro;25,000 and owns a house, even if it is a family home, does not qualify for the mortgage-to-rent scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister needs to be aware of some worrying issues that are coming down the line.  Even where people are eligible for the mortgage-to-rent scheme, councils in some parts of the country have sent letters to the Housing Agency claiming that their houses are too rural.  That is an indictment of those councils.  Some cases have been sorted now.<\/p><p>I ask that the Department would send an instruction to local authorities to the effect that if people are eligible for the mortgage-to-rent scheme, they are eligible regardless of whether the property is up a boreen or in the middle of a town or city.<br\/><br\/>I welcome what Deputy Michael McGrath has done with this legislation and ask him to clarify the position on the issue I raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200049#ZZ00600","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542907500,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and commend Deputy Michael McGrath on bringing it to this stage.  We had a very worthwhile debate on Committee Stage about all of the issues pertaining to the regulation of vulture funds.  The provisions of the Bill will only take effect from the date of enactment but we must recognise the fact that a considerable number of loans have already been transferred to vulture funds.  The vulture funds have refused to meet the individuals and businesses concerned to reach a settlement on their loans and they continue to avoid transparency vis-&agrave;-vis the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  The funds will not come before committees of this House.  They are barely replying to invitations to come before the finance committee to discuss their intentions in this country and the negative impact they are having on Irish society.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to see as part of the expectation of Government with regard to these vulture funds that they would come here and explain their case and set out their plans for these loans for the coming years.  To date, all of the evidence suggests that vulture funds have no interest in settlements.  They refuse to talk about settlements or to engage with their customers.  They pay scant regard to any protocol that is in place in terms of facilitating customers who are trying to renegotiate or settle.  The banks have to be held to account because of the fact that they have encouraged customers with distressed mortgages or loans to restructure them.  In most of those cases, one will find a clause in the contract saying that the restructuring will be reviewed in three or six months.  Within the three or six month period, the banks then offload those loans to vulture funds, and once they do that, the funds can do what they like with loan.  Once the grace period of three or six months expires, the vulture funds can introduce new interest rates, new conditions and so on and they do not seem to care.  There is nothing to regulate them.  If this Bill regulates the vulture funds to the extent that the banks are regulated, it will represent a very positive step forward.  If we can bring the vulture funds before the committees of this House, as we should be able to do, that will also be a step forward, as will be getting them to agree to engage with their customers, current and future.<\/p>  <p>  In reality, we should stop the transfer of distressed loans to vulture funds.  We should insist that the banks take each individual case and work out a solution for that business, individual or family.  The European Central Bank, Mr. Mario Draghi, and the Central Bank in Ireland have all said that they are not forcing the banks here to sell loans to vulture funds.  Indeed, Mr. Draghi said that this is a social policy issue.  He said that we should address the consequences of distressed mortgages with some form of social policy.  Organisations such as David Hall's iCare should be supported by the Government.  The banks have given a sample portfolio of loans to Mr. Hall's organisation and he has proved that those who are caught in the middle, that is, those who are earning too much to qualify for local authority housing, can be put on a sustainable mortgage or a differential rent to allow them to stay in their home.  That should be pursued by Government.  There should be a social element to the policy of restructuring mortgages and keeping people in their homes.  If the Government was to pursue that policy, it would not have to regulate the vulture funds to the extent envisaged in this Bill.  The European Union would prefer that vulture funds were not regulated because they are essential in a market that finds itself in the type of distress and collapse that the Irish market experienced.<\/p>  <p>  There is a fundamental contradiction here and I am happy that the Government is supporting Deputy McGrath's Bill and has a timeframe for its implementation.  However, I would encourage the Government to go further with this and to introduce its own legislation if necessary.  I introduced the Affordable Housing and Fair Mortgage Bill previously, elements of which could be implemented by Government.  I encourage the Department to look at that Bill again to see if we can prevent the sale of distressed mortgages to vulture funds.  We should provide for the sale of such loans to voluntary housing agencies or housing co-operatives that could restructure them and possibly put people on a differential rent.<\/p>  <p>  The main problem with all of this is the fact that the current crop of young bankers are seeing a very sharp side to banking through these vulture funds.  The funds have no desire to comply with the rules and their aim is to make money at all costs.  We will have the job of re-educating bankers in the new lending culture that will be necessary in banks in the future.  We have already had a report on that.<\/p>  <p>  I encourage the Minister to look at this issue in the round.  He should accept this legislation, pass it and then go back to the Department and work out what will be done for the future.  AIB is lining up, as is Permanent TSB and no doubt Bank of Ireland and others will follow.  There are many thousands of people who are in mortgage distress and we could do so much for them.  I have often seen cases in court of families defending themselves, trying to keep a roof over their heads.  They are up against a plethora of bankers, solicitors and barristers.  We are damaging families and damaging the family unit, with children watching their parents trying to fight for their family home with no support from anyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200050#AAA00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1542907500,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Michael McGrath on the Bill and thank the Government for taking it on board and ensuring that it will become law without delay.  The current situation is that our banking sector has been repaired to a large extent and the real issue now is dealing with the fallout from previous times in the form of distressed loans.  We must bear in mind that when we talk about distressed loans we are also talking about stressed families and individuals.  We are talking about people who see no hope.  The idea that we would just cut them adrift and leave them to the mercy of unregulated vulture funds beggars belief.  I was always very concerned when I saw the large-scale sale of loans to these funds because they were unregulated, meaning that we were unable to guarantee that they would at least comply with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That in itself put enormous pressure on individuals.<\/p>  <p>  It is hard to explain to an individual why his or her loan can be sold for a knock-down price to a vulture fund but the same individual cannot engage with the lender directly to restructure the loan and write off a certain amount.  What we have effectively done is allowed vulture funds to profiteer on both the individual and the collective.  Vulture funds are just a quick fix solution.  The banks have impaired balance sheets and do not want to have to retain certain ratios of capital for bad loans.  They want to move such loans off their balance sheets as quickly as possible and that is what is going on.  The notion that the banks will trawl through the files and assess every individual loan case by case is fanciful.  The banks put large swathes of loans into a single book and then sell it off.  That is a major issue which must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  When Mr. Mario Draghi appeared before the finance committee he said quite clearly that we are operating in a quasi-monopoly situation here when it comes to banking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200050#AAA00300","speaker":"1229"}]
