Members and all in attendance are required to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Today is the first meeting in a long time where people can physically come into room as well as ourselves.  Members are required to practice good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and other attendees.  They should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for full co-operation in this matter.<\/p> <p>  Any member participating in the meeting remotely is required to participate from within the Leinster House complex only. <\/p> <p>  Today the committee will give consideration to the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  To assist us in considering these matters I am pleased to welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, who is participating in the meeting online.  Members will recall that the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs gave comprehensive consideration to this trade agreement earlier this year and engaged with a wide range of witnesses, including the Minister.  The committee published its report on the matter last week and laid it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, given that this committee's remit specifically relates to the affairs of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we decided it would be appropriate for us to engage directly with the Minister on this matter. <\/p> <p>   I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  This means that witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if statements of witnesses are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, I will direct them to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. <\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, the Minister's opening statement has not been received by the committee, and on behalf of the committee, I express our disappointment that we have not received it.  We have raised that with departmental officials and Ministers of State in the past when we have not received opening statements.  It is important that members get the opening statement before the meeting starts so that they can address it and contribute as best they can.  I call the Minister to make his opening contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

As the committee will be aware, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs debated CETA over several hearings and published its report last Wednesday.  I hope we are moving closer to a time when we can take a vote of ratification.  Ratifying CETA is Government policy and an objective of mine as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  While I welcome the scrutiny, I do not want ratification delayed and drifting indefinitely, and for Ireland to have to stand by and watch other EU member states ratify it ahead of us, as the majority have.  That would send out the wrong message to the world - one of a waning commitment to trade and free enterprise in Ireland which would have negative consequences for investment and employment.  Ireland should be a leader in Europe and a first mover when it comes to free trade. <\/p> <p>  As a country, we owe our relative prosperity to the goods and services produced by our people and our land, which we sell around the world.  This formula that has worked well.  It is based on international trade, our attractiveness as a place to invest and our ability to enter into international free trade agreements with other countries.  Our position at the heart of Europe, its single market and the eurozone is also crucial to this.  This economic model has consistently raised our living standards through the decades and created hundreds of thousands of jobs for our citizens.  We will depend on that for our pandemic recovery. <\/p> <p>  Since the provisional application of CETA in 2017, the benefits have been plain to see.  Goods exports to Canada increased from &euro;953 million in 2016 to more than &euro;1.7 billion in 2020.  That is an increase of 78% in a little over five years.  Services exports grew from &euro;1.6 billion in 2016 to more than &euro;2.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 44%.  This benefits all Irish jobs, businesses and tax revenues, which we use to fund our public services and public infrastructure.  The elimination of tariffs, reduced trade barriers and simplified customs procedures and the more compatible technical requirements that flow from CETA make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to trade with Canada.<\/p> <p>  In April this year, my Department released the results of an independent study by Copenhagen Economics of the potential economic opportunities for Ireland of the EU free trade agreements, FTAs, with Canada, South Korea, Mexico and Japan.  It found that these four Union FTAs are forecast to have a positive effect on trade, GDP and national income for Ireland.  The deal with Japan benefits us the most of course, due to the size of that country which has approximately 120 million people relative to Canada&rsquo;s 38 million.  An important finding in the study is that real wages would increase by up to 4.4% in 2030 as a result of the trade agreements, with the largest increases for low-income workers.  This demolishes the idea that well-designed free trade agreements exert downward pressure on wages and labour standards when, in fact we know the reverse is true.  As members will be aware, the full coming into force of CETA, once ratified by all member states, will result in the implementation of the investment chapter of the agreement, including provisions for the resolution of disputes between investors and states should they arise.  This has been the area of most controversy. <\/p> <p>  All international agreements have dispute resolution arrangements; they need to.  Where such agreements cover, not only trade in both goods and services but also investment rules and protections, there must be some form of dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments.  The EU&rsquo;s new approach to investment protection is the investment court system, ICS, which is contained in CETA and replaces the original investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism.  It is important to point out that this is something that we, as the EU, looked for in negotiations and wanted included; it is not something being imposed on us by anybody else.<\/p><p>On the ICS, I emphasise the rights of governments to regulate in the public interest are paramount and I believe they are fully protected under the terms of this agreement and the accompanying joint interpretative instrument.  Investors may utilise national courts or the ICS but cannot use both to forum shop.  Equally, it is important to remember that a Canadian firm can already sue the Government for alleged unfair treatment or discrimination in our courts whether CETA exists or not.  In the courts today, we see plenty of examples of companies suing the government and its agencies or the government and its agencies suing private companies. The same will apply to Irish companies that operate in Canada and it works very much in both directions.  What CETA simply provides for is an arbitration alternative to using national courts.  However, that alternative, unlike a challenge in the courts, cannot find any act of a government to be <i>ultra vires<\/i>or unconstitutional.  It is concerned only with redress or compensation if harm and discrimination is proven.<br\/><br\/>In Ireland, were we not to ratify CETA and instead sought to allow provisional application to continue on an indefinite basis, this would bring substantial legal uncertainty for businesses around tariffs and market access, as well as customs and conformity requirements.  It is also the case that indefinite provisional application is unprecedented and would be open to legal challenge; just leaving things as they are is not a viable solution.  There would be no quantitative benefit to Irish businesses or the economy overall in rejecting the agreement.<br\/><br\/>Regarding potential costs, it would be an entirely hypothetical exercise to try to estimate what, if any, costs could arise for the Exchequer on foot of any judgement under the ICS or to say what type of discrimination would be substantiated against the State.  I would argue the State is not going to discriminate against any Canadian companies.  It is also not possible to anticipate the sector of the economy or the size of the company which may pursue such a claim, but the Irish State has a strong reputation for rule of law and has no record of treating inward investors unfairly, inequitably or in a discriminatory manner, which are the criteria under which an award could be made.  In contrast, we are usually accused of the opposite.  Hence, the State&rsquo;s exposure to economic loss cannot be regarded as materially affected by the introduction of the ICS mechanism provided for within CETA.  This is particularly so given the existing recourse that inward investors from any jurisdiction have to the domestic courts.<br\/><br\/>In light of the experience and track record of the Government in supporting foreign investment in Ireland, the risk or likelihood of an award being made against the State could be considered negligible.  On that basis, the protections offered by CETA to Irish investors in Ireland would far outweigh any potential exposure to the State under the agreement.  The day-to-day administrative costs of the ICS tribunal, including the retainer fees of the fifteen members, will place no charge on the Exchequer and will be covered by the budgets of the European Commission and the Canadian Government.  Therefore, there are no costs directly arising from CETA.  Under the ICS, a state can never be forced to change its legislation, only to pay fair compensation in cases where an investor is deemed to have been treated unfairly under the specific grounds detailed.  An investor cannot be given compensation just because it has lost profits or suffered economic loss or costs; it is for the investor to prove it was discriminated against and to establish that it incurred losses as a consequence of that discrimination.<br\/><br\/>CETA preserves the right of each member state to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, the environment or consumer protection, meaning policies such as those relating to plain packaging on cigarettes, for example, or minimum alcohol pricing can, and will, continue to be introduced.  These &quot;right to regulate&quot; provisions are specifically designed to avoid any danger of so-called &ldquo;regulatory chill&rdquo;.  As part of the finalisation of the agreement, the EU and Canada also agreed a legally binding joint interpretative instrument that was added to CETA to provide further assurances in relation to public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.  CETA does not restrict either the EU or Canada from passing new laws in areas of public interest, such as the environment and health and safety, nor does it affect the Government's scope for developing new laws in response to the needs and priorities of Irish citizens.  Importantly, within CETA, both sides agree that more trade and investment should not be at the expense of environmental protection and labour rights.  The EU and Canada will not seek competitive advantage through lowering of standards in any domain.  On the contrary, the EU and Canada are committed to ensuring CETA helps confirm that economic growth, social development and environmental protection can go hand in hand as far as is practicable.<br\/><br\/>As a small, open economy, Ireland has benefited from our export-oriented enterprises trading across the globe and, therefore, we support international trade and the EU FTAs that seek to underpin this.  Ireland has been, and is, an attractive destination for foreign direct investment, FDI, for many decades, and participating in EU third-country agreements that cover investment and provide investment protection continue to assist us in marketing Ireland as a competitive FDI-friendly jurisdiction for multinational enterprise to invest in, with the attendant jobs and prosperity that entails.  On that basis, and given that there can be no doubt that CETA is a high-standard agreement, I believe that ratifying the agreement, albeit at this late stage, would send a positive message to our trading partners around the world, and to our ally, Canada, that Ireland continues to be committed to the values of open and fair global trade.  <br\/><br\/>I again thank the committee for taking the time to consider the agreement in detail.  I hope this process can help us to move towards ratification soon.  Again, my apologies for not being able to send the committee this statement in advance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#A00700","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Canadian Government has also been sued multiple times by Eli Lilly and Company and in other instances.<\/p> <p>  A special court for corporations will act as a major deterrent for Government in passing laws that might benefit citizens but may not benefit corporations.

It is important that colleagues look at the hard facts of this agreement rather than creating a straw man, which might have had some validity in earlier agreements.  It is also important to bear in mind we are a country that exports 130% of our GDP and we are one of the most open economies in the world.  We have welcomed foreign investment, including Canadian investment, on the basis of respect for the sort of principles underpinning this investor protection agreement, such as no discrimination, everyone being treated fairly and so on.<\/p><p>I was on the trade council and I will ask the Minister to confirm some of the memories I have of these issues.  In drawing up this agreement, we bent over backwards to ensure the State's right and the citizen's right to expect government could regulate their interests in every way was protected.  First, am I correct that the grounds on which a claim can be taken are restricted?  They have to do with a denial of justice, a breach of fundamental due process or targeted discrimination against the company.  Second, am I also correct that explicit provision was made whereby there could be no obligation to privatise, no restriction on a government bringing back into public ownership some service and no interference with the state's right to regulate?  Frameworks that might impact on the profit of a company can be changed and states are perfectly entitled to do that.  In addition, am I correct that there was a decisive move away from the previous <i>ad hoc<\/i>, closed system, to an open system with a panel of experienced judges from both sides to ensure this process was fair and open and an appeal mechanism was put in place?<\/p><p>While I understand why people have concerns about chilling effects on the State based on past experience, the facts of this agreement are particularly protective.  As the Minister said, it was part of the new, progressive generation of trade agreements that recognised the need for a new settlement with globalisation.  That is clear.  We are shifting expectations of companies, rightly so, but this agreement protects the State's rights.<\/p><p>Does the Minister agree that protectionism is alive and well?  Often, it is not at national level; it can be at individual state level.  It is important that Irish companies are able to trade in a large country such as Canada and not find that rules in one province, or one part of the federation, are treating it unfairly.  There are benefits for Ireland in having this sort of access for our companies, which cannot afford expensive court procedures in several different jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#E00800","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution.

These are all public policy matters and are not trammelled in any way by the treaty.<\/p><p>On the grounds for making a claim, I will again point out companies can already make claims against states.  That is nothing new.  However, the grounds set out in CETA are the standard for &quot;fair and equitable&quot; treatment.  It is:<\/p> <blockquote> \ta clear, closed text which defines precisely the standard of treatment, without leaving ... discretion to the Members of the Tribunal ...<br \/><br \/>Thus, a breach of the fair and equitable treatment ... can only arise when there is<br \/><br \/>(a) denial of justice in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings; (b) fundamental breach of due process, including a fundamental breach of transparency, in judicial and administrative proceedings; (c) manifest arbitrariness; (d) targeted discrimination on manifestly wrongful grounds, such as gender, race or religious belief; (e) abusive treatment of investors, such as coercion, duress and harassment; or (f) a breach of any further elements of the fair and equitable treatment obligation adopted by the Parties <\/blockquote> <p>These are the grounds on which an Irish company could take action against a Canadian authority or<i>vice versa.<\/i>They are strong protections and it is legitimate that if an Irish company was treated in that way, it should have recourse to the courts.  Again, it is already the case that companies can sue states.  There is nothing new about that.  What is different in this agreement is that there is an international panel as an alternative to the national courts system.  That is to the advantage of Irish companies, rather than dealing with nine or ten provinces with different legal systems.  The reverse happens for Canadian companies in Europe that have to deal with 27 different legal systems.  They have the certainty of one system that is much easier to manage. <\/p><p>I agree with what the Deputy said about protectionism.  It is alive and well and, if anything, is making a comeback, not just in Ireland but around the world.  That worries me because there is no doubt Ireland will be a net loser if we start rowing back on free trade and see the rise of protectionism again.

The protections that exist do so for all businesses.  They exist for Irish firms operating in Canada and particularly for small firms that do not have the resources and big legal departments that the big companies have.  They gain these protections as well.  It is a two-way street, as trade always is.  Irish firms will benefit and get the protections they need if they are mistreated or discriminated against.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Paris climate accords, any analysis of these trade agreements would indicate that the impact on the environment is not large in either direction.  What we need to do in terms of meeting our commitments under the Paris Agreement is what we do ourselves.  Of course, all trade involves a degree of transport and there are emissions from that.  What we need to do, however, we need to do ourselves, whether it is around decarbonising our energy systems or all the things we need to do.

I will arrange for that RIA to be circulated to committee members.<\/p> <p>  In summary, as I set out in my opening statement, since the provisional application of CETA in 2017, the benefits have been plain to see, with goods exports increasing from &euro;953 million to &euro;1.7 billion and service exports increasing from &euro;1.6 billion to &euro;2.3 billion.  In April this year, we released the Copenhagen Economics report on the potential economic opportunities of the four FTAs and their forecast to have a positive effect on trade, GDP, national income for Ireland, wages and consumer prices.<\/p> <p>  With regard to potential litigation costs, which the Deputy mentioned, what we are discussing here is the ICS under CETA.  I reiterate that a Canadian firm can already sue the Government for alleged unfair treatment or discrimination in our courts.  This would be the case whether CETA existed or not.  What CETA simply provides for is an alternative to the national courts, which is an arbitration mechanism.<\/p> <p>  Regarding potential costs, it would be a hypothetical exercise to estimate what costs, if any, would arise for the Exchequer on foot of a judgment under the ICS or to say what type of discrimination would be substantiated against the State.  Equally, it is not possible to anticipate the sector of the economy or the size of the company that may pursue such a claim.  As I highlighted previously, however, the State has a strong reputation for observing the rule of law and we have no record of treating inward investors unfairly or in a discriminatory manner.  If anything, we are accused of the opposite.  I find it hard to see, therefore, how a Canadian company would use the ICS system successfully to gain compensation from Ireland.

The argument for an alternative is weak, other than on grounds of efficiency.  The other important point to make is that we can be in favour of a trade deal but not in favour of this specific element of the alternative dispute resolution system.

The first relates to the ratification process.  The Minister said that most member states have ratified the deal.  According to my latest count, 13 member states have yet to ratify it.  There is a certain irony there because the Government has dragged its heels when transposing some EU directives in the past but there is an eagerness on the part of this Government to try to ratify this trade deal.

Most other member states, 15 of the 27, which are member states further along than we are, for example, France and the Netherlands, have ratified it by their lower house as I mentioned earlier.  Since I have been the Minister, there have been no discussions whatsoever at European Council level around a plan B or what we would do if it is not ratified.

Is Ireland adopting the position that the ICS will be the preferred mechanism in future trade agreements to discuss how countries use arbitration rather than country to country as was used previously?<\/p> <p>  It was said that rules were designed to ensure access by SMEs to the tribunal but they appear to be absent, although there is a commitment by the Commission and the Council to ensure such access is provided.  Have there been further assurances about this access for SMEs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#H00500","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>The question asked by the Deputy at the outset on the breach of competition law is valid, but it is also hypothetical.  I imagine that the way it would work is that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, which is Ireland's competition authority, would conclude that there was a breach of competition law.  If that breach of competition law harmed a Canadian company, I do not see how they would sue the State because it would be the State that had found competition law had been breached.  If for some reason a State body did not follow its procedures and failed to find that there was a competition breach when there was one, if for example an Irish company was acting in breach of competition law and the competition authority did nothing about that, then the Canadian company could take the case.  For this to happen it would have to be an Government agency acting illegally and discriminating against a Canadian company over a European one.  I just do not think that would arise.  We do not have a tradition in Ireland of discriminating against international investors.  I do not believe that anyone would argue that we do.<\/p> <p>  The ICS could well be a prototype for future trade agreements.  It does not exist in some trade agreements and it does in others.  I believe it is in the Mexico agreement but not in EU-Mercosur, for example.  It is potentially a prototype for future agreements and particularly if we are coming to trade agreements with China in the future or other economic powers.  It is something we would favour as a European Union because it creates that alternative to the national courts that maybe would not have the same degree of confidence.<\/p> <p>  On SME access, part of the reason for this system is to assist SMEs.  SMEs do not have big funds or big legal departments.  It is hard for them to navigate different national court systems, different provinces in Canada and different member states.  Having a single mechanism as an alternative to national courts would be to their advantage if they are being mistreated or discriminated against.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#H00600","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Again, the case would have to be upheld.  It would have to be true that the Government or a Government agency discriminated against and treated a Canadian company unfairly.  It is already the case in the national courts that such a case could be taken and there could be damages, and I believe punitive damages as well as compensation.  The answer to the Deputy's question is &quot;Yes&quot; but I will read a note into the record from my officials that might answer the question better than I did:<\/p> <blockquote> \tCETA introduces a precise and specific standard of fair and equitable treatment of investors and investment.  An investor may only have recourse to the ICS in very specific limited grounds such as in the case of a denial of justice, a fundamental breach of due process or targeted discrimination, for example, on the grounds of race, religious belief or gender.  None of these measures give the Government any concern that we would be subject to ICS proceedings.  Investors must prove that they have been discriminated against or treated unfairly as described.  They must also prove that they have suffered economic harm or loss.  CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives and it is made clear that the agreement does not imply an expectation that public bodies will remain unchanged.  An investor cannot be given compensation solely because he or she has lost profits or suffered economic loss or costs and there is no provision for the awarding of punitive damages.  [I am happy to clarify that.]  As such, regulation for the protection of public health, the environment, or consumer protection, for example, measures relating to plain packaging on cigarettes and minimum alcohol pricing, can continue to be introduced and it is also noted in the CETA that governments can change their laws including in a way that affects investors' expectations of profits.  That would not be a breach of investor protection standards.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#H00800","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#H00900","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>That concludes the first round of questions.

It is a false argument that some people are making, perhaps not the Senator, that this would open up the possibility of litigation, when that litigation happens regularly using national court systems and international arbitration mechanisms.  This is just a new avenue.  It is a more efficient system that will be beneficial to Irish companies operating in Canada.  That is why we think it is to the benefit of people.<\/p> <p>  I can understand why people may be against this treaty, and that is fair enough.  They are going to vote against it no matter when the vote is held, be it this year or two years hence.  What I do not understand is the argument that somehow we should wait to ratify it last or wait until we are among the last two or three countries to ratify it.  If one is for it, fair enough and if one is against it, fair enough.  However, I do not understand the argument that it is somehow beneficial to drag this out or to wait until we are the last, second last or third last country to ratify it.

Is there anybody on this call who is going to change his or her mind just because we are the last or second last country to do it?

Were the terms of CETA to be approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, a separate decision of the Government would then be required authorising the notification of the completion of Ireland's domestic procedure concerning the ratification of CETA to the Secretariat-General of the Council.

As it stands, Canadian companies can sue the Government in the national courts, as can citizens, etc.  However, these proposals allow for separate systems, the likes of which we have not signed up to previously.  We have not signed up to anything like this proposed system.  In that respect, therefore, the Minister will have to accept that this is something of a new departure.  It is not the same process as the national courts because it is not open to everybody.  It is only open to these large multinationals and corporations.  It is a special corporate court and it is not open to citizens.<\/p> <p>  It is different to anything that exists now, or am I picking this up wrong?  Can the Minister give us an example of something that is the same as the ICS?  I ask because this is the aspect that people are concerned about.  I am not going to tell him what to do, but I would not infer that people are somehow not capable of understanding this aspect.  I think people understand it and they are not glibly writing emails to their elected representatives.  People have engaged with the issue and, where they have a concern, they raise it.  They are perfectly entitled to do that.  I would not dismiss that, and I encourage the Minister not to do so either.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the specifics of the ICS, where and what are we now signed up to that is the same as this proposal?  When people say that this is a new departure, that is, effectively, the case because this would be a new space for us to go into.  We can argue the merits and demerits of doing that, but we must first accept that what we would enter into would be a new space.  It is a separate and parallel process.  It is not the same as our national courts, because, as was said, the national courts can act in the public interest.  The ICS is not the same.  It is an additional system that is available only to corporations.  We are not signed up to anything that is the same as this proposed system.  However, if there is, then I would like the Minister to tell us what it is so that we can go and engage with it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#L02600","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  People are capable of understanding the issues, but, unfortunately, sometimes they are misled.  Some people genuinely believe that ratifying CETA will mean that for the first time it will be possible for Canadian companies to sue the State.  That is not true.  Many things have been put out there that are not true.  People are being told that it will be possible to sue for loss of profits.  Again, that is not true.  Unfortunately, therefore, some people at least are being misled regarding what CETA is all about.  Frankly, that is wrong and shame on those who would engage in misleading the public in any form.  This is an additional system, as the Deputy described it.  I agree with that description of it as an additional system.  However, it is not new or unprecedented to have international panels and transnational courts.  The ICS will only look at the terms of CETA and it cannot challenge domestic law, which must be taken by the ICS tribunal as a fact.  Perhaps that answers the question previously asked by Deputy Murphy.  The ICS is only there to adjudicate on CETA and the system cannot be used to challenge a domestic law.  That must be accepted by the ICS tribunal as a fact and it can only look at whether the terms of CETA have been breached.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the broader issue, international trade agreements are not part of domestic law and that is why separate adjudication arrangements are required where disputes may arise in such contexts.  All international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements.  Moreover, where such agreements cover investment rules and protections, there must be a dispute resolution mechanism to cover investments.  An example would be an ISDS mechanism, which was the original plan under CETA.  Irish companies investing in Canada have only one legal system and one constitutional framework to navigate should they believe that they have been discriminated against.  In contrast, Canadian companies investing in Europe are faced with 27 legal systems and constitutions to navigate.  ISDS systems have existed since the 1950s and they enable overseas investors to resolve disputes with the government of the country where the investment is made through binding international arbitration.  ISDS mechanisms have been included in more than 2,000 investment treaties to date.  The mechanism proved controversial in recent times, and it is now regarded as outdated by the European Commission.<\/p> <p>  The Government considered the fact that the European Commission was to seek to address the concerns raised by NGOs and others regarding the ISDS system in the context of the Commission trying to develop a new replacement mechanism - the ICS - to address concerns regarding transparency and the legitimacy of the public interest.  Therefore, what is worth pointing out here is that the original mechanism proposed was an ISDS system.  We have loads of those already.  The concept is part of 2,000 investment treaties.  We are not party to all of them, but we are party to some of them.  The investment court system is designed to be an improvement on the ISDS system and to be more transparent, more legitimate and more in the public interest.  Other people, who objected to CETA earlier, did not like the ISDS system.  We have tried to respond to those concerns by coming up with a better system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#L02700","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Designed to be responsive to whom is what we must be clear about.

As you noted, Chair, joining me today are council members Ms Dawn Holland, Professor Michael McMahon, Dr. Adele Bergin, and Mr. Alessandro Giustiniani as well as our chief economist and head of secretariat, Dr. Eddie Casey.  We value our engagements with the Oireachtas and see this as a very important part of our work.  The council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to assess and endorse the official macroeconomic forecasts, assess budgetary projections, compliance with the fiscal rules and to assess the fiscal stance.  Its focus is on the overall fiscal stance, rather than on individual tax measures or spending items.<\/p> <p>  Last week, the council published its pre-budget 2022 statement as an input into the upcoming budget.  The economy is recovering quickly from the pandemic as vaccinations progress and as individuals adapt to new circumstances.  Upside risks to the official projections for the economy include the potential unwinding of large household savings and boost from the Government&rsquo;s planned budgetary expansion.  However, jobs are likely to recover more slowly than spending and the long-term scarring effects on activity from the pandemic remain uncertain.  Over the longer term, it is likely that Ireland&rsquo;s ageing population would tend to slow growth, with productivity growth also likely to moderate as it converges on norms for more mature economies.<\/p> <p>  The council welcomes the July summer economic statement, SES, as a significant step in the Government publishing a medium-term budgetary plan to 2025.  This is something that was promised in the programme for Government.  The SES includes more realistic spending forecasts for maintaining the existing level of services.  This basically allows for pressures from rising prices and changing demographics that were not fully accounted for in past forecasts.  The change in approach addresses a long-standing weakness in budgetary projections that the council had been concerned about.  The SES also sets out a new spending rule and a debt objective.  These approaches are also welcome and partly address recommendations made by the council in the past.<\/p> <p>  While the progress made in the SES was welcome, there were three key areas for concern.  First, there has been a significant shift in policy for the medium term, leading to higher risk.  While a sizeable fiscal response to Covid-19 was warranted, the sustained deficits now planned for future years would prevent the debt ratio from falling steadily to safer levels.  The Government&rsquo;s own projections imply a deficit of close to 3% of GNI* in 2025, while the council&rsquo;s more positive view of the recovery would suggest something close to 1.5% if the Government sticks to its spending plans.  Running significant budget deficits for several years during a period of strong growth and with high public debt carries risks.<\/p> <p>  Even allowing for low interest rates into the future, the council estimates a one-in-four risk that the Government&rsquo;s debt ratio could end up on an unsustainable path.  Ireland&rsquo;s deficit and net debt ratio could still be among the highest in the OECD by 2025, which increases the risks of higher borrowing costs if Ireland is viewed as an outlier, particularly as a relatively small, open economy.  This leaves the public finances more exposed to shocks, particularly from unexpected falls in growth.  It also reduces the likelihood that the Government could respond to future crises or future downturns by supporting the economy in the same way it did during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  Second, key details of the fiscal plan are still lacking.  The planned increase in public investment will see Ireland&rsquo;s public investment peak at around 6% of national income in the coming years.  There is a good case for higher spending in areas such as health, climate change, and housing, particularly as interest rates are so low.  Yet the speed and timing of the ramp-up of investments, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s weak track record with public investment management, means that capacity constraints might lead to higher costs.  To assess the risks, more information is needed on the Government&rsquo;s investment plans and the underlying economic assumptions, particularly in relation to the new national development plan, the climate action plan, implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and around Housing for All.  The Government should plan eventually to bring investment down to more normal levels.<\/p> <p>  Third, the new spending rule and debt objective need more work if they are to be useful.  The spending rule is intended to constrain permanent voted spending to grow at the same rate as potential output, assumed by the Government to be around 5%.  The council has recommended a spending rule for several years to ensure that spending grows in line with the Government&rsquo;s ability to pay.  However, applying the rule now, when sharp permanent spending increases already took place in the last budget, means that the rule is likely to lock in a high path for spending.  There are also a number of other design problems with the rule.  It is too narrow, focused only on a portion of spending and ignoring tax cuts; it should be calibrated to improve the deficit rather than to maintain it; and it should be given a statutory footing and better linked to the debt objective, which is itself rather vaguely specified.  The SES also did not explain how the budgetary plans comply with the existing EU and domestic fiscal rules.<\/p> <p>  In regard to budget 2022, the council&rsquo;s assessment is that the Government&rsquo;s &euro;4.7 billion package of measures appears to be at the limit of what is prudent.  The implied 5.5% expansion is modestly above estimates of the underlying potential growth rate of the economy but this would help to support the recovery.  The council assesses that some of the temporary and targeted income and job supports may need to continue, depending in part on the public health situation.<\/p> <p>  Looking beyond 2022, the Government should prioritise between its plans for significant expansions in public investment, fast increases in current spending and a desire to cut taxes.<\/p><p>By expanding all areas at once, the Government is effectively avoiding difficult choices and slowing the return of debt ratios to safer levels.  This reduces the scope to ensure that future downturns or crises could be cushioned by strong fiscal support in the same way as we have seen during the pandemic.  A more prudent approach would be to limit current spending to a slower pace of increase or not to implement tax plans to reduce taxes at the same time as a ramp-up in public investment is going ahead.  I thank the committee and look forward to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes and his team for the presentation.  I want to talk about tax buoyancy and the forecasts.  Mr. Barnes's opening statement and the pre-budget statement published by the council last week focused on what could be described as a robust and quick recovery of the economy as restrictions ease and normal economic activity resumes.  He said the council has developed a recovery scenario which differs from the macroeconomic projections in the SES.  He described those as not being fully updated and not consistent with the Government's fiscal plans.<\/p> <p>  The council's recovery scenario sees modified domestic demand, which we know is a better measure of economic activity than GDP, rebounding faster than the projections in the SES.  We also know that tax receipts returned to the Exchequer signalled a strong recovery with tax heads such as VAT, income tax and corporation tax coming in above profile.  What accounts for the difference between the scenario outlined by the council and that in the SES?  Is it the view of the witnesses, given the outdated projections in the SES which feed into the tax and fiscal forecasts, that tax revenue is likely to be higher and, therefore, deficits lower this year and in 2022?<\/p> <p>  In his statement Mr. Barnes outlined that the deficit will drop from a projection of about &euro;20 billion this year to in the region of &euro;15 billion.

It was a concern and disappointment to us that the SES, which is a major statement of Government policy, did not include updated macroeconomic projections.  There were some updates on the international side, but the domestic parts failed to take into account two significant developments.  The first was that the short-term news in the economy has been much more positive than it was when the special purpose entity, SPE, was set up in April.  The second is that the fiscal stance has changed very significantly.  It was a major flaw in the SES that it did not update the macroeconomic projections in what was a major statement of Government policy.<\/p> <p>  As a result of that, as the Deputy correctly noted we developed a recovery scenario because we thought that was a more realistic picture that took into account both of those things, namely a scenario where the economy recovers quite rapidly and where the long-term impact of Covid relative to the trend is relatively small because the economy has bounced back quite fast.  To us, that suggests there will not be as big a long-term impact as we feared at one time.  That is essentially good news.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the pace of recovery, the way to think about it is that this is a timing issue.  We were always relatively positive about where the economy was going to end up; it is just that the recovery has happened earlier.  That means that we see more of the recovery in 2021 and less in 2022.  We get to the same position, but earlier.  That is a good thing, but it does not change our view of the long or medium run.  It is important to view it as a timing issue.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy has noted, we have not done a very detailed analysis of the budget deficit for this year, but, as he reminded us, we think it could be around &euro;15 billion or 7% of national income, which is somewhat less than what was set out in the stability programme update, SPU.  It is still a big deficit.<\/p> <p>  Does Dr. Casey want to add anything specifically about 2022?  It obviously depends on decisions taken in the budget.

There is now anticipated to be a deficit for several years which means that the debt ratio will not move substantially toward safer levels.  The Government will essentially be putting more money into the economy than it takes out over this period.  There is a risk of overheating eventually building up or cost pressures in specific sectors.  That is the concern.<\/p> <p>  The origin of that concern is that the Government is increasing current spending in line with inflation.  It is increasing the volume of current spending, ramping up investment and planning to cut taxes.  It is trying to do everything at the same time.<\/p><p> In regard to the pressure on the public finances and the budget balance, a reduction of debt could be achieved by prioritising between those different items in the medium term.  The council does not have a mandate and does not look at those specific items.  However, if one accepts the case that the priority is to improve public services and that investment is extremely important, that raises questions about the relative importance of doing the other things.  One has to wonder whether cutting taxes should be the priority and the prudent thing to do in the context of these other ambitions that the Government has.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's second point, there is a very important distinction between current and capital investment in economic terms.  We know also that many of the needs of the economy are in terms of the capital.  Public investment was very low for a long time.  We are partly paying the price for that today.  There is an important distinction.  It is a good case to make public investment while interest rates are low.  We recognise that case and that is why we are relatively comfortable in some sense with the run-up investment that is planned.  However, it is a huge increase.  There are legitimate questions about the capacity of the economy to catch up at that speed.  Therefore, having a period of catch up clearly makes sense.<\/p><p> Investment at one point was maybe running at 2% of the national income.  It will now go to 6%.  If it only went to 4%, it would take an awfully long time for the economy to catch up.  It is okay to overshoot, but that has to be managed carefully and it raises risks.  This is a very high level of investment by historical standards in Ireland.  It is essentially the highest ever share of national income in public investment.  It is very high by international standards as well.  It is a very sharp increase.  That process has to be carefully managed, because it carries risks in terms of value for money but also in terms of macroeconomic management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty has run out of time.

There are clearly important changes afoot internationally and those may impact Ireland.  Ireland is also very reliant on a small number of companies for corporation tax.<\/p> <p>  Inflation, if the economy runs a bit hot, and internationally is  a very major question.

When thinking about the borrowing risk, my view would be that the risk is not that the borrowing is the trigger but rather that high levels of borrowing limits the ability of the economy to respond to other triggers that might arise.<\/p> <p>  I will respond to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question about the effect of an unwind of savings.  We know that saving rates have been high.  This is partly because people have become more prudent, but partly also because there has been enforced lack of spending in the economy over the last 18 months during lockdown.  The question about whether this will generate inflation depends a lot on how quickly and in which sectors people choose to spend the money.  Again, touching on Mr. Barnes&rsquo;s opening statement, one concern would be that people have built up sufficient savings and they all decide to invest, for instance, in housing.  At the same time, the Government is embarking a large expansion of its public construction projects.  That would put quite a bit of pressure on that particular sector, which is already subject to many cost pressures coming through supply chains.  These pressures are completely outside of the control of Ireland, namely, world steel prices, cement prices, etc.  That would be a scenario where the likely inflationary effects would be larger and concentrated in particular sectors.  If everybody spent their money on doing things that they did before, such as spending in the hospitality sector, there will probably be a less likely focus on inflation.  This is because there will probably still be quite a lot of spare capacity.  That is where we would currently probably see a need for any targeted support from the economy going forward.  That unwinding of savings into those sectors would limit the need for the Government to continue to provide that targeted support.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question is difficult to answer, because it depends on exactly how people choose to spend the money.  However, this is something that we are very aware of as a potential thing to keep an eye on and see how savings choose to be unwound.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McMahon.

First, as well as housing, health and education, climate is a major issue.  The investment needs that might be associated with that are potentially massive.  That is something that we do not have much of handle on at the moment.  That is where the climate action plan will be important.  However, climate will require much more deployment of funds than health and education in the times come.  This is not to say that health and education are not important.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s second point, which is important, is the various things may be driving housing, including the Government's investment plans and,as  Professor McMahon said, private savings.  One of the things that will do is that it will give a cyclical boost to the economy in the years ahead.  That will partly feed back to the Government in terms of revenue.  This would be a good thing.  However, that is not necessarily sustainable as a source of revenue, if there is to be a temporary boom in housing.  It would be nothing on the scale of what we saw in the early 2000s.  However, it is one thing that will flatter the public finances in the years ahead.  If one look at our projections for deficit, which is around 1.5% in 2025, the underlying position is much worse than that.  It is a structural deficit, at 2% or 3%.  We need, therefore, to be careful that we do not get confused by putting money into the economy, which would make public finances look better than they really are in an underlying sense.<\/p> <p>  The impact of house prices is always difficult to assess.  We have private savings acting and we also have Government policy.  One of the things we are calling for is more economic analysis around Housing for All.  While there is a lot of information about what the Government is planning to do, there is not much of an economic assessment of what it expects the outcomes to be or on how it expects it to work.  This information would be important in assessing whether that money will have a positive impact on the economy.  We need to see a much better economic assessment from the Government on what it is planning to with Housing for All.  That will helpfully tell us something about what Government thinks will happen to rents and house prices as a result of its own policies.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I apologise for omitting climate from my list.

We make regular efforts through wave and wind energy but they are related.  The wind energy will provide renewable energy for two thirds of the requirement in terms of time.  One third requires to be provided for elsewhere.  There are limited areas there.  The problem would appear to be a lack of investment in those areas in the early days.  We need investment now.

I just have one criticism to make.  I have enjoyed reading the report but we got it far too late.  Maybe they do not expect us to read anything beyond the summary but there are 70 pages in it.  I got an opportunity this morning to start reading it.  I found it really interesting.<\/p> <p>  The summary captures it.  Mr. Barnes managed to incorporate what I saw as some of the key elements into his opening statement.<\/p> <p>  There is so much in this.  I have said to the Chair previously that I like to take a non-partisan approach in the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight and assume the role of an outside onlooker who is trying to represent the best interests of all of the people.  Terribly noble and all as that sounds, I mean not to take a political approach to it.<\/p> <p>  Here we are again.  This is the fifth annual pre-budget report stating we cannot rely on corporate tax.  It is truly appalling that governments have failed to deal with this.  The first steps were taken in budget 2020.  That is very regrettable.<\/p> <p>  The rainy day fund had been suggested in 2016.  Even the worst critics of the former Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, would say he had the special savings interest account, SSIA, scheme developed to try to stop people spending and to put some of their money away so that it would not boost the economy.  There was &euro;20 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund which helped to reduce the impact of the crash, although not by much.  We have no such measures in place at present.<\/p> <p>  They mentioned human resource shortages and challenges.  I do not know if we are fully across that yet or if we fully know what the impact of material shortages will be.  It seems to be much more acute in terms of materials in some other countries and I am wondering why that is.<\/p> <p>  There is so much to respond to but I want to make one point to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.  I think IFAC could help the budgetary oversight considerably in this.  It was a suggestion made by Mr. Mark Little, the former RT&Eacute; correspondent, Washington correspondent and general bright guy.  IFAC is covered to comment on this under its role of assessing the fiscal stance.  We have, as a budgetary oversight committee, in the past number of years looked at gender-proofing budgets.  The only way to politically protect decision-making in budgets is a suggestion Mr. Little made, not for that reason but to future-proof budgets.  Ministers of the day need to be held to account for budgetary decisions they take now that will have a negative or disproportionate impact on generations coming down the track.  If that became an institutionalised requirement, it would help to head off some of these things that IFAC has pointed to.<\/p> <p>  Personally, I will be looking for spending on MetroLink and all the rest of it, and fighting for the budgets that are available.  That is the politics side of the House and I accept that.  I do not see any contradiction in it.  To be quite honest, nobody anticipated tax cuts after the year and a half we have been through.  They see the State heading for a &euro;250 billion debt.  They see the State having honoured that unwritten contract between itself and its citizens and their families and non-citizens to protect them when times get really tough.  The State stood up to that challenge and the public recognise there was a huge cost to that.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see the future-proofing of budgets.  I will return to this theme.  Every Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, every Minister for Finance and every Department head and Minister will have to ask what will be the impact of this decision on an 18-year-old, on a 25-year-old, on a 30-year-old, etc., and whether it will incur a disproportionately heavy debt burden on them on top of the climate action burden that is already on their shoulders to carry.  I am off my soapbox there but I will come back to it.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barnes does not mention Brexit.  He might comment on that.  I was very taken with his final comments about climate action that this could end up being much more costly than we anticipated.  Mr. Barnes gives some figures there and some context to it.  There are three issues I would like responses on.  What are IFAC's views on Brexit, the future-proofing of budgets and the climate action piece?  I ask Mr. Barnes to develop that theme a little more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#D00700","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lahart for those thoughtful comments, including the fact that we should send him a copy of the report as soon as we have it next time.

I will ask Dr. Adele Bergin to come in on Brexit and Professor Michael McMahon to come in on the general issues.<\/p> <p>  One point Deputy Lahart is right about is that as a medium-term strategy, the SES talks about how certain things will be dealt with, mostly the increase in public investment.  It does not talk about some other subjects which are important.  One of the neglected subjects is corporation tax.  It assumes there will be a &euro;2 billion loss, as the Government has been assuming for some time, from international tax developments but that is not developed.  There is no institutional response to that.  It is just baked into the figures.  The rainy day fund solution and the prudence account that we talked about at some point could all be good ways of dealing with that, but it is not really addressed.  There is also not much on the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is another major initiative that does not really figure much in the discussion on the SES.  Where that fits into the whole arithmetic could be better articulated.  As I have said, there is a lack of detail about many aspects, including the climate aspect that the Deputy talked about and how that fits in and whether it has been allocated.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right in terms of some of these deeper questions about the public finances.  As we have said, there is a need to prioritise between higher investment, higher current spending and taxation.  The consequence of not prioritising is taking more risk and shifting the burden onto the next generation.  In the past, we have re-emphasised how hard choices needed to be taken to meet the objective that the Government had, which was, essentially, to bring debt down at a steady pace to a more prudent level.  In fact, what has happened is those hard choices have been avoided and we have ended up taking more fiscal risk.  That was precisely the risk we warned about a year ago.<\/p> <p>  Maybe Professor McMahon will want to come in on the long-term issues.

It is not currently in our remit to discuss whether the adjustments fall more on one generation than another but when you assess the current fiscal stance, it is important to know the direction of travel.<\/p><p>When we published the first long-term sustainability report last year, what was striking as we went through the analysis, and what stood out in the report, was how if actions were deferred until they became very apparent and the glaring headlights were a couple of feet away, the actions that needed to be taken at that later point would be much larger and as, Mr. Barnes alluded to, fall on a generation of people who are 15 or 20 years down the road.  We proposed - and this applies both to the ageing population and issues such as climate, on which much more work needs to be done - it is exactly right to have that longer-term view when making these assessments.  Early actions that mitigate things can be taken and, as Deputy Durkan said, in some cases, it feels as though we should have taken early action years ago.  We do not have that ability, but we do have the ability to start thinking about and making the changes now.  That is the sense in our assessment of the proposed configuration of current spending, increases in investment and tax cuts being at the limit of what we think is prudent, especially when projecting further down the road, knowing that these hard choices will have to be made.  That is the basis for why this focus on the long term is a really important one that we can do as part of our assessment of the macro aggregate fiscal stance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I want to comment on the generational point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#E00200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Bergin to go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#E00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I was going to come in on the Deputy's question on Brexit.

On Brexit, as deadlines get delayed and the new regime is not fully implemented, it may be that we are living in an unusual period, but, as Dr. Bergin said, it is hard to read the data, partly because Covid is going on and many other factors are distorting the numbers.  There are many moving parts in the flow of trade, be it to the North, the UK or the Continent, and it is hard to read.  That is why we did not say much about it.  We are still carefully watching, but it is difficult to read.<\/p> <p>  On the EU fiscal rules, there is what is called the general escape clause, which the EU has said will likely apply until the end of next year.  For the moment, the Commission is providing advice but it is not enforcing the rules as they stand.  The existing rules should kick in at EU level at that point and, of course, the domestic rules also apply.  One question is whether there will be a change to the rules.  There is significant discussion about that.  The European Commission has a consultation out.  It is unclear what the direction of that is and whether anything will change.<\/p> <p>  One of our concerns is that the Government has not explained how the running of persistent deficits over several years is consistent with the EU fiscal rules.  On the face of it, it does not look as though it is, but the Government should explain its strategy.  There may be special circumstances related to the high-level investment Ireland is planning in the years ahead, but the current EU rules do not make any allowance for that.  The Government needs to think about this and it may constrain its plans.  It needs to make the case, if it wants to go ahead with what it is doing.  It is a constraint, which was not addressed in the summer economic statement, SES.  This is unfortunate, given these are the fiscal rules to which Ireland is committed.<\/p> <p>  The third aspect is corporation tax.  There is significant discussion internationally and things may change, as a result.  It is still very hard, even at a political level, to know what will happen, both internationally and in the US, which is obviously of major interest to Ireland.  There are two main channels for the effect.  One is a loss of corporation tax revenue.  The Government is assuming a loss of &euro;2 billion in its baseline.  Our baseline is a bit higher.  The kind of work we have done would suggest that with a more prudent approach, more than &euro;3 billion, and potentially, an even bigger figure.  The other effect is on the economy.  Either some firms will withdraw from Ireland, which seems relative unlikely, or new firms will stop coming here, because it is viewed to be less attractive when some of the tax advantages have gone.<\/p> <p>  What is difficult is that revenue is concentrated around a small number of companies and the very detailed things one would only know if one was the tax director of one of these companies could have an impact on whether a company continues to pay tax here and it is very hard to predict.  That is why we argue that Ireland needs to reduce its dependency on that, because there is significant risk.  A lot of money is coming in from a small number of sources, which could change relatively fast.<\/p> <p>  There are big concerns around costs and capacity in construction.  The Government, in Housing for All, has not really explained how it sees these issues playing out and how it sees the capacity in the sector developing.  This has economic implications.  If there was just a big run-up in costs in those sectors, that could be destabilising to the rest of the economy.  It could also just reduce the value for money.  There is no point just spending more money and having more demand for construction, if there is no more supply coming.  These are things that need to be monitored, particularly as the scale of the investments becomes so large.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Does the notion that we could end up losing &euro;2 billion or, as far as Mr. Barnes is concerned in another assessment, &euro;3 billion in corporation tax to the Exchequer, as a result of the OECD process, need some revision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#E00700","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>It is uncertain, so the distribution of risks has probably not changed that much.

It is one of the things we hope we will get more information on in the climate action plan.  That would then allow us to think more carefully about the fiscal implications of what will be major societal change with many impacts on the public finances.  In that context, changes in areas such as carbon taxes may raise additional revenues.  Additional expenditures, however, may also be required in the current form to compensate some of the people affected by some of the climate policies.

It will be one of the major issues.  Much additional information is required, but three types stand out.  One is the need to have a clear idea of what the Government is planning to spend money on.  For example, will more funds be allocated to construction, which would consequently push more resources to that sector, or will more money be spent on machinery for wind farms, etc., which is imported?  Very different impacts would result for the domestic economy in each of those contexts.  It would, therefore, be very useful to know that information.

We can imagine some of them will generate revenue for the Government and the economy.  Other projects may be more concerned with just limiting economic damage.

What does Mr. Barnes want to see in the national development plan that would give IFAC comfort in terms of the policies being pursued around the catch-up we are doing on the public expenditure side and the capital side?  It is peaking at 6% in coming years.  What rate would IFAC like to see that normalised to over time?  I have read the IFAC report and that is a feature.  We are doing catch-up.  We have come through a very difficult period since the crash in 2008 and with Covid and everything else.  With everything now moving in terms of the green agenda, we have to restructure our infrastructure in those terms.  Will Mr. Barnes deal with that because I would be interested to hear his thoughts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#G01600","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":298,"content":"<p>In terms of the national development plan and the question of doing an explicit review of it, I do not think that is within our mandate and, obviously, there are many issues in there that are much more microeconomic than the ones the council deals with.  However, it will be an input to our fiscal assessment report and our assessment of the fiscal stance.  It will be important to understanding the economic forecasts, the budgetary forecasts and then our overall view of the public finances.  Whether the national development plan provides us with comfort, as the Deputy suggested, or not will very much depend on what it says.  That is why it is a very important input for our sense of the public finances.<\/p> <p>  One of the big questions we discussed earlier was what the Government's own view of the normalisation is.  I do not think it is for us to say.  There is little doubt that public investment will be higher on average in the future than it was if we go back a couple of years.  To what level it should normalise, I do not really know, but it would be good to know what the Government&rsquo;s view of that is.  The specific question of whether the normalisation ends in 2026 or how the Government is going to unwind this is an important issue because it is a big factor pushing on the economy.  That is a big part of the information we are looking for.  It is about the composition and it is about the economics of it as well.  At the moment, we do not really have that information and it is legitimate that that should be in the national development plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#G01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Barnes looking for that?

It obviously does make a big difference.  There has been a lot of discussion internationally over the past few years about the benefits of higher public investment but it often does not take into account the fact that the impact on the public finances depends a lot on whether it is revenue generating.  Some of it indirectly generates revenue through encouraging growth but other things might not have that benefit.  The multipliers matter a lot.  There are some forms that will feed back relatively quickly into the public finances because they are quite employment intensive, for example, but buying imported things is going to have a lot less impact.<\/p><p>Of course, the NDP is about much more than just public investment.  There is a broader vision of the economy, which will be important for growth and issues such as climate change.  One of the things we need to understand is whether the measures in the NDP are going to meet the Government's own climate objectives.  If there is a shortfall there that would suggest that maybe more spending is needed than is in the plan, then that would, of course, be a concern.  If it is a plan consistent with delivering the Government's objectives, we would find that reassuring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#G01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I am not sure whether it has been touched on but I want to raise the new spending rule and the debt objective.  I assume one of the areas Mr. Barnes is commenting on in that regard is that IFAC have been looking for a fully-balanced budget by 2025.  The Government is looking to run a balanced budget on the current side but a deficit with respect to the capital side.  Can an argument be made that with an economy such as Ireland's, which is doing such a catch-up on the capital side, we are by definition going to be running deficits on the capital side for a period?  Is it a point of principle with the council?

That is one of the reasons we are interested in exactly how the capital is going to be done.  That this is in large part capital spending makes a big difference.  If the Government said it was going to run a deficit of this size just for everyday current spending, we would be much more concerned than we are when it is for public investment.  As we say in the report, there is a strong case for public investment at the moment, both because there are big needs and because interest costs are low.<\/p> <p>  What is important is that other factors must be looked at.  One is the capacity of the construction sector and the economy to deliver in a sustainable way these kinds of increases in investment and the deficit financing of it.  The other one is, of course, the sustainable level of the public finances.  Ireland enters this with a lot of debt.  If public debt today was 50% of national income then we would be having a different conversation about this.  The concern comes from the fact we start from a very high level of debt inherited not particularly from building up the capital stock but from the pandemic-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Yes, and the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#H00400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>-----and from the banking crisis and its consequences.

That is the kind of programme we were much more comfortable with.  That said, there are choices to be made around that and there is no exact science as to whether that path is the perfect one.

On the other, had the Government stuck to its earlier plans, that would have been achieved earlier and we would have gone in from a stronger position.<\/p> <p>  There can be little doubt the management of the crisis has been very effective from an economic point of view.  The economy took an extraordinary hit in terms of the level of activity falling, everyone having to stay at home and most places being shut.  It was quite incredible.  The government supports mobilised in Ireland and other places have helped the economy through that period in an effective way.  It is exactly the kind of countercyclical policy governments should run when the economy gets into trouble.  The Government also did a good job with the contingencies it put in place, both for Brexit and Covid.  Those also helped from a budgetary planning perspective so that even as some supports had to be extended, it was not moving the headline numbers, because the Government had made allowances.  That is a good strategy and one the council recommended.  It was good that is was pursued.  We are now in a different environment and people must understand that in a crisis it is possible, for a short time, to run generous supports for the economy and large deficits but that cannot carry on into normal times.<\/p> <p>  As we come back to normal times we must think beyond that and that is why we have the concerns in the report.

When we are talking about financial prudence, planning, strategies and where exactly we are going, one of the biggest issues I can see for business, budgets and everything is surety of energy supplies for our country.  If we do not have power, everything grinds to a halt.  There is an enormous cost being placed on people at the moment because of the ever-increasing cost of energy.  This is having a real distorting effect on our economy.  Every economic commentator will tell us the way things have changed so much in the past 18 months with the costs of our basic energy needs.  It is frightening and we might ask where it is going to stop.  The next thing then is surety of supply and whether we are going to have uninterrupted power for the next three or four months.  Even if we get over this winter, will we have an assured energy supply next winter?  We must look at the Government's decisions to date and think about what we are doing here.<\/p> <p>  Over the past number of days we have had the news breaking that 200 lorryloads of peat have been imported from Latvia because we have shut down Bord na M&oacute;na.  It might seem like a small issue but it is a really big issue.  The importation of peat briquettes from Germany goes on unabated as we have closed our peat briquette-making factory.  Returning to the matter of surety of supply, the Government is now faced with a scenario where the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is finally conceding we will need to hire generators that use gas.  This is going to cost an awful lot of money.  It is going to be very bad for our environment.  We must look at what the Government decided to do.  To make us look good, it shut down our power plants.  The result of that is we are bringing in generators to ensure the lights do not go out and that everybody who is so concerned about everything in the environment will have some way to charge their phones and boil the kettle.<\/p><p>The general transition probably will not work, ultimately, and we will just have to buy the power from France and England, which produce it with nuclear power stations.  We know what is happening in China, which is building hundreds of coal-burning power stations.  This type of policy will not do our economic credibility any good, including among people wanting to come here, like we have heard, including the Intels of the world, and their take on what our Government has done.  The reality of decisions taken over the last 12 months is starting to bite us.  From an economic perspective and a good economist's point of view, how are we looking to the world and to the rest of Europe because of what is happening to us?  If the lights go out in Ireland, that will be one of the worst financial damnations that could happen to us because it would show us up as having made really poor political decisions and having left ourselves extremely vulnerable to every type of financial market.  What will be the result for our industry if we cannot be sure that we can pump petrol and that we can keep computers turned on?  If we have a debate here today on anything to do with budgets or finances without discussing the result of what this Government of the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael has done, we will be ignoring the elephant in the room.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#H01000","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy that there is a complex situation with energy supply nationally.  It is driven by a number of things.  One relates to the impact of climate change and the policies that have been put in place for that transition.  That is why the climate action plan is extremely important.  The stakes are high, both with regard to safeguarding the climate and also the potential economic impacts.  The costs of doing the wrong things will make that situation worse.  That is why the climate action plan is important both from an economic and fiscal perspective.  None of us on the council is an expert on these issues.  Perhaps Dr. Bergin is - I do not know.  This is not really our area of expertise but it is something we follow closely because it is important.  There are some big risks associated with it and some big costs on the baseline.  These are important issues and things that we will look at increasingly carefully.<\/p> <p>  To the council's credit, two years ago, our annual conference was on fiscal policy and climate.  When we first set it up, it looked like we were maybe ahead of the curve and maybe not many people were thinking about the question.  We learned a lot from that and it underlined how important these issues are.  It has prepared us to look at them.  One of the problems is that other problems are being dealt with at the same time.  At the same time as climate change, there is also population ageing and other issues.  Many things affect public finances, which is why good planning is so critical.  If you try to fix one problem without thinking about how it interacts with other things, which the Deputy gave examples of, we could end up making some bad decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Has Deputy Healy-Rae any further questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#J00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":314,"content":"<p>No, but I think it is a sobering thought and it shows that the Government really did not think this through.

It is a bad start for our aims and ambitions with regard to climate action if one of the first things to happen is that we cannot guarantee energy supplies in this country.  The credibility of everything will be thrown into doubt and we will have to look seriously at what we propose to do in the future.  I do not think that the people will go along with giving the Government a blank cheque of support if they see that a result of this will be chaos in the markets and in their work and home lives if they cannot be guaranteed an energy supply.  One can look at simple things that have happened such as peat being imported from Latvia after people in Bord na M&oacute;na have had their jobs and way of life shut down.  Bord na M&oacute;na played an integral role in Irish society.  The result is now that the jobs are in Latvia, the briquettes are made in Germany, they are sent to us here and everything is fine.

I feel this would drive the economy and activity, reduce carbon emissions, put money back in people's pockets and increase their disposable income.

I have looked at the different ways that climate policies can be designed.  For example, if there is a tax on carbon, how you spend that revenue has different impacts.  Where is that going to be put in the spending programme?  Is it being used as a new revenue source or to pay off debt?  Is it being channelled into energy efficiency research and energy efficient technology which would help to speed up the transition process?  Will it be channelled into social protection to offset the costs that might be borne by some of the more vulnerable households in society?  There are many policy trade-offs.  It is not necessarily the council's role to identify the appropriate policy mix.

First, I wish to ask a couple of questions specifically around a thorny issue that we come up against in the committee all of the time, that is, what is good medium-term budgetary planning and what does that look like, and in regard to access to data and planning for demographic change.  Does IFAC consider access in this country to demographic data and disaggregated data in terms of health and the make-up of our communities is on par with other countries?  Is it an adequate methodology for IFAC to engage in meaningful medium to long-term fiscal planning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#K00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I will make two points.  On the point of medium-term planning in general, one of the extremely encouraging things about the SES was the move to the existing level of service basis for current expenditure.  As we have discussed in the past, in previous budgetary exercises, Government spending plans were not sufficient to even provide the current level of spending, taking into account inflation and demographics.  We said that was incredible and we were very critical of it.  That has been largely addressed through the existing level of service.  This is very close to what the council calls a standstill.  That is important because it gives one an idea of what the public finances will look like over the next few years, instead of some arbitrary set of numbers.  It could also be very important for medium-term planning because that could then feed into the expenditure ceiling.  Since 2013, there have been expenditure ceilings in Ireland.  These are multi-year ceilings at departmental level for spending.  The problem is that every year they are revised.  That happens because the overall level of spending in the forecast was too low and, consequently, that trickled down to the expenditure ceilings, which were too low, and so they were revised up as we moved towards reality.  This is potentially very useful because with the right top-down expenditure, forecasts like that translate into the ceilings and those can now be kept fixed.  There is no reason they should change.  That is good in terms of understanding what is happening to the public finances, but it also might be helpful to people in terms of the thinking about how to make the best of that money rather than them always being in a process of just thinking about how they can get their budget up in the following year.  There are encouraging signs in relation to medium-term budgetary planning, but the proof of that pudding will be in the eating.<\/p> <p>  On access to data, this is an issue on which I can only comment in the context of the council.  The OECD review of the council from February recommended that the council should have a statutory right to information.  As of today, the council has no right to information.  We rely on the goodwill of the Government.  The Department of Finance provides us with the information that we need.  We have a good relationship with that Department, but it does not always have all of the information we ask for - some of it may not even exist - and sometimes getting it takes time.  It is not a perfect process but it works.  We find that much more difficult in relation to other areas of government.  For example, in regard to health, it is very difficult for us to understand what is happening there.  We know there have been massive overruns in the pre-Covid period but we cannot understand that because we do not have access to that information.  There are some issues on the Revenue side and in all areas of government.  As the investment programme ramps up, that may also become more of an issue.  The OECD recommended that the council should have a statutory right to information.  That would change the nature of the dialogue we have with the Government, with a presumption that if we make reasonable requests for information we would be provided with it in a timely way.  We do think that is important.  I can only speak for the council.  It may be a wider issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes for that interesting response.  When it comes to health, it is possible some of that data is not collated and as such it does not exist.  This is going to be an issue going forward.  I am interested in Mr. Barnes's first point around meeting the core spending.  I noted in last year's budget, for the first time, that the mental health allocation was divided into spend for current services and spend for implementation of new programmes.  It was incredibly useful for the mental health sector to be able to see how that would play out.  In the application of new programmes such as Sl&aacute;intecare it would seem very important to disaggregate current spending and new programmes spend.  I hope to see more of that in the coming budget.<\/p> <p>  I commend IFAC on its report.  It is a fascinating read.  Towards the end of it, there is reference to higher investment, addressing priorities and how that might be costly.  In terms of economic oversight and fiscal planning, I take the point around capital investment and public spend on particular investment programmes or infrastructure.  I am mindful of the NDP, hopefully, being published soon.  From a climate perspective, is that a challenge for the witnesses, or is it something that you are mindful of, when it comes to forecasting requirements in terms of the economic outcomes of particular capital investments?  There may also be a requirement for economic forecasting on the lack of investment or the failure to do something.  I am thinking specifically of not just the physical impacts of climate change, for example, where we are seeing water infrastructure that is beginning to fall apart and has a knock-on cost to our health system or, perhaps, inward investment which may see our infrastructure as not fit for purpose, but also global policy changes and the expectation that Ireland would meet them.  IFAC has included the cost of investment in its report.  How difficult is it for it to include in these types of reports the cost of not investing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#K00500","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Those are excellent points.  The point made by the Chairman with regard to a distinction between new spend and what is needed for the current spending is really important.  It is important for the public to understand that, otherwise it can appear that the Government has allocated billions of euro in extra funding to a particular area and lead the public to wonder why a particular public service is not getting any better.  If that is essentially just the money that is needed to pay the wages as they go up for the same people or to reflect higher demographics, people need to understand that distinction between the ongoing costs and new spend.  That is an important distinction.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman makes a very good point in terms of climate and some of the housing issues.  On the one hand, we need to understand how it meets the Government's objectives, but that is not very clearly spelled out.  We are not really in a position to assess that but we would like to know Government thinking on that so that we can understand the risks around it.  On the other hand, we need to see a joined up approach to thinking on these subjects.  For example, in the housing area, one of the things that the Government spends a lot of money on is housing supports.  As rents go up in the private sector, that means more people need that help and it becomes more costly to provide.  There is a great deal of feedback going on the public finances and housing costs, housing generally and, as mentioned by the Chairman, climate and health and many other factors.  These are very good parts of economic planning, some of which would help us to understand the fiscal implications and many of which will help to understand the policies more generally.<\/p><p>Professor McMahon might want to come in on this too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I was going to make a similar point to the one just made by Mr. Barnes.

An example that Mr. Barnes alluded to is social housing spending versus having the houses and the links with health.  It is difficult without the detail to be able to say anything.  For example, some investment plans have large ongoing maintenance associated with them whereas others do not, so it is not just about thinking about the benefits of not investing; it is also the fiscal costs of investing and not investing.  The point is well made but, without detail, it is almost impossible to even guess at what the interaction between these complex things are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McMahon.

Raiseaconcern is a small Irish-owned, Irish-based professional organisation that works with private sector employers and public bodies in the prevention, detection, investigation and remediation of workplace wrongdoing.  As our name suggests, we specialise in the area of whistleblowing, or employee disclosure, as we prefer to call it.  We have practical experience of dealing with employers and workers in this area.<\/p> <p>  Committee members will appreciate that the content of our work, who we work for and the identity of the disclosers we engage with is extremely confidential, so they will understand why I will not be in a position to discuss specific cases with them.  However, as the committee considers and debates the first set of amendments to the Protected Disclosures Act since its enactment in 2014, I welcome the opportunity to share some views with the committee and to take questions.<\/p> <p>  Many elements of the adoption of the EU whistleblowing directive into Irish law are non-discretionary, so my submission only covers those limited areas where there is discretion under the directive or where members have general discretion as legislators to go beyond the provisions of the directive.  In all, we make four recommendations on the general scheme of the Bill.  The first relates to grievances, which is dealt with in head 5 of the general scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021092200002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Brennan"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632265200,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Deputy John McGuinness took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":340,"content":"<p>It is proposed to insert a provision into the Act that matters concerning interpersonal grievances will not come within its scope.  While we agree with the intent, we urge caution.  In our experience, many employers regard claims of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment as interpersonal grievances.  We encourage the committee to ensure that in drafting the Bill to exclude interpersonal grievances there is no ambiguity, and that it is explicit that it does not exclude disclosures regarding bullying, harassment and sexual harassment from protection.<\/p> <p>  The second area I wish to cover is anonymous disclosure, which is dealt with in head 8.  It is proposed to explicitly afford protection to workers who make anonymous disclosures if they are subsequently identified and suffer penalisation.  It is also proposed to avail of a \"carve out\" provided for in the directive that recipients of anonymous disclosures are not obliged to accept or follow up on such disclosures.  It is our experience that concern about their identity being revealed is the single biggest fear that disclosers have and is one of the most significant deterrents to disclosure.  This is why Raiseaconcern provides the service of being a confidential recipient.  We have set out in our submission why we see no logic or justifiable reason as to why disclosures by named workers must be accepted and followed up by employers, whereas in contrast, the same obligation does not apply to disclosures made by anonymous disclosers.<\/p> <p>  The third area I would like to deal with is internal reporting channels.  That is dealt with in head 9.  It is proposed that the existing legislation will be amended to require all employers with 50 or more employees to establish internal reporting channels.  While it is appropriate to minimise the compliance burden on micro or small enterprises, we feel there is no logic in excluding them from the requirement to put simple processes in place for receipt of employee disclosures.  The risk of wrongdoing exists in micro and small enterprises just as it does in medium and large ones.<\/p> <p>  In the operation of other aspects of legislation, Ireland does not operate exemption or light-touch provisions for micro or small enterprises.  For example, as a small enterprise we must adhere to the same tax administration provisions, health and safety provisions and environmental protection provisions as medium and large enterprises.  Raiseaconcern's view is that our legislation should promote a workplace environment where all enterprises, small as well as big, act legally and properly.  The Government is required under Article 20 of the directive to provide support on the design of policies and procedures and on their operation.<\/p><p>There is nothing to prevent Government bodies, trade associations, voluntary bodies and others from making template policies, procedures and processes available at low or no cost to micro or small enterprises, thereby eliminating or at least minimising the cost of compliance.<\/p><p> The fourth area we want to cover concerns ministerial reporting channels, dealt with in head 11.  I am sure it is a provision with which the committee is well familiar.  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 currently permits disclosers who are employed by a public body to make disclosures to a Minister of the Government in certain circumstances.  The general scheme of the Bill proposes to change this and introduce a range of new conditions that must be met for such disclosures, including that such disclosures will be referred to the new protected disclosures office in the Office of the Ombudsman.  Raiseaconcern can understand that there are administrative benefits to having a central point in a protected disclosures office to which Departments can refer worker disclosures for evaluation and handling.  However, the Bill proposes to introduce new and increased hurdles that disclosers must meet in order to make a disclosure to a Minister.  This seems to narrow the ability of disclosers to claim protection and this seems regressive.  We encourage the committee to consider this further.<\/p><p> There are areas where the Bill might be improved.  Our submission sets down a further matter that the committee might consider.  Where recipients of disclosures find on investigation that wrongdoing has occurred, we feel the legislation should require that the broader and underlying root causes that prevailed which facilitated or enabled the wrongdoing to take place should be identified.  This should include why the wrongdoing was not identified by others before the disclosure was made by a whistleblower.  It is only by completing this final step and taking remedial action to address the root causes that similar problems can be avoided at a general level in future.  There should be sharing of the learning, and in the case of public bodies, there may be scope to incorporate provisions in this regard into annual reports.  The protected disclosures office could also play a vital role in this, which would be in the public interest.<\/p><p>On the question of possible implications or consequences arising from the legislation, in our submission Raiseaconcern has set out the reasons adequate and appropriate resourcing of the new protected disclosures office in the Ombudsman's office will be crucial to its success.  The same applies to adequately resourcing the functions of \"prescribed persons\" on whom significant additional responsibilities will now fall.<\/p><p> The proposed amendments to the Protected Disclosures Act will strengthen protection and redress for those who disclose wrongdoing and help ensure their disclosures are acted upon and that they receive feedback.  It will also provide balance by ensuring due process is afforded to those who are the subject of disclosures.  However, passing legislation alone is not enough.  It is the view of Raiseaconcern that this needs to be accompanied by a Government-backed initiative to promote a positive attitude towards this whole area.  Ireland should promote a culture where we encourage, as well as offer, legislative protection to workers who raise concerns about workplace wrongdoing.  This culture would create the environment within which Ireland&rsquo;s national and public interests would be best served by making it a better place to work, a better place to do business and a better place with which to do business.  We encourage the Government to align this amended legislation with a public awareness programme promoting such a culture.

I am here to faithfully assist this committee and outline my experience of the practices of the State in dealing with my application under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  Having walked that walk for justice, I can attest to this committee that there many failings in the implementation of the existing Act and the practices are greatly at variance with the theory.<br\/><br\/>The circumstances of my working life in a local authority forced me to &quot;blow the whistle&quot; on and refuse to participate in serious wrongdoings.  These wrongdoings had catastrophic consequences for the abused.  On 22 June 2016, the day before the Brexit referendum in the UK, I submitted a protected disclosure application under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 to the relevant Minister as per the Act.  That was done in person in Leinster House and he assured me it would be dealt with expeditiously.  Attached to the protected disclosure application I provided a copy of my published book, <i>Abuse of Power: Because Councils Can<\/i>, to the Minister, which outlines relevant particulars supporting my application.  The committee should be assured that no line in my book or the veracity of any statements I have made have been challenged in the past seven years by any person or entity because I am telling the truth.<br\/><br\/>Six months later in December 2016, the Minister telephoned me and related that his Department did not yet have policies or procedures in place to administer my protected disclosures application he but asked me to trust him and that he would deal with it fairly.  I believed I was entitled to the remedy sought in the application at that stage and should not have been penalised further by delays for the admitted failure of the Government to have administrative processes in place for legislation that was already two and a half years in existence.  It is clearly set out in that Act that a Minister is a &quot;relevant person&quot; to receive protected disclosures.<br\/><br\/>The elephant in the room about the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 is that whether by accident or by design, it is not time-bound.  &quot;What has no timeline is farcical&quot; is a line I have heard repeated by a Minister with respect to another topic and it is a very pertinent point.  Under this current regime, it seems no resolution needs ever to emerge.  Unfortunately for bona fide whistleblowers who expect a fair process in a timely manner with an outcome advised to them, I can only say that since I submitted my protected disclosure application to the relevant Minister in June 2016, the entire protected disclosures process has failed for me.<br\/><br\/>Not alone was I deprived of a timeline but I was further deprived of communications, including the determination, which I understand was made in May 2018.  The then Minister wrote to me and told me to wait for the outcome.  I am still waiting and he has gone from the Oireachtas since.  The current Minister issued the same response in a parliamentary question three years later in 2021.  I was told to wait.<br\/><br\/>The Minister states he does not have any role of governance or oversight or role in the way that the public funds allocated by him is spent or misspent by a local authority.  The Minister confirmed to me in writing that the chief executive officer of a local authority can use the public resources in any way he decides.  Despite this fact, the application I made in good faith to the Minister was put before the same local authority for its investigation of its own actions.  This removed any possibility of a fair process for me due to the overriding conflicts of interest.<br\/><br\/>The protected disclosures legislation has been used against me. While I was working in good faith, supplying the documentation and evidence to support my application, the Minister delegated the task of investigation back to the perpetrators.  Years have gone by again.  This is the perversity of administration that I experienced under implementation of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  Having exhausted all avenues in my home country and suffering denial of justice and infringement of my fundamental rights, I submitted an application to the petitions committee of the European Parliament, PETI, for assistance.  This was heard on 13 April 2021, and I have submitted the original EU broadcast stream of petition to the clerk of this committee to share with you for more complete information.<br\/><br\/>The petitions committee sent my petition to the European Commission directorate of justice for investigation.  It returned with comment that it was &quot;a very well substantiated&quot; application, but as of this moment, until the Irish Government has transposed the EU directive into Irish law, the Commission cannot pass a judgment on the failings of the whistleblower legislation just yet.<br\/><br\/>It is important that this PETI committee has taken interim actions while we are all awaiting transposition of the 2019 directive.  It has kept my European petition open, referred my petition to the legal affairs committee for investigation and written to the Irish Department of Justice seeking information about progress of the Irish Government in implementing the EU whistleblower directive.<br\/><br\/>When the Irish Department of Justice received the letter from the EU petitions committee chair, it declined responsibility and passed it to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It in turn declined responsibility for it and passed it onto the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Minister of which was the recipient of my original protected disclosure application.<\/p><p>How can an ordinary citizen like me have faith in this system?<br\/><br\/>I did not choose to become a whistleblower.  I was pushed out of a career in the local government sector at 52 years old because I believed in my respect for the law, in adherence to standards and governance, and in my refusal to join others in abusing the rights of citizens.  All of these details are set out in my 2014 published book <i>Abuse of Power: Because Councils Can.  <\/i>As a public servant, I refuse to be corrupt.<br\/><br\/>I went to the High Court in 2010 and had my good name reconfirmed.  All of my evidence was taken at its highest point.  The court found that I had made a recommendation for the abused tenant to be transferred to alternative accommodation, as was her legal right.  Council officials denied this for years until then.  I believe that woman would be alive today if she had not been so abused.  They never apologised to her family or to me.<br\/><br\/>The Minister delegated responsibility from my protected disclosure application to the same local authority.  Is there any political will for a fair outcome for people like me?  My High Court action in 2010 uncovered an absence of legislation governing recruitment in local authorities.  There is a serious public interest element to this finding, the ramifications of which highlight scope and potential for mass patronage and nepotism in local authorities in Ireland.  Is this democracy?<br\/><br\/>It is contended by some academics and commentators that individuals who blow the whistle are courageous.  In the absence of open support and backing from our elected politicians, I believe whistleblowing will persist in being a precarious route for individuals standing against corruption.  It continues to mean risks, costs and suffering for honest workers of conscience and, perversely, without any negative career consequences for the perpetrators.  I do not dare to doubt the bona fides of anyone here today, but in truth, we all know that in the real Ireland any legislation is only as good as its enforcement.  In my lived experience, this is primarily due to the lack of political will to enforce the legislation that is already there, with or without a timeline.<br\/><br\/>I am not looking for something that I am not entitled to.  The remedy in the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 is minuscule when compared with the actual cost to me for my honesty and integrity.  It does not even consider the whole retaliation element.  However, I want closure.  I have copied the committee in my original protected disclosure application to the Minister.  I have explicitly waived all rights to anonymity from the outset.<br\/><br\/>Doing the right thing, as a public servant, and blowing the whistle on wrongdoing did not present the biggest challenge for me.  What has presented extreme challenge over the past 17 years is the victimisation, penalisation and retaliation that I have endured and suffered, coming from actions of individuals who are protected inside State-funded organisations and who are personally cosseted by the public purse.  It is unfair that they are shielded from all accountability for their actions and that they are enabled to engage in malicious strategies to delay, to deny and to wait for the whistleblower to die.  At 70 years of age, this is unsavoury at best.<br\/><br\/>I have many concerns about the transposition of the EU directive into Irish whistleblowing law, which I hope the committee can explore further.  I am happy to answer any questions.  By the way, I submitted 16 documents to support this statement.  They comprise letters to and from the Department.  It shows the chronology of my application, and how the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 does not work for the whistleblower.  It is a shame that this these documents were censored from the committee because full information is a requirement to move forward and to seriously do what electorate expects, that is, to represent everybody and to leave some space for the honest, conscientious worker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021092200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Julie Grace","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Grace for her contribution.

Some 39 years ago today, on 22 September 1982, I walked into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College in Templemore, County Tipperary, as a shy, insecure teenager.  When I left there six months later, I did so as a confident and highly motivated young man, ready to fulfil my role as a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure that I was not the only one who felt like I did on that day, as we waited with anticipation to be sworn in as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  After the swearing-in ceremony, a senior Garda officer addressed us and told us that we were now members of the Garda family; that we could only depend on each other for support; and that it was our duty to take care of each other as members of the Garda family.  Therein lies the problem.  That mantra led to the toxic culture of loyalty before honesty that has existed within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since its foundation and still exists today.  I am sure that this culture of protecting the organisation and one's colleagues at all costs is not unique to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but there is a major difference between blind loyalty to a colleague who has made a genuine mistake and to a colleague who is engaged in criminality.  Sadly, in my experience, these lines are blurred.<\/p> <p>  In the aftermath of making a statement of complaint against a Garda colleague who said that &ldquo;what Maurice McCabe needs is a bullet in the head&rdquo;, to when I subsequently made complaint to the Garda confidential recipient Mr. Oliver Connolly about the corrupt termination of lawfully issued fixed charge penalty notices by a senior Garda officers, I went from being a respected Garda colleague and an elected Garda Representative Association, GRA, district representative, to being viewed as an enemy within, in a relatively short amount of time.<\/p> <p>  In the aftermath of former Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace bringing our allegations into the public domain, I was confronted by an inspector and a sergeant while I was in Cavan Garda station carrying out inquiries into ticket fixing, using An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's PULSE system.  They told me to get out of the station and not to come back.  On another occasion I was subjected to a search by a Garda sergeant, who believed that I had PULSE documents concealed in bags of shredded paper that I had removed from a waste bin at the rear of Monaghan Garda station to use as dog bedding, as I had done for several years.  This search took place on a public roadway.  I was on duty and in uniform at the time.<\/p> <p>  The former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, who received my initial complaint about the corrupt determination of fixed charge penalty notices on 4 April 2012 from Mr. Oliver Connolly, the Garda confidential recipient, issued a direction in December 2012 prohibiting both myself and Sergeant Maurice McCabe from using the PULSE system.  This meant that it was not possible for us to carry out our duties as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  Martin Callinan subsequently described our actions as &ldquo;disgusting&rdquo;, when he appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts on the 23 January 2014.  The comments made by former Commissioner Callinan on that occasion were a clear warning to other members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who might have been considering making protected disclosures that there was no such thing as confidentiality and that their identities will become known, just as ours had.<\/p> <p>  In February 2013, I was heavily criticised by a member of the Judiciary acting in a personal capacity due to the fact that a judicial colleague had been named in a national newspaper as having had multiple penalty points terminated for speeding.  I retired from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 1 May 2013, as my position had become untenable.  This member of the Judiciary subsequently asked me to withdraw a complaint that I had made in September 2012 under An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anti-fraud policy against a senior Garda officer who was a serial ticket fixer.  I believe that this request, which I ignored, was at the behest of the senior officer about whom I complained.<\/p><p>I welcome any legislation that offers protection to bona fide whistleblowers, but the sad reality is that until there is a major culture change in Ireland relating to the treatment of people who report wrongdoing in the workplace, life will continue to be very difficult for these people.  The acceptance of the role of bona fide whistleblowers must become the rule and not the exception.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021092200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Wilson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Wilson and I invite Mr. McGree to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021092200002#E00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee today to offer my experience of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  I refer to the famous quote, often repeated, &quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot;  <br\/><br\/>The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 was devised in Ireland to protect and advise citizens on how to do something to prevent the triumph of evil.  Like all legislation, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 is theory.  As legislators, politicians see the world through the eyes of those who debate the issues of the day before devising theory or laws to address them.  I view the world through different eyes.  I see the practical impact and damage done by weak laws and even weaker regulation.  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 is not Government's best work.  It is littered with half-finished aspirations and unqualified requests.  It is actioned by weak and unenforceable guidelines, recommendations and framework documents which permit ambiguity and provide loopholes to those seeking to frustrate or abuse the intended purpose of the Act.  Amendments to such a law will achieve little.  I will give an example.  If someone is assaulted in Ireland, the State represents the victim assaulted and those accused are prosecuted by the State through the Offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  If a person is assaulted for being a whistleblower, penalised for making a protected disclosure, as defined by the Protected Disclosures Act, the State will finance the defence of those accused of corruption and penalisation through the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  This explains why some politicians, in particular Ministers who are identified as recipients of protected disclosures under the Act, lack the courage required to support whistleblowers.  The Ministers understand that such support means standing with David against Goliath, standing up to the vast State resources employed to defend those who breach the Protected Disclosures Act.  This culture is anti-whistleblower.  Our culture needs to change before the Act changes.  In its current form, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 does not deliver protection.  It does not prevent corruption and waste and it does not provide savings for the State or ensure better efficiency of public spending.  It serves only as a financial burden on the State as it incurs the huge expense of financing the defence of the corrupt and the assault of the whistleblower.<br\/><br\/>I refused to co-operate and assist in the stealing of public service resources.  I reported this corruption, currently estimated at more than &euro;21 million, as a protected disclosure.  The State employed at least eight different independent external firms, funded from the public purse, to investigate, review, or challenge my reports.  All energies and efforts<br\/><br\/>are focused on me, the discloser, while the corruption, the disclosure, is ignored and continues to this day.  If I had embraced the corruption and assisted the theft of public funds, the State would have lost &euro;21 million, and would have continued to lose, but I refused to steal and instead reported corruption as a protected disclosure.  This has cost the State &euro;21 million in corruption.  That corruption continues to this day, with further millions of euro spent on firms to investigate and challenge reports upholding my concerns.  I lost my career and my home.  My family suffered.  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 does not deliver the function for which it was devised.<br\/><br\/>In March 2016, my concerns were defined as a protected disclosure.  In February 2017, an independent report by a judge upheld my concerns and my complaints of penalisation.  I received apologies and commendations from the Minister and the director general of my Department.  In March 2018, I received an award from the Workplace Relations Commission which upheld my penalisation for making a protected disclosure, one of the less than 10% successful WRC cases to date.  I have never received that award.  In April 2019, with my circumstance escalating, I made a second protected disclosure highlighting my treatment and reporting serious organised corruption, which was passed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the Minister, but my treatment was referred to line managers as a HR matter and in January 2020 I lost my career when the decision was taken to retire me 14 years early due to the penalisation that I was enduring for making protected disclosures.<br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 is theory.  The reality is different.  Real people in positions of authority mistreated me because they saw me as a threat to their criminal operations.  They had been identified in the judge's report as penalising me for making protected disclosures, but the State protected them, not me.  Their authority financed and empowered them to refuse acceptance of the judge's findings.  These people remained my line managers and now viewed me as an even more dangerous threat to their criminal enterprise because the Protected Disclosures Act labelled me a credible whistleblower.  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 did not protect me; it defined me, identified me, labelled me and placed a target on my back.  My penalisation escalated unabated and continues to this day.  I should not be retired at 47 years of age.  I should be working, providing public service, as I had done professionally for 25 years.  Instead, I lost my job because I am not a thief.  I lost my job because I reported corruption.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The Minister passed my protected disclosure to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When those involved in the criminal activity became aware that I had reported their criminal enterprise, my family and I came under sustained attack, intimidation and abuse.  We were followed, assaulted and abused.  Our home was attacked and damaged by men in balaclavas late<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">at night.  Our car was vandalised and a dead rat was left at our front door.  I reported these incidents to the Minister, complete with supporting CCTV footage, as the recipient of my protected disclosure.  I described these events as serious penalisation for making protected disclosures, but also as a serious criminal offence under section 20 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011, which makes it a criminal act to penalise someone for reporting a crime.  I received a written reply from a private legal firm, retained by the Minister&rsquo;s Department and financed from public funds, to inform me that the harassment and intimidation of my family was no longer defined as a crime due to the amendment made to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 by the Oireachtas, removing the definition of such intimidation and harassment as criminal when the initial criminal activity is reported as a protected disclosure.  It could only be defined as penalisation, making the recipient of my protected disclosure, the Minister, responsible for my family's protection.  The problem for my family is that the Minister refuses to engage with me because his departmental civil servants, the same line managers found to have penalised me in the judge's report, are in dispute with me because they refuse to accept the findings of the Department's own report upholding my earlier protected disclosure and penalisation.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  On the day before Christmas Eve 2019, the Minister wrote to inform me that he was retiring me from my career due to my penalisation for making protected disclosures.  He said that he knew my family had endured a tough time, but that he could not protect us because he was constrained by the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  When that Act permits a Minister to take away a whistleblower's career, while that same Minister is constrained from protecting the whistleblower, no one can boast that it is performing the function for which it was devised.  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 did not protect me, it even removed other protections that should have been available to me.  It did not prevent the triumph of evil.  I am not alone; I am just invisible.  Every tactic is employed to ensure that whistleblowers like me remain invisible and silent.  The reality is there are many people in Ireland who, like me, have been let down by the Protected <\/font>Disclosures Act 2014.  On 12 June 2020 , the Government published a commitment to ensure the effectiveness of new whistleblowing legislation in the context of the transposition of the EU directive on whistleblowing.  The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future<b><i><\/i><\/b>details the Government's pledge to use the opportunity of the EU consideration of reforms to European-wide whistleblowing provisions to review, update and reform our whistleblowing legislation and ensure that it remains as effective as possible.  It is time to deliver on that pledge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021092200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel McGree"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>It is very powerful to hear personal stories in relation to this and I commend the witnesses on coming before the committee.

I am just aware of time constraints.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with Mr. McGree.  On the role of the Minister and the reporting channels under the current legislation that allow protected disclosures to be made directly to the Minister, while the new Bill looks to bring in the protected disclosures office, what does Mr. McGree think could have constrained the Minister under the current Act from acting appropriately?  How could that be improved?  Is the new proposal for a protected disclosure office an improvement on the current Act or is it a retrograde step?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021092200002#F00100","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I do not know what constrained the Minister.  That was his phrase; it is what he said to me.  My understanding of the Protected Disclosures Act is that under section 8 a Minister is a recipient for a protected disclosure and there is a certain obligation and responsibility on a recipient of a protected disclosure to perform some functions for your protection.  That was not done in my case.  I mentioned in my statement that there is a lot of ambiguity in the Act which leaves the decision on actions to be taken by people, such as the Minister in receipt of a protected disclosure.  It is not clear what action there is to be taken.  There is definitely a need for more education and for more information to be provided.  The biggest issue around making a protected disclosure to a Minister is that a Minister is an executive authority over a Department.  You are drawing a concern to that Minister regarding that Department.  Very often, what the Minister will do is simply return the protected disclosure, concern or submission to the Department to deal with so you are effectively back to investigating yourself and alerting officials in the Department that somebody is speaking up and raising concern.  We have all spoken today about the change in the culture towards whistleblowers.  That culture is very real.  It has been identified in some Departments already with mention of things such as silo culture and dysfunction within Departments.  When you are handing something as delicate as a protected disclosure back to the officials in the Department, you are leaving them open to disclosure and penalisation.  Ministers need to understand that they need to take better ownership of what they receive and deal with it better.  We are not contacting our local politician, looking to be moved up the waiting list for a hospital appointment or an issue over planning permission.  This is a serious matter.  We are making disclosures on genuine and serious concerns, very often within public administration.  We cannot be just fobbed off to some personal assistant or some official within their Department.  Ministers are going to have to start to stand up and respect whistleblowers.  They need to protect them and realise what they are doing and then act on that which means acting in their position as executive authority over the Department.<\/p> <p>  The proposed amendment creates an office in the Office of the Ombudsman.  I cannot see that making any difference.  Despite my previous comments, Ministers are elected politicians.  As such, they can be held to account by the people.  It may take the next election to do that but it can be done; they are accountable.  What we are finding from inside the public service is that public officials, senior civil servants, are just not held to account.  They are allowed to make arbitrary decisions.  As an example, I made a protected disclosure to my Minister.  It was sent for external investigation by a firm.  That firm upheld my protected disclosure.  The officials in the Department immediately challenged that report, refused to accept it and railed against it.  I will not name names, but everyone will be well aware of another protected disclosure made in a different Department.  The protected disclosure was sent to a barrister for investigation.  The barrister investigated it as an external firm but did not uphold the protected disclosure.  The Secretary General then appeared before the committee and said \"nothing to see here\" because it was investigated and not upheld.  Effectively, you have Secretaries General or senior civil servants who are allowed to make the decision as to whether the independent investigation of protected disclosures is accepted or not.  That is just not fair or proper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021092200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel McGree"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGree.

As I said in my opening statement, it depends hugely on how much resourcing and expertise is placed into those areas and what capability they are given to independently investigate these issues themselves or refer them to others for independent investigation.  The more steps there are the better but what cannot happen is a dilution in the provisions that are already in place.  I mentioned in my opening statement my concern that at the moment there are new restraints proposed on disclosures to Ministers which might make it much more difficult for a worker to qualify to make a disclosure to a Minister.  That needs to be looked at.  We need to ensure that all the provisions at whatever level, and the best level to make a disclosure, if possible, is at a worker to manager level.  Forget about Ministers, Secretaries General, or managing directors; the culture you need to encourage is that people, when they are concerned about something as part of their daily work, feel that they can go to their manager and raise it.  That should be the end of it.  They might never mention the words \"protected disclosure\".  Where the problems arise, and where the protection is needed, is when penalisation in some shape or other is introduced.  Everyone has spoken about culture.  It is really about trying to create a culture that people who raise issues and concerns should be regarded positively.  They do positive things for the organisation they work for rather than being people out to cause trouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021092200002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Ms Grace spoke about a lack of accountability.

I understand how the mechanisms of the State work and how the public service works but what if you have corruption inside the public service?  Ireland is a very small country.

The Department funds the local authority but has no further engagement as to how that is spent.<\/p><p>We are looking at more engagement from the politicians.  It is about political will.  We depend on the politicians.<\/p><p> The first point at which we have our story heard is when we speak with our local representative.  When we vote for our local representative, that is the expectation that we have.  With all due respect, while there are some excellent and engaged politicians, there are many apathetic politicians.  They are not interested.  It is as simple as that.  We need to start at the top.  It is about the fundamentals.  A top-down, not bottom-up, approach is required.  With all due respect to some of the other speakers, unless the culture is clean at the top, and until such time as we address the matters of victimisation, retaliation and penalisation, we are going nowhere.  Those reactions are silent, covert and they are done from a distance.<\/p><p> How can we change that?  We can change it by looking for strong political will.  We need Ministers who will say that it is not acceptable.  I understand the inordinate authority that senior civil servants have under the Ministers and Secretaries and Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial and Court Offices (Amendment) Act 2020.  One particular Minister - I will not say whom - told me they are terrified of upsetting the public servants.  Another politician told me that they knew that I was entitled to recourse and the issues should have been resolved long ago but those inside did not want to set a precedent.  If we face that kind of disengagement from our politicians and they take that kind of cavalier approach to rights and wrongs, I am not sure where we can start.<\/p><p> We need better engagement.  I am the first to say that we have some excellent politicians.  However, I am very concerned, because when the members of the public petitions committee wrote to a particular Minister in this Government, they got a document back saying that the whistleblower legislation is very robust and is the envy of other countries.  I do not know whether it is the case that the Minister does not understand what we are going through, or whether he wrote that document himself, for me, as a whistleblower, it is concerning and alarming.<\/p><p> To succinctly answer the Deputy's question, I reiterate the point that I put my trust in my local representative to represent my interests.

I see restitution as being the focal point of setting this right in the new legislation.  It should be timely.  There is not much point in kicking it out for so many years until someone dies, and that is the aspiration and the reality of it.  I see huge implications for younger whistleblowers who have young families.  I was one of the more fortunate ones in that I was older.  Yes, I had losses and it took 17  years of really good living from me.  I had to go to the High Court to have my good name reaffirmed because I have an adult family.  I have been victimised by the procedures but I am not a victim.  I am a survivor.  My heart goes out to the younger people with young families with their homes and careers absolutely destroyed because they did the right thing.  There is nowhere for them to go.  I must tell the committee I am not an isolated case.  I cannot comment on it but I have seen cases in the local authority where this has happened to people who raised their head above the parapet.  With all due respect, there needs to be, as I said, a shift from the top down.<\/p><p> Deputy Casey is talking specifically about the legislation.  Somebody must be in charge.  The Minister is an elected person there by virtue of a democratic system, flawed as it might be.  He is the corporate soul and a person one should be able to apply to.  He should be properly resourced and in a position to appropriately investigate.  As was said, it is not down to the perpetrators.  This is the big joke.  It is like a three-ring circus.  It goes from one to the other.  It goes from one person to their cousin, to their friend, to their partner or whoever.<\/p><p> We need a very firm section in that legislation that deals with restitution and with the protection of giving the evidence.  Very few people who come forward do that willingly.  It is a heart-wrenching exercise to have to go through.  You do not want to get yourself in that position but you need somewhere to go.<\/p><p> To go back again to the restitution, it should reflect the losses and reflect where a person is in their career.  If somebody has lost their home over it, that should be reflected.  If you want a quicker solution to this, you should look at penalisation of the perpetrators.

Let us say it is the Minister for fisheries, although we do not have one, then it will stay with whoever comes into that ministerial role because the Minister, in accepting that disclosure, is not actually acting in a private capacity but as the corporate soul.  It should stay with the Department or wherever to which it was originally made.<\/p> <p>  Something very important, which has not been addressed at all, is communication with the whistleblower.  In my case, my stuff was all given to the local authority and I saw nothing.  I was not entitled to read anything that was said about me.  I got little snippets through FOIs, although I was denied the bulk of the material.  The victimisation and the retaliation is something but the penalisation is very covert.  In my case the retaliation was done from a distance and it often takes people a few years to find out how they have been retaliated against.  In this, there is the loss that has been experienced and then the loss that is happening now, and there is a further interference with people.  As happened in my story, if people further engage negatively with their employment there should be some mechanism there to come back.  I go back again to the perpetrators.

It is very important we have accountability and that somebody is held accountable.  When a bona fide whistleblower makes a complaint and if and when it is upheld, it is vitally important to instill confidence in other whistleblowers that there is accountability and somebody is made pay the price.<\/p> <p>  I mention something Mr. Brennan said earlier which I have a little difficulty with.  If I heard him correctly, he spoke about people who make disclosure and do not follow them through.  I have a problem with that.  If somebody makes a bona fide complaint, he or she should be willing to follow it through.  It is like throwing a hand grenade into a crowded room and then running away.  Maybe I am wrong on that.<\/p> <p>  Another very important point is this legislation should deal with people who make false complaints.  We are here to discuss the concerns of bona fide whistleblowers.  It is vitally important to include in any legislation penalties for people who deliberately make false allegations and portray themselves as bona fide whistleblowers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021092200002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Wilson"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses very much for coming in and for all the work they have done for the State and the people over the years.

The organisations involved were everything the National Museum of Ireland to the Defence Forces to the Prisons Service.  A couple of things strike me.  One is that the whole process is not very transparent, even for an elected representative trying to find out whether a protected disclosure was submitted, what its status is, has a decision been made on it, etc.  Thus there seems to be a problem with transparency there.  The people who submit the protected disclosure have a significant problem with transparency.  They do not receive information on how long the process is going to be or who is going to be talking to them.  They might only have a conversation with one person over a period of years.  Even making the process of the protected disclosure more transparent to its author and to elected representatives on his or her behalf would add light and maybe help the process, would it not?

Often they did not know if anything was being done, if something was being done or what the situation was.  In our firm, where we mediate between disclosers and employers, one of the things we have done from the start is to provide a two-weekly feedback.<\/p><p>It may just be to state there is nothing to say because we are dependent on whoever is actually looking at the thing and it is possible nothing is happening, but it is very important.  It can be a very lonely place for someone who has plucked up the courage to make a disclosure to be on their own.  One of the welcome provisions of the new legislation is the requirement that is in it.

Everybody knows if you ask an organisation to investigate itself, it will not do an independent job.  An external investigation is the best way to make sure things are investigated properly.  In addition, I do not have as much confidence in elected representatives as some of the witnesses.  I honestly believe many Ministers are captured by, and very dependent on, their Departments.  I spoke to a Fine Gael Minister once who told me he was surrounded by a dozen people with degrees and master's degrees who had worked in the Department for more than 25 years; he was told in a hundred and one ways why things could not happen, etc.<\/p> <p>  My instinct on this has always been that we should have a permanent office within the State with experienced resourced individuals whose only job is to investigate difficulties happening within the State, right up to commissions of investigation.  We know there are commissions of investigation that have been ongoing for years, are costing the State heaps of money and are never really getting to the heart of the problem.

What the Deputy is describing is fantastic and it is the type of remedy that is probably required for whistleblowers.  The difficulty is in the setting up of that and the importance of the words used in respect of it.  For example, whistleblowers are very familiar with the phrase \"an independent external investigator\".  I have dealt with nine different external investigators at this stage to whom I have been referred.  These are firms that would perhaps have an expertise in the audit world, the human resources world or the legal world.  They are professionally very equipped to carry out the kind of investigation the Deputy referenced.  They are private firms but are paid for from the public purse.  As I said, the difficulty is in the wording.  While these are independent external investigations, I have experienced difficulties in that the terms of reference for the investigation were set by my Department.  It has then immediately got control of what the independent external investigator can investigate.  The external investigators I have dealt with - as I said I have dealt with nine - were all extremely professional, were very sympathetic to me, were very kind people and were very capable within the sphere of influence of the work they were doing, but their hands were completely tied by the terms of reference.  I could mention other events, factors and incidents but the investigator would be precluded from investigating them by the terms of reference set by my Department, so exactly how independent is this external investigation?<\/p> <p>  The next problem are the phrases in the current legislation and in the proposed amendments referencing the updates that will be provided to whistleblowers so they will not be left in this black hole.  What is an update?  What does it mean to you and what does it mean to me?  I received an update recently, which was a one-line email stating that the investigation of my protected disclosure was ongoing.  That was it.  The Department I was dealing with met its obligation to provide me with an update, but the update provided me with nothing new.  I have no new time period and I was not given any new information.  This is the type of difficulty we are up against.<\/p> <p>  We are all familiar with the phrase \"lessons have been learned\".  The only ones learning lessons are departmental public servants, public service departments and Departments within government.  They are learning how to circumvent the Protected Disclosures Act on issues such as external investigations.  They are finding ways of delivering what is prescribed under the Act but not in a way that is delivering any redress, any answers for whistleblowers or actually delivering anything proper.  I have experienced senior public servants using public money to retain honest, professional and good independent external firms to produce investigations and reports that everybody knows are going nowhere and will not solve a problem.  They are effectively wasting public money on ineffective reports just to tick the box to say, \"oh, we had that protected disclosure investigated externally and independently and it wasn't upheld\".

The person who pays the piper often chooses the tune, to a certain extent.<\/p> <p>  Timing is a big issue.  I know of people who have protected disclosures languishing for long periods of time.

I will draw attention to the fact that the amendments to the Protected Disclosures Act proposed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have 26 headings.

Currently, what is mentioned in the amendments about time limits is that the Minister proposes investigations will \"diligently follow-up...having assessed the matter.\"  Again, we are back to the strength of words.  What does \"diligently follow-up\" mean?  That will mean something different to everyone here.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if many people are familiar with the fact there is already a ten-week timeline in place.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform put out a tender for a panel of external independent investigators.  Under that tender, a framework document was agreed whereby those investigators would perform a function for the Government in exchange for public funds.  The minimum mandatory requirement in that tender agreement is that the investigation must make findings within ten weeks - 60 days.  In the event they do not make a finding within 60 days, they must provide a reason to the discloser.  This is completely ignored.  Nobody abides by this requirement.  I have had an investigation ongoing for four years.  I submitted a complaint in September 2017, a firm was appointed in March 2018 and it is still ongoing.  The time limits are a major matter but they need to be addressed in a definite way.  There has to be a reason for going above and beyond the time period because it is being used as a weapon against whistleblowers to frustrate us.

That is mainly done through corrupt politicians, with particular elected representatives going from one interview board to another.  They make sure their own nominees are employed.

I am also of the opinion that if a complaint is made, the complainant has a right to have the complaint fully investigated by the appropriate body, whatever that body might be.  The protected disclosure in legislation is supposed to give adequate cover to the person making the complaint.  Following from this is the idea of a successful outcome to a complaint, which may be different.  It may not always be possible to achieve the result desired by the complainant for a variety of reasons.<\/p> <p>  I accept the right of everybody to criticise politicians and it is par for the course in this business.  We get it on a daily basis.  We do our best, although we do not always succeed in doing the job we are given.  The answer might be if people are not able to do the job, they should get out.  I assure the witnesses that in my experience in public life, which has come over a long time, I could identify many people to whom I could make that suggestion but I will not do it.<\/p> <p>  The volume of queries we receive is unbelievable.  For example, over one famous weekend not so long ago, my office received 4,700 submissions.  We do our best and even dish them out to different Departments to follow up as the case may be.  Generally speaking, we get a response, but with the volume, one can very often be snowed under.  This does not take away from the fact that there must be a conclusion.  The legislation is supposed to protect the discloser and, insofar as it can be done, achieve a conclusion.  As I have said, one cannot determine what that conclusion might be, and this conclusion may not be satisfactory to the complainant.<\/p> <p>  Many occurrences over the years should not have happened and at various levels in respect of capacities, one has always tried to do one's best to identify and, insofar as it is possible, to address and resolve such matters.  It does not always happen this way and one can look back, with the benefit of hindsight, and say that if A, B and C had been done at the time, it might have brought a different outcome.  That is true and the human being is subject to the usual human frailties.  I am not making excuses for failures to do the job that needs to be done but I am attempting to point out the magnitude of the problem and that difficulties may arise that are not immediately evident.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman and the rest of us on the committee know we have had countless complaints relating to banking and bankers, etc.  I am sure there have been complaints in other departments over the past number of years.  One follows them up as best one can, although one does not always achieve a result that one expects or perhaps feels should be the outcome.  It takes a significant length of time for this to happen.  We do not have unlimited offices or personnel to scale or scope our work.  We do the best we can in the circumstances, although that may not always suffice.  I am not making excuses but we do our best.  I would not like this discussion to pass with the idea going unchallenged that the reason for all of this is corrupt politicians and that there will be no change as long as there are such people.<\/p> <p>  I am sure I speak for the majority of people in the House when I say nobody sets out to avoid statutory responsibilities, and nor should people do that.  I hope that idea continues.  It follows that there may be swings and roundabouts, leading to slippages, and matters may fall between stools, as the saying goes, because of insufficient or inadequate care and attention.<\/p> <p>  I and, I am sure, everybody else have dealt with cases in the past where after looking at a position, we have had to explain to a complainant or complainants that in the circumstances and having regard to what has transpired, there are limits to what can be achieved.  Nobody wants to hear that but it happens often.  This may not be of any great help to the complainant but it might be of some help in allowing people understand that at least information is given to the person concerned at the time.  Otherwise, we could all mislead people and bring them down the road into a cul-de-sac.  I am not in favour of doing that.  I am in favour of checking everything.

I fully understand his referral to the fact that Ministers and politicians in general are in receipt of a huge amount of communications and their workload is large, but I wish to draw his attention to parliamentary questions that were asked by a committee member, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, and also by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  This year they both tabled parliamentary questions to each Department to get a breakdown of the number of protected disclosures since 2016.  Prior to 2016 the numbers were released following the statutory review that was conducted.  There have been 510 protected disclosures between 2014 and now.  If the answers to the parliamentary questions are correct and can be trusted and believed, that is what was identified through the questions tabled by Deputies Catherine Murphy and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.<\/p> <p>  A parliamentary question was asked about one of those protected disclosures.  The Minister for Finance gave details, including the cost, which at that point was &euro;55,000.  The investigation was still ongoing at that time.  A private firm was being paid to carry out an independent external investigation.  The sum is a low and conservative figure, but if one multiplies it by the 510 protected disclosures that are being investigated, it comes to approximately &euro;30 million of public funding going to private firms to investigate protected disclosures and produce reports that can then be just ignored, denied, challenged, forgotten and buried by civil servants because the findings are unpalatable or likewise if they say the civil servants did a great job and there is nothing to see here and they can be embraced.  That is a lot of public money on only 510 protected disclosures since 2014.  It is not an onerous task.<\/p> <p>  I accept the point that we are all human, from the Minister down the line, and we can all make mistakes.  What members must begin to understand is that the mistake has catastrophic effects for the whistleblowers.  We are destroyed mentally and financially.  Our lifestyle and everything is gone.  We are no more.  My home was repossessed.  My career is gone.  My career involved a uniform, much like Mr. Wilson who is here today.  He will know what I am talking about when I talk about being part of a uniformed branch of the State.  The family or organisation I was part of was all taken away from me.  The State is the only one that provides that service.  There was no other Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for Mr. Wilson to join.  There was no other Prison Service for me to join.  I cannot go and get another job.  I am 25 years doing my job, which is a specific State job.  One cannot walk out the door and go and work for somebody else when one falls out with one's employer.

It is one horrible, dangerous road to be cast aside and left alone.  In this isolation and being left alone, the only person we are told to subscribe to is our Minister.  If one stops a person in the street and asks them to name the Minister in a Department, there is a good chance he or she can say who the Minister is.  People can say who their local Deputy is.  Politicians are approachable to us and we can reach out to them.  If one stops the same person in the street and asks them who is the Secretary General of each Department, he or she will not be able to say, because he or she does not know.  These people are invisible oligarchs running the Departments with no accountability for the authority that they wield, so we must turn to politicians.  What we are asking today is for those same politicians to stand up, represent us, protect us and take on board what we are saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021092200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel McGree"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>As Mr. McGree is aware, there is another whistleblower in the midlands who has been fighting a long, arduous battle for more than 30 years, but that is a different story.  Regarding Deputy Durkan's contribution, it copper-fastens the need for an independent office to deal with protected disclosures, as proposed by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  On a personal basis, it is great to see Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n looking so well after his problems.  Thank God he is back to full fitness.  We need a properly financed, independent office to deal with protected disclosures.  It will cost a lot of money, but I take on board what Deputy Durkan said about the volume of correspondence he and other Deputies have received.<\/p> <p>  I respectfully disagree with something Ms Grace said about Maurice McCabe being a success of the protected disclosure system.  He was not a success of the protected disclosure system, or of the confidential recipient system, he was a success due to the wisdom of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton and the honesty and courage of Deputy John McGuinness.  That is how Maurice McCabe was successful.  People should remember that there was another inquiry, led by a retired judge, which was held behind closed doors that was not so benevolent towards Sergeant McCabe.  It is important to put that on record.<\/p> <p>  I take on board also what was said by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, who was doubtful about the independence of people who sit on these boards or are part of these bodies.  I agree with him.  One can stick the word \"independent\" outside any building, but it does not mean that the functions being carried out inside are independent.  It is important that we do not give up.  We have to be positive.  I have suffered.  I do not want to open up old wounds, but life has been very difficult in recent years, as it has been for Ms Grace, Mr. McGree and all bona fide whistleblowers.  It is important that we leave this meeting today feeling positive in the knowledge that this committee and other Members of the Oireachtas are finally going to take this issue seriously.  It is not enough to enact legislation, the one word I want to see, that must leap from this legislation, is \"accountability\".  Until we get accountability, we will go nowhere.

I will address one of the general comments that was made about Maurice McCabe being a case that was successful.  I do not believe any case has been successful.  They have left a huge scar on the lives of the individuals concerned as well as those of their families and extended families.  Quite frankly, I do not believe that any compensation or apology is enough for some of the people who have been treated this way by the State.  Unfortunately, we are dealing with a preference for the <i>status quo<\/i>rather than a desire to do things right by those who come forward and tell the truth.  There is a certain corruption within the State that has caused this to happen.  If that old culture is not rooted out of the State and replaced by an open culture of transparency and accountability, then we will continue to have this ongoing issue.<\/p><p>I would also draw attention to the fact that there are numerous other unnamed whistleblowers, who are currently having their lives destroyed by a State that believes it can kick individuals around using, as Mr. McGree said, taxpayers' money to do so.  Where decisions have been made and results have been arrived at, again, with regard to Ms Grace's case, it is appalling that the Department has dragged out this case for so long.  It is unacceptable that in replies to parliamentary questions, various Ministers have simply paid lip service and made no decision.  There has been no political leadership in Ms Grace's case, demanding an answer, an outcome and an end to that inquiry.<\/p><p>If the officials or the Minister are listening now, I suggest the time has come to draw a conclusion to Ms McGree's case.  Ensure that those who need to be sanctioned are sanctioned and acknowledge those who need to be in terms of their own complaint.  Now is the time to do it.  I will be raising that issue again on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I encourage as many members of the committee as possible, and anyone else who is interested in this, to do likewise.<\/p><p>With regard to Mr. McGree and the Department responsible, his case has been acknowledged within a court, which has upheld the decision and outcomes and yet he has not had any compensation in terms of what was discussed at the time.  It is easy to say it is unacceptable but the State, where it is found wrong, has an obligation to its citizens to honour the outcome of a process.  That has not happened in Mr. McGree's case.  To think that the same issues are ongoing, that nothing is being done and that he is being penalised makes a person have very little regard for the State.  That is how I feel about the three cases before us today.  I would like to see the State acknowledge its wrongdoing, deal with each of the individuals effectively and efficiently, set a timeframe and for there to be independence, and not just independence in name but an office that will clearly stand over its integrity and credibility, and deal with the cases as they emerge.<\/p><p>I cannot speak for all of the members but I am sure they want to do the right thing about whistleblowers and want to see this legislation being robust and so on.  I want to see the cases - the protected disclosures that have been lodged and put in a process - dealt with and sorted.  I do not want to see all of them having to wait until after the legislation has passed.  It is a dark stain on the State that it would allow this to happen and I am going to pursue it in that way.<\/p><p>I would reach out to the whistleblowers, one of whom is based in Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, which has now merged as a technological university, and say that in that case, similar to those of the witnesses present, it is time to draw a line and acknowledge the wrongdoing.  It is time to compensate and support the families concerned and move on.  I will pursue it in that vein.  I have no doubt the members of the committee will revisit this to ensure we get the appropriate legislation that will provide independence and make people accountable.<\/p><p>Each of the witnesses has made a great contribution to this debate on which we can reflect.  I thank them again for coming along today and wish them and their families well.  I give a commitment that this will not be another committee report left on a shelf and that we will be able to take some action as a result of it.<\/p><p>We will suspend the meeting until 3 p.m. when we will meet in private session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021092200002#M00700","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632265200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 2.28 p.m. and resumed in private session at 3 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632265200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 3.36 p.m. until 12.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 29 September 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health","time":1632265200,"counter":403},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 09:30<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 09:30<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Colm Burke, Frances Black, Cathal Crowe, Martin Conway, Bernard J.

Thank you, Chair, for inviting us here today.  I am joined by Ms Bernadette Grogan, our policy and advocacy co-ordinator.  Mental Health Reform is Ireland&rsquo;s leading national coalition on mental health, with more than 75 member organisations working for progressive reform of mental health services and supports in Ireland.  We welcome the opportunity to update members on the need for investment in mental health in the context of the increased need for services arising from Covid-19.  There are three key areas regarding our mental health services that I would like to highlight this morning: resourcing, rebuilding and reforming.<\/p> <p>  Prior to the pandemic, mental health services in Ireland were already under pressure, with long waiting lists, staff shortages and a lack of therapeutic support in many areas.  Investment has been long needed in primary care to improve access to psychology services, talk therapies, counselling, psychologists, social workers and social prescribing.  Covid-19 laid bare the inadequacies of our mental health services.  High quality services demand high levels of investment.  As outlined in our pre-budget submission, the Government needs to increase spending on mental health to 10% of the total health budget.  The World Health Organization recommends 12% while Sl&aacute;intecare recommends 10%.  The UK spends nearly 13% of its health budget on mental health.  Currently, in Ireland, expenditure on mental health is approximately 5.1% of the total health budget.<\/p> <p>  Last week, before the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, said that this figure may not be fully reflective of the range of mental health supports which may be provided across other services and Departments.  The figure was derived from available data and highlights our call for better data on mental health services and outcomes.  For budget 2022, we are calling for an additional &euro;85 million; &euro;20 million to maintain existing levels of services and &euro;65 million to be used exclusively for developing new services to drive change in the system and deal with the current challenges.  The &euro;10 million announced in February 2021 for mental health impacts of Covid-19 has not yet been spent.  This funding must be ring-fenced and the proposed initiatives in place by the end of this year.  All announcements in budget 2022 should be surplus to the &euro;10 million.<\/p> <p>  Effective leadership will be key to driving rebuilding of mental health services.  For that reason, we strongly believe that a dedicated lead for mental health needs to be created within the HSE.  This lead should report directly to the CEO and drive forward the changes needed to realise the Sharing the Vision implementation plan.  We need to build community mental health services to ensure needs are met.  Due to Covid-19, many services provided by the community and voluntary sector moved online.  The past 18 months have seen the growth of e-mental health initiatives and we call for these initiatives to be supported and expanded.  Our Brave New Connections project is supporting capacity building for non-profit organisations, focusing on aspects of their activities and services where they have had to adapt or respond to the challenges of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  However, we must equally be aware of the existence of a digital divide and that some of our most vulnerable and marginalised have been excluded from accessing online supports.  While the additional &euro;1.1 million in Covid-19 funding allocated to the sector was welcome, a significant digital divide remains.  Mental health is not a matter for the health sector alone.  Good mental health for the population of Ireland cannot be achieved without measures being taken by other Departments.  We must reduce the risk factors for poor mental health in crucial areas such as income, employment and housing.  Sharing the Vision includes recommendations for other Departments and we urge a collaborative approach to address all areas which affect mental health.<\/p> <p>  Mental Health Reform welcomed the publication of the heads of the Bill for the mental health (amendment) Bill.  Ireland has an opportunity to introduce person-centred, progressive and non-coercive legislation, which is compliant with human rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and is adequately funded.  We look forward to working with members during the legislative process.  We believe that a draft Bill will be coming before committee imminently.  We respectfully request confirmation of whether this joint Oireachtas committee or the sub-committee will undertake the pre-legislative scrutiny.  We have an opportunity for the pre-legislative scrutiny to be as thorough as possible.  We also have concerns around Part 5 of the emergency measures legislation.  Mental Health Reform calls on the Government to review and repeal Part 5 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 to strike a better balance between the need to protect people from Covid-19 and the protection of human rights. <\/p> <p>  Mental Health Reform looks forward to working with the committees, relevant Ministers and others to ensure that services are adequately resourced, are rebuilt and the legislation is reformed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Coyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Mental Health Ireland would like to thank the committee for the invitation to participate in the meeting today.<\/p><p>We welcome the opportunity to discuss the significant need for investment in mental health and the need for support for people impacted by Covid-19.  There was a huge mobilisation of mental health services and the entire health system in response to Covid-19 and great agility was shown in many aspects of the health service to respond to the unprecedented challenge.  The unstinting work of all those involved is very much appreciated.  In the midst of Covid, the new mental health policy was launched.  Sharing the Vision set out to reframe our understanding of mental health and how we can respond to the full spectrum of mental health need through harnessing the wide range of resources in the community and the health system.  It acknowledges the range of determinants of mental health from housing to employment to the physical environment and more and influences across the lifespan from infancy and early childhood experiences through to later life.  As a leading organisation in mental health promotion, Mental Health Ireland is fully committed to playing a strong role in the implementation of Sharing the Vision.<\/p><p> Covid-19 provides an excellent analogy for understanding how we might respond to the spectrum of mental health need.  We all became expert to some extent on a public health approach to a serious disease - how the most effective strategy was a population-wide approach to avoid getting the disease.  It brought home to us all the power of small collective preventive actions in preventing serious illness and deaths - ultimately ensuring that Covid would not overwhelm our hospitals.  The effectiveness of the public health approach has long been recognised and underpins Sl&aacute;intecare - accessing care at the most appropriate and cost-effective service level with a strong emphasis on prevention.  In a prescient way, the mental health policy Sharing the Vision emphasised the importance of prevention and mental health promotion - broadening the base of the mental health system so that people can easily access support at the primary care level and in their local community only escalating to a specialist mental health service when that is the level of support they require and not because it is the only source of support.  A timely, appropriate response is essential to avoid potentially compounding mental health difficulties through long delays.<\/p><p> What does this mean in terms of our response to the mental health impact of Covid-19?  It means that we should respond to need as it arises in different individuals and in different settings, for example, schools and workplaces.  We know that the Covid-19 crisis has affected individuals' mental health in different ways resulting in loneliness, fear, trauma, unemployment, anxiety, increased alcohol consumption and increased domestic abuse.  These effects require responses from a range of services and agencies.  Specialist mental health services are an essential element of the response for some but certainly not for all individuals.  The challenge in Ireland is that Covid-19 has landed on a mental health service that is already fragile and over-stretched.  Broader-based services in primary care settings and the community and voluntary sector all have an essential role to play.  However, resources for mental health have almost exclusively been directed towards specialist psychiatric services to the neglect of primary care mental health services.  Mental health promotion and building resilience, which we now know constitute the cornerstone of a public health approach, have not been seen as the core business of either mental health services or health promotion services and have not been resourced accordingly.  It is important to say that the choice here is not between specialist mental health services or non-specialist services.  Just as mental health needs exist along a continuum the response to this need requires a continuum of services.  I will not revisit the requirements here, which are set out in detail in Mental Health Reform's pre-budget submission, but investment is needed to maintain existing levels of service as well as to develop the continuum of services recommended in Sharing the Vision.  New capital investment is needed to build new acute mental health units.  Some essential elements of the system have never been built, for example, psychiatric intensive care units to enable safe and effective care to be provided for individuals with a high level of complex need.  In Ireland, we often depend upon the Prison Service to respond to acute need.  Opportunities can be maximised in other capital projects, such as in primary care centres, to co-locate mental health services, which facilitates the provision of integrated care.<\/p><p> In terms of the Government or State role in supporting mental health, where does responsibility lie?  Of course, the Department of Health and the HSE have a central responsibility but the Covid experience has demonstrated how an effective public health response requires many Departments and agencies to contribute to a societal and economic recovery as well as recovery in individual health.  The same is true for mental health.  We know many factors have a role in determining and influencing a person's mental health and we need to become much better at working together.  There are some examples to build on such as the joint policy statement on housing options for older people and the make work pay initiative of the Department of Social Protection.  Over the past year, Mental Health Ireland employed 80 people with lived experience of mental health difficulties but more needs to be done for people with mental health difficulties who have fluctuating conditions so that there is a flexible approach to supports increasing and decreasing as a person's needs change.  Modern and sophisticated social protection systems need to better accommodate this reality in people&rsquo;s lives.  <\/p><p> Looking positively to the future, we can use the opportunity provided by Covid to build a mental health support system that Irish people can be proud of.  What might this look like?  It would be an equitable mental health support system with access based on need and not ability to pay with an equitable distribution of resources across the country.  It would be a co-produced mental health system that actively involves people with lived experience, families and supporters in the design, delivery and evaluation of mental health services.  Crucially, it would be a broader-based mental health system with resources allocated to build existing services as well as developing a full continuum of supports.  It would be an agile and innovative mental health system building on the use of e-mental health supports, which played such a crucial role during the pandemic, while recognising that these are just a tool and not a substitute for face-to-face interaction.  It would be a mental health system that provides good value for money with long-standing existing services subject to the same scrutiny as new initiatives and with the confidence to decommission services that are no longer fit for purpose.  It would be an outcome-focused mental health system with multi-annual budgets directed towards achieving the outcomes of Sharing the Vision and using funding mechanisms to incentivise integrated cross-Department and cross-agency working.  It would be an implementation-focused mental health system.  One of the reasons implementation does not happen in this country is that the implementation process itself is not resourced.  It would be a system with a credible workforce plan that includes retooling and refreshing the skills amongst the existing workforce, which has shown its commitment to the sector.  <\/p><p> We know from our experience with Covid that we can do this.  When faced with a big enough challenge, the individuals and systems involved rose to the challenge and overcame it.  We need to bring the same energy, resources and effort to improving mental health for all.  Mental Health Ireland is hopeful for a better future.  We must now decide to grasp this opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona Keogh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I thank members of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health for attending this meeting, some of whom are attending for the first time.

On the &euro;20 million for the existing levels of service, as the Senator can appreciate, costs rise year on year.  For example, the cost of running a service today will increase next year due to staffing costs increasing or basic costs like rent or electricity.  That is the minimum that is required to run the exact same level of services that we are providing today, next year.  What has happened in the past is that perhaps not enough money has been ring-fenced to provide for existing levels of service and new development money has been used to fill that gap.  The new development money is important for putting in place new services.<\/p> <p>  The Senator made a good point in relation to the services being provided in rural areas.  I am from Gortahork in north-west County Donegal, a very rural and isolated area.  Therefore, I can very much appreciate how difficult it is to ensure that services are in place across the country.  As many members will be aware, currently our services operate from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  A mental health crisis does not happen between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  It can happen at any time, and in particular, perhaps during the night-time hours.  In our submission, we are asking for investment to be put into rolling out 24-7 services across the country.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Coyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I wish to add that e-mental health has a particular role to play in making mental health services more accessible for people, particularly those in rural areas.

It is an additional tool that makes that initial contact more accessible.  It is not a replacement for face-to-face contact.

I know that we have limited time.  I could spend the whole meeting talking about the issues around mental health, but I will limit what I say.<\/p> <p>  In response to Ms Coyle's question on the heads of Bill which will be coming to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny, it is my understanding, and I stand to be corrected, they will be coming to this committee as the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health.<\/p> <p>  There is an issue that I wish to touch on that I was prevented from speaking on in the past.  It concerns Part 5 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, amending the Mental Health Act 2001, that was mentioned by Ms Coyle.  I agree 100% with the witnesses that it needs to be reviewed and repealed.  As the witnesses will be aware, I tabled amendments earlier this year and I did not even get the chance to debate them because of the Government's undemocratic use of the guillotine procedure.  I was effectively gagged, but I am using my opportunity to speak on it today.<\/p> <p>  As the witnesses will be aware, Part 5 of the Act provides for amendments to the Mental Health Act which allows mental health tribunals to be reduced to one-member, paper-based tribunals with minimal personal interaction between the relevant persons.  This legislation was introduced originally to reduce the amount of personal interaction between the relevant persons to prevent the spread of Covid-19.  It was first introduced in the context of an emergency.  However, we have moved on since then.  It is my understanding that there have been almost 800 mental health tribunals since the emergency powers were introduced and these powers have not been used once.  I stand to be corrected on that.  Perhaps the witnesses have more information on that, but it is my understanding that the powers have not been used once.  In my opinion, there is no need for these emergency powers if all the evidence suggests that they are not being used.  We need to protect people's human rights.  It is as simple as that.  I ask Ms Coyle to outline briefly for the committee the concerns she has if Part 5 of the Act is not repealed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#C00600","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":418,"content":"<p>As I said, the emergency legislation was implemented during a unique time in this country, but as it currently stands, it is not compliant with international human rights law.

I have limited time so I will move on.  We have all seen the impact that Covid has had on mental health services.  However, we were in a mental health crisis pre-Covid.  There is no getting away from that fact.  We are now in a mental health emergency.  We have heard the Government announcements over the last while in relation to one-off funding for mental health.  As Ms Coyle said, the &euro;10 million in funding that was announced in February has not even been spent yet.  I accused the Government at the time, and I will stand over what I said, of making the announcement for cheap headlines when the money was not going to the people that I deal with on a daily basis who are providing front-line emergency mental health supports to our communities.  I am not even talking about some of the more traditional mental health supports.  Dr. Keogh stated that a holistic approach is required.  I am not just referring to the traditional front-line mental health supports.  Those working in family resource centres, youth services and direct provision centres are all on the front line of this mental health crisis and emergency.  People are banging down their doors seeking to access the care they need, when and where they need it.  The big issue we have is ensuring that we get the appropriate care to people where and when they need it.<\/p> <p>  I ask Dr. Keogh to outline briefly the benefits of multi-annual funding over one-off piecemeal funding.  It is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#C00800","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":420,"content":"<p>It is a huge challenge for organisations in the community and voluntary sector, in particular, that they are continually looking for a budget every year.  They have no certainty of funding in terms of planning and developing services.  We know that these organisations are a crucial part of that continuum of support to avoid people being unnecessarily forced up to the most specialist level of the system, when in fact the support would be more appropriately provided wherever they are living, in their own homes, or other settings like workplaces, schools and so on.<\/p><p>Multi-annual funding for community and voluntary organisations is an important commitment.  That needs to be tied to those organisations working to meet the outcomes that are set out in Sharing the Vision.  Many of them already do that but we could be better at setting out that we will give them annual funding to do this, this and this.<\/p><p> Another important thing that could be done within the front-line mental health system is to maybe be more imaginative and flexible in who is being recruited.  There are shortages in certain staff groups or certain specialties and rather than continually going to the marketplace, knowing that we will not be able to recruit from certain groups, if we look more specifically at need within a team or within a local area and maybe recruit to fill specific needs such as family therapists and people who have specific psychotherapeutic skills, who would obviously be appropriately trained, accredited, registered, etc., that would go some way to addressing some of those gaps.  While the workforce is built, that is another parallel piece of work that needs to go on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona Keogh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I will let Ms Grogan in for a minute or so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#D00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":423,"content":"<p>Thank you so much.

This is my first time on this side.  Some of the members know me from being a parliamentary assistant in the Houses since 2014 but it is a very different experience this morning.<\/p> <p>  I just wanted to jump in on this point.  Obviously, it was welcome that &euro;1.1 million was made available to the community and voluntary sector to move to online spaces due to Covid.  As Dr. Keogh said, it does not replace face-to-face.  As part of Mental Health Reform, we are undertaking a project called Brave New Connections and part one of it was launched recently with survey results.  That was basically a survey of our members about how they were working in Covid times and how it was for them working online.  Some 80% of the respondents said that they work directly with service users while 95% of them expanded their services to online options.  Some 70% of them said that they had difficulties but one of the main difficulties was on the service user side - people having access to laptops, tablets, mobile phones.  Of those surveyed, 65.5% said that they had technical issues.  Again, it is that whole joined-up thinking in terms of providing the funding but will the people who need the supports be able to access it?  <\/p> <p>  At last week's Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health, Senator Dolan mentioned the libraries and the education and training boards, etc.  Again, it is that cross-governmental cross-Department attitude towards access.<\/p> <p>  On the &euro;10 million Deputy Mark Ward talked about, and it is great to see him healthy and back again after his fight with Covid, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall recently asked some parliamentary questions on our behalf, trying to find out what initiatives were in place.  The Minister said that they were still looking at initiatives and they wanted to see what the priority areas were.  That is all great but, as the committee will be aware, it is the community and voluntary sector organisations on the ground which are dealing with this daily and they deal with vulnerable people and people in need to whom you cannot say to wait until the end of quarter 4 2021 and then you will get back to them.  That is why multi-annual funding is important.  It allows important services to be able to plan, and also contingency plan.

We have already spoken about the need for a cross-governmental approach so that we break down this notion that mental health is for the Department of Health alone.  We need to look more broadly at it and we need to have meaningful engagement and commitment as well as money and investment from other Departments.  Quite often what has happened is that a Department would be willing but when it would come to putting money on the table, it would look to see whether the Department of Health provided the funding there.  That is something that has to change.  The Sharing the Vision document outlines very well that necessary reform of moving to a system where service users have such a say in their mental health journey.  Everyone who accesses mental health services may need a different service, everyone's journey is unique and we need a service that has those doors for people to open.  There is a lot there.  On the reform of the Act, maybe I can pass over to Ms Grogan to quickly make one or two points in relation to what needs to reform in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#D01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Coyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I am obviously new with Mental Health Reform.

Obviously, it is a long-awaited amendment of the Mental Health Act to bring it into compliance with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which we ratified in 2018, and with human rights law.  It has been functioning outside of human rights legislation for a long time.<\/p> <p>  The heads of the Bill are interesting, but I suppose one of the things we were looking at is that the 2015 expert group's 165 recommendations were brought forward prior to the ratification of the UNCRPD.  We can speak about things being person-centred, individual care plans and listening to the person but there has to be a whole culture change in moving away from the biomedical models and looking at people.  There is a huge opportunity now for the Oireachtas with the amendment Bill.  We had the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act in 2015.  Not all of that has been commenced.

Sometimes, there can be a response that does not take full account of the person's life experience and what has brought him or her to that point and is instead just about fixing the presenting problem.  Sometimes, a little more time and engagement are needed.  The model would involve listening to and engaging with the person and identifying what his or her priorities are instead of moving too quickly to determining how to fix the presenting problem.  A great deal of work has been done on this model.<\/p> <p>  I am trying to remember the actual term for it, but a dialogue programme that has been running in west Cork involves a system of assessing and working with individuals and their families that has been successful in Finland.

A team comes together, the person and his or her family members are there if that is what he or she wants, and they work together to establish what the issues are and how they can be resolved.  Care planning is a part of that approach.  The care planning process can sometimes be seen as overly bureaucratic, but if it is done well and properly, a care plan is a jointly produced programme wherein the mental health professionals, the person and his or her family have to work together.

Everything in it was not implemented and there is still a long way to go on staffing levels, but it brought about important changes in the mental health system and it set out the infrastructure we are now working towards.  Implementation has been painfully slow, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  The implementation structures in Sharing the Vision have been much more sophisticated from the outset, which was one of the difficulties with A Vision for Change.  There is a very well-worked implementation group with a number of panels working to it.  We have learned much more about how to go about implementation.  In recent years, the mental health directorate in the HSE has adopted a very interesting approach to resourcing implementation.  That was one of the points I made in my opening statement.  We can sometimes think implementation is a magic process and if we really want to implement Sharing the Vision it will somehow happen, but we need to resource that process.  It involves change and we all know that change, for structures and individuals, is difficult.  We have to learn new things and change how we might have done things in the past.

Everything we said today is echoing this cross-governmental approach.  There is no health without mental health.  All aspects of everything affect our mental health.

Joint funding is another way to really incentivise it.  A joint funding package is put forward in respect to housing and mental health, social protection and mental health or justice and mental health and it is seen as a win-win rather than Departments having to compete and fight with each other.  This is a win-win for everybody, but most importantly the people who need the supports.  The First 5 strategy for young children and families is a really good example.  If we can get that early intervention, we know it is such a worthwhile investment.  It is that approach to very long-term, slow and incremental gains.  Nobody will be able to see big things it can point to within a political term and say \"we did that\" but in ten, 15 or 20 years' time, we should be seeing gains across society in terms of lower levels of criminality and so on if we can get in early and really support children and families.

I will set into it.  I must agree entirely with the comments of our witnesses on the general availability of mental health services at present.  As Deputies, we all deal with many cases of parents with children who have mental health problems and attempting to gain access for treatment in a hospital or sometimes even to an accident and emergency department is nearly impossible.  There seems to be a lack of awareness of the seriousness of the problem as it affects mental health patients.  There does not seem to be an alertness to the fact that if the issue is not dealt with in the early days it can get dramatically worse in a very short time.  That also applies to adult patients.  We have all dealt with, and continue to deal with, cases, for example, where a patient is not co-operative, is suicidal and does not want to be helped in any way but a way must be found to encourage the patient and to deal with the situation.  A patient cannot be allowed to float in the wilderness with no assistance, no place to go and nobody to reach out to.<\/p> <p>  The number of cases where a patient is discharged prematurely, sometimes in the middle of the night, with no place to go, is alarming and appalling.  That practice did not start recently.  It started about 20 years ago.<\/p> <p>  The decongregation of mental hospitals was never probably planned, funded or implemented.  It still is not.  As long as it goes on, we will have major deficiencies.  We will have breakdowns in the system.  For example, a situation occurred not so long ago where a juvenile patient, who was severely affected, injured himself to the extent that he needed hospital treatment.  He was brought to an accident and emergency department and waited all day and all night there.  What in God&rsquo;s name has gone wrong with the system?  The parents and the families are very frustrated.  Only for the families that follow up and the mothers, fathers or family members who stay in hospitals overnight continuously to insist on treatment for their child or sibling, the whole system would break down.<\/p> <p>  There is a necessity to identify the basics that have to be put in place as a matter of urgency.  Whatever it takes to fund that, we have to do it.  We are obliged as a society to respond to the health and all the other needs of our society, but we need to deal with this issue as a matter of urgency.  We have all dealt with extreme cases where we believe something should have been done and ask why it was not done and who is to blame.  The blame game is no good to patients who have injured or harmed themselves.  The necessary service needs to be put in place.  Whatever funding that requires must go with it.  If we do not do it now, it will get dramatically worse.  It impacts on all of us if we do not take the necessary action.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to go on about it.  Most of what I want to say I have said many times previously.  I know what the witnesses are saying.  They will get a good hearing here.  I am not saying anything by way of criticism.  This is a fundamental issue and the Department of Health and all involved must examine the seriousness of the situation and deal with it as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#H01200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Do any of the witnesses wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#H01300","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I will.  I thank the Deputy for his comments.  I was delighted to see him still in his summer suit the other day in the Chamber.  His point is excellent and it is why we have been calling for a national advocacy service for young people and adults in mental health services.<\/p><p>As the Deputy so rightly stated, there are parents who will stay in the accident and emergency units and who are constantly advocating for people.  That is great for people who have supports.  What about the people who do not have anyone to advocate for them?  Perhaps their supports are in services which are provided by some of our member organisations.  It is heartening to see that advocates are mentioned in the new heads of the Bill but this is talking about individuals.  I would be interested to see if we will be drilling down more into that to say that this could be a support organisation because not everyone has an individual to advocate for them, particularly if one has enduring mental health issues.  A national advocacy service is something that Mental Health Reform has been pushing for for a considerable period of time.<\/p><p> On the point of parents advocating for their children, I wanted to inform the committee that the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland is one of our members.  It got in touch with us today to tell us about a child in Mayo who has Huntington&rsquo;s disease, who will be waiting two years to access the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and who has acute anxiety.  We were talking earlier about the Eircode lottery but this is completely unacceptable.  We know that there are more than 2,700 children are on waiting lists for CAMHS, with hundreds waiting more than a year.  This is very dangerous.  An advocacy service would help that, together with an independent complaints mechanism which does not exist at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#H01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Buckley next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#J00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#J00300","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I am afraid we cannot hear the Deputy.

I will make a number of brief points.  There is a similarity between both organisations presenting to the committee today.  I believe Dr. Keogh referred to care being based on needs rather than on the ability to pay, which is spot on.  This can be a very significant barrier.  It is tough enough to get any assistance when it comes to mental health but if one has the cash one has some chance of getting one&rsquo;s foot in the door.  I know from being on the Sl&aacute;intecare committee and on the Committee on Future of Mental Health Care, that we always reiterated that point.<\/p> <p>  Touching on the community and voluntary sector, which is a vital cog in the service, the professional side of the HSE and recruitment has been a very significant issue.  Our witnesses are correct in referring to the need to think outside of the box in that if one cannot get a specific professional, one should  get the next best person, which is better than not getting anybody.  We had discussions yesterday on another committee on retention.  One particular post was advertised for 13 years and was never filled, which was crazy.<\/p> <p>  Our witnesses mentioned schools and funding.  I see that back in 2020, &euro;2 million was proposed for third level education and for extra help in some universities because of anxiety and mental health issues.  That was not spent either.  A great deal of money has been promised but is not going to where it should be.<\/p> <p>  Ms Grogan mentioned the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act and other Acts such as the Mental Health Act.  They have been very slow and without progressing those as fast and as hard as we can, we are not going to achieve what our guest speakers have sought to achieve, which is a proper functioning mental health service within the country.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the Midleton Centre for Autism funded by the Department of Education, which is the only all-Ireland specialist autism centre.  With Brexit and discussions on a united Ireland coming down the tracks, is there any way we can give this issue an all-Ireland dimension?  We are an island and we can learn from each other on this.  Are there ways of working through this issue in that way?  <\/p> <p>  Briefly, we are talking here about mental health, its reform and on working and finding proper models.  Yesterday, a number of members of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health discussed the closure of a mental health facility in my own town, a facility that is working perfectly.  It is one of the best which has not had a case of Covid-19 and yet the HSE has decided that it will be shutting this facility next month because of lack of funding for structural issues.  What would our witnesses reading be of such an issue?  One has a model that has been working perfectly for years but constant Mental Health Commission reports have flagged issues that have not been reacted to by the HSE, where it has not invested in the building.  That service could now be lost and the patients in that facility are now to be removed.  If I was to have told our witnesses this last year, what would their reaction be to that have been?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#J00500","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Who would like to take that question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#J00600","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Keogh wish to come in on this question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Coyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I will speak on the scope of the all-Ireland piece.

There is a need for services to be continually maintained and upgraded down to basic structural maintenance.  Ms Coyle spoke very clearly in her contribution about how &euro;20 million is needed just to maintain the existing level of service.  That is part of what the funding is for.  Things break and buildings need to be painted, maintained and kept to a certain standard.  I am aware that several acute inpatient units need upgrading and, indeed, in some cases new units are needed.<\/p> <p>  I will speak on the scope for all-island co-operation and perhaps the related issue of out-of-Ireland placements that are made, which comprise a very small number every year.  This involves people with very complex needs.  Sharing the Vision was quite strong on the need to develop expertise within Ireland and that expertise definitely exists here to support these individuals who should not be exported to other jurisdictions to meet their needs.  This can be a very tailored individualised package and can be expensive but we are already paying extortionate sums, in some cases, to have people supported.  It is essential to have that expertise and that a funding model to support that is developed in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Keogh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#J00900","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Crowe to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#J01000","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

I was contacted around this time last year by a number of parents in my constituency to say that eating disorders were spiking again among young people and that there were not enough dieticians in my district of CHO 3 and, indeed, nationally.  We organised a campaign within the constituency, which was very good.  In March of this year we received confirmation from the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, that a new dietician would be appointed to University Hospital Limerick.  Do we an adequate number of dieticians in the country?<\/p> <p>  Dieticians serve two very important roles.

When we historically think of mental health, we may think of a psychiatrist, psychologist or psychiatric nurses but there is a very important need for a multidisciplinary team, so that the community mental health teams are made up of various disciplines, including dietitians, social workers and occupational therapists.  We know that across the country our community mental health teams are not at full capacity and that there is a need to look at that to ensure those positions in place and are delivering the services to the communities.

Prior to my election to the D&aacute;il I was a primary school teacher.  On a typical school day there was a range of school supports for children.  There were also outside of school therapeutic supports and supports provided by the National Educational Psychological Service.  Throughout the Covid pandemic many of the needs of our young people were not fully met.  Teaching was done online and we all got to know about Zoom.  We did not know Zoom existed 18 months ago and suddenly the whole of Ireland was using it.  Some of the many key therapeutic supports have to happen in person, and I get that, but many could have been offered online.  Do we have much catch up to do in this regard?<\/p> <p>  Will Ms Coyle also weld into her response, if she does not mind, a reply to the following question?  In my constituency of Clare I have long had a concern for the rural male farmer.  This has been characterised in a number of dramas.  Some years ago, RT&Eacute; had a series that portrayed rural isolation and the depression it can lead to.  There is a huge campaign about testicular cancer, prostate cancer and male health.  The reality is that in many Irish villages we still have rural isolated bachelor farmers.  I do not believe their needs are being adequately spoken about.  The rural pub was a release for many of them and it has not been there for the past 18 months.  They have become more withdrawn as a group.  If Ms Coyle would respond to these questions I would hugely appreciate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#K00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I might ask Dr. Keogh to contribute on the second question.  I understand Mental Health Ireland has a partnership with the IFA in this regard.  With regard to e-mental health, before the pandemic Ireland, it is fair to say, was not as advanced as some of its European counterparts in utilising online technology for various reasons such as that the broadband structure needed to be strengthened.  Overnight we saw a move from face-to-face to online technology.  There is no going back.  These technologies are great and perhaps allow us access a larger number of service users but they are not suitable for everyone.  Not everyone has the hardware or technology to log in.  I have been acutely aware of how expensive video calls are.  They eat up data.  Many people are in the privileged position of having a contract with unlimited data but for others on pay-as-you-go it can be quite a significant cost.  In our pre-budget submission we have asked for funding, particularly for the community and voluntary sector.  Overnight these organisations changed their services and they are developing new models of care.  We have asked that funding be set aside to support this work in the years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Coyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Mental Health Ireland carries out activities with regard to individuals, households, communities and workplaces.  With regard to communities and workplaces, a small country farm can be a very isolated place.  In the past, Mental Health Ireland has partnered with the IFA.  We also partner with Coillte and Get Ireland Walking.  This highlights the importance of having flexible agile players in the community and voluntary sector that can respond to specific needs by partnering with other organisations with a remit in the area.  The need for supports for people in very isolated settings points to the need to build up a real community of support.  This is not really about specialist mental health services.  This is about having a rich enough diversity of organisations that are attuned to mental health needs and mental health supports and well-being without having to provide a formal mental health service.  It really is crucial.  The loneliness forum has done much work in this area and has made some very concrete suggestions.

I am a Senator based in Ballinasloe, which is very much a rural area.  Mental health is a huge issue in our area, as is protecting people and making sure they are safe.  I read through the submissions and looked at the website.  We speak a lot about waiting lists.  I am very interested in how we are using innovation to tackle these.  The witnesses probably have a number of ideas on this.  I posed a question to the Minister on what projects are being done by the e-health section in the HSE that are focused on mental health.  Do the witnesses have any ideas on this?  We are seeing the largest budget ever for mental health.  It will be approximately &euro;1.1 billion this year.  It is the largest budget in Irish history for mental health services.  It is focused on capital infrastructure and building acute 50-bed units.  We need to see more of them.  In Roscommon we just have Roscommon University Hospital with a 22-bed unit.  We need more in community healthcare west.  Some early intervention steps have been taken, such as the community crisis cafe set up in Galway.  I am curious to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on this.  I believe it is very important, along with ideas such as telehealth.  How will we use technology to reduce waiting lists?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the point made by Deputy Crowe, the submission mentioned the cross-focus between various Departments.  Healthy Ireland in the public health section of the Department of Health involves local authorities.  \"Make a Moove\" was an initiative in north Tipperary in an area close to mine.  It tackled mental health in farming and how to engage with the cohort of farming families.  I want to highlight Men's Shed, which is crucial.

Therefore, those proposals are still being examined.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State&rsquo;s reply continued by stating that \"it is envisaged that initiatives will be starting in Quarter 4 2021\".  That is the only information we have.  We would like to see that &euro;10 million provided as part of Covid-19 initiatives progressed and spent separately from whatever other measures may be introduced in budget 2022.  We are calling for the provision of an additional &euro;85 million in the budget.  Drilling down into our pre-budget submission, though, it can be seen that there is a call for the provision of &euro;10 million in the context of mental health services in respect of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and then another &euro;120 million for the Department of Social Protection, but we did not want to scare the members too much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#L01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":525,"content":"<p>That is fine.

Regarding the idea of a structure to co-ordinate mental health issues between Departments, mention was made of the importance of tying the different approaches together.  Do the witnesses have a model or structure in mind that they believe might work?  I was previously a member of the all-party committee dealing with disability issues.  Representatives appeared before that committee from the Department of the Taoiseach and the other Departments involved in the area.  Civil servants also came before the committee from all Departments and they were also tied into the committee.  In addition, they came back to the committee with ideas they had regarding how to move that structure forward.  As a group, do the witnesses have any ideas in that respect?<\/p> <p>  Early intervention was also mentioned.  We are much better now at recognising children on various spectrums, etc., and, as a society, we are identifying more instances of such needs to be addressed.  As a result, that is putting great pressure on services.  Depending on the location, people could be waiting up to two years for their child to be assessed and then maybe another two years for the supports to be put in place.  Has research been done on the impact that experience has on families?<\/p><p>In particular, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence of the impact that has on relationships.  There has been huge strain on the family, in particular, the break-up of marriages, etc., due to those supports not being there.<\/p><p> With the impact of Covid, many of the support groups that we had for mental health and other areas were closed.  Some responded through Zoom.  In many cases, it did not help.  As for the impact that will have on waiting lists, we reckon they will multiply.  There will be huge numbers as a result.  If we go back to children in those situations who are waiting on those assessments, the waiting list will be longer for those supports to kick-in.  Would one see that &euro;10 million sitting there waiting to be spent as one of the areas of priority, particularly for those children?<\/p><p> Lastly, what of those who contracted Covid, in particular, long Covid, and the impact it had on their mental health?  I am talking about a lot of people whose lives have completely changed, physically, mentally and in every way.  They do not have energy.  People who were very fit are no longer able to walk down to the local shop.  What of the impact that has on society?  Do you recommend that there should be research undertaken into supports for those individuals, but also what we should be doing as a society?  What should the Minister be doing, in particular, to support those individuals who have been impacted by long Covid?  There are a few questions.  Apologies for taking so long.  I note Deputy Ward wants to come in as well.  Does someone want to respond to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#L02100","speaker":"1571","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":536,"content":"<p>There are a few questions.

We also need to be reflective and perhaps self-critical of what has not worked in the past.  What comes to mind is a brilliant initiative that some may be familiar with - Pathfinder - that was looking at mental health services for young people.  That was a multi-Department initiative led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Health and then Department of Children and Youth Affairs that was initiated in 2015 and has still not got off the ground.  We need to be reflective.  Even when we put brilliant initiatives together, why do they not quite work?<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleagues for the other parts of your question.

What comes to mind is the importance of the community and voluntary sector in this.  There is so much research needed and there are community and voluntary organisations working on the ground in areas of their own specialty.  For example, Alcohol Action Ireland has the Silent Voices initiative where it is looking at the impact of alcohol on family life and children living in homes with alcohol misuse.  There is also the HSE report, The Untold Story, which stated that there would be a further 200,000 children on top of the 400,000 people affected by alcohol homes.  There are all of these pieces of research and studies, if we had that structure that would be looking at the overarching aspect of everything.  Focus Ireland has a lot of research done on the impact of homelessness on children.  There are so many areas from birth inter-generational poverty to inequalities that can impact a person's mental health and can set people up with more barriers and more difficulties.  It is about joining all of those dots together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I might speak briefly to the issue of long Covid.  There is a developing response within the health service and the recognition that cross-specialty teams, a bit analogous to the cross-Department work we are trying to encourage, are needed.  Certainly, mental health would be a component of that support that would be needed.<\/p> <p>  We are on a learning curve.  I was looking at some research from other countries and they are still trying to understand what is going on there.<\/p> <p>  It would be a good opportunity to - I know rehabilitation services are being developed - include other post-viral syndromes that have been ignored for a long time.  I am thinking of one but the name escapes me.  Somebody might jump in with it.  It was ignored for so long.  Anyway, it will come back to me.  It is a post-viral long-term condition.  It is the same kind of structure.  I refer to people whose needs across specialties often fall between the cracks in the health services.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the cross-Government structures, I am trying to think back.  There were some very effective structures ten or 15 years ago around implementing social inclusion policies.  The structures need to bring Departments together at a very high level.  One needs principal officers or assistant secretaries sitting on these with decision-making authority.  The key is a joint funding pot that they are responsible for that goes towards achieving agreed cross-cutting outcomes.  That structure needs to be mimicked, probably all the way up to a Cabinet sub-committee and, as the Chairman suggests, also all-party committees, to reflect that.  When one has a similar type of grouping cutting across both the Civil Service structures and the Government structures, that helps to improve delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":539,"content":"<p>And possibly championed by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#M00500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Very much, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":541,"content":"<p>Deputy Ward is looking to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#M00700","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":542,"content":"<p>Thanks, Chair.  I appreciate the chance of coming back in.  I enjoyed the meeting.  I got a lot out of it.  Like a sponge, I soak up everything that goes on here.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses and all the members who contributed to the meeting.  We got really valuable information.<\/p> <p>  A question that I am often asked is, how would you fix the mental health services.  I heard Dr. Keogh saying that we have to do these things incrementally.  It will not be fixed overnight.  People sometimes do not want to hear one say one cannot wave a magic wand and fit it overnight, but we can improve people's lives.  I think that is all that people are looking for.  They are looking for access to services being improved, access to 24-7 emergency mental healthcare and granting mental health care parity of esteem with physical healthcare.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Keogh mentioned early intervention.  Early intervention is key.  If we get the early intervention in at the appropriate time, the people who get this early intervention are less likely to need more acute services going forward.  Even in monetary terms, and I do not like talking in economic terms, it is economically favourable to get the early intervention rather than provide support at a later time when more acute services are needed.  In the primary care services, over 10,000 people are waiting for primary psychology appointments.  The vast majority of them are children.  We need to start staffing those services.  If people can see that there are inroads being made in these, their waiting lists are going down and they are getting access to services, probably not as quickly as they would like but better than they were getting them in the past, that would bring many people with us.<\/p> <p>  There has been talk about the governance in the HSE and the clinical lead would be something for that.  It is difficult to trace any money or governance issues within the HSE, particularly since the cyberattack which has made it even worse because we are not getting any answers back.  It is like trying to get information in a vacuum.<\/p> <p>  They mentioned a cross-departmental approach to this.  There is not a decision made at the Cabinet table that does not impact people's mental health.  I have always said it.  Whether it be housing, economics, health, transport or whatever, whatever decisions are made at the Cabinet table have an impact on mental health and we need to have that mental health voice at the Cabinet table.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Keogh, Ms Coyle and Ms Grogan talked about the cross-departmental approach and how it would work.  I would not have 100% confidence that it would work in its current status.  I will give one example.<\/p><p>In my area of Clondalkin, we have agreed funding for a primary healthcare centre.  It is currently held up due to a row between the Department of Education and the Department of Health over land in Cork.  That is mind-boggling.  There is something that is ready to go in Clondalkin, but there is an issue between them in Cork and this is being used as a weapon between the Departments.  We need to break down these structures.  We must get to a position where civil servants and the Ministers are all involved.  Ms Coyle mentioned joint funding that would work across both Departments, but is there any other way she could see this cross-departmental approach to mental health issues working?  I would be interested to hear that because I believe that is a missing cog.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021092200002#M00800","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":544,"content":"<p>There were many very interesting questions there.

I will start with a few opening remarks and will hand matters back to the Chairman thereafter.  I am the current Welsh Language Commissioner, the person responsible for regulating the standards regime in Wales and England.  This presentation is made in my capacity as Welsh Language Commissioner and my comments will derive from my experience of operating the standards, including their setting and enforcement, here in Wales.<\/p> <p>  The commissioner is a corporate sole, which is a legal entity where all powers are vested in a single person.  The post is funded by the Welsh Ministers and the commissioner is appointed through a public appointments process, with the appointment being confirmed by the First Minister for a period of seven years.  Although the post is not independent of government, it is an arm's length organisation.  It is a quasi-judicial role which requires the holder of the post to adjudicate on cases.  The commissioner is accountable to the Welsh Language Tribunal for all its regulatory decisions.  The tribunal has the power to confirm, revoke or amend a judgment made by the commissioner when setting or enforcing a standard.  Any organisation or citizen may submit a case to the Welsh Language Tribunal.  Beyond the regulatory role, I also employ staff who undertake work to promote and facilitate the use of Welsh through non-statutory means within the private and voluntary sector.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note there are still two statutory regimes relating to the Welsh language.  Devolution gave the Welsh Parliament, the Senedd, the right to legislate in the field of the Welsh language.  The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure came into force in 2011 repealing much of the Welsh Language Act 1993 which preceded it.  Due to the legislative context, the Senedd had no competence to legislate in the area of justice at the time the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure was given assent.  As a result, Part 3 of the Welsh Language Act, which deals with the use of Welsh in the courts both civil and criminal, remains in force.  Under the measures, ministerial approval from Westminster must be also obtained before standards can be imposed on Westminster ministerial departments and, to date, they all continue to implement Welsh language schemes.  However, more than 122 organisations are currently implementing the language standards. <\/p> <p>  It will be easiest if I refer the committee to my written statement for details regarding the process of setting standards, how complaints are investigated and the power of enforcement.

Croeso, if that is the right way to say it.  The commissioner is very welcome and I thank him for joining us.  I have a Welsh brother-in-law who, I am sorry to say, does not speak Welsh but who has a few words, which he has passed on to me.  All of us look at Wales with great envy in respect of the extent to which the national language is enjoyed and seen as a cultural asset to the country.  We would love to have the same strength of numbers among native speakers of the Irish language.  This may not be something which falls under the commissioner's remit but, from what he has said and his written statement, it seems he focuses more on the enforcement of standards and rules regarding the proliferation of the Welsh language.  Is he involved in any schemes or programmes to promote the language or is that something that is done elsewhere?  If he is, can he point us to anything he feels has worked particularly well in promoting Welsh?  I say that particularly in the context of Welsh being a kind of commonality among Welsh people linguistically while Irish is not or not as much as we would like it to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#B00400","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":556,"content":"<p>At the time the measure was introduced, a conscious decision was taken that the commissioner would not just be the regulator.  We retained some duties with regard to language promotion.  In the main, these relate to seeking to ensure private companies and the voluntary sector ensure services are available through the medium of Welsh.  Through the standards, the regulations also provide us with the ability to ensure the public bodies we regulate take steps to promote the language as well.  The Senator will see the language standards do not just relate to service delivery.  They also place responsibilities on those public bodies to assess the impact on language of any policy decision they make.  A certain number of these bodies, including all of the local authorities, also have a responsibility to produce a five-year promotion plan to ensure the usage of the language and the number of speakers increase within their areas.<\/p><p> If I am honest with members, I have to say that during the initial period the standards were introduced, a lot of attention was given to service delivery to ensure reception areas and so on had public information etc. readily available in both languages.  If you look at the investigations that were undertaken during the first three or four years, they mainly concentrated on complaints received which related to the lack of websites being available in both languages, the lack of public information that was available and the lack of staff who were able to provide the service in the Welsh language.<\/p><p> As our office has matured and as the workings of those primary standards have settled down, we have seen our functions move to being much more critical as to whether the standards relating to policymaking and promotion are sufficient.  We are going through the second promotion plans now and they are all being prepared.  Half of the local authorities are preparing their five-year plans this year and the other half will prepare them next year.  We have provided guidance on what we would expect to see in a good promotion plan with the hope that this will improve the quality of the plans.  To be honest, the quality of the first round of plans was not what we would have hoped for and is not what we would expect to see in the second round of plans that are being prepared.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aled Roberts","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":558,"content":"<p>An bhfuil s&eacute; sin s&aacute;s&uacute;il?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#C00200","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":559,"content":"<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; sin go hiontach ar fad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#C00300","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for the presentation and I apologise for being slightly delayed in coming along.

I am particularly interested in that idea of having local authorities make local promotion plans.  That would map well onto our context.<\/p> <p>  One of my big interests is that a well-being framework is being worked on in Ireland in terms of accommodating well-being budgets.  It is something we have spoken to the ambassador of New Zealand about and they have a linguistic and cultural dimension within their well-being framework.  It is something the Welsh have done well in terms of having the seven dimensions accounted for.  I am looking at the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, and it jumps out at me that the role of the Welsh Language Commissioner is identified in a number of places in that Act in terms of his or her role within those well-being measures.  It sets out how the commissioner should interact with the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales.  I would be interested in the commissioner's commentary about whether placing Welsh and Welsh culture front and centre in terms of well-being indicators within a Welsh context has worked well in strengthening his position as a language commissioner?  Does it sit well within this broader reporting framework?  Has it strengthened the legislative basis of the language to have that particular indicator used to measure the well-being of the Welsh nation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#C00400","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":561,"content":"<p>It has strengthened our role and made it clear the language should not be considered purely from a linguistic protection perspective.  One of the seven key aims of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 includes building a successful, culturally diverse and bilingual Wales, and therefore it places extra duties on those public bodies so that they cannot be in breach of what are sometimes quite narrow Welsh language standards.  To do so would also put them in breach of their responsibilities under the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.<br\/><br\/>It is early days as far as proper implementation on the ground is concerned.  There is a requirement on health boards, which have only been subject to the standards since 2019, to include linguistic assessments in their future planning.  There is a responsibility on them to do that under the Welsh language legislation, but that is reinforced through the expectations placed upon them under the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.  To date, we have seen a failure by those health boards to assess adequately the linguistic needs of their populations and a failure of that to feed through into their workforce planning arrangements going forward.<br\/><br\/>The maturity we need within the debate around well-being etc. at health board and local authority levels is something my office would expect because we went through the exact same process with local authorities when standards came through.  What can happen now is that individual citizens can make a complaint directly to my office if they feel their health board or local authority has not taken proper regard of their needs and linguistic requirements as far as their health and social care are concerned.  We have convinced the health boards and local authorities by now that this is not an issue of language rights <i>per se<\/i>but that the availability of healthcare or social care in the language of one's choice goes directly to the quality of the care that is given.  I mention the example of a young child in Wales who is unable to converse in English or an elderly patient who has lost his or her English because he or she is living with dementia.  Whether or not that authority then provides the service in your mother tongue or the tongue you have reverted to impacts on the quality of the care that is delivered.<br\/><br\/>In a roundabout way, I see the situation improving but I would not want to give the committee the impression we are there yet as far as Wales is concerned either, mainly because some of the obligations that are placed on these public bodies have only been in place for two years or so.

It is easy for people to forget that Welsh is a relative newcomer on the scene, both in the judicial and political context, because to all intents and purposes it was previously excluded.

For the government's strategy going forward, it is important we look at usage.  Usage is one of the two main planks of its policy, rather than only increasing the number of speakers.

We also have a body called the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol, which translates as the Welsh National College, which has previously been given responsibility to increase the Welsh language provision with universities.  It has now been given the same responsibility for post-16 further education learning.  The pattern in post-16 is not as healthy as pre-16, but that is because the majority of youngsters in Wales are no longer educated post-16 within schools.  They are educated within colleges and, historically, the provision within in colleges has not been as good - let us put it that way - as it has been in the schools.

However, it is important I explain that, unlike Welsh language schemes, if somebody makes a complaint to us, we have a duty to accept the complaint, provided it is a valid one.  There is no requirement on members of the public to complain to the public body itself before they come to us.  As more public bodies have become subject to the standards, that has created a problem because, and I make this point in the statement, sufficient resources have to be given to the commissioner's office to ensure the capacity is there to deal with complaints.<\/p><p>We also have a situation where there was an understanding between the government and the previous commissioner regarding the maximum number of officials that could be accommodated or employed by the commissioner.  We currently have a ceiling of 46 employees and there is a division of roles between those employees who are within the regulatory field, dealing with standards and language schemes, and those who have responsibility for promotion.<\/p><p> What happened over time is that the number of complaints increased and the amount of time it took to deal with a complaint increased as well.  That caused dissatisfaction with the complainants and the public bodies regarding the amount of time it was taking to resolve matters.  Increasing resources were having to be placed within the regulatory teams, which meant there was a lot of criticism of a reduction in the amount of promotional work that was being undertaken by the commissioner's office.  That transfer of resources led to the Welsh Government's White Paper, going back about three years, in which it questioned whether there was too much regulation and not enough promotion, for all intents and purposes.<\/p><p> Just prior to my assuming the role in 2019, we introduced an enforcement code, as we call it, which gave guidance to individual officers as to whether it was appropriate for a full investigation to be undertaken.  We had to accept each and every complaint that was being delivered.  To give an example, there could have been a complaint that a circumflex had been missed from a letter on a sign.  Under the old regime, it was likely there would have been a full investigation which would have taken 15 or 18 months to resolve, with a report at the end suggesting the public body replace the sign, when in reality the sign had been replaced 14 months earlier because the body had accepted it had breached the standards.  When individual officers receive a complaint, our new enforcement code allows them to make a recommendation to me personally, provided the complaint is valid, as to whether to undertake a full investigation.  They can take into account the public body's previous record with regard to language, and they can look at whether the public body accepts there has been a breach of standards and what action it has taken to resolve that breach.  The officers may say an investigation is not going to gain anything and suggest I do not investigate in this case.  That has led to some friction between me and some language campaigners who have felt I have an obligation to investigate all cases fully, but the Welsh Language Tribunal has upheld all my decisions on the basis I have been reasonable and proportionate in exercising my powers, because the measure gives me discretion as to how many cases I investigate or what types of cases I investigate.<\/p><p> While some of the language campaigners were concerned we were going to be investigating fewer issues and fewer complaints, this has allowed me to release some resources, which means I can then undertake investigations of my own volition.  My monitoring officers might come back to me saying they have been having discussions with a public body now for 12 months and are not making any progress whatsoever on the issue, that the body, in their estimation, is in breach of the language standards that have been placed upon it, and ask me what I want to do.  They would recommend, having looked at all the other tools available to them, that this is a matter I should investigate.<\/p><p> The real difference between standards and language schemes is the only power the commissioner had previously with regard to schemes, and still has for those bodies that are still operating language schemes, was to make recommendations to the body itself, which in some instances might not be implemented or might be ignored.  Now, once there is an adjudication made by me, I place enforcement measures on the body.  Those enforcement measures range between my saying it has to do this by such-and-such a date and a situation where I say to the public body I want it to produce an action plan showing me it will have resolved this issue within such-and-such a period.  If the reality is it is a much bigger issue for it to get to grips with, I might I say I want it to do this by such-and-such a date.  The real need then is the commissioner's office puts sufficient resources into monitoring those enforcement measures and those action plans.<\/p><p> If I am honest, in the early days of standards, once the enforcement measures were actually imposed, there was very little monitoring by the commissioner's officers as to whether they had been successfully implemented.  I became aware there were instances where people were having to complain about the same thing that had been investigated 18 months previously and which should really have been resolved.  We have now put some resources into monitoring those enforcement and action plans, and I get regular reports confirming whether the plans are actually being implemented.  If they are not being implemented, then the public bodies know there will be further consequences to those actions.  Fortunately, to date the threat of public embarrassment for breach of the language standards has been sufficient to ensure most public bodies have ensured all the enforcement measures have been implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#D01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aled Roberts","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":576,"content":"<p>To clarify, the commissioner investigates some cases and feels he does not need to investigate others.

There are some instances where the public body just turns around and says it is not itself but some other public body that is responsible for a particular complaint.  We have some instances of those and we have others where there is a ready acceptance of responsibility, but we might not be satisfied with the explanation given and we want to investigate to understand.  The body may have put its hands up but we want to know how it got into that position in the first place because it assured us previously it had sufficient measures in place to ensure this kind of breach did not occur.<\/p><p> We have a small number of a cases, and I can provide the committee with statistics to give some indication of the number involved, where the public body does not accept responsibility and I have to undertake an investigation.  At the outset of the investigation I can call for evidence from the public body.  I must ensure the call for evidence is sufficiently broad to ensure I have all the evidence before me to come to a reasonable adjudication.  Luckily, those instances are, if anything, reducing in number as the bodies become more aware of the workings of the standards.<\/p><p> Among those bodies where there have been a high number of complaints, there was a tendency for those complaints to be dealt with by the Welsh language unit and the Welsh language officers.  Because the senior management teams within those organisations are concerned about the attention that is drawn to them for breaches of language legislation, we have seen the language complaints increasingly being dealt with by the corporate complaints department, which means the evidence provided to us is substantial and allows us to come to a proper decision earlier in the case.

The public element feeds into the research we undertake.  It was a conscious decision that the government would draw up the standards and present them to the Senedd for debate.

In other ways, it is not, because we have come across instances after the standards have been introduced where the wording used by the government is narrow or does not take into account developments, particularly in technology, that have occurred subsequently.<\/p> <p>  I am more than happy to provide the committee with information on the standard-setting process.

In a previous life, I was a local authority leader who had responsibility for language policy within my authority.  That was because I was one of only three Welsh speakers in the authority.  They thought, \"Who should we give it to?  We'll give it to the leader.\"  I live in Wrexham in north-east Wales which does not have a large Welsh-speaking population.  It is probably at around the 15% level.  I was first elected in 1991.  I can remember instances when officers directly stated in public session that they would not provide services in Welsh.  They are the circumstances I have grown up with in my own area as a first language Welsh speaker.  Members can imagine how that felt.<\/p> <p>  Language schemes were introduced which were, in my opinion, burdensome as far as administration and process were concerned.  At the end of the day, there was a reporting mechanism to what was then the Welsh Language Board, but it was dependent on the information supplied to it by that same authority.<\/p><p>Subsequently, if there was any complaint, even if that complaint was investigated by the commissioner's office because the commissioner was then in existence, all the commissioner could do, as I said previously, was to recommend to the public body what it should do.  There was no real enforcement process available.<\/p><p> I was then elected to the Welsh Assembly as it then was and was a spokesperson on the Welsh language.  I was not convinced at the time, in terms of the language measure that was introduced, that the standards would be anything other than another administrative tool, if I am to be honest with the committee.  However, since 2015 to 2016, the standards have been in existence with local authorities and the Welsh Government in any event.  They have been introduced in Wales sector by sector.  The local authorities, the Welsh Government and the national parks were in the first tranche of bodies that were made subject to the standards.<\/p><p> I can honestly say to the committee, even looking at the authority of which I was previously a member, that the attitude towards the Welsh language since 2016 has altered significantly.  It has not been an easy road but it is one that has involved many investigations against the authority concerned and, as far as some of the elected members were concerned, they felt antagonism towards the commissioner's office which they felt was investigating too many complaints against them.  We now have a healthy relationship with that authority to the extent that all of its public-facing services are now available in both languages, which would not have been the case prior to the introduction of standards.  We have a recruitment policy for reception staff.  Remember, even in an area where it is only 15% Welsh speakers, reception staff would be required to be fluent Welsh speakers as part of their terms of employment.<\/p><p> There are other instances which allow me to use Welsh in my everyday contact with the local authority.  I get my bin collection notification by text every Monday evening reminding me to put my bins out by 7.30 in the morning.  That is sent to me in Welsh only because I am registered as a Welsh speaker with that local authority.  If I had been asked in 2014 whether there was any chance that that local authority would text me in Welsh regarding my bin service, there would not have been a cat in hell's chance of that happening.<\/p><p> It is practical things like that which change the attitude of both Welsh speakers and non-Welsh speakers in a particular area.  Another strength of our system is that we also do not differentiate between areas that have large or small numbers of Welsh speakers.  There are areas in south-east Wales that might have 3% or 4% Welsh speakers and the standards on those authorities are exactly the same.  Realistically, are they going to be able to provide the same level of service in Welsh as Gwynedd or Ynys M&ocirc;n in the north west where there is over 70% Welsh speaking?  The answer is \"No\", but the standards give us the opportunity to ensure their workforce and service delivery planning moves along so that we can increasingly see provision in Welsh for everyday services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aled Roberts","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":587,"content":"<p>What is the number of public bodies involved?

If you read our manifesto call to all the political parties prior to the Senedd elections, we called for the programme of government to include a timeline for the introduction of new standards.  There are two issues here.  The government is dependent on us to carry out the research.  We have carried out the research into the train companies, health regulators, housing associations, and water, gas and electric companies.  We have had a period of three and a half years where no new standards have been introduced.  That, in part, was due to some questioning as to what the future of the commission would be as decided upon by the government.  There was a White Paper introduced which suggested it would actually remove the office of commissioner and would introduce a commission.  During that period of uncertainty, there was little movement as far as the government was concerned.<\/p> <p>  There was also the ongoing debate between my office and the government regarding the division of the regulatory and promotional duties.  That has been clarified now for two years so there was an expectation we would revert to the introduction of language standards.  There has not been any movement during that period.  We understand there are big practical problems in place because the public health emergency here has meant the call on translation services, on lawyers in particular, has been great and there is a resource issue for the government as to the framing of regulations.<\/p> <p>  We have now reached agreement with the government that it will proceed with standards for the rail companies.  That will include Transport for Wales but will also include Avanti West Coast, which runs the services to Holyhead, and GWR, which runs the service to the south west of Wales from London.  They will be subject to the standards.  I also have an expectation that we will move on the health regulators but, as I say, there is a political decision that is taken with regard to the introduction of standards.  All I can do is the groundwork because it is then a political decision as to whether the standards are actually introduced.<\/p> <p>  The other issue, which is something the proposed legislation in Ireland does deal with, is the other shortcoming in our legislation, which is that if a new body is created, depending on the actual legislation that founded the body, there are different ways of making it subject to the standards.  This has meant there have been new bodies created in the past two to three years which operate in sectors that are currently subject to the standards but the new bodies are not subject to the standards themselves.  That includes a body such as Qualifications Wales, which deals with all qualifications, as you would expect, within compulsory education. There is also a new health body called Health Education and Improvement Wales.  I was trying to remember what the title to the organisation was in English.  It is charged with ensuring the training and recruitment of health and social care practitioners is undertaken.  We had an issue where it was not subject to the standards and we were not happy with some of the actions it was taking, to the extent we agreed a Welsh language scheme with the body and I have to say our relationship with it now is very positive.  It shows that there is a gap in respect of the extension of standards to bodies that are created by the Welsh Government itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aled Roberts"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":589,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Uasal Roberts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#G00400","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":590,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Uasal Roberts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#G00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Mr. Roberts is very welcome agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimhe.  Croeso i'r pwyllgor, if I am pronouncing that correctly.  I have been very encouraged by what he has said regarding dealing with public bodies and so on.  He has covered some of this already but how challenging or realistic is the target of having 1 million Welsh speakers by 2050?  What resistance to the Welsh language standards has there been from the civil service, the public or departments?  I recently received a complaint from a constituent who was dealing with Kerry County Council.  She made her planning application completely as Gaeilge but the refusal of the planning permission was completely in English.  A motion was put to Kerry County Council that anyone making an application in Irish would get a reply in Irish.  The reply given was that arrangements are in place for a service as Gaeilge to be provided where requested by a customer.  Obviously the fact her application was completely as Gaeilge was considered irrelevant unless there was a specific request on top of that.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to ask the commissioner something about road signage.  Having driven through Wales, I have seen the signs for Abertawe, Swansea.  Was the changing of all road signs arranged by regulation or was the passing of legislation in either the Welsh Parliament or the other parliament required?  I would appreciate it if the commissioner would answer those two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#H00100","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":592,"content":"<p>As far as the Deputy's constituent is concerned, each and every public body that is subject to the standards is supposed to decide on the language of choice of the constituent.  If a planning application was made in Welsh, it would be expected that Welsh would be registered as the language of choice.  In those circumstances, the standards require that all future correspondence with that constituent would be in Welsh.  Clearly, we have instances where that does not happen but the constituent would then have the opportunity to complain directly to me.  Provided the complaint was valid and if, following a full investigation, that complaint was upheld, I would take enforcement actions against the local authority to ensure it had proper processes in place to ensure that did not happen again.<\/p> <p>  As far as Welsh language signage is concerned, the Welsh Government decided Welsh would come first on all signage.  Previously, although there was a requirement for road signage to be bilingual, which, to be fair, goes back to pre-devolution days, it was up to each local authority concerned whether to put English or Welsh first.  There were instances where you could travel ten miles and, if you passed three boundaries, the signage would change each time depending on the choice of the council.  The Welsh Government changed that so that all new signage has to place Welsh first.  There is also a requirement for signage painted on roads and so on to be bilingual.  Again, the standards ensure complaints can be made in instances where that does not occur.  The only condition I would place on that is the policy only requires signage to be changed when it is being replaced.  The Deputy will probably be driving through Wales from Ireland for some decades yet and still be seeing signage on which Welsh does not come first.

N&iacute;l.  I have a number of questions myself.  The commissioner mentioned earlier that he was trying to get more Welsh spoken in the Senedd.  If he has any hints, I hope he will share them because one of the biggest problems we have is that the level of Irish spoken in the Chamber, although obviously not in this committee, is reducing year on year.  Without this committee, the amount of Irish spoken in these buildings would be a national disgrace.  If the commissioner has any hints, we will try to share.  Obviously, we are supposed to be under schemes and so on but we would like to encourage Deputies and Senators to use more Irish in the Chamber.  There has been debate in the Chambers over the years regarding the desire to be heard in the media, given the sometimes limited time we have to speak, as the media in the main only carries or gives prominence to quotes in the English language.  As a result, many Deputies and Senators shy away from using the Irish they have.<\/p> <p>  Does the commissioner have a role in assessing the impact of legislation?  When legislation is promised or is being drawn up in the Senedd, does he get advance sight of it to make recommendations?  That is something we have encouraged here.<\/p> <p>  I have two short final points.  The commissioner mentioned enforcement and companies being afraid of public embarrassment.  Does the stick go beyond public embarrassment?  Are there financial penalties involved?  This is a debate we have had with regard to the Bill.  The Bill we are working our way through, which will bring in the standards and so on, will be back here next Tuesday.  The debate will start again and will then go on to our own Seanad.  That question is part of that debate.<\/p> <p>  Has the commissioner had the same experience as us during the Covid period?  For example, signage, notices to schools and other documents issued by our health service were totally in English.  It is only when somebody raises a complaint that a notice will appear, often a number of weeks later.  This is true of other services but is particularly true of our health service, the HSE, which issued most of the public statements in that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#H00500","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":596,"content":"<p>It might be worthwhile to put the committee in contact with the Senedd Commission in Cardiff because it faces the exact same issues.  As I mentioned, the percentage of Welsh spoken has been reducing but, as I said, I believe this was due to the reduction in those who spoke Welsh as a first language during the term of the last Senedd.  Clearly, we face the same issues with regard to Senedd members wanting to make a point in English to get exposure in the English-medium channels in addition to the Welsh-medium channels.  There is an action plan in place.  One of the difficulties faced by Senedd members is that it may be the case that their staff in Cardiff do not speak Welsh.  That means a lot of the research, speech writing and so on is undertaken in English.  It is therefore the responsibility of the Senedd members themselves to ensure they are able to make their speeches in Welsh.  There are practical issues, which the Senedd is tackling.<\/p> <p>  We have also had discussions with the government with regard to the amount of background information that is available in both languages.<\/p><p>Members of committees, for example, do not have to translate documentation themselves.  It is now expected that all committee papers will be available in both languages.  If I were to present evidence in both languages, that would be sent out to all committee members within scope.  I am more than happy to share good practice within the Senedd with the committee but I do not want to create the impression it is all sweetness and light.  We have a job of work to do.  The fact the First Minister and the ministers for education and health all speak Welsh as their first language has ensured much more exposure to the language within the current Senedd than there was previously.<\/p><p> We do not have prior sight of language impact assessments.  That is a live issue between ourselves and the government.  We have policy standards and it would be worth it for the committee to look at these.  The policy standards require all public bodies subject to the standards to carry out full assessments of the impact of any policy decision on the language.  This year, we were involved in an action that went all the way to the Court of Appeal in London.  We were of the opinion that a language assessment was not sufficient for proper consideration of a policy.  As a result, we have issued new guidance to public bodies that are subject to the standards with regard to what we expect to see within a language assessment if it is to make a proper job of work of it as far as Welsh is concerned.<\/p><p> We do have the power to enforce a civil penalty on a public body.  This has not been used since the standards were imposed.  Although it is something I would always keep in my armoury, the real purpose of enforcement, to my mind, is to bring about a change of behaviour as far as the public body is concerned.  Where civil penalties are imposed, for example, in areas related to the environment or some economic measures, these penalties will only actually bring about a change in the public body's behaviour if they are enough to cause that body some discomfort financially.  My problem is that the maximum civil penalty I can impose is &pound;5,000.  We have to use this power sparingly and ensure its use is proportionate.  Some of the other enforcement measures that are within my power bring about that change of behaviour much more rapidly than a civil penalty would.  If I was trying to get the chief executive of a local authority to introduce something that would cost a given figure, if the embarrassment of being in breach of the language standards and of being the subject of an adverse report from the commissioner was not sufficient to change his or her mind, I am not sure a &pound;5,000 civil penalty would bring about the change in attitude.  It is within our powers but it is not something that has been used to date.<\/p><p> As far as Covid is concerned, the picture is mixed.  All of the public written communication with individual householders and individuals has been fully bilingual.  We are currently dealing with a complaint regarding some of the arrangements in respect of press conferences undertaken by the Welsh Government and whether the language was given equal status.  We also have a problem in that some of the signage within certain vaccination centres was not bilingual and, in some instances where bilingual documentation was used, the English part was filled in by the health practitioners without asking the language choice of the patient.  We have had complaints from people who are saying their vaccination cards were filled out in English even though they asked for them to be filled out in Welsh.  Those are the subject of investigations.<\/p><p> However, I have to say the concern we had at the outset that Welsh would be put to one side because of the public health emergency was not realised to the extent we thought it would be.  There was an attempt by the government and the public health authorities to ensure information was available bilingually and that proper consideration was given to the language.  Even with regard to the letter from Boris Johnson in Downing Street that was addressed to everyone at the outset of the campaign, I had to have oxygen when I opened my envelope to see that the letter was in Welsh first and then in English.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021092200002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aled Roberts","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>We have a long way to go to reach some of those standards.

I come from the small rural town of Drumshanbo in County Leitrim, a Border county.  I believe passionately in rural communities, community development and social inclusion.  I have seen first-hand the impact of the work of Pobal.  My lived experience is that diversity, equality, justice and inclusion make for a stronger society.  I know that these values give chance and opportunity to those who would not otherwise enjoy it.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of my educational background, I hold a bachelor of arts degree, a higher diploma, a master of arts degree in public policy and a master of science degree in organisational development.  I have studied equality and human rights and recently became a chartered director with the Institute of Directors, studying in detail governance, leadership, finance and strategy.  I have served on boards at local, national and international level and am currently serving as treasurer on the board of the International Coaching Federation.  I hope that these skills will help me make a better contributor as chairperson of Pobal. <\/p> <p>  Passionate about community development and the rural economy, I was a member of the Offaly county development board and have served as a volunteer with the National Adult Literacy Agency.  Key interest areas of mine are the role of women in society, the role of carers and gender equality.  Professionally, I have held key leadership roles in the public sector, most recently as national HR director in the Health Service Executive, HSE.  I am a chartered member of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and a qualified mediator.  I believe passionately in supporting individuals and teams and in developing supportive coaching cultures. <\/p> <p>  As chairperson of Pobal a key role for my board colleagues and I will be to support, challenge and lead our excellent and committed staff to deliver on Government policy, on our programmes and to remember one fundamental thing, namely, that Pobal is not an end in itself.  It is not the object of the exercise but a means to an end, and that end is a stronger society.  It is communities across the country where people, especially the most vulnerable, are better supported.  My time as a Pobal board member and my appointment as chairperson coincide with the conclusion of our current strategic plan which covers the period 2018 to 2021.  My colleagues and I, together with the executive team are deeply engaged with writing and agreeing a new strategic plan, a process that is now in its concluding stages.  <\/p> <p>  The work of positioning Pobal to deliver on Government policy in ways that helps communities most is critically important.  There are lots of metrics by which we can measure outputs but we must remember the fundamental fact that we exist to help people.  The scale of that help and its importance in people&rsquo;s lives is immense.  In 2020, 26,178 individuals and 2,687 local community groups were supported through the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, while 16,939 new participants were approved as part of the seniors alert scheme, SAS.  A total of 1,891 young people with disabilities have been supported through the Ability programme, through 27 organisations nationally, since the programme commenced.  Some 582 community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises received Covid-19 stability fund support, enabling them to continue to provide critical supports and services while 9,123 individuals were supported on T&uacute;s and 3,385 participants were supported on the rural social scheme, RSS.  Subsidies were administered to 46,606 children from 36,236 households under the national childcare scheme while 105,975 children were supported under the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme during the 2019-2020 programme year.  This is a sample of the scale of what Pobal is delivering and demonstrates that its reach into people lives is large.  <\/p> <p>  Every programme is about people and every life situation is unique.  We are there to be a helping hand and a real support.  If the programmes we support are effective then people&rsquo;s lives are enhanced.  That is the context in which my board colleagues and I are working on our strategic plan for 2022 to 2026.  The framework for our new plan will revolve around our vision, our mission and our values.  It is about delivering continuous improvement and about agility in that delivery.  Pobal is now in the process of drafting the content for the new strategic plan across a set of four pillars underpinning our strategic ambition.  Those pillars are people, systems and processes, customers and partners, and governance.  As we conclude the development of our strategic plan for the next five years, Pobal has been engaged in the periodic critical review process.  This periodic deep dive into public organisations is a very welcome opportunity for Pobal to reflect and to take account.  As a relatively new board member, about to become chairperson, I have learnt a lot and taken considerable assurance from the rigor of this process.  A key strategic priority for me as chairperson will be ensuring that the recommendations of the periodic critical review are implemented and that Pobal continues to provide a highly effective service for managing Government grants and payments to communities.  This must be underpinned by high standards in accountability, financial management, and in the support we provide to all those we work with.  Work to date on the periodic critical review evidences that Pobal engages and consults with supported organisations on an ongoing basis to ensure the effective implementation of the programmes they manage.  The ongoing periodic critical review process and our new five-year strategic plan will be the impetus for the standards and the vision that the board and I, as chairperson, want for Pobal. <\/p> <p>  Pobal matters because every day, in towns and villages across Ireland, Pobal staff are on the ground working with communities.  They are delivering services locally to combat social exclusion and enhance lives.  Pobal makes a difference to people&rsquo;s lives and communities every day and it is a positive difference I am convinced can be increased and built upon.  As Chairperson I will define, clarify and agree expectations.  I will invest in open, regular communication and respect the experience and input of stakeholders.  In partnership with the CEO, I will lead a values-based organisation, support and challenge as required, be responsive and ensure the delivery of a value-for-money service for Government which makes a difference for people and communities.<\/p><p>I will lead a board that is focused both on the highest governance standards and on excellent performance.<\/p><p> As chair designate, I want to acknowledge the excellent leadership and commitment to Pobal of every member of the board and, in particular, our outgoing chairman, Professor Deiric &Oacute; Broin.  Deiric has contributed enormously and I express my sincere thanks to him.  I want also to commend the work and dedication of the CEO, Ms Anna Shakespeare and all the staff of Pobal working alongside local and national community organisations to build stronger communities, to support families, to assist individuals and to nurture children every day.  I am deeply honoured to have been nominated by the Minister for Justice, Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands, Deputy Humphreys, as chair designate for Pobal.  I am conscious of the responsibility I have undertaken and I come here today to present my credentials and to pledge my utter commitment to the role.<\/p><p> As with other boards, I hope to demonstrate strategic leadership and to offer an approach that is collaborative and effective.  I very much see the relationship between the board of Pobal and that of this Oireachtas committee as a two-way process.  I would be very pleased to provide regular briefings that are appropriate and useful to the members.  I thank the committee for inviting me today and I look forward to engaging with members in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021092200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosarii Mannion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mannion.  We will now take questions from committee members.  One thing that many Members of the Oireachtas find frustrating is the fact that when agencies such as Pobal, right across the board, are established at arm&rsquo;s length from the various Ministers, accountability to the Oireachtas is only through the parliamentary committee.  The work programme of the parliamentary committee, dealing as our committee does with a broad spectrum of issues, does not lead to a situation where agencies are before the committee on a regular basis.  If some mechanism could be found so there is a clear avenue and route for Members of the Oireachtas to raise specific issues with Pobal and get responses, that would be very useful.  I and many other Members of the Oireachtas have done so in the past and have received detailed replies from Pobal regarding various issues, but having a formalised structure would be of benefit in providing a level of accountability.

Is there anything we can do, when it is a relatively small amount of money, to support such projects?  They sometimes just do not bother because it is too difficult for them.  They may be very small projects with maybe a manager and two or three staff.  They are managing the project and trying to grow, develop and build, and the Pobal funding would be a very small amount of their overall mainstream funding.

My commitment, working with the executive team, is that we are going to reduce those levels of bureaucracy, where we can, while at the same time holding that fine balance so we do not minimise or interrupt any standards of governance or accountability whereby we will be held to account.  There is a fine balance there.  We can do more and we will do more.  At no point should it be prohibitive for a local voluntary organisation working on the ground with communities to enhance social inclusion, community development and all the things I have spoken about in my opening statement.  At no point should our processes or systems be prohibitive to people in terms of engaging with funding.  It will be a key priority, perhaps the key priority, in the new strategic plan, and one that we will show form on and improve on.

One of the things we are all finding across the country is the challenges with funding models as a direct result of the pandemic.  I know Pobal has to make sure that the projects it is supporting are sustainable in the long term.  We are in a very unique circumstance at the moment and it is important that we would ensure there is a certain amount of flexibility during the current climate.  The opportunities to fundraise for community organisations are not there at the moment.  There are issues in regard to the sustainability of some organisations in the short term.  It is important that when assessments are done, they are not purely being done based on the here and now, which, as I said, is very unique, but that we look at the broader sustainability of these initiatives going forward.<\/p> <p>  One other point that I would like Ms Mannion to take away is in a broader area, and it is in regard to the level of female participation on public boards.  Ms Mannion is sadly in a relatively unique position in that she has been a member of a public board, not just in Pobal but also the county development board in Offaly.  That will give her a unique perspective in terms of the challenges across the midlands counties in particular.  We need to do more to encourage women to apply for State boards.  Ms Mannion is in an even more unique club in being a chair of a public board as there is only a small handful of women in that particular role.  As I  said as Minister and as a member of this committee, it would be great to be in a situation where the Minister of the day is forced to appoint a man to a State board in order to meet the 40% threshold.  That is what we should strive to achieve right across the board in order to have a mix of gender.  We also need a mix of background.  If we look at many State boards across the country, many of them are dominated by people from Dublin or the hinterland of Dublin, and people have a very different mindset than we see in the rest of the country.  It is important to get that regional balance.  I hope Ms Mannion can engage with colleagues and use her role to encourage more women and more people from regional locations, with regional perspectives, to apply for appointment to State boards and to act as chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021092200002#C00700","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I will start with the second point first.  Female participation and gender equality is an area that I am absolutely passionate about.  I am delighted to report that the board of Pobal has 60% female proportional representation at the moment.  I would obviously like to see greater participation across the board.<\/p><p>It is an area that has improved across State boards.  We have much more progress to make, but it certainly has been improved.  Excellent work has been done by Balance for Better Business, the Public Appointments Service and the Institute of Directors in Ireland.  I assure the Chair that I will do whatever I need to do to offer a helping hand to any females out there to participate in, or apply to, boards.  I will certainly do everything I can in that regard.  I thank the Chair for his comments.<\/p><p> On the point about Covid-19, there is no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions have had a disproportionate effect on the most vulnerable and marginalised individuals.  Pre-existing social and economic inequalities are increasing as a result of the pandemic.  We are acutely aware of that in Pobal and we are not passive bystanders.  We will feed our observations to policymakers in terms of policy design and implementation and in making sure that is taken on board as much as possible and as much as it practicably can be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021092200002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosarii Mannion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mannion for attending and for her instructive engagement with the committee.

Along with Ms Bergin is D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Finnegan, chief executive of Screen Ireland.  I welcome both witnesses, who are joining us in Committee Room 3 remotely via Microsoft Teams.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is such that I will invite witnesses to make an opening statement, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  As attendees are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.  Before I invite Ms Bergin to deliver her opening statement, which is limited to three minutes, if possible, I will advise the witnesses in relation to parliamentary privilege.  There is a little bit of housekeeping to go through, so please bear with me.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply.  As our witnesses are attending remotely from outside Leinster House campus they should please note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity to legal proceedings as does a witness who is physically present.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present with the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in the public meetings.  I cannot permit members to attend outside that.<\/p> <p>  In addition, when physically present in the committee room for the committee's meetings, members in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  It is strongly advised to practice good hand hygiene and that members leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending.  They should always maintain an appropriate level social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking. I ask for members' full co-operation in that regard.  Finally, members should identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the Debates Office staff who are preparing the Official Report, and should mute their microphone when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  Members should please use the raise hand button on Teams if they wish to make a contribution.<\/p> <p>  Members have been circulated with the speaking slots the secretariat has very kindly prepared and can see where they come in.  There is always room for manoeuvre.  If people need to change around, we can do that.  The first three speakers will be Deputy Munster, Senator Malcolm Byrne and Deputy Fitzpatrick.  It is noted that apologies have been received from Deputy Cannon and Senator Hoey.<\/p> <p>  With all that housekeeping done and to one side, Ms Bergin and Ms Finnegan are very welcome.

I would like to thank the committee for all the work it does, particularly during the ongoing Covid challenge.<\/p> <p>  I served two terms on the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  This experience has provided a strong grounding in oversight from a board perspective and an insight into the importance and value of a strong and cohesive board overseeing and supporting effective implementation of a robust agency strategy.  My time on the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland also gave me an insight into the value of film tourism, both in showcasing Ireland to the world and in terms of inward investment from large film studios.<\/p> <p>  I have extensive experience in business management from a variety of organisations and post-qualification experience as a chartered accountant with PwC.  I am also a chartered tax adviser and have a recent qualification in risk management, compliance and governance.  I believe the combination of my executive and non-executive experience, along with my professional qualifications, will inform my role as chair of Screen Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Screen Ireland is committed to building creative excellence in screen storytelling.  My first objective is to ensure that the industry recovers and continues on the steady trajectory of growth that it was on before Covid-19 to become a strong sustainable sector of the economy, supporting Irish companies to create high quality employment.<\/p> <p>  Screen content production is one of the fastest growing industries in the world.  Ireland needs to capture its share of inward international production, and, in parallel, accelerate the growth and financial stability of Irish production companies through continued Screen Ireland funding and the section 481 tax incentive.<\/p> <p>  My second objective is to continue to grow the training and skills development remit of Screen Ireland, which drives creative excellence and long-term sustainability.  My third objective is to create a wider understanding of the value of the industry as an important contributor to the economic and cultural well-being of the country.  My fourth objective is to increase the focus on the environmental impact of film production.  Progress in this area is essential.  It may be costly and time consuming but it is also a business and social imperative.<\/p> <p>  This vibrant, valuable industry needs to be more accessible to people from different backgrounds and regions in order that the full breadth of contemporary Ireland benefits and is represented.  Screen Ireland will shortly be publishing its three-year strategic plan that will include the objectives I have outlined today.  I am very much looking forward to contributing to an industry that creates such cultural and economic value.

Ms Bergin said that the priorities for the board during her tenure as chair are capturing the share of the inward international production market, as well as training and skills.  I am glad to hear that.  The content creation industry is a trillion-dollar industry.  In the UK it accounts for 7% to 8% of GDP and over Covid, one thing we have seen is a rapid growth in the demand for content in various forms.  I read recently that the average American consumer subscribes to four different streaming services.  I do not think that is quite the case here yet but we are moving in that direction.  I ask Ms Bergin to paint a picture of the course of her term, looking to 2025 and beyond.  Between construction and planning, we are going to have between 1 million sq. ft and 1.5 million sq. ft of studio space based here in Ireland over the next few years so there will be huge potential there.  I want Ms Bergin to be ambitious.  In 2025, what is the potential for Ireland in terms of what we can capture among the international content creation space, film, television, animation and other areas?  On the skills side, where are those skilled staff going to come from?  Who is going to drive that ambition?  Will it come through Screen Ireland, or what agencies will be specifically responsible for that?  What does Screen Ireland expect the Government to do?  How can we assist in order to achieve that?  We have a good content creation industry here.

We have a number of initiatives in place to develop talent across the country.  At the moment we have some constraints in terms of studio space, which, as the Senator noted, is being addressed at the moment but also we need to increase the talent and the crew base and that is something we are very much focusing on at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Bergin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":651,"content":"<p>That is exactly what the priorities are.  In terms of the inward production, studio space is growing in Ireland, as the Senator said.  Before now, the infrastructure has been insufficient and that was outlined in 2017 in the Olsberg report.  If all these studio spaces come online, it will open up an incredible possibility for a pipeline of big international productions to come to Ireland.  We had a very successful trade mission to Los Angeles before the pandemic with the T&aacute;naiste.  We met with all the major studios and streamers and the feedback was really clear that Ireland is a very attractive place to film and that we have a very competitive tax incentive.  There is always feedback on things we could streamline and we can look at some of our nearest competitors in terms of jurisdictions for things we could do.  The biggest challenge for Screen Ireland is twofold.  It is about maintaining the balance between international production and, as Ms Bergin said, the local productions generating creatively Irish-led stories, but also the depth of crews that will be required.  Our skills team have been doing a huge amount of work.  We recently launched two academies, a live-action academy and an animation one, to try to help build that depth of crew.  In our strategy we will also be announcing some crew hubs that are being built, which will hopefully cover the whole country with a view to expanding the crew base for when these productions come in.  On one production alone during the summer we had over 1,000 Irish crew.  There are great opportunities there but alongside the studio expansion, we need to ensure we have the right crew levels in place as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I would like to follow up because I was very conscious that Ms Bergin said in her opening statement that one of her key aims was to capture the share of inward international production but in response to my question her focus was on supporting the development of a creative indigenous sector.

It is a very competitive incentive and the regional uplift has been a strong example of policy that we think helped attract some of those bigger productions to the regions.

For us it is about building the entire ecosystems and when we see examples that Ms Bergin referred to of visual effects work or animation work, if the live-action portion of a large-scale project go elsewhere when it reaches that limit, it makes us less competitive at that scale.<\/p><p>This is particularly relevant when we want to attract large-scale franchises or tent-pole feature films.  They tend to be very large-scale in their budgets and it becomes much more challenging to keep the entire project within Ireland.  Deputy Munster asked earlier about the recipients of funding.

I am a member of the executive council of the CTTC and managing director of Bartons Transport in Kildare.  I am joined by my colleagues on the executive council, Mr. James McGinley of John McGinley Coach Travel in Donegal and Mr. Mike Buckley of Kerry Coaches in Killarney.<\/p> <p>  The CTTC is the largest representative body for private bus and coach operators, with some key industry names among our membership.  We are a proactive organisation, focused on engaging collaboratively with stakeholders in the transport area and on delivering results for our members spread across every constituency in Ireland. <\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has brought severe disruption to the sector and to the membership of the CTTC.  International tourism has been brought to an especially abrupt halt, while domestic business for members disappeared during the successive lockdowns introduced from mid-March 2020.  With the country entering a new Covid-19 phase, passenger demand remains greatly dissipated.  This is exacerbated by the imposition of maximum capacity rates and low consumer confidence.<\/p> <p>  When the 2019 tourism season ended, little did coach tourism operators think that they would still be wondering about the viability of the industry in the summer of 2021.  In March 2020, the industry ground to a complete halt with the onset of the pandemic.  In 2019, a record 11.2 million overseas visitors came to Ireland and coach tour operators made a significant contribution to the overall success of our tourism product.  Responsible for directly attracting 2 million international visitors every year, coach tour operators invest substantial sums of money in marketing Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product abroad at no cost to the State or its agencies.  The industry carries coach passengers to every corner of Ireland, giving employment not just to coach tour operators and drivers, but also to the staff of hotels, retail and hospitality outlets, visitor centres and other small enterprises.  In 2018, coach tourism helped to contribute &euro;400 million to the Irish economy and therefore our strategic value to Ireland cannot be underestimated.<\/p> <p>  The Government last provided funding to the coach tourism sector in the July stimulus plan of 2020.  While this funding was hugely appreciated by the industry at the time, many operators had exhausted their resources by the time those moneys were allocated in March 2021.  No further support has been forthcoming in 2021 and this has created a major viability problem for a sector that is responsible, as I said, for bringing two million international tourists to Ireland annually.  For this reason, the CTTC is calling on the Government to urgently provide funding to the sector via a supplementary budget allocation in the upcoming finance Bill.  This is a necessary step to safeguard an industry with tangible and strategic value to the State and it would also ensure that the quality of the coach fleet remains at a standard that markets Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product positively.  Funding should be made available to cover losses incurred in 2021 and it should replicate the &euro;10 million provided under the business continuity scheme for coach tourism.  The implementation of such a measure should mirror the previous scheme.  Such an initiative would greatly help the industry and assist in keeping many operators in business as they await a partial return to normality in the 2022 tourism season. <\/p> <p>  The CTTC also recommends continued funding for 2022 under the business continuity fund for coach tourism to reflect the damage done to the sector.  The peculiarities of our industry mean there is a long lead-in time for international bookings.  With huge uncertainty engulfing us regarding the variants of Covid-19, the continued effectiveness of vaccines and a potential crisis in confidence affecting our consumer markets, it is essential that a support net is provided on a contingency basis in 2022.  This will be crucial to enabling us to be ready to scale up operations when the country&rsquo;s tourism revival begins in earnest.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee again for the invitation.

I thank the Deputy for the question.  Regarding the &euro;10 million, and to provide some historical perspective, we commissioned Mr. Jim Power, one of the leading economists in the country, to draw up a report for us after March 2020.  The impact of the pandemic hit us like a tornado and we needed to quickly see where our losses were accruing.  That economic report examined our fixed costs.  Our difficulty was that no revenue was coming into any of the operators dealing with international tourism or private coach hire because all events were cancelled.  We were facing a situation where no revenue was coming in, while we were still operating and had to insure our vehicles even as they depreciated greatly in value.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Power collected and collated a great deal of information from the sector and arrived at an estimate for our fixed costs of 17%.  Although no revenue was coming in, our costs were still running at 17%.  The final figure was arrived at by taking the overall figure for the revenue garnered by private coach tours and private hire operations in 2019, some &euro;250 million, and then taking 17% of that amount as representing fixed costs.  The total came to &euro;42.5 million.  We assumed at the time, in our innocence, that the pandemic was going to last six to nine months.  Until March 2021, therefore, we predicted that we would have losses of approximately &euro;32 million.  That is the amount that we requested in funding from the Government then.  <\/p> <p>  We were allocated &euro;10 million in the July stimulus of 2020 and we were very grateful for that funding.  To put the situation into perspective, however, that amount would cover the repayment capacity for two or three months of a touring coach.  These coaches in our depots and yards will not have moved for some 24 months by the time there is any smell of a recovery in the market.  In summary then, we were very grateful for the &euro;10 million in funding.  It was a lifeline to support operators and get them into 2021.  The difficulty that arose in the context of the new variants appearing and ongoing lockdowns is that the 2021 season has, effectively, seen business dissipate as well.<\/p><p>There was an opportunity towards the end of the year to generate international business, however, due to travel advisories in the US advising against coming to Ireland, a signal was sent out that the country was closed.  The amount of international business in September-October is minimal and only scratches the surface.  We were grateful for the &euro;10 million funding, but the original request was based on our fixed costs, which were &euro;42.5 million per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":687,"content":"<p>Mr. Buckley stated that for many businesses the Government support only covered overheads for two or three months.

We were grateful for the Government support.  The fact it was introduced helped in the negotiating with banks.  Most of our business are now in forbearance.  Nevertheless, they are accruing interest charges, which means when the loans have to be paid back and the repayments kick in, there will be additional costs.  Much of the money procured under the stimulus in July 2020 will go to defray some of those interest charges.  It really is a bandage on a major bleed or haemorrhage.  It has helped us because the majority of people in this sector have significant debts.  In the coach sector, the capital outlay on coaches is quite high.  For example, in 2019 more than &euro;80 million was spent by our members on new vehicles.

We have 80% less connectively into the county from all the major tourism markets worldwide at present.  That in itself is a worrying factor.  Even when consumer sentiment is high, if people cannot travel here, they will go to a different destination in the world.  There is a huge sense of uncertainty.  Certain outdoor niche markets, such as hiking, walking and golfing, may bounce back quicker.  Due to the nature of the virus, people who traditionally came to Ireland in large groups to travel together may become reticent.  Many of the incoming tour operators are telling us that people are simply not buying from their brochure tours.  As an anecdote, I know of one tour company operating a large coach that is travelling around Ireland at present with two American visitors in it.  There is a driver and a guide on that coach.  The tour company wanted to operate the tour in order to send out the message that Ireland was open for business.  They are the harsh realities of where we are at present.

We also discussed, as we come through this pandemic and move into the next phase of recovery for 2022 and 2023, training and the investment needed for the training of new entrants in the market, such as new drivers and staff.  We have lost a number of drivers who have retired or left the industry for other industries.  We have a good working relationship with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  During this period of time, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and many others involved in tourism will have understood the positive contribution coach tour operators make to regional economies.  The sector is responsible for the transportation of visitors to retail and hospitality outlets and visitor attractions, the length and breadth of the country.  They include restaurants, evening function venues, visitor locations, such as Trinity College Dublin and St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and various different places similar to that.  They now know the importance of coach tourism.

Operators who had previously operated school transport contracts have had the opportunity to retender for those.  Some of them operated extra 50% capacity vehicles.  In general, school transport not only encompasses going in and out of the school, it also encompasses travel to matches, swimming events and day trips to various locations.  In addition, school tours in 2020 and 2021, for which thousands of coaches had previously travelled the length and breadth of Ireland for, were cancelled.

Mr. James McGinley is in the waiting room.  He is trying to get in, but for some reason he is not able to get in.  Perhaps someone could help him.<\/p> <p>  Regarding funding for 2020, it was drawn down in March 2021.  It was done on a very specific basis with regard to the coaches we had in our fleet.  It was very specific on the year of the coaches because it was very much focused on tourism.  It was not for private hire or any other element of the coach transport sector.  Mr. Buckley gave an example regarding the funding for that.  We have been out of business since March 2020, but many of our operators have not operated vehicles in the tourism sector since November 2019.  The winter period is normally our quiet period and our busier period is from March to October.  During the pandemic, the revenue that would have been generated in the 2020 period was just not there, so a lot of operators went to their banks and put a stay on their payments.  When we received the funding, the operators went to the banks to say they received it and they were able to pay perhaps a lump sum off against a certain amount of payments.  As Mr. Buckley mentioned, the grant was per vehicle and probably covered about three months of repayments on one brand new coach, which we were very grateful for, but members can see already there is a huge gap in trying to fund those vehicles because they are parked up and not operating.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about what will happen as we move into 2021.  No doubt there will be casualties because some of the operators are nearly in a holding process and when they get back into operation again, they will have to start paying for their vehicles.  Part of the funding we are looking for will help those operators get to next year.  It is as if we are halfway across the ocean.  The Government has helped us to get to this point, but we need to get the rest of the way across, to get us to the next period when we can start to operate again on our own two feet.  That is the situation on the funding side.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the staffing side, we mentioned that there have been casualties in the business.  We lost a lot of good quality tour drivers.  Some left the business because of their age profile or because they decided it was time to step away after a long career.  Others have gone into other businesses and enterprises and they might feel that is more appropriate for them moving forward.  There is no question but there will be a staff shortage when we come back into operation.  That is already being seen in some areas, such as the school transport division, where there is a shortage of drivers.  Staffing will be an element, but part of the process will be to work with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to try to put training courses in place in order that we can upskill new staff.

The seasonality of the coach tourism business is very important in the overall scheme of things.  When the pandemic hit in March 2020, everybody had had a good, decent season in 2019.  To put figures on it, 11 million visitors came to Ireland in 2019 and 2 million of those were transported by coach tours around the country.

Coach tours take people to Gweedore in Donegal, the Dingle Peninsula here in Kerry and the wilds of Mayo and Wexford, so it is important to highlight the add-on that coach tourism gives to local economies, in particular in the more peripheral areas of the country, in shops, caf&eacute;s, small hotels and the attractions that are set up along the Wild Atlantic Way and on the south-eastern coastline.  These areas are hugely dependent on coach tourism going there.  What happened in March 2020 was that people had a decent season, their funds were exhausted and they were looking forward to a decent year in 2020 and, all of a sudden, no revenue was forthcoming.  That was the reason the panic buttons were pressed in March 2020 and why we commissioned Jim Power to do an economic report, which gives a very stark picture of where we are at.<\/p> <p>  I concur with what Mr. Barton says about next year.  There is still a huge amount of uncertainty about 2022.  Please God, when we do come back in March and April we will see coach tours operating around the country again.  However, we will have huge difficulties with staff shortages.  We also need support to get us to March 2022 because we do not have a season this year that would allow us to put a pot of money away to meet payments and continue existing in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":700,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Fitzpatrick happy with the responses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#J00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":701,"content":"<p>Could I ask one more question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#J00500","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":702,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#J00600","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I know the sector got no money in 2021.

The purpose of the meeting is to receive an update on the review of the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Department the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and his officials.  I am sorry for the slight delay in the commencement of the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.<\/p><p>Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus should note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p> For anyone watching this meeting, Oireachtas members and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee or to join the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams, which is a welcome development.  It shows that, like everywhere else in society, the Oireachtas is very much getting back to normal business.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will, reluctantly, be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams, prior to making a contribution to the meeting, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, people are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  I strongly advise that people employ good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacant seat between them and the others attending.  People should always maintain the appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.<\/p><p> I call on the Minister of State to make his opening statement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092200002#A00200","speaker":"1593","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting me to attend before the committee today and answer questions.  I am joined today by Mr. Richard Browne, acting director of the NCSC, and Mr. Peter Hogan, principal officer in the Department's cybersecurity and Internet policy division.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted to have this opportunity to present to the committee on the capacity review of the NCSC, which was completed last June.  When we last met, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I were awaiting the outcome of the review.  I am pleased to report that the review was completed within the intended timeframe.  I know that the committee was keen to hear the recommendations of the capacity review and ensure that the Government took appropriate steps to implement these as early as possible.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, in July the Minister obtained Government agreement to a substantial expansion in the staffing of the NCSC from 25 to 45 staff over the next 18 months, and to at least 70 within five years.  The associated budgetary increase for the centre for 2022 is estimated at &euro;2.5 million.  The Government also agreed a significant package of other measures to further strengthen the capacity of the NCSC, including the development of legislation to establish the NCSC on a statutory basis with a set of formal powers and a legal mandate.  These measures include: that the role of director of the NCSC should be re-advertised at a salary of &euro;184,000, which is the deputy secretary general scale, to reflect the scale and importance of the role, and to attract experienced candidates; that the director will have responsibility for building and leading the NCSC, further developing the operational capacity and expertise of the NCSC and supporting the development of the policy and legislative framework relating to cybersecurity in the State; that a single headquarters for the NCSC will provide the required security infrastructure and capacity, and that the centre will be accommodated within the Department's new headquarters in Beggar's Bush; that we will develop a five-year technology strategy for the NCSC which scopes its internal requirements and its relationship with academia and industry; that there is a measure to recruit people to 20 additional full-time roles; and that a cybersecurity graduate training programme will be initiated by the NCSC in 2021, with four computer science graduates recruited each year on contracts of three years' duration.<\/p> <p>  I have already shared with committee a redacted version of the executive summary of the capacity review.  In respect of the findings of the review and the benchmarking exercise, there are some details that I cannot share due to national security considerations both in Ireland and in those countries with which comparisons were made.  I will endeavour to be as open and transparent as possible with the committee, however.  Where necessary, I will ask my officials to follow up with written replies to questions.<\/p> <p>  The capacity review recognises that the NCSC has grown considerably since its establishment in 2011.  The consultants acknowledged that the NCSC team had developed significant expertise and capability in a relatively brief timeframe.  The consultants found that staff at all levels of the NCSC are knowledgeable and highly motivated and have a clear understanding of the NCSC&rsquo;s role and purpose.  The consultants also remarked positively on the progress of implementation of the national cybersecurity strategy and the role that the interdepartmental committee has played in driving this work.<\/p> <p>  The consultants were tasked with charting a five-year course for the continued development of the NCSC taking into account the evolving threat landscape and the growing body of EU legislation on cybersecurity.  The consultants proposed a new organisational structure for the NCSC and recommended that an incremental expansion be pursued over the coming five years.  The capacity review recommends, as an initial step, that the headcount of the NCSC&rsquo;s operational team should increase from 25 to 41 full-time equivalent staff, with numbers continuing to grow to in the region of 50 in year 3 and approximately 70 in year 5.  In that context, the Government has decided to go further in the initial expansion of the staffing complement.<\/p> <p>  The capacity review includes more than 40 recommendations which have been categorised as high, medium and low priority and which cover issues from governance to technology to skills development.  The capacity review recommendations will not be fully completed for some years and there are many interdependencies within them.  For example, much of the recommended technology development requires a suitably equipped headquarters facility.  A clear legislative mandate is necessary for the NCSC's functions to be expanded further.<\/p> <p>  I would like to provide the committee with an update on the progress of implementing the measures that were agreed by Government in July.  Working with the Public Appointments Service, good progress is being made by the Department in progressing the delivery of the increase in headcount that was recommended in the capacity review.  I understand that in the coming weeks a number of open recruitment competitions will commence to recruit new staff with cybersecurity skills and experience to complement the existing team.   In addition, we are availing of the Civil Service mobility scheme to redeploy staff from across the civil and public service who have an interest in the NCSC&rsquo;s work.  We are taking a broad perspective on the skill sets necessary for the NCSC&rsquo;s range of functions, including stakeholder engagement, project management and compliance.  The process has already begun and we are currently seeking expressions of interest.<\/p> <p>  The competition for the NCSC director, run by the Public Appointments Service, will be advertised this Friday.  As was the case for the previous recruitment campaign, this will be an open process carried out in line with the established principles for senior recruitment to the civil and public service.  I expect to see this competition concluded before year-end and a permanent director appointed as early as possible thereafter.  The Public Appointments Service is using the services of an executive search company to assist in identifying suitable candidates.  In the interim, we took the decision to appoint Mr. Browne as acting director in order to ensure that the NCSC has a full leadership team in place during this important period of transition.  Mr. Browne has previously served in this area since 2014 so he was able to hit the ground running when he returned in July.  His focus is in implementing the measures agreed by Government in July, and he and his team are already making good progress.<\/p> <p>  The development of the NCSC's headquarters will be managed as part of the redevelopment of the Department&rsquo;s offices at Beggar's Bush, Dublin 4, which are expected to be completed in 2023.  The acting director and chief technology officer, CTO, have worked closely with the corporate services area of the Department and the Office of Public Works, OPW, over the past two months with a focus on the design and layout of the new headquarters.  This will be an important facility for the national response to a major cybersecurity incident and, as a result, we need to ensure that it is fully equipped.   There are also international standards for the security of accredited computer security incident response team, CSIRT, which will need to be factored into the design, construction and fit-out of the new facility.<\/p> <p>  While the new headquarters are being developed, temporary accommodation will be required for the NCSC and the OPW has identified a suitable location for this temporary facility.  Under the supervision of the acting director, the NCSC administration and CTO teams are currently working on the design and procurement for the fit-out of this facility.<\/p><p>Appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that this temporary facility can accommodate the NCSC as its staffing complement grows through 2022 and 2023.  We will ensure that it meets the exacting international security standards for the CSIRT.<\/p><p> The development of a technology strategy for the NCSC is closely linked to the new headquarter project.  The acting director and CTO have completed a review of the capacity review&rsquo;s recommendations in respect of technology to inform the development of the new strategy.  The CTO has also identified a number of priority investments which are part of the Department&rsquo;s submission for the 2022 Estimates process.<\/p><p> Work has also commenced on the cybersecurity internship scheme which will complement the existing actions in the national cybersecurity strategy on cyber careers and skills.  This scheme will be a priority action following the imminent recruitment rounds I referred to earlier.<\/p><p> Finally, in respect of the proposed legislation for the NCSC recognising the need to work in partnership with other Departments and agencies, at the recent meeting of the interdepartmental committee on the national cyber security strategy, a way forward was agreed by all members.  To empower the NCSC to carry out its necessary functions, it is inevitable that the proposed legislation will provide for intelligence gathering, which will bring with it certain governance requirements as well as requirements on the legislative process.  Officials in my Department are leading a consultation with relevant stakeholders which it is intended to complete before the end of this year.  Thereafter, work will begin on drafting heads of a Bill which I hope to see progress through the Oireachtas before the end of 2022.<\/p><p> I recently attended the Estonian Digital Summit, where there was much interest in the Government&rsquo;s response to the HSE cyber incident and the development of our NCSC.  The conference theme was trusted connectivity.  I was pleased to have the opportunity to engage in constructive conversations with peer Ministers from a number of EU countries, as well as Singapore and the UK, and I also had the opportunity to meet the Estonian Prime Minister.  It was clear from the conference and discussions with other Ministers that the global landscape of cyber threats is at the top of the political agenda and that concerted international co-operation will be necessary to secure essential services in the face of these threats.  During my visit to Tallinn, I also met with Ireland&rsquo;s secondee to the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, CCDCOE, and paid the centre a visit.  There are great resources in the CCDCOE that we can draw on to inform the further development of our own cyber capacity, both within the NCSC and across Government.  I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092200002#B00200","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

People were asking at the time how this happened, whether it could have been avoided and whether we could have been better prepared.  On seeing the report before us, or the bit of it we have available to us, we can be left in absolutely no doubt that we could and should have been better prepared.  The report finds that the NCSC is not fit for purpose, is under-resourced, over-tasked and its structural and legislative foundations are wholly inadequate.  That is a very damning indictment.  It states that the NCSC does not currently have the organisational design or capacity to achieve the objectives of the national cybersecurity strategy which was only published at the end of 2019.  It states that the NCSC is under-resourced and over-tasked with regard to wider engagement with critical national infrastructure comprising in the region of 120 operators of essential services or digital service providers.<\/p> <p>  That raises very fundamental questions on the establishment and resourcing of the NCSC since its establishment.

The capacity review was ordered to assess what additional resources were needed by the National Cyber Security Centre in the face of an escalating level of cybersecurity threats.  I am sure that the Deputy is aware that the volume of cybersecurity attacks that are happening around the world greatly increased even before the pandemic but during the pandemic it is estimated that they increased approximately sixfold.  In response to that, a capacity review was ordered.  This was decided upon, in fact, last summer during the programme for Government negotiations when it was agreed between the Government parties that we would commission a capacity review and see what additional resources were needed by the NCSC.<\/p> <p>  That was a timely thing to do and was done long before this attack ever happened and the capacity review found that there was an escalating level of threats, that the NCSC was performing well but needed additional resources.

Does the Minister of State believe and can he give a commitment that those resources for staffing and for the fitting of the headquarters will be made available?

I recommended a higher staffing complement and this was accepted.  It will be a challenge to recruit additional cybersecurity staff at a time when cybersecurity threats are increasing for all countries and for critical infrastructure providers as there is a great deal of competition in the market but there is a need also for additional training and education.

The organisation consists of many independent bodies, health agencies and different levels of private and public medicine, brought together.  By its nature, it is a complex organisation.<\/p> <p>  The healthcare sector is a uniquely difficult sector to protect.  Part of the reason for that is that people who are working in healthcare are dealing with life-and-death situations all the time.

Many of the systems in the HSE have had to be rebuilt from the ground up and a lot of areas of HSE estate that were not thought of very often, such as parts of the 2000 systems that were not very prominent, are now better understood.  One of the principles of cybersecurity and of trying to protect any organisation is that there is a complete list of all of the things that need to be protected, that there is a full inventory and that one is familiar with having to build those systems from the ground up whenever that is needed.

Reference has been made to the cyberattack on the HSE and in particular, to the repercussions and knock-on effect it has had on waiting times and on dealing with the backlog of appointments.  I know it might not necessarily be the Minister of State's brief but is there a plan on behalf of the HSE to tackle those waiting times?<\/p><p>Deputy O'Rourke made reference to Government funding for cybersecurity, and it was reported on in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>last week.

Waiting lists are an operational matter for the HSE and a strategic matter for the Department of Health.  They are outside of my remit to some extent.  From an IT point of view, a waiting list attaches to a particular consultant and consultants are attached to particular hospitals.  This means that there are multiple waiting lists around the country that are not really connected with each other.  It is difficult to say, for example, how many people are on multiple waiting lists and how many unique people are on all the waiting lists that are in the country.  I know the Sl&aacute;intecare team and the HSE have been looking at ways of unifying those waiting lists to get some idea of who is on more than one waiting list, whether people should be transferred from one list to another or whether there should be shared lists that go outside of a single consultant.  There is an IT aspect to waiting list management and there is also the question of how to keep track of whether the people on waiting lists are still waiting for operations and whether they still require the service.  The HSE made great progress in making sure that people who are on waiting lists still intend to have the procedure they are waiting for.  The Senator is right that it is outside of my area.<\/p> <p>  On funding, it is easy to think that money is the solution to all of the problems.  That is not the case in this situation.  The HSE had its IT funding doubled in recent years.  It also had a massive increase in staff.  As I said before, the funding for the NCSC had tripled in the previous year.  A great deal of money is available.  I had no sense when I was speaking to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform or when we presented our memorandum to Cabinet that the Government was not willing to spend whatever it took to secure the HSE and national cybersecurity assets.  Money is not an issue and we will have the best security operations centre and headquarters for cybersecurity that will be as good as any other country in Europe.  It is not a financial thing; it comes down to a cultural approach to the priority that is given to cybersecurity and the seriousness with which it is taken.  If one looked over previous meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and saw how much time was spent on discussing cybersecurity, I would imagine it was quite small compared with other issues because there are so many other pressing life and death issues within health.  Having political support for cybersecurity might be more important than having a budget and it will not be constrained in any way by a lack of money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092200002#E00500","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":741,"content":"<p>That is a good point.

What we do is to provide those organisations with information.  We get them to do risk assessments and we can audit those organisations as well.  In addition, we have the legal power to request information from those organisations, and we have done that.  We can also issue orders for compliance or enter their facilities.  Generally, we do not need to invoke those powers.  We have a co-operative relationship with those critical infrastructure providers because it is in their interest to ensure that they do not get attacked.

Another recommendation is to develop a strategy for NCSC and provide it with a properly established and appropriately scoped mandate.  In my view, FireEye basically states that the current strategy may not be fit for purpose.  In fairness, the Minister of State stated, of his own volition, that the centre needs to be put on a statutory footing.<\/p><p>The Department will seek to bring in changes over the next year plus.  Are we at a point where this work needs to be fast-tracked?  I accept that there are issues about drafting legislation.  Another recommendation is to provide the NCSC single headquarter facility.  I am not certain that one floor within the Department can be categorised as such and ask the Minister of State to comment.  <\/p><p>The report further states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe recommended consideration is given to separating the Technical Authority and Competent Authority roles as part of this process ... A significant burden rests on NCSC to deliver against the strategy and, based on our review, it does not currently have the organisational design or capacity to achieve all of the objectives.  A dedicated budget should also be assigned to achieve the NCSS's objectives. <\/blockquote> <p>Finally, the report recommends that the NCSC reduce its reliance on external capabilities and very much prioritise its internal capacity.  Has the NCSC lost staff?  The Minister of State mentioned boosting retention.  Is the NCSC losing top-level staff?<\/p><p>A sum of &euro;100 million was lost due to the cyberattack on the HSE and there was also a cost in terms of the  impact on appointments.  There is a report in one of today's newspapers that 30,000 of the computers in the HSE still use Windows 7 yet Microsoft came forward and declared that it did not provide security support for Windows 7 from 2015.  When will there be a swap over to using more modern software?<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that the post of Firector is being advertised now and has a salary of &euro;184,000, which is very much in keeping with the views of experts in the area who have come before us.  The recruitment campaign is being run by the Public Appointments Service.  Does the service have the expertise to interview such a person?  The cyberattack on the HSE took place in the middle of Covid and, let us be honest, there was a period when things got very hairy.  Now that we have reached calm waters do we not need more based on this report?<\/p><p>The report was interesting and never criticised the staff and declared that they are very competent and very good.  However, the report is highly critical, stating that the NCSC is not fit for purpose and that it needs its own dedicated budget.  How big will the budget be?  <\/p><p>The report refers to separating the regulator's post from the advisory one, and having a stand-alone headquarter.  What I have in mind is that over the next two years we would see a fit-for-purpose NCSC and have stand-alone legislation in place.  To bring the legislation forward would very much concentrate the minds on what should be in the centre.<\/p><p>The executive summary is pretty direct because it says: &quot;However, legislation that gives &quot;statutory legal vires&quot; to the full operation of cyber security capability ... is critical for an effective future operational posture.&quot;  In fairness, the Minister of State has stated that and I would like him to address my points.  The devil is always in the detail and the detail in the report, from what I can see, states  that the current NCSC is not fit for purpose structurally.  The staff are very good and performed exceptionally well under difficult circumstances.  There appears to be an indication that the NCSC is losing staff.  Is that the case?  Is it possible, given this work is so important, to make this a two-year plan rather than a five-year plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092200002#G00100","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.

I have read the report and really do not see it saying that the centre is structurally unfit for purpose but certain recommendations were made.  We knew that the NCSC needed more resources in response to an escalating threat and escalating workload.  That is why we commissioned the report to see where should the money be spent and where should the resources be directed.  I absolutely agree that the centre needs a new headquarter building and new physical facilities to accommodate all of the new staff.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked whether a floor of the Department would be sufficient; he did not say that it is not sufficient.  In fact, the space will accommodate 100 staff.  We have examined in great detail what a security operations centre for a NCSC looks like in a number of different countries and specified that we wanted the best in class.  So there was not a constraint about saying let us get something that is mid-market.  We wanted to get the best that we could get and the long-term future is the headquarters facility.<\/p><p>In the near future, we will redeploy staff who are there at the moment to a temporary building.  I have talked directly to the staff.  I have asked them if they feel they are getting what they need, that there is a problem with morale, or there are any issues they wish to address with me.  They are saying \"No\".<\/p><p> The Chair mentioned lost capacity and losing staff.  Every organisation has a certain degree of churn, of people who come and go.  Sometimes that is an indication of success within an organisation.  If you go into an organisation and you develop great skills, you then have that option to move into the private sector or towards some other organisation.  You have on your CV that you are somebody who was involved in national security and in protecting your own country at the highest level.  Because the centre has such a good reputation, that is something very positive, and it is one of the reasons people want to work at the NCSC and that it does not have difficulty attracting quality staff.  Again, from talking directly to the staff, that is the feedback I get from them.  The fact some people come and some people go is normal within any organisation.  Having fresh people coming in is a good thing.  Having the perspectives of people coming from the Army, the Defence Forces, or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are all positive things that help out.<\/p><p> The Chair also mentioned Windows 7 and the fact there are thousands of computers in the HSE that are still running Windows 7.  If possible, one of the things you should do as part of your security hygiene is to have the most up-to-date patches on your operating system, all the updates that should be on your phone, and, where possible, you should not be using bits of software that are out of date.  However, that is just one line of defence.  That is part of what you should do.  Like with the coronavirus where you should wear a mask, wash your hands, and stay two metres away, none of these things on its own is enough to protect you from an attack, and none of those things on its own is the reason you got attacked.  The HSE was not attacked because some computers were running Windows 7, and it would not have been prevented if the computers had all been upgraded.  That was not the problem alone.  It did not help, but it certainly would not have prevented the attack from taking place.  I can tell the Chair that definitively.  I can also say the HSE was well aware that this was a risk.  Richard Corbet, who was the chief information officer, took useful steps to minimise and mitigate the risk of running Windows 7.  For example, he firewalled off those computers to one section of the network and added virus protection software.

That involves either the manufacturer of the machinery upgrading its systems or else, when it is time to replace the X-ray or MRI facility, the replacing of the client machines also.  However, you can take mitigating actions to prevent against it.  Windows 7 is one risk of many.  It is not the sole reason this attack happened.

It is understandable, but this on its own will not prevent a cyberattack.

Many people did not know that there was a NCSC until this year, when we needed to know.  We have all been alarmed at what happened with the cyberattack.  It had a devastating impact on front-line healthcare delivery because of how it got into the inner bowels of databases held by the HSE.  We are talking about capacity to withstand cyberattacks in Ireland, but what led to it in the first place was probably a lack of capacity.  We were somewhat akin to a Ford Fiesta chasing a supercharged car down the motorway in a police chase.  We were lagging way behind.<\/p><p>Now the Minister of State has an important job.  He is the right person for that job.  We have looked at his CV.  He is equipped with skills to lead this out and he now has a review which he has said he will implement, and that is good.  It is all very good.<\/p><p> Lack of capacity, is what got us in trouble.  I am concerned, without being a cybersecurity expert, that where we are going may still leave us short of capacity.  The budget we will spend on cybersecurity is one 1,000th of what is spent in the UK.  The UK will spend approximately &pound;2 billion and has 1,000 staff.  We will get ourselves, if I understand the executive report correctly, up to 70 staff over a five-year period.  Cybersecurity does not follow international boundaries.  We are vulnerable.  The fact that we have been attacked this year probably shows the criminal underworld that Ireland has a bit of a soft underbelly insofar as attacks are concerned.  I am really concerned.  While we are now talking about building capacity and giving the Department money to increase and increase - and the Minister of State has a tough job to do and he will do it right - are we getting far enough?  We have counterparts in Europe that have been taking the lead on this for many years.  I made the point at this forum just a few months ago that Ireland is militarily neutral - that is a fact - but I do not think cybersecurity necessarily comes into the realm of neutrality.  If there is capacity we can have in aligning ourselves with other European nations or indeed the UK to protect ourselves from a cybersecurity point of view, we should do that.  Will we have enough capacity?  This concerns me hugely.  The UK will have 1,000 times more money invested in its system.  It will have multiples of staff dedicated to fighting this.  I just do not want us to be laggards.  I want the Minister of State to say he is in talks with European counterparts on having an alliance in Europe to combat this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092200002#H01700","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":779,"content":"<p>The Deputy said the attack happened because of a lack of capacity.  I want to see the two reports that are coming out before I make a decision on the view I will take on what caused the attack.  I will allow that time to see what happened.  The Deputy mentioned the UK and its &pound;2 billion spend.  There is also the United States.  The Deputy has to accept that those countries, with their enormous intelligence-gathering capabilities, Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ, and so on, were still subject to the same kind of attacks as we were.  The Colonial Pipeline attack cut off fuel supply to three US states.  There have been huge attacks on the United Kingdom as well.  I met with the UK's digital Minister to discuss that a couple of weeks ago.  They have not been protected by having this enormous spend.  When we compare how much money is spent in Ireland with how much money is spent in the UK on cybersecurity, we have to make sure we are comparing the same thing.  The &pound;2 billion is not the budget for the UK's National Cyber Security Centre at all.  I do not know what its budget is, but I think the &pound;2 billion figure includes the cybersecurity spend across a range of Departments and on GCHQ.  Ireland does not have the equivalent of GCHQ and does not intend to have it.  We are not trying to monitor all internet traffic coming in and out of Ireland, to check everybody's emails and to go through everybody's phone calls.  We do not have that ambition and that is just not part of our strategy.  We have a completely different set-up.  We could make comparisons but they would have to be fair comparisons.

What we are talking about here is essential command of cybersecurity, whereby the Government will build resilience, and rightly so.  However, when you get out beyond the HSE, the Houses of Parliament and all the Departments based here in Dublin, there are schools dotted right throughout the country, local healthcare centres managed by the HSE and small rural Garda stations.  Eighteen months ago, I worked in a classroom in one of those schools.  There was a computer with Windows XP installed on it.  That computer would sit in a classroom.  The teacher might change each year because we could be moved up to sixth class or down to junior infants or anywhere in between, so a different person would come in.  Some of the computers in primary schools would not even be password-protected.  Our school had a regime for that but many schools would not.  Those computers in some ways are probably not too different from what the HSE has.  There would be a whole plethora of reports relating to a child's abilities or psychological needs.  There could be comments relating to discipline, their attainment in tests, standardised and non-standardised - a whole litany of information that is relevant to the teacher but which, if it got beyond the realm of the classroom and out into the public domain, would be pretty upsetting to students and parents, who would take huge offence at the school.  What I am getting to - and our Chairperson alluded to this just a moment ago - is that if the HSE has 30,000 PCs that have Windows 7 as their operating system.  I am in a position to tell the Minister of State anecdotally that the schools around Ireland have antiquated laptops and computers, a lot of them not properly protected whatsoever.  That is a matter of real concern for me.  It concerns me that we will have essential command of robust cybersecurity but then, when you go down to the tentacles and go out of the spokes of the wheel to all those small schools, Garda stations and health centres, there just is not that protection.  It is fine having \"mothership government\" protected, but I do not think that protection will be there.  I am not convinced that 70 staff working centrally for cybersecurity across a five-year period will have the capacity either.  The arms and the tentacles of government invested very heavily in freedom of information, and there is a freedom of information officer in pretty much every public body and they are robustly protected.  However, we really need to see this capacity built not just centrally but to all those schools.  How will the Department do that?

There is no intention to try to provide a central protection for all State bodies from 70 people working in Dublin who will offer some kind of centralised support across all these organisations.

The Deputy is correct that it has to be distributed and it cannot be done in a centralised way.  It cannot work that way.  There will not be somebody sitting in an office in Dublin protecting you from being attacked.  It has to go out to the furthest leaves on the tree.<\/p><p> In my other role, I am extending broadband to every primary school in Ireland by the end of next year.  I am well aware that Internet access for schools is a critical part of education and that schools need to be protected.  They are educational facilities and are capable of upskilling and learning what they need to do to protect themselves from a cyberattack in the same way they learn to protect themselves from a fire or other natural disaster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092200002#J01000","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":789,"content":"<p>I will move to Senator Craughwell of the Independent Group.

We should compliment the Garda on reversing at least some of the damage done to the HSE.  The Minister of State said a few moments ago that money was a bit of a red herring.  I am appalled to hear him say that.  Malta, one of the smallest countries in the EU, is scheduled to spend &euro;1.9 billion on cybersecurity over the next six years.  I am afraid it does not go down well with me to say that money is a red herring.<\/p> <p>  I compliment the Chairman and my colleagues on agreeing to bring a human resources expert in front of the committee because the money the Department offered for the director of cybersecurity role was a joke.  No serious professional would come anywhere near this country for that money, which suggests to me, and I have said this many times, security, whether it is cybersecurity, internal security or external attacks, is treated as a joke.  We do not take it seriously.  The Minister of State is trying to change that, but if he is going to do so he will have to see a budget that will support him.  Some &euro;13.8 million was spent on cybersecurity from 2017 to 2021.  Where are we going?  At the end of the day, it is a joke.<\/p> <p>  As we move forward, and I have said this a hundred times, we need an integrated intelligence agency under a director of intelligence that will bring together all the different intelligence-gathering agencies of the State.  That includes the Garda, Defence Forces and the Departments of Social Protection and the Environment, Climate and Communications.  We need them all under one umbrella whereby they can share information and we will know what is happening.  We take issues like cybersecurity with a grain of salt.  In the past few weeks, we had word of a Minister's phone being hacked.  It just sort of breezes past everybody as nothing to get too excited about.  Maybe the Minister of State cannot answer this today, but are his phones protected properly?  Does he have encrypted telephones?  If he does not, then he should.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is a central location for foreign direct investment.  We control some of the largest volumes of data in Europe and we are talking about having 30 people working in cybersecurity.  There should be hundreds of people working in cybersecurity, particularly when you look at the United States, which has almost 1 million people working in cybersecurity, and Estonia, a country we looked down our noses at a few years ago because it was much poorer than us, and its reputation in this area.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, spoke about the issues of the Defence Forces and legislation.  Last night, we saw on television how the Graham Dwyer case may limit the capacity of the Garda to get involved in counter-espionage, or counterintelligence, which is outrageous.  It is outrageous that that might happen.  We see ships sailing up and down the Atlantic coast, coming very close to the 12-mile limit where they are capable of intercepting data travelling from the United States into Ireland.<\/p> <p>  There are 3.5 million cybersecurity positions open in the world.  With that many positions open, Ireland will have to compete.  To do so, we will have to put billions into cybersecurity.  We will not have foreign direct investment here in a few years' time if we start seeing cybersecurity attacks.  I cannot understand it, but my belief is that since we all started to register on our mobile phones during the Covid-19 pandemic, we are being inundated with all sorts of crazy attacks.  I get a dozen phone calls a week from the Department of Social Protection that I no longer answer.  I will not answer any number now if I do not recognise the caller because I am sick to the teeth of it.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State will be going in front of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Cabinet in the next few days.  Do they fully understand the impact there will be on foreign direct investment if they do not invest in cybersecurity?  There is clearly a lack of understanding of what is required.  In fairness to the Minister of State, after he saw the HR expert, Bl&aacute;thnaid Carolan, talk to the committee about a salary structure of &euro;220,000, he clearly fought the battle and got as close to that figure as he possibly could.  We will, hopefully, get somebody very good for the role.  The problem we have, with 3.5 million vacancies in the world, is if we will become a training centre for people who are paid poor money and who will move to higher-paying economies as soon as they are trained.<\/p> <p>  I am very concerned about this issue.  This committee has taken a huge amount of time to debate these matters.  I thank the Chairman for that and I thank the Minister of State for being here but is cybersecurity, and security in general, treated as a joke?  Does he agree we need a director of intelligence and one single intelligence agency?  I am shocked to hear that we have only one Defence Force member posted with the NCSC.  It should be run by the military, like most cybersecurity organisations in the world.  I will throw that over to the Minister of State and I might come back with one or two supplementary questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092200002#K00300","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":791,"content":"<p>I am not aware of any cybersecurity centre in the world that is run by the military.

There must be a director of cybersecurity who has his or her staff placed in every Government agency.  They should be reporting directly to him or her, not to the Secretary General of the Department or some principal officer in a Department, who might write a report at some stage which might finish up in the Department of the Taoiseach.

This is a centralised model, and the opposite of the model we were discussing with Deputy Cathal Crowe, whereby we have a distributed model as people need to be able to control their own cybersecurity in their own organisations.

There are often only one or two individuals who respond and all of the others are large corporate bodies, tech giants or whatever.  They have a particular interest in this area.  We have a co-operative, not a fractious or confrontational, relationship.  We work with those companies because we have the same goal, which is to protect Ireland, our assets and infrastructure from attack to ensure peace and continuity on the island.  We are absolutely aligned and in clear communication with those companies at all times.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the committee.  It gives me food for thought.  The committee's questions were insightful and useful and came from different perspectives.  I now have a couple of things on my to-do list.  I hope my civil servants are happy to work with me on that and I think they are.  I appreciate the committee's constructive approach to working with me.

We think that in the short term he should request that all Departments incorporate cybersecurity spending in their Estimates.  That should be possible and it would enable the Minister of State to gather that information very quickly.  We spoke about the framework the Minister of State is looking at in terms of the reporting.  A structured framework should be put in place so that when people are attacked, instead of immediately taking the default position and paying the ransom, they will instead engage with authorities such as the HSE.  That is how we can ensure these pirates do not come knocking on the door all the time.  We must let it be known that Ireland is not a haven for cyber pirates.  We will write to the Minster of State formally in that regard, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092200002#O01200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":873,"content":"<p>That would be great.
