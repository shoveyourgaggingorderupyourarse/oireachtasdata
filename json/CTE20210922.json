As you noted, Chair, joining me today are council members Ms Dawn Holland, Professor Michael McMahon, Dr. Adele Bergin, and Mr. Alessandro Giustiniani as well as our chief economist and head of secretariat, Dr. Eddie Casey.  We value our engagements with the Oireachtas and see this as a very important part of our work.  The council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to assess and endorse the official macroeconomic forecasts, assess budgetary projections, compliance with the fiscal rules and to assess the fiscal stance.  Its focus is on the overall fiscal stance, rather than on individual tax measures or spending items.<\/p> <p>  Last week, the council published its pre-budget 2022 statement as an input into the upcoming budget.  The economy is recovering quickly from the pandemic as vaccinations progress and as individuals adapt to new circumstances.  Upside risks to the official projections for the economy include the potential unwinding of large household savings and boost from the Government&rsquo;s planned budgetary expansion.  However, jobs are likely to recover more slowly than spending and the long-term scarring effects on activity from the pandemic remain uncertain.  Over the longer term, it is likely that Ireland&rsquo;s ageing population would tend to slow growth, with productivity growth also likely to moderate as it converges on norms for more mature economies.<\/p> <p>  The council welcomes the July summer economic statement, SES, as a significant step in the Government publishing a medium-term budgetary plan to 2025.  This is something that was promised in the programme for Government.  The SES includes more realistic spending forecasts for maintaining the existing level of services.  This basically allows for pressures from rising prices and changing demographics that were not fully accounted for in past forecasts.  The change in approach addresses a long-standing weakness in budgetary projections that the council had been concerned about.  The SES also sets out a new spending rule and a debt objective.  These approaches are also welcome and partly address recommendations made by the council in the past.<\/p> <p>  While the progress made in the SES was welcome, there were three key areas for concern.  First, there has been a significant shift in policy for the medium term, leading to higher risk.  While a sizeable fiscal response to Covid-19 was warranted, the sustained deficits now planned for future years would prevent the debt ratio from falling steadily to safer levels.  The Government&rsquo;s own projections imply a deficit of close to 3% of GNI* in 2025, while the council&rsquo;s more positive view of the recovery would suggest something close to 1.5% if the Government sticks to its spending plans.  Running significant budget deficits for several years during a period of strong growth and with high public debt carries risks.<\/p> <p>  Even allowing for low interest rates into the future, the council estimates a one-in-four risk that the Government&rsquo;s debt ratio could end up on an unsustainable path.  Ireland&rsquo;s deficit and net debt ratio could still be among the highest in the OECD by 2025, which increases the risks of higher borrowing costs if Ireland is viewed as an outlier, particularly as a relatively small, open economy.  This leaves the public finances more exposed to shocks, particularly from unexpected falls in growth.  It also reduces the likelihood that the Government could respond to future crises or future downturns by supporting the economy in the same way it did during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  Second, key details of the fiscal plan are still lacking.  The planned increase in public investment will see Ireland&rsquo;s public investment peak at around 6% of national income in the coming years.  There is a good case for higher spending in areas such as health, climate change, and housing, particularly as interest rates are so low.  Yet the speed and timing of the ramp-up of investments, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s weak track record with public investment management, means that capacity constraints might lead to higher costs.  To assess the risks, more information is needed on the Government&rsquo;s investment plans and the underlying economic assumptions, particularly in relation to the new national development plan, the climate action plan, implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and around Housing for All.  The Government should plan eventually to bring investment down to more normal levels.<\/p> <p>  Third, the new spending rule and debt objective need more work if they are to be useful.  The spending rule is intended to constrain permanent voted spending to grow at the same rate as potential output, assumed by the Government to be around 5%.  The council has recommended a spending rule for several years to ensure that spending grows in line with the Government&rsquo;s ability to pay.  However, applying the rule now, when sharp permanent spending increases already took place in the last budget, means that the rule is likely to lock in a high path for spending.  There are also a number of other design problems with the rule.  It is too narrow, focused only on a portion of spending and ignoring tax cuts; it should be calibrated to improve the deficit rather than to maintain it; and it should be given a statutory footing and better linked to the debt objective, which is itself rather vaguely specified.  The SES also did not explain how the budgetary plans comply with the existing EU and domestic fiscal rules.<\/p> <p>  In regard to budget 2022, the council&rsquo;s assessment is that the Government&rsquo;s &euro;4.7 billion package of measures appears to be at the limit of what is prudent.  The implied 5.5% expansion is modestly above estimates of the underlying potential growth rate of the economy but this would help to support the recovery.  The council assesses that some of the temporary and targeted income and job supports may need to continue, depending in part on the public health situation.<\/p> <p>  Looking beyond 2022, the Government should prioritise between its plans for significant expansions in public investment, fast increases in current spending and a desire to cut taxes.<\/p><p>By expanding all areas at once, the Government is effectively avoiding difficult choices and slowing the return of debt ratios to safer levels.  This reduces the scope to ensure that future downturns or crises could be cushioned by strong fiscal support in the same way as we have seen during the pandemic.  A more prudent approach would be to limit current spending to a slower pace of increase or not to implement tax plans to reduce taxes at the same time as a ramp-up in public investment is going ahead.  I thank the committee and look forward to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes and his team for the presentation.  I want to talk about tax buoyancy and the forecasts.  Mr. Barnes's opening statement and the pre-budget statement published by the council last week focused on what could be described as a robust and quick recovery of the economy as restrictions ease and normal economic activity resumes.  He said the council has developed a recovery scenario which differs from the macroeconomic projections in the SES.  He described those as not being fully updated and not consistent with the Government's fiscal plans.<\/p> <p>  The council's recovery scenario sees modified domestic demand, which we know is a better measure of economic activity than GDP, rebounding faster than the projections in the SES.  We also know that tax receipts returned to the Exchequer signalled a strong recovery with tax heads such as VAT, income tax and corporation tax coming in above profile.  What accounts for the difference between the scenario outlined by the council and that in the SES?  Is it the view of the witnesses, given the outdated projections in the SES which feed into the tax and fiscal forecasts, that tax revenue is likely to be higher and, therefore, deficits lower this year and in 2022?<\/p> <p>  In his statement Mr. Barnes outlined that the deficit will drop from a projection of about &euro;20 billion this year to in the region of &euro;15 billion.  Can he give us any indication of what he thinks the position will be in 2022 as a result of those dynamics?  Has the council developed its own projections to reflect the strong recovery?  What is the view of the council in terms of how the Government should respond to such tax buoyancy?  In other words, should any revision in tax revenue upwards in the Government's October forecast be committed to additional spending measures, used for tax cuts or used to improve the fiscal position?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#B00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Doherty.  It was a concern and disappointment to us that the SES, which is a major statement of Government policy, did not include updated macroeconomic projections.  There were some updates on the international side, but the domestic parts failed to take into account two significant developments.  The first was that the short-term news in the economy has been much more positive than it was when the special purpose entity, SPE, was set up in April.  The second is that the fiscal stance has changed very significantly.  It was a major flaw in the SES that it did not update the macroeconomic projections in what was a major statement of Government policy.<\/p> <p>  As a result of that, as the Deputy correctly noted we developed a recovery scenario because we thought that was a more realistic picture that took into account both of those things, namely a scenario where the economy recovers quite rapidly and where the long-term impact of Covid relative to the trend is relatively small because the economy has bounced back quite fast.  To us, that suggests there will not be as big a long-term impact as we feared at one time.  That is essentially good news.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the pace of recovery, the way to think about it is that this is a timing issue.  We were always relatively positive about where the economy was going to end up; it is just that the recovery has happened earlier.  That means that we see more of the recovery in 2021 and less in 2022.  We get to the same position, but earlier.  That is a good thing, but it does not change our view of the long or medium run.  It is important to view it as a timing issue.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy has noted, we have not done a very detailed analysis of the budget deficit for this year, but, as he reminded us, we think it could be around &euro;15 billion or 7% of national income, which is somewhat less than what was set out in the stability programme update, SPU.  It is still a big deficit.<\/p> <p>  Does Dr. Casey want to add anything specifically about 2022?  It obviously depends on decisions taken in the budget.  I do not think we have done a very detailed modelling of that.

Does the council believe that net tax cuts should be off the table, given the other pressures?<\/p> <p>  In its commentary, the council mentions a reduction in current spending if the Government was to deal with the tax cuts.  Is the council suggesting that there is a difference between current and capital spending?  There is a crisis in housing.  The ESRI has called for a doubling in capital investment which is not what the Government has outlined in the SES.  Does the council believe further capacity regarding capital spending as a catch-up programme is required to deal with the fact that houses have not been built in the numbers that were required over the past decade?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#B00700","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The council's concern was about the overall budgetary stance.  There is now anticipated to be a deficit for several years which means that the debt ratio will not move substantially toward safer levels.  The Government will essentially be putting more money into the economy than it takes out over this period.  There is a risk of overheating eventually building up or cost pressures in specific sectors.  That is the concern.<\/p> <p>  The origin of that concern is that the Government is increasing current spending in line with inflation.  It is increasing the volume of current spending, ramping up investment and planning to cut taxes.  It is trying to do everything at the same time.<\/p><p> In regard to the pressure on the public finances and the budget balance, a reduction of debt could be achieved by prioritising between those different items in the medium term.  The council does not have a mandate and does not look at those specific items.  However, if one accepts the case that the priority is to improve public services and that investment is extremely important, that raises questions about the relative importance of doing the other things.  One has to wonder whether cutting taxes should be the priority and the prudent thing to do in the context of these other ambitions that the Government has.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's second point, there is a very important distinction between current and capital investment in economic terms.  We know also that many of the needs of the economy are in terms of the capital.  Public investment was very low for a long time.  We are partly paying the price for that today.  There is an important distinction.  It is a good case to make public investment while interest rates are low.  We recognise that case and that is why we are relatively comfortable in some sense with the run-up investment that is planned.  However, it is a huge increase.  There are legitimate questions about the capacity of the economy to catch up at that speed.  Therefore, having a period of catch up clearly makes sense.<\/p><p> Investment at one point was maybe running at 2% of the national income.  It will now go to 6%.  If it only went to 4%, it would take an awfully long time for the economy to catch up.  It is okay to overshoot, but that has to be managed carefully and it raises risks.  This is a very high level of investment by historical standards in Ireland.  It is essentially the highest ever share of national income in public investment.  It is very high by international standards as well.  It is a very sharp increase.  That process has to be carefully managed, because it carries risks in terms of value for money but also in terms of macroeconomic management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty has run out of time.

There are clearly important changes afoot internationally and those may impact Ireland.

When thinking about the borrowing risk, my view would be that the risk is not that the borrowing is the trigger but rather that high levels of borrowing limits the ability of the economy to respond to other triggers that might arise.<\/p> <p>  I will respond to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question about the effect of an unwind of savings.  We know that saving rates have been high.  This is partly because people have become more prudent, but partly also because there has been enforced lack of spending in the economy over the last 18 months during lockdown.  The question about whether this will generate inflation depends a lot on how quickly and in which sectors people choose to spend the money.  Again, touching on Mr. Barnes&rsquo;s opening statement, one concern would be that people have built up sufficient savings and they all decide to invest, for instance, in housing.  At the same time, the Government is embarking a large expansion of its public construction projects.  That would put quite a bit of pressure on that particular sector, which is already subject to many cost pressures coming through supply chains.  These pressures are completely outside of the control of Ireland, namely, world steel prices, cement prices, etc.  That would be a scenario where the likely inflationary effects would be larger and concentrated in particular sectors.  If everybody spent their money on doing things that they did before, such as spending in the hospitality sector, there will probably be a less likely focus on inflation.  This is because there will probably still be quite a lot of spare capacity.  That is where we would currently probably see a need for any targeted support from the economy going forward.  That unwinding of savings into those sectors would limit the need for the Government to continue to provide that targeted support.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question is difficult to answer, because it depends on exactly how people choose to spend the money.  However, this is something that we are very aware of as a potential thing to keep an eye on and see how savings choose to be unwound.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McMahon.

First, as well as housing, health and education, climate is a major issue.  The investment needs that might be associated with that are potentially massive.  That is something that we do not have much of handle on at the moment.  That is where the climate action plan will be important.  However, climate will require much more deployment of funds than health and education in the times come.  This is not to say that health and education are not important.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s second point, which is important, is the various things may be driving housing, including the Government's investment plans and,as  Professor McMahon said, private savings.  One of the things that will do is that it will give a cyclical boost to the economy in the years ahead.  That will partly feed back to the Government in terms of revenue.  This would be a good thing.  However, that is not necessarily sustainable as a source of revenue, if there is to be a temporary boom in housing.  It would be nothing on the scale of what we saw in the early 2000s.  However, it is one thing that will flatter the public finances in the years ahead.  If one look at our projections for deficit, which is around 1.5% in 2025, the underlying position is much worse than that.  It is a structural deficit, at 2% or 3%.  We need, therefore, to be careful that we do not get confused by putting money into the economy, which would make public finances look better than they really are in an underlying sense.<\/p> <p>  The impact of house prices is always difficult to assess.  We have private savings acting and we also have Government policy.  One of the things we are calling for is more economic analysis around Housing for All.  While there is a lot of information about what the Government is planning to do, there is not much of an economic assessment of what it expects the outcomes to be or on how it expects it to work.  This information would be important in assessing whether that money will have a positive impact on the economy.

I just have one criticism to make.  I have enjoyed reading the report but we got it far too late.  Maybe they do not expect us to read anything beyond the summary but there are 70 pages in it.  I got an opportunity this morning to start reading it.  I found it really interesting.<\/p> <p>  The summary captures it.  Mr. Barnes managed to incorporate what I saw as some of the key elements into his opening statement.<\/p> <p>  There is so much in this.  I have said to the Chair previously that I like to take a non-partisan approach in the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight and assume the role of an outside onlooker who is trying to represent the best interests of all of the people.  Terribly noble and all as that sounds, I mean not to take a political approach to it.<\/p> <p>  Here we are again.  This is the fifth annual pre-budget report stating we cannot rely on corporate tax.  It is truly appalling that governments have failed to deal with this.  The first steps were taken in budget 2020.  That is very regrettable.<\/p> <p>  The rainy day fund had been suggested in 2016.  Even the worst critics of the former Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, would say he had the special savings interest account, SSIA, scheme developed to try to stop people spending and to put some of their money away so that it would not boost the economy.  There was &euro;20 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund which helped to reduce the impact of the crash, although not by much.  We have no such measures in place at present.<\/p> <p>  They mentioned human resource shortages and challenges.  I do not know if we are fully across that yet or if we fully know what the impact of material shortages will be.  It seems to be much more acute in terms of materials in some other countries and I am wondering why that is.<\/p> <p>  There is so much to respond to but I want to make one point to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.  I think IFAC could help the budgetary oversight considerably in this.  It was a suggestion made by Mr. Mark Little, the former RT&Eacute; correspondent, Washington correspondent and general bright guy.  IFAC is covered to comment on this under its role of assessing the fiscal stance.  We have, as a budgetary oversight committee, in the past number of years looked at gender-proofing budgets.  The only way to politically protect decision-making in budgets is a suggestion Mr. Little made, not for that reason but to future-proof budgets.  Ministers of the day need to be held to account for budgetary decisions they take now that will have a negative or disproportionate impact on generations coming down the track.  If that became an institutionalised requirement, it would help to head off some of these things that IFAC has pointed to.<\/p> <p>  Personally, I will be looking for spending on MetroLink and all the rest of it, and fighting for the budgets that are available.  That is the politics side of the House and I accept that.  I do not see any contradiction in it.  To be quite honest, nobody anticipated tax cuts after the year and a half we have been through.  They see the State heading for a &euro;250 billion debt.  They see the State having honoured that unwritten contract between itself and its citizens and their families and non-citizens to protect them when times get really tough.  The State stood up to that challenge and the public recognise there was a huge cost to that.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see the future-proofing of budgets.  I will return to this theme.  Every Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, every Minister for Finance and every Department head and Minister will have to ask what will be the impact of this decision on an 18-year-old, on a 25-year-old, on a 30-year-old, etc., and whether it will incur a disproportionately heavy debt burden on them on top of the climate action burden that is already on their shoulders to carry.  I am off my soapbox there but I will come back to it.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barnes does not mention Brexit.  He might comment on that.  I was very taken with his final comments about climate action that this could end up being much more costly than we anticipated.  Mr. Barnes gives some figures there and some context to it.  There are three issues I would like responses on.  What are IFAC's views on Brexit, the future-proofing of budgets and the climate action piece?  I ask Mr. Barnes to develop that theme a little more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#D00700","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lahart for those thoughtful comments, including the fact that we should send him a copy of the report as soon as we have it next time.  Let me respond in a slightly different order to the Deputy's questions.  I will ask Dr. Adele Bergin to come in on Brexit and Professor Michael McMahon to come in on the general issues.<\/p> <p>  One point Deputy Lahart is right about is that as a medium-term strategy, the SES talks about how certain things will be dealt with, mostly the increase in public investment.  It does not talk about some other subjects which are important.  One of the neglected subjects is corporation tax.  It assumes there will be a &euro;2 billion loss, as the Government has been assuming for some time, from international tax developments but that is not developed.  There is no institutional response to that.  It is just baked into the figures.  The rainy day fund solution and the prudence account that we talked about at some point could all be good ways of dealing with that, but it is not really addressed.  There is also not much on the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is another major initiative that does not really figure much in the discussion on the SES.  Where that fits into the whole arithmetic could be better articulated.  As I have said, there is a lack of detail about many aspects, including the climate aspect that the Deputy talked about and how that fits in and whether it has been allocated.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right in terms of some of these deeper questions about the public finances.  As we have said, there is a need to prioritise between higher investment, higher current spending and taxation.  The consequence of not prioritising is taking more risk and shifting the burden onto the next generation.  In the past, we have re-emphasised how hard choices needed to be taken to meet the objective that the Government had, which was, essentially, to bring debt down at a steady pace to a more prudent level.  In fact, what has happened is those hard choices have been avoided and we have ended up taking more fiscal risk.  That was precisely the risk we warned about a year ago.<\/p> <p>  Maybe Professor McMahon will want to come in on the long-term issues.  Then if Dr. Bergin wants to come in on Brexit, that would be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes and Deputy Lahart.  This relates somewhat to Deputy Durkan's point about taking action and when in the process you take it.  As Mr. Barnes was pointing out, our mandate is to assess the overall fiscal stance.  We know that.  It is not currently in our remit to discuss whether the adjustments fall more on one generation than another but when you assess the current fiscal stance, it is important to know the direction of travel.<\/p><p>When we published the first long-term sustainability report last year, what was striking as we went through the analysis, and what stood out in the report, was how if actions were deferred until they became very apparent and the glaring headlights were a couple of feet away, the actions that needed to be taken at that later point would be much larger and as, Mr. Barnes alluded to, fall on a generation of people who are 15 or 20 years down the road.  We proposed - and this applies both to the ageing population and issues such as climate, on which much more work needs to be done - it is exactly right to have that longer-term view when making these assessments.  Early actions that mitigate things can be taken and, as Deputy Durkan said, in some cases, it feels as though we should have taken early action years ago.  We do not have that ability, but we do have the ability to start thinking about and making the changes now.  That is the sense in our assessment of the proposed configuration of current spending, increases in investment and tax cuts being at the limit of what we think is prudent, especially when projecting further down the road, knowing that these hard choices will have to be made.  That is the basis for why this focus on the long term is a really important one that we can do as part of our assessment of the macro aggregate fiscal stance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I want to comment on the generational point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#E00200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Bergin to go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#E00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I was going to come in on the Deputy's question on Brexit.  We have looked at this in more detail in some of our previous reports.  It is important to note that the ultimate impact of Brexit is quite difficult to predict.  Some research suggests that in the long run, Brexit may reduce the level of output in the economy by approximately 3%, but that is a long-run estimate and the Deputy's question probably refers more to the short run, which is difficult to predict.  Trying to disentangle the data on Brexit impacts from those on Covid is especially challenging.  In the report, the initial disruptions we had seen in the earlier part of the year have been mitigated, to some extent.  There is also the possibility of challenges in some sectors occurring at the same time as opportunities for expansion in others.

On Brexit, as deadlines get delayed and the new regime is not fully implemented, it may be that we are living in an unusual period, but, as Dr. Bergin said, it is hard to read the data, partly because Covid is going on and many other factors are distorting the numbers.  There are many moving parts in the flow of trade, be it to the North, the UK or the Continent, and it is hard to read.  That is why we did not say much about it.  We are still carefully watching, but it is difficult to read.<\/p> <p>  On the EU fiscal rules, there is what is called the general escape clause, which the EU has said will likely apply until the end of next year.  For the moment, the Commission is providing advice but it is not enforcing the rules as they stand.  The existing rules should kick in at EU level at that point and, of course, the domestic rules also apply.  One question is whether there will be a change to the rules.  There is significant discussion about that.  The European Commission has a consultation out.  It is unclear what the direction of that is and whether anything will change.<\/p> <p>  One of our concerns is that the Government has not explained how the running of persistent deficits over several years is consistent with the EU fiscal rules.  On the face of it, it does not look as though it is, but the Government should explain its strategy.  There may be special circumstances related to the high-level investment Ireland is planning in the years ahead, but the current EU rules do not make any allowance for that.  The Government needs to think about this and it may constrain its plans.  It needs to make the case, if it wants to go ahead with what it is doing.  It is a constraint, which was not addressed in the summer economic statement, SES.  This is unfortunate, given these are the fiscal rules to which Ireland is committed.<\/p> <p>  The third aspect is corporation tax.  There is significant discussion internationally and things may change, as a result.  It is still very hard, even at a political level, to know what will happen, both internationally and in the US, which is obviously of major interest to Ireland.  There are two main channels for the effect.  One is a loss of corporation tax revenue.  The Government is assuming a loss of &euro;2 billion in its baseline.  Our baseline is a bit higher.  The kind of work we have done would suggest that with a more prudent approach, more than &euro;3 billion, and potentially, an even bigger figure.  The other effect is on the economy.  Either some firms will withdraw from Ireland, which seems relative unlikely, or new firms will stop coming here, because it is viewed to be less attractive when some of the tax advantages have gone.<\/p> <p>  What is difficult is that revenue is concentrated around a small number of companies and the very detailed things one would only know if one was the tax director of one of these companies could have an impact on whether a company continues to pay tax here and it is very hard to predict.  That is why we argue that Ireland needs to reduce its dependency on that, because there is significant risk.  A lot of money is coming in from a small number of sources, which could change relatively fast.<\/p> <p>  There are big concerns around costs and capacity in construction.  The Government, in Housing for All, has not really explained how it sees these issues playing out and how it sees the capacity in the sector developing.  This has economic implications.  If there was just a big run-up in costs in those sectors, that could be destabilising to the rest of the economy.  It could also just reduce the value for money.  There is no point just spending more money and having more demand for construction, if there is no more supply coming.  These are things that need to be monitored, particularly as the scale of the investments becomes so large.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Does the notion that we could end up losing &euro;2 billion or, as far as Mr. Barnes is concerned in another assessment, &euro;3 billion in corporation tax to the Exchequer, as a result of the OECD process, need some revision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#E00700","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>It is uncertain, so the distribution of risks has probably not changed that much.

That would then allow us to think more carefully about the fiscal implications of what will be major societal change with many impacts on the public finances.  In that context, changes in areas such as carbon taxes may raise additional revenues.  Additional expenditures, however, may also be required in the current form to compensate some of the people affected by some of the climate policies.

It will be one of the major issues.  Much additional information is required, but three types stand out.  One is the need to have a clear idea of what the Government is planning to spend money on.  For example, will more funds be allocated to construction, which would consequently push more resources to that sector, or will more money be spent on machinery for wind farms, etc., which is imported?  Very different impacts would result for the domestic economy in each of those contexts.  It would, therefore, be very useful to know that information.  In economics jargon, different things will have different multipliers and we need to have that kind of information.<\/p> <p>  The second thing required is to understand the Government's economic analysis of how it thinks these projects are going to work.  We can imagine some of them will generate revenue for the Government and the economy.  Other projects may be more concerned with just limiting economic damage.  That kind of assessment will help us to understand what fiscal impact will result from the flow of money associated with these investments.  Value for money, of course, is also an issue in this regard.<\/p> <p>  We also need to know what the Government intends to do beyond 2025.  Government investment up to the end of 2025 is currently set at 6% of national income and we have a large structural deficit.  One scenario concerns Government thinking stemming from a view that there will be a surge in investment up to 2025 and that it will then be intended to bring the level of investment down to a new normal of something like 4% rather than 6%.  However, if the Government intends to carry on investing at 6%, that has different implications for the public finances in the long term.<\/p><p>We really need to know how it thinks about this increase in investment.

We might need other health spending related to, say, deferred treatments and things like that but, specifically related to Covid, it assumes those things would not materialise.  Then, also related to other things like additional unemployment spending and additional expenditure on pandemic unemployment payments and the employment wage subsidy scheme, those types of things would have been much lower.  A final thing was the buffers allocated to various Departments just in case there was a need for additional Covid spending there.  If we look at the figures that were included for 2022, in the official projections there were lots of buffers included, right across the board, just in case a Department happened to again need additional funding to meet various stresses related to Covid.

It is peaking at 6% in coming years.  What rate would IFAC like to see that normalised to over time?  I have read the IFAC report and that is a feature.  We are doing catch-up.  We have come through a very difficult period since the crash in 2008 and with Covid and everything else.

It will be important to understanding the economic forecasts, the budgetary forecasts and then our overall view of the public finances.  Whether the national development plan provides us with comfort, as the Deputy suggested, or not will very much depend on what it says.  That is why it is a very important input for our sense of the public finances.<\/p> <p>  One of the big questions we discussed earlier was what the Government's own view of the normalisation is.  I do not think it is for us to say.  There is little doubt that public investment will be higher on average in the future than it was if we go back a couple of years.  To what level it should normalise, I do not really know, but it would be good to know what the Government&rsquo;s view of that is.  The specific question of whether the normalisation ends in 2026 or how the Government is going to unwind this is an important issue because it is a big factor pushing on the economy.  That is a big part of the information we are looking for.  It is about the composition and it is about the economics of it as well.

Some of it indirectly generates revenue through encouraging growth but other things might not have that benefit.  The multipliers matter a lot.  There are some forms that will feed back relatively quickly into the public finances because they are quite employment intensive, for example, but buying imported things is going to have a lot less impact.<\/p><p>Of course, the NDP is about much more than just public investment.

The Government is looking to run a balanced budget on the current side but a deficit with respect to the capital side.  Can an argument be made that with an economy such as Ireland's, which is doing such a catch-up on the capital side, we are by definition going to be running deficits on the capital side for a period?

One is the capacity of the construction sector and the economy to deliver in a sustainable way these kinds of increases in investment and the deficit financing of it.  The other one is, of course, the sustainable level of the public finances.  Ireland enters this with a lot of debt.

It is exactly the kind of countercyclical policy governments should run when the economy gets into trouble.

When we are talking about financial prudence, planning, strategies and where exactly we are going, one of the biggest issues I can see for business, budgets and everything is surety of energy supplies for our country.  If we do not have power, everything grinds to a halt.  There is an enormous cost being placed on people at the moment because of the ever-increasing cost of energy.  This is having a real distorting effect on our economy.  Every economic commentator will tell us the way things have changed so much in the past 18 months with the costs of our basic energy needs.  It is frightening and we might ask where it is going to stop.  The next thing then is surety of supply and whether we are going to have uninterrupted power for the next three or four months.  Even if we get over this winter, will we have an assured energy supply next winter?  We must look at the Government's decisions to date and think about what we are doing here.<\/p> <p>  Over the past number of days we have had the news breaking that 200 lorryloads of peat have been imported from Latvia because we have shut down Bord na M&oacute;na.  It might seem like a small issue but it is a really big issue.  The importation of peat briquettes from Germany goes on unabated as we have closed our peat briquette-making factory.  Returning to the matter of surety of supply, the Government is now faced with a scenario where the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is finally conceding we will need to hire generators that use gas.  This is going to cost an awful lot of money.  It is going to be very bad for our environment.  We must look at what the Government decided to do.  To make us look good, it shut down our power plants.  The result of that is we are bringing in generators to ensure the lights do not go out and that everybody who is so concerned about everything in the environment will have some way to charge their phones and boil the kettle.<\/p><p>The general transition probably will not work, ultimately, and we will just have to buy the power from France and England, which produce it with nuclear power stations.  We know what is happening in China, which is building hundreds of coal-burning power stations.  This type of policy will not do our economic credibility any good, including among people wanting to come here, like we have heard, including the Intels of the world, and their take on what our Government has done.  The reality of decisions taken over the last 12 months is starting to bite us.  From an economic perspective and a good economist's point of view, how are we looking to the world and to the rest of Europe because of what is happening to us?  If the lights go out in Ireland, that will be one of the worst financial damnations that could happen to us because it would show us up as having made really poor political decisions and having left ourselves extremely vulnerable to every type of financial market.  What will be the result for our industry if we cannot be sure that we can pump petrol and that we can keep computers turned on?

Bord na M&oacute;na played an integral role in Irish society.  The result is now that the jobs are in Latvia, the briquettes are made in Germany, they are sent to us here and everything is fine.  It is crazy.  If you stand back from it and think about it, it would be laughable if it was not so serious.  I am not laughing at it and nobody else is as far as I can see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#J00400","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their time and input.  I have a question for Ms Holland.  Last year, I read with interest her paper on the economic implications of climate change mitigation policies.  I am concerned about spending money on carbon credits.  I feel that it would be better spent by putting it in the hands of homeowners and small businesses, enabling them to install renewable energy infrastructure such as solar panels or heat pumps.  I feel this would drive the economy and activity, reduce carbon emissions, put money back in people's pockets and increase their disposable income.  What is Ms Holland's view on this approach versus the current approach of buying carbon credits or subsidising massive wind farms which are not producing as much energy at the right time as one would expect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#J00500","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  She raises some important issues.  In designing a climate policy, there are many different channels that can be used as policy instruments.  I cannot say I am an expert on the individual types of policies that the Deputy is proposing or the trade-offs that would arise.  I have looked at the different ways that climate policies can be designed.  For example, if there is a tax on carbon, how you spend that revenue has different impacts.  Where is that going to be put in the spending programme?  Is it being used as a new revenue source or to pay off debt?  Is it being channelled into energy efficiency research and energy efficient technology which would help to speed up the transition process?  Will it be channelled into social protection to offset the costs that might be borne by some of the more vulnerable households in society?  There are many policy trade-offs.  It is not necessarily the council's role to identify the appropriate policy mix.  We look forward to hearing the details of those proposals in the climate action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Dawn Holland"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>So do I.

First, I wish to ask a couple of questions specifically around a thorny issue that we come up against in the committee all of the time, that is, what is good medium-term budgetary planning and what does that look like, and in regard to access to data and planning for demographic change.  Does IFAC consider access in this country to demographic data and disaggregated data in terms of health and the make-up of our communities is on par with other countries?  Is it an adequate methodology for IFAC to engage in meaningful medium to long-term fiscal planning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#K00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I will make two points.  On the point of medium-term planning in general, one of the extremely encouraging things about the SES was the move to the existing level of service basis for current expenditure.  As we have discussed in the past, in previous budgetary exercises, Government spending plans were not sufficient to even provide the current level of spending, taking into account inflation and demographics.  We said that was incredible and we were very critical of it.  That has been largely addressed through the existing level of service.  This is very close to what the council calls a standstill.  That is important because it gives one an idea of what the public finances will look like over the next few years, instead of some arbitrary set of numbers.  It could also be very important for medium-term planning because that could then feed into the expenditure ceiling.  Since 2013, there have been expenditure ceilings in Ireland.  These are multi-year ceilings at departmental level for spending.  The problem is that every year they are revised.  That happens because the overall level of spending in the forecast was too low and, consequently, that trickled down to the expenditure ceilings, which were too low, and so they were revised up as we moved towards reality.  This is potentially very useful because with the right top-down expenditure, forecasts like that translate into the ceilings and those can now be kept fixed.  There is no reason they should change.  That is good in terms of understanding what is happening to the public finances, but it also might be helpful to people in terms of the thinking about how to make the best of that money rather than them always being in a process of just thinking about how they can get their budget up in the following year.  There are encouraging signs in relation to medium-term budgetary planning, but the proof of that pudding will be in the eating.<\/p> <p>  On access to data, this is an issue on which I can only comment in the context of the council.  The OECD review of the council from February recommended that the council should have a statutory right to information.  As of today, the council has no right to information.  We rely on the goodwill of the Government.  The Department of Finance provides us with the information that we need.  We have a good relationship with that Department, but it does not always have all of the information we ask for - some of it may not even exist - and sometimes getting it takes time.  It is not a perfect process but it works.  We find that much more difficult in relation to other areas of government.  For example, in regard to health, it is very difficult for us to understand what is happening there.  We know there have been massive overruns in the pre-Covid period but we cannot understand that because we do not have access to that information.  There are some issues on the Revenue side and in all areas of government.  As the investment programme ramps up, that may also become more of an issue.  The OECD recommended that the council should have a statutory right to information.  That would change the nature of the dialogue we have with the Government, with a presumption that if we make reasonable requests for information we would be provided with it in a timely way.  We do think that is important.  I can only speak for the council.  It may be a wider issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes for that interesting response.  When it comes to health, it is possible some of that data is not collated and as such it does not exist.  This is going to be an issue going forward.  I am interested in Mr. Barnes's first point around meeting the core spending.  I noted in last year's budget, for the first time, that the mental health allocation was divided into spend for current services and spend for implementation of new programmes.  It was incredibly useful for the mental health sector to be able to see how that would play out.  In the application of new programmes such as Sl&aacute;intecare it would seem very important to disaggregate current spending and new programmes spend.  I hope to see more of that in the coming budget.<\/p> <p>  I commend IFAC on its report.  It is a fascinating read.  Towards the end of it, there is reference to higher investment, addressing priorities and how that might be costly.  In terms of economic oversight and fiscal planning, I take the point around capital investment and public spend on particular investment programmes or infrastructure.  I am mindful of the NDP, hopefully, being published soon.  From a climate perspective, is that a challenge for the witnesses, or is it something that you are mindful of, when it comes to forecasting requirements in terms of the economic outcomes of particular capital investments?  There may also be a requirement for economic forecasting on the lack of investment or the failure to do something.  I am thinking specifically of not just the physical impacts of climate change, for example, where we are seeing water infrastructure that is beginning to fall apart and has a knock-on cost to our health system or, perhaps, inward investment which may see our infrastructure as not fit for purpose, but also global policy changes and the expectation that Ireland would meet them.  IFAC has included the cost of investment in its report.  How difficult is it for it to include in these types of reports the cost of not investing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#K00500","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Those are excellent points.  The point made by the Chairman with regard to a distinction between new spend and what is needed for the current spending is really important.  It is important for the public to understand that, otherwise it can appear that the Government has allocated billions of euro in extra funding to a particular area and lead the public to wonder why a particular public service is not getting any better.  If that is essentially just the money that is needed to pay the wages as they go up for the same people or to reflect higher demographics, people need to understand that distinction between the ongoing costs and new spend.  That is an important distinction.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman makes a very good point in terms of climate and some of the housing issues.  On the one hand, we need to understand how it meets the Government's objectives, but that is not very clearly spelled out.  We are not really in a position to assess that but we would like to know Government thinking on that so that we can understand the risks around it.  On the other hand, we need to see a joined up approach to thinking on these subjects.  For example, in the housing area, one of the things that the Government spends a lot of money on is housing supports.  As rents go up in the private sector, that means more people need that help and it becomes more costly to provide.  There is a great deal of feedback going on the public finances and housing costs, housing generally and, as mentioned by the Chairman, climate and health and many other factors.  These are very good parts of economic planning, some of which would help us to understand the fiscal implications and many of which will help to understand the policies more generally.<\/p><p>Professor McMahon might want to come in on this too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I was going to make a similar point to the one just made by Mr. Barnes.

For example, some investment plans have large ongoing maintenance associated with them whereas others do not, so it is not just about thinking about the benefits of not investing; it is also the fiscal costs of investing and not investing.

I come from the small rural town of Drumshanbo in County Leitrim, a Border county.  I believe passionately in rural communities, community development and social inclusion.  I have seen first-hand the impact of the work of Pobal.  My lived experience is that diversity, equality, justice and inclusion make for a stronger society.  I know that these values give chance and opportunity to those who would not otherwise enjoy it.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of my educational background, I hold a bachelor of arts degree, a higher diploma, a master of arts degree in public policy and a master of science degree in organisational development.  I have studied equality and human rights and recently became a chartered director with the Institute of Directors, studying in detail governance, leadership, finance and strategy.  I have served on boards at local, national and international level and am currently serving as treasurer on the board of the International Coaching Federation.  I hope that these skills will help me make a better contributor as chairperson of Pobal. <\/p> <p>  Passionate about community development and the rural economy, I was a member of the Offaly county development board and have served as a volunteer with the National Adult Literacy Agency.  Key interest areas of mine are the role of women in society, the role of carers and gender equality.  Professionally, I have held key leadership roles in the public sector, most recently as national HR director in the Health Service Executive, HSE.  I am a chartered member of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and a qualified mediator.  I believe passionately in supporting individuals and teams and in developing supportive coaching cultures. <\/p> <p>  As chairperson of Pobal a key role for my board colleagues and I will be to support, challenge and lead our excellent and committed staff to deliver on Government policy, on our programmes and to remember one fundamental thing, namely, that Pobal is not an end in itself.  It is not the object of the exercise but a means to an end, and that end is a stronger society.  It is communities across the country where people, especially the most vulnerable, are better supported.  My time as a Pobal board member and my appointment as chairperson coincide with the conclusion of our current strategic plan which covers the period 2018 to 2021.  My colleagues and I, together with the executive team are deeply engaged with writing and agreeing a new strategic plan, a process that is now in its concluding stages.  <\/p> <p>  The work of positioning Pobal to deliver on Government policy in ways that helps communities most is critically important.  There are lots of metrics by which we can measure outputs but we must remember the fundamental fact that we exist to help people.  The scale of that help and its importance in people&rsquo;s lives is immense.  In 2020, 26,178 individuals and 2,687 local community groups were supported through the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, while 16,939 new participants were approved as part of the seniors alert scheme, SAS.  A total of 1,891 young people with disabilities have been supported through the Ability programme, through 27 organisations nationally, since the programme commenced.  Some 582 community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises received Covid-19 stability fund support, enabling them to continue to provide critical supports and services while 9,123 individuals were supported on T&uacute;s and 3,385 participants were supported on the rural social scheme, RSS.  Subsidies were administered to 46,606 children from 36,236 households under the national childcare scheme while 105,975 children were supported under the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme during the 2019-2020 programme year.  This is a sample of the scale of what Pobal is delivering and demonstrates that its reach into people lives is large.  <\/p> <p>  Every programme is about people and every life situation is unique.  We are there to be a helping hand and a real support.  If the programmes we support are effective then people&rsquo;s lives are enhanced.  That is the context in which my board colleagues and I are working on our strategic plan for 2022 to 2026.  The framework for our new plan will revolve around our vision, our mission and our values.  It is about delivering continuous improvement and about agility in that delivery.  Pobal is now in the process of drafting the content for the new strategic plan across a set of four pillars underpinning our strategic ambition.  Those pillars are people, systems and processes, customers and partners, and governance.  As we conclude the development of our strategic plan for the next five years, Pobal has been engaged in the periodic critical review process.  This periodic deep dive into public organisations is a very welcome opportunity for Pobal to reflect and to take account.  As a relatively new board member, about to become chairperson, I have learnt a lot and taken considerable assurance from the rigor of this process.  A key strategic priority for me as chairperson will be ensuring that the recommendations of the periodic critical review are implemented and that Pobal continues to provide a highly effective service for managing Government grants and payments to communities.  This must be underpinned by high standards in accountability, financial management, and in the support we provide to all those we work with.  Work to date on the periodic critical review evidences that Pobal engages and consults with supported organisations on an ongoing basis to ensure the effective implementation of the programmes they manage.  The ongoing periodic critical review process and our new five-year strategic plan will be the impetus for the standards and the vision that the board and I, as chairperson, want for Pobal. <\/p> <p>  Pobal matters because every day, in towns and villages across Ireland, Pobal staff are on the ground working with communities.  They are delivering services locally to combat social exclusion and enhance lives.  Pobal makes a difference to people&rsquo;s lives and communities every day and it is a positive difference I am convinced can be increased and built upon.  As Chairperson I will define, clarify and agree expectations.  I will invest in open, regular communication and respect the experience and input of stakeholders.  In partnership with the CEO, I will lead a values-based organisation, support and challenge as required, be responsive and ensure the delivery of a value-for-money service for Government which makes a difference for people and communities.<\/p><p>I will lead a board that is focused both on the highest governance standards and on excellent performance.<\/p><p> As chair designate, I want to acknowledge the excellent leadership and commitment to Pobal of every member of the board and, in particular, our outgoing chairman, Professor Deiric &Oacute; Broin.  Deiric has contributed enormously and I express my sincere thanks to him.  I want also to commend the work and dedication of the CEO, Ms Anna Shakespeare and all the staff of Pobal working alongside local and national community organisations to build stronger communities, to support families, to assist individuals and to nurture children every day.  I am deeply honoured to have been nominated by the Minister for Justice, Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands, Deputy Humphreys, as chair designate for Pobal.  I am conscious of the responsibility I have undertaken and I come here today to present my credentials and to pledge my utter commitment to the role.<\/p><p> As with other boards, I hope to demonstrate strategic leadership and to offer an approach that is collaborative and effective.  I very much see the relationship between the board of Pobal and that of this Oireachtas committee as a two-way process.  I would be very pleased to provide regular briefings that are appropriate and useful to the members.  I thank the committee for inviting me today and I look forward to engaging with members in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021092200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosarii Mannion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mannion.

My commitment, working with the executive team, is that we are going to reduce those levels of bureaucracy, where we can, while at the same time holding that fine balance so we do not minimise or interrupt any standards of governance or accountability whereby we will be held to account.  There is a fine balance there.  We can do more and we will do more.

I can give the Deputy that assurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021092200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosarii Mannion"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I am delighted to hear that.

One of the things we are all finding across the country is the challenges with funding models as a direct result of the pandemic.  I know Pobal has to make sure that the projects it is supporting are sustainable in the long term.  We are in a very unique circumstance at the moment and it is important that we would ensure there is a certain amount of flexibility during the current climate.  The opportunities to fundraise for community organisations are not there at the moment.  There are issues in regard to the sustainability of some organisations in the short term.  It is important that when assessments are done, they are not purely being done based on the here and now, which, as I said, is very unique, but that we look at the broader sustainability of these initiatives going forward.<\/p> <p>  One other point that I would like Ms Mannion to take away is in a broader area, and it is in regard to the level of female participation on public boards.  Ms Mannion is sadly in a relatively unique position in that she has been a member of a public board, not just in Pobal but also the county development board in Offaly.  That will give her a unique perspective in terms of the challenges across the midlands counties in particular.  We need to do more to encourage women to apply for State boards.  Ms Mannion is in an even more unique club in being a chair of a public board as there is only a small handful of women in that particular role.  As I  said as Minister and as a member of this committee, it would be great to be in a situation where the Minister of the day is forced to appoint a man to a State board in order to meet the 40% threshold.  That is what we should strive to achieve right across the board in order to have a mix of gender.  We also need a mix of background.  If we look at many State boards across the country, many of them are dominated by people from Dublin or the hinterland of Dublin, and people have a very different mindset than we see in the rest of the country.  It is important to get that regional balance.  I hope Ms Mannion can engage with colleagues and use her role to encourage more women and more people from regional locations, with regional perspectives, to apply for appointment to State boards and to act as chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021092200002#C00700","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I will start with the second point first.  Female participation and gender equality is an area that I am absolutely passionate about.  I am delighted to report that the board of Pobal has 60% female proportional representation at the moment.  I would obviously like to see greater participation across the board.<\/p><p>It is an area that has improved across State boards.  We have much more progress to make, but it certainly has been improved.  Excellent work has been done by Balance for Better Business, the Public Appointments Service and the Institute of Directors in Ireland.  I assure the Chair that I will do whatever I need to do to offer a helping hand to any females out there to participate in, or apply to, boards.  I will certainly do everything I can in that regard.  I thank the Chair for his comments.<\/p><p> On the point about Covid-19, there is no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions have had a disproportionate effect on the most vulnerable and marginalised individuals.  Pre-existing social and economic inequalities are increasing as a result of the pandemic.  We are acutely aware of that in Pobal and we are not passive bystanders.  We will feed our observations to policymakers in terms of policy design and implementation and in making sure that is taken on board as much as possible and as much as it practicably can be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021092200002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosarii Mannion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mannion for attending and for her instructive engagement with the committee.
