Members and all in attendance are required to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Today is the first meeting in a long time where people can physically come into room as well as ourselves.  Members are required to practice good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and other attendees.  They should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for full co-operation in this matter.<\/p> <p>  Any member participating in the meeting remotely is required to participate from within the Leinster House complex only. <\/p> <p>  Today the committee will give consideration to the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  To assist us in considering these matters I am pleased to welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, who is participating in the meeting online.  Members will recall that the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs gave comprehensive consideration to this trade agreement earlier this year and engaged with a wide range of witnesses, including the Minister.  The committee published its report on the matter last week and laid it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, given that this committee's remit specifically relates to the affairs of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we decided it would be appropriate for us to engage directly with the Minister on this matter. <\/p> <p>   I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  This means that witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if statements of witnesses are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, I will direct them to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. <\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, the Minister's opening statement has not been received by the committee, and on behalf of the committee, I express our disappointment that we have not received it.  We have raised that with departmental officials and Ministers of State in the past when we have not received opening statements.  It is important that members get the opening statement before the meeting starts so that they can address it and contribute as best they can.  I call the Minister to make his opening contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

As the committee will be aware, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs debated CETA over several hearings and published its report last Wednesday.  I hope we are moving closer to a time when we can take a vote of ratification.  Ratifying CETA is Government policy and an objective of mine as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  While I welcome the scrutiny, I do not want ratification delayed and drifting indefinitely, and for Ireland to have to stand by and watch other EU member states ratify it ahead of us, as the majority have.  That would send out the wrong message to the world - one of a waning commitment to trade and free enterprise in Ireland which would have negative consequences for investment and employment.  Ireland should be a leader in Europe and a first mover when it comes to free trade. <\/p> <p>  As a country, we owe our relative prosperity to the goods and services produced by our people and our land, which we sell around the world.  This formula that has worked well.  It is based on international trade, our attractiveness as a place to invest and our ability to enter into international free trade agreements with other countries.  Our position at the heart of Europe, its single market and the eurozone is also crucial to this.  This economic model has consistently raised our living standards through the decades and created hundreds of thousands of jobs for our citizens.  We will depend on that for our pandemic recovery. <\/p> <p>  Since the provisional application of CETA in 2017, the benefits have been plain to see.  Goods exports to Canada increased from &euro;953 million in 2016 to more than &euro;1.7 billion in 2020.  That is an increase of 78% in a little over five years.  Services exports grew from &euro;1.6 billion in 2016 to more than &euro;2.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 44%.  This benefits all Irish jobs, businesses and tax revenues, which we use to fund our public services and public infrastructure.  The elimination of tariffs, reduced trade barriers and simplified customs procedures and the more compatible technical requirements that flow from CETA make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to trade with Canada.<\/p> <p>  In April this year, my Department released the results of an independent study by Copenhagen Economics of the potential economic opportunities for Ireland of the EU free trade agreements, FTAs, with Canada, South Korea, Mexico and Japan.  It found that these four Union FTAs are forecast to have a positive effect on trade, GDP and national income for Ireland.  The deal with Japan benefits us the most of course, due to the size of that country which has approximately 120 million people relative to Canada&rsquo;s 38 million.  An important finding in the study is that real wages would increase by up to 4.4% in 2030 as a result of the trade agreements, with the largest increases for low-income workers.  This demolishes the idea that well-designed free trade agreements exert downward pressure on wages and labour standards when, in fact we know the reverse is true.  As members will be aware, the full coming into force of CETA, once ratified by all member states, will result in the implementation of the investment chapter of the agreement, including provisions for the resolution of disputes between investors and states should they arise.  This has been the area of most controversy. <\/p> <p>  All international agreements have dispute resolution arrangements; they need to.  Where such agreements cover, not only trade in both goods and services but also investment rules and protections, there must be some form of dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments.  The EU&rsquo;s new approach to investment protection is the investment court system, ICS, which is contained in CETA and replaces the original investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism.  It is important to point out that this is something that we, as the EU, looked for in negotiations and wanted included; it is not something being imposed on us by anybody else.<\/p><p>On the ICS, I emphasise the rights of governments to regulate in the public interest are paramount and I believe they are fully protected under the terms of this agreement and the accompanying joint interpretative instrument.  Investors may utilise national courts or the ICS but cannot use both to forum shop.  Equally, it is important to remember that a Canadian firm can already sue the Government for alleged unfair treatment or discrimination in our courts whether CETA exists or not.  In the courts today, we see plenty of examples of companies suing the government and its agencies or the government and its agencies suing private companies. The same will apply to Irish companies that operate in Canada and it works very much in both directions.  What CETA simply provides for is an arbitration alternative to using national courts.  However, that alternative, unlike a challenge in the courts, cannot find any act of a government to be <i>ultra vires<\/i>or unconstitutional.  It is concerned only with redress or compensation if harm and discrimination is proven.<br\/><br\/>In Ireland, were we not to ratify CETA and instead sought to allow provisional application to continue on an indefinite basis, this would bring substantial legal uncertainty for businesses around tariffs and market access, as well as customs and conformity requirements.  It is also the case that indefinite provisional application is unprecedented and would be open to legal challenge; just leaving things as they are is not a viable solution.  There would be no quantitative benefit to Irish businesses or the economy overall in rejecting the agreement.<br\/><br\/>Regarding potential costs, it would be an entirely hypothetical exercise to try to estimate what, if any, costs could arise for the Exchequer on foot of any judgement under the ICS or to say what type of discrimination would be substantiated against the State.  I would argue the State is not going to discriminate against any Canadian companies.  It is also not possible to anticipate the sector of the economy or the size of the company which may pursue such a claim, but the Irish State has a strong reputation for rule of law and has no record of treating inward investors unfairly, inequitably or in a discriminatory manner, which are the criteria under which an award could be made.  In contrast, we are usually accused of the opposite.  Hence, the State&rsquo;s exposure to economic loss cannot be regarded as materially affected by the introduction of the ICS mechanism provided for within CETA.  This is particularly so given the existing recourse that inward investors from any jurisdiction have to the domestic courts.<br\/><br\/>In light of the experience and track record of the Government in supporting foreign investment in Ireland, the risk or likelihood of an award being made against the State could be considered negligible.  On that basis, the protections offered by CETA to Irish investors in Ireland would far outweigh any potential exposure to the State under the agreement.  The day-to-day administrative costs of the ICS tribunal, including the retainer fees of the fifteen members, will place no charge on the Exchequer and will be covered by the budgets of the European Commission and the Canadian Government.  Therefore, there are no costs directly arising from CETA.  Under the ICS, a state can never be forced to change its legislation, only to pay fair compensation in cases where an investor is deemed to have been treated unfairly under the specific grounds detailed.  An investor cannot be given compensation just because it has lost profits or suffered economic loss or costs; it is for the investor to prove it was discriminated against and to establish that it incurred losses as a consequence of that discrimination.<br\/><br\/>CETA preserves the right of each member state to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, the environment or consumer protection, meaning policies such as those relating to plain packaging on cigarettes, for example, or minimum alcohol pricing can, and will, continue to be introduced.  These &quot;right to regulate&quot; provisions are specifically designed to avoid any danger of so-called &ldquo;regulatory chill&rdquo;.  As part of the finalisation of the agreement, the EU and Canada also agreed a legally binding joint interpretative instrument that was added to CETA to provide further assurances in relation to public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.  CETA does not restrict either the EU or Canada from passing new laws in areas of public interest, such as the environment and health and safety, nor does it affect the Government's scope for developing new laws in response to the needs and priorities of Irish citizens.  Importantly, within CETA, both sides agree that more trade and investment should not be at the expense of environmental protection and labour rights.  The EU and Canada will not seek competitive advantage through lowering of standards in any domain.  On the contrary, the EU and Canada are committed to ensuring CETA helps confirm that economic growth, social development and environmental protection can go hand in hand as far as is practicable.<br\/><br\/>As a small, open economy, Ireland has benefited from our export-oriented enterprises trading across the globe and, therefore, we support international trade and the EU FTAs that seek to underpin this.  Ireland has been, and is, an attractive destination for foreign direct investment, FDI, for many decades, and participating in EU third-country agreements that cover investment and provide investment protection continue to assist us in marketing Ireland as a competitive FDI-friendly jurisdiction for multinational enterprise to invest in, with the attendant jobs and prosperity that entails.  On that basis, and given that there can be no doubt that CETA is a high-standard agreement, I believe that ratifying the agreement, albeit at this late stage, would send a positive message to our trading partners around the world, and to our ally, Canada, that Ireland continues to be committed to the values of open and fair global trade.  <br\/><br\/>I again thank the committee for taking the time to consider the agreement in detail.  I hope this process can help us to move towards ratification soon.  Again, my apologies for not being able to send the committee this statement in advance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#A00700","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Canadian Government has also been sued multiple times by Eli Lilly and Company and in other instances.<\/p> <p>  A special court for corporations will act as a major deterrent for Government in passing laws that might benefit citizens but may not benefit corporations.

It is important that colleagues look at the hard facts of this agreement rather than creating a straw man, which might have had some validity in earlier agreements.  It is also important to bear in mind we are a country that exports 130% of our GDP and we are one of the most open economies in the world.  We have welcomed foreign investment, including Canadian investment, on the basis of respect for the sort of principles underpinning this investor protection agreement, such as no discrimination, everyone being treated fairly and so on.<\/p><p>I was on the trade council and I will ask the Minister to confirm some of the memories I have of these issues.  In drawing up this agreement, we bent over backwards to ensure the State's right and the citizen's right to expect government could regulate their interests in every way was protected.  First, am I correct that the grounds on which a claim can be taken are restricted?  They have to do with a denial of justice, a breach of fundamental due process or targeted discrimination against the company.  Second, am I also correct that explicit provision was made whereby there could be no obligation to privatise, no restriction on a government bringing back into public ownership some service and no interference with the state's right to regulate?  Frameworks that might impact on the profit of a company can be changed and states are perfectly entitled to do that.  In addition, am I correct that there was a decisive move away from the previous <i>ad hoc<\/i>, closed system, to an open system with a panel of experienced judges from both sides to ensure this process was fair and open and an appeal mechanism was put in place?<\/p><p>While I understand why people have concerns about chilling effects on the State based on past experience, the facts of this agreement are particularly protective.  As the Minister said, it was part of the new, progressive generation of trade agreements that recognised the need for a new settlement with globalisation.  That is clear.  We are shifting expectations of companies, rightly so, but this agreement protects the State's rights.<\/p><p>Does the Minister agree that protectionism is alive and well?  Often, it is not at national level; it can be at individual state level.  It is important that Irish companies are able to trade in a large country such as Canada and not find that rules in one province, or one part of the federation, are treating it unfairly.  There are benefits for Ireland in having this sort of access for our companies, which cannot afford expensive court procedures in several different jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#E00800","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution.

These are all public policy matters and are not trammelled in any way by the treaty.<\/p><p>On the grounds for making a claim, I will again point out companies can already make claims against states.  That is nothing new.  However, the grounds set out in CETA are the standard for &quot;fair and equitable&quot; treatment.  It is:<\/p> <blockquote> \ta clear, closed text which defines precisely the standard of treatment, without leaving ... discretion to the Members of the Tribunal ...<br \/><br \/>Thus, a breach of the fair and equitable treatment ... can only arise when there is<br \/><br \/>(a) denial of justice in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings; (b) fundamental breach of due process, including a fundamental breach of transparency, in judicial and administrative proceedings; (c) manifest arbitrariness; (d) targeted discrimination on manifestly wrongful grounds, such as gender, race or religious belief; (e) abusive treatment of investors, such as coercion, duress and harassment; or (f) a breach of any further elements of the fair and equitable treatment obligation adopted by the Parties <\/blockquote> <p>These are the grounds on which an Irish company could take action against a Canadian authority or<i>vice versa.<\/i>They are strong protections and it is legitimate that if an Irish company was treated in that way, it should have recourse to the courts.  Again, it is already the case that companies can sue states.  There is nothing new about that.  What is different in this agreement is that there is an international panel as an alternative to the national courts system.  That is to the advantage of Irish companies, rather than dealing with nine or ten provinces with different legal systems.  The reverse happens for Canadian companies in Europe that have to deal with 27 different legal systems.  They have the certainty of one system that is much easier to manage. <\/p><p>I agree with what the Deputy said about protectionism.  It is alive and well and, if anything, is making a comeback, not just in Ireland but around the world.  That worries me because there is no doubt Ireland will be a net loser if we start rowing back on free trade and see the rise of protectionism again.

The protections that exist do so for all businesses.  They exist for Irish firms operating in Canada and particularly for small firms that do not have the resources and big legal departments that the big companies have.  They gain these protections as well.  It is a two-way street, as trade always is.  Irish firms will benefit and get the protections they need if they are mistreated or discriminated against.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Paris climate accords, any analysis of these trade agreements would indicate that the impact on the environment is not large in either direction.  What we need to do in terms of meeting our commitments under the Paris Agreement is what we do ourselves.  Of course, all trade involves a degree of transport and there are emissions from that.  What we need to do, however, we need to do ourselves, whether it is around decarbonising our energy systems or all the things we need to do.

I will arrange for that RIA to be circulated to committee members.<\/p> <p>  In summary, as I set out in my opening statement, since the provisional application of CETA in 2017, the benefits have been plain to see, with goods exports increasing from &euro;953 million to &euro;1.7 billion and service exports increasing from &euro;1.6 billion to &euro;2.3 billion.  In April this year, we released the Copenhagen Economics report on the potential economic opportunities of the four FTAs and their forecast to have a positive effect on trade, GDP, national income for Ireland, wages and consumer prices.<\/p> <p>  With regard to potential litigation costs, which the Deputy mentioned, what we are discussing here is the ICS under CETA.  I reiterate that a Canadian firm can already sue the Government for alleged unfair treatment or discrimination in our courts.  This would be the case whether CETA existed or not.  What CETA simply provides for is an alternative to the national courts, which is an arbitration mechanism.<\/p> <p>  Regarding potential costs, it would be a hypothetical exercise to estimate what costs, if any, would arise for the Exchequer on foot of a judgment under the ICS or to say what type of discrimination would be substantiated against the State.  Equally, it is not possible to anticipate the sector of the economy or the size of the company that may pursue such a claim.  As I highlighted previously, however, the State has a strong reputation for observing the rule of law and we have no record of treating inward investors unfairly or in a discriminatory manner.  If anything, we are accused of the opposite.  I find it hard to see, therefore, how a Canadian company would use the ICS system successfully to gain compensation from Ireland.

The argument for an alternative is weak, other than on grounds of efficiency.  The other important point to make is that we can be in favour of a trade deal but not in favour of this specific element of the alternative dispute resolution system.

The first relates to the ratification process.  The Minister said that most member states have ratified the deal.  According to my latest count, 13 member states have yet to ratify it.  There is a certain irony there because the Government has dragged its heels when transposing some EU directives in the past but there is an eagerness on the part of this Government to try to ratify this trade deal.

Most other member states, 15 of the 27, which are member states further along than we are, for example, France and the Netherlands, have ratified it by their lower house as I mentioned earlier.  Since I have been the Minister, there have been no discussions whatsoever at European Council level around a plan B or what we would do if it is not ratified.

Is Ireland adopting the position that the ICS will be the preferred mechanism in future trade agreements to discuss how countries use arbitration rather than country to country as was used previously?<\/p> <p>  It was said that rules were designed to ensure access by SMEs to the tribunal but they appear to be absent, although there is a commitment by the Commission and the Council to ensure such access is provided.  Have there been further assurances about this access for SMEs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#H00500","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>The question asked by the Deputy at the outset on the breach of competition law is valid, but it is also hypothetical.  I imagine that the way it would work is that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, which is Ireland's competition authority, would conclude that there was a breach of competition law.  If that breach of competition law harmed a Canadian company, I do not see how they would sue the State because it would be the State that had found competition law had been breached.  If for some reason a State body did not follow its procedures and failed to find that there was a competition breach when there was one, if for example an Irish company was acting in breach of competition law and the competition authority did nothing about that, then the Canadian company could take the case.  For this to happen it would have to be an Government agency acting illegally and discriminating against a Canadian company over a European one.  I just do not think that would arise.  We do not have a tradition in Ireland of discriminating against international investors.  I do not believe that anyone would argue that we do.<\/p> <p>  The ICS could well be a prototype for future trade agreements.  It does not exist in some trade agreements and it does in others.  I believe it is in the Mexico agreement but not in EU-Mercosur, for example.  It is potentially a prototype for future agreements and particularly if we are coming to trade agreements with China in the future or other economic powers.  It is something we would favour as a European Union because it creates that alternative to the national courts that maybe would not have the same degree of confidence.<\/p> <p>  On SME access, part of the reason for this system is to assist SMEs.  SMEs do not have big funds or big legal departments.  It is hard for them to navigate different national court systems, different provinces in Canada and different member states.  Having a single mechanism as an alternative to national courts would be to their advantage if they are being mistreated or discriminated against.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#H00600","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Again, the case would have to be upheld.  It would have to be true that the Government or a Government agency discriminated against and treated a Canadian company unfairly.  It is already the case in the national courts that such a case could be taken and there could be damages, and I believe punitive damages as well as compensation.  The answer to the Deputy's question is &quot;Yes&quot; but I will read a note into the record from my officials that might answer the question better than I did:<\/p> <blockquote> \tCETA introduces a precise and specific standard of fair and equitable treatment of investors and investment.  An investor may only have recourse to the ICS in very specific limited grounds such as in the case of a denial of justice, a fundamental breach of due process or targeted discrimination, for example, on the grounds of race, religious belief or gender.  None of these measures give the Government any concern that we would be subject to ICS proceedings.  Investors must prove that they have been discriminated against or treated unfairly as described.  They must also prove that they have suffered economic harm or loss.  CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives and it is made clear that the agreement does not imply an expectation that public bodies will remain unchanged.  An investor cannot be given compensation solely because he or she has lost profits or suffered economic loss or costs and there is no provision for the awarding of punitive damages.  [I am happy to clarify that.]  As such, regulation for the protection of public health, the environment, or consumer protection, for example, measures relating to plain packaging on cigarettes and minimum alcohol pricing, can continue to be introduced and it is also noted in the CETA that governments can change their laws including in a way that affects investors' expectations of profits.  That would not be a breach of investor protection standards.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#H00800","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#H00900","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>That concludes the first round of questions.

It is a false argument that some people are making, perhaps not the Senator, that this would open up the possibility of litigation, when that litigation happens regularly using national court systems and international arbitration mechanisms.  This is just a new avenue.  It is a more efficient system that will be beneficial to Irish companies operating in Canada.  That is why we think it is to the benefit of people.<\/p> <p>  I can understand why people may be against this treaty, and that is fair enough.  They are going to vote against it no matter when the vote is held, be it this year or two years hence.  What I do not understand is the argument that somehow we should wait to ratify it last or wait until we are among the last two or three countries to ratify it.  If one is for it, fair enough and if one is against it, fair enough.  However, I do not understand the argument that it is somehow beneficial to drag this out or to wait until we are the last, second last or third last country to ratify it.

Is there anybody on this call who is going to change his or her mind just because we are the last or second last country to do it?

Were the terms of CETA to be approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, a separate decision of the Government would then be required authorising the notification of the completion of Ireland's domestic procedure concerning the ratification of CETA to the Secretariat-General of the Council.

As it stands, Canadian companies can sue the Government in the national courts, as can citizens, etc.  However, these proposals allow for separate systems, the likes of which we have not signed up to previously.  We have not signed up to anything like this proposed system.  In that respect, therefore, the Minister will have to accept that this is something of a new departure.  It is not the same process as the national courts because it is not open to everybody.  It is only open to these large multinationals and corporations.  It is a special corporate court and it is not open to citizens.<\/p> <p>  It is different to anything that exists now, or am I picking this up wrong?  Can the Minister give us an example of something that is the same as the ICS?  I ask because this is the aspect that people are concerned about.  I am not going to tell him what to do, but I would not infer that people are somehow not capable of understanding this aspect.  I think people understand it and they are not glibly writing emails to their elected representatives.  People have engaged with the issue and, where they have a concern, they raise it.  They are perfectly entitled to do that.  I would not dismiss that, and I encourage the Minister not to do so either.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the specifics of the ICS, where and what are we now signed up to that is the same as this proposal?  When people say that this is a new departure, that is, effectively, the case because this would be a new space for us to go into.  We can argue the merits and demerits of doing that, but we must first accept that what we would enter into would be a new space.  It is a separate and parallel process.  It is not the same as our national courts, because, as was said, the national courts can act in the public interest.  The ICS is not the same.  It is an additional system that is available only to corporations.  We are not signed up to anything that is the same as this proposed system.  However, if there is, then I would like the Minister to tell us what it is so that we can go and engage with it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#L02600","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  People are capable of understanding the issues, but, unfortunately, sometimes they are misled.  Some people genuinely believe that ratifying CETA will mean that for the first time it will be possible for Canadian companies to sue the State.  That is not true.  Many things have been put out there that are not true.  People are being told that it will be possible to sue for loss of profits.  Again, that is not true.  Unfortunately, therefore, some people at least are being misled regarding what CETA is all about.  Frankly, that is wrong and shame on those who would engage in misleading the public in any form.  This is an additional system, as the Deputy described it.  I agree with that description of it as an additional system.  However, it is not new or unprecedented to have international panels and transnational courts.  The ICS will only look at the terms of CETA and it cannot challenge domestic law, which must be taken by the ICS tribunal as a fact.  Perhaps that answers the question previously asked by Deputy Murphy.  The ICS is only there to adjudicate on CETA and the system cannot be used to challenge a domestic law.  That must be accepted by the ICS tribunal as a fact and it can only look at whether the terms of CETA have been breached.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the broader issue, international trade agreements are not part of domestic law and that is why separate adjudication arrangements are required where disputes may arise in such contexts.  All international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements.  Moreover, where such agreements cover investment rules and protections, there must be a dispute resolution mechanism to cover investments.  An example would be an ISDS mechanism, which was the original plan under CETA.  Irish companies investing in Canada have only one legal system and one constitutional framework to navigate should they believe that they have been discriminated against.  In contrast, Canadian companies investing in Europe are faced with 27 legal systems and constitutions to navigate.  ISDS systems have existed since the 1950s and they enable overseas investors to resolve disputes with the government of the country where the investment is made through binding international arbitration.  ISDS mechanisms have been included in more than 2,000 investment treaties to date.  The mechanism proved controversial in recent times, and it is now regarded as outdated by the European Commission.<\/p> <p>  The Government considered the fact that the European Commission was to seek to address the concerns raised by NGOs and others regarding the ISDS system in the context of the Commission trying to develop a new replacement mechanism - the ICS - to address concerns regarding transparency and the legitimacy of the public interest.  Therefore, what is worth pointing out here is that the original mechanism proposed was an ISDS system.  We have loads of those already.  The concept is part of 2,000 investment treaties.  We are not party to all of them, but we are party to some of them.  The investment court system is designed to be an improvement on the ISDS system and to be more transparent, more legitimate and more in the public interest.  Other people, who objected to CETA earlier, did not like the ISDS system.  We have tried to respond to those concerns by coming up with a better system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021092200002#L02700","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Designed to be responsive to whom is what we must be clear about.

As you noted, Chair, joining me today are council members Ms Dawn Holland, Professor Michael McMahon, Dr. Adele Bergin, and Mr. Alessandro Giustiniani as well as our chief economist and head of secretariat, Dr. Eddie Casey.  We value our engagements with the Oireachtas and see this as a very important part of our work.  The council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to assess and endorse the official macroeconomic forecasts, assess budgetary projections, compliance with the fiscal rules and to assess the fiscal stance.  Its focus is on the overall fiscal stance, rather than on individual tax measures or spending items.<\/p> <p>  Last week, the council published its pre-budget 2022 statement as an input into the upcoming budget.  The economy is recovering quickly from the pandemic as vaccinations progress and as individuals adapt to new circumstances.  Upside risks to the official projections for the economy include the potential unwinding of large household savings and boost from the Government&rsquo;s planned budgetary expansion.  However, jobs are likely to recover more slowly than spending and the long-term scarring effects on activity from the pandemic remain uncertain.  Over the longer term, it is likely that Ireland&rsquo;s ageing population would tend to slow growth, with productivity growth also likely to moderate as it converges on norms for more mature economies.<\/p> <p>  The council welcomes the July summer economic statement, SES, as a significant step in the Government publishing a medium-term budgetary plan to 2025.  This is something that was promised in the programme for Government.  The SES includes more realistic spending forecasts for maintaining the existing level of services.  This basically allows for pressures from rising prices and changing demographics that were not fully accounted for in past forecasts.  The change in approach addresses a long-standing weakness in budgetary projections that the council had been concerned about.  The SES also sets out a new spending rule and a debt objective.  These approaches are also welcome and partly address recommendations made by the council in the past.<\/p> <p>  While the progress made in the SES was welcome, there were three key areas for concern.  First, there has been a significant shift in policy for the medium term, leading to higher risk.  While a sizeable fiscal response to Covid-19 was warranted, the sustained deficits now planned for future years would prevent the debt ratio from falling steadily to safer levels.  The Government&rsquo;s own projections imply a deficit of close to 3% of GNI* in 2025, while the council&rsquo;s more positive view of the recovery would suggest something close to 1.5% if the Government sticks to its spending plans.  Running significant budget deficits for several years during a period of strong growth and with high public debt carries risks.<\/p> <p>  Even allowing for low interest rates into the future, the council estimates a one-in-four risk that the Government&rsquo;s debt ratio could end up on an unsustainable path.  Ireland&rsquo;s deficit and net debt ratio could still be among the highest in the OECD by 2025, which increases the risks of higher borrowing costs if Ireland is viewed as an outlier, particularly as a relatively small, open economy.  This leaves the public finances more exposed to shocks, particularly from unexpected falls in growth.  It also reduces the likelihood that the Government could respond to future crises or future downturns by supporting the economy in the same way it did during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  Second, key details of the fiscal plan are still lacking.  The planned increase in public investment will see Ireland&rsquo;s public investment peak at around 6% of national income in the coming years.  There is a good case for higher spending in areas such as health, climate change, and housing, particularly as interest rates are so low.  Yet the speed and timing of the ramp-up of investments, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s weak track record with public investment management, means that capacity constraints might lead to higher costs.  To assess the risks, more information is needed on the Government&rsquo;s investment plans and the underlying economic assumptions, particularly in relation to the new national development plan, the climate action plan, implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and around Housing for All.  The Government should plan eventually to bring investment down to more normal levels.<\/p> <p>  Third, the new spending rule and debt objective need more work if they are to be useful.  The spending rule is intended to constrain permanent voted spending to grow at the same rate as potential output, assumed by the Government to be around 5%.  The council has recommended a spending rule for several years to ensure that spending grows in line with the Government&rsquo;s ability to pay.  However, applying the rule now, when sharp permanent spending increases already took place in the last budget, means that the rule is likely to lock in a high path for spending.  There are also a number of other design problems with the rule.  It is too narrow, focused only on a portion of spending and ignoring tax cuts; it should be calibrated to improve the deficit rather than to maintain it; and it should be given a statutory footing and better linked to the debt objective, which is itself rather vaguely specified.  The SES also did not explain how the budgetary plans comply with the existing EU and domestic fiscal rules.<\/p> <p>  In regard to budget 2022, the council&rsquo;s assessment is that the Government&rsquo;s &euro;4.7 billion package of measures appears to be at the limit of what is prudent.  The implied 5.5% expansion is modestly above estimates of the underlying potential growth rate of the economy but this would help to support the recovery.  The council assesses that some of the temporary and targeted income and job supports may need to continue, depending in part on the public health situation.<\/p> <p>  Looking beyond 2022, the Government should prioritise between its plans for significant expansions in public investment, fast increases in current spending and a desire to cut taxes.<\/p><p>By expanding all areas at once, the Government is effectively avoiding difficult choices and slowing the return of debt ratios to safer levels.  This reduces the scope to ensure that future downturns or crises could be cushioned by strong fiscal support in the same way as we have seen during the pandemic.  A more prudent approach would be to limit current spending to a slower pace of increase or not to implement tax plans to reduce taxes at the same time as a ramp-up in public investment is going ahead.  I thank the committee and look forward to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes and his team for the presentation.  I want to talk about tax buoyancy and the forecasts.  Mr. Barnes's opening statement and the pre-budget statement published by the council last week focused on what could be described as a robust and quick recovery of the economy as restrictions ease and normal economic activity resumes.  He said the council has developed a recovery scenario which differs from the macroeconomic projections in the SES.  He described those as not being fully updated and not consistent with the Government's fiscal plans.<\/p> <p>  The council's recovery scenario sees modified domestic demand, which we know is a better measure of economic activity than GDP, rebounding faster than the projections in the SES.  We also know that tax receipts returned to the Exchequer signalled a strong recovery with tax heads such as VAT, income tax and corporation tax coming in above profile.  What accounts for the difference between the scenario outlined by the council and that in the SES?  Is it the view of the witnesses, given the outdated projections in the SES which feed into the tax and fiscal forecasts, that tax revenue is likely to be higher and, therefore, deficits lower this year and in 2022?<\/p> <p>  In his statement Mr. Barnes outlined that the deficit will drop from a projection of about &euro;20 billion this year to in the region of &euro;15 billion.

It was a concern and disappointment to us that the SES, which is a major statement of Government policy, did not include updated macroeconomic projections.  There were some updates on the international side, but the domestic parts failed to take into account two significant developments.  The first was that the short-term news in the economy has been much more positive than it was when the special purpose entity, SPE, was set up in April.  The second is that the fiscal stance has changed very significantly.  It was a major flaw in the SES that it did not update the macroeconomic projections in what was a major statement of Government policy.<\/p> <p>  As a result of that, as the Deputy correctly noted we developed a recovery scenario because we thought that was a more realistic picture that took into account both of those things, namely a scenario where the economy recovers quite rapidly and where the long-term impact of Covid relative to the trend is relatively small because the economy has bounced back quite fast.  To us, that suggests there will not be as big a long-term impact as we feared at one time.  That is essentially good news.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the pace of recovery, the way to think about it is that this is a timing issue.  We were always relatively positive about where the economy was going to end up; it is just that the recovery has happened earlier.  That means that we see more of the recovery in 2021 and less in 2022.  We get to the same position, but earlier.  That is a good thing, but it does not change our view of the long or medium run.  It is important to view it as a timing issue.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy has noted, we have not done a very detailed analysis of the budget deficit for this year, but, as he reminded us, we think it could be around &euro;15 billion or 7% of national income, which is somewhat less than what was set out in the stability programme update, SPU.  It is still a big deficit.<\/p> <p>  Does Dr. Casey want to add anything specifically about 2022?  It obviously depends on decisions taken in the budget.

There is now anticipated to be a deficit for several years which means that the debt ratio will not move substantially toward safer levels.  The Government will essentially be putting more money into the economy than it takes out over this period.  There is a risk of overheating eventually building up or cost pressures in specific sectors.  That is the concern.<\/p> <p>  The origin of that concern is that the Government is increasing current spending in line with inflation.  It is increasing the volume of current spending, ramping up investment and planning to cut taxes.  It is trying to do everything at the same time.<\/p><p> In regard to the pressure on the public finances and the budget balance, a reduction of debt could be achieved by prioritising between those different items in the medium term.  The council does not have a mandate and does not look at those specific items.  However, if one accepts the case that the priority is to improve public services and that investment is extremely important, that raises questions about the relative importance of doing the other things.  One has to wonder whether cutting taxes should be the priority and the prudent thing to do in the context of these other ambitions that the Government has.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's second point, there is a very important distinction between current and capital investment in economic terms.  We know also that many of the needs of the economy are in terms of the capital.  Public investment was very low for a long time.  We are partly paying the price for that today.  There is an important distinction.  It is a good case to make public investment while interest rates are low.  We recognise that case and that is why we are relatively comfortable in some sense with the run-up investment that is planned.  However, it is a huge increase.  There are legitimate questions about the capacity of the economy to catch up at that speed.  Therefore, having a period of catch up clearly makes sense.<\/p><p> Investment at one point was maybe running at 2% of the national income.  It will now go to 6%.  If it only went to 4%, it would take an awfully long time for the economy to catch up.  It is okay to overshoot, but that has to be managed carefully and it raises risks.  This is a very high level of investment by historical standards in Ireland.  It is essentially the highest ever share of national income in public investment.  It is very high by international standards as well.  It is a very sharp increase.  That process has to be carefully managed, because it carries risks in terms of value for money but also in terms of macroeconomic management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty has run out of time.

There are clearly important changes afoot internationally and those may impact Ireland.  Ireland is also very reliant on a small number of companies for corporation tax.<\/p> <p>  Inflation, if the economy runs a bit hot, and internationally is  a very major question.

When thinking about the borrowing risk, my view would be that the risk is not that the borrowing is the trigger but rather that high levels of borrowing limits the ability of the economy to respond to other triggers that might arise.<\/p> <p>  I will respond to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question about the effect of an unwind of savings.  We know that saving rates have been high.  This is partly because people have become more prudent, but partly also because there has been enforced lack of spending in the economy over the last 18 months during lockdown.  The question about whether this will generate inflation depends a lot on how quickly and in which sectors people choose to spend the money.  Again, touching on Mr. Barnes&rsquo;s opening statement, one concern would be that people have built up sufficient savings and they all decide to invest, for instance, in housing.  At the same time, the Government is embarking a large expansion of its public construction projects.  That would put quite a bit of pressure on that particular sector, which is already subject to many cost pressures coming through supply chains.  These pressures are completely outside of the control of Ireland, namely, world steel prices, cement prices, etc.  That would be a scenario where the likely inflationary effects would be larger and concentrated in particular sectors.  If everybody spent their money on doing things that they did before, such as spending in the hospitality sector, there will probably be a less likely focus on inflation.  This is because there will probably still be quite a lot of spare capacity.  That is where we would currently probably see a need for any targeted support from the economy going forward.  That unwinding of savings into those sectors would limit the need for the Government to continue to provide that targeted support.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question is difficult to answer, because it depends on exactly how people choose to spend the money.  However, this is something that we are very aware of as a potential thing to keep an eye on and see how savings choose to be unwound.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McMahon.

First, as well as housing, health and education, climate is a major issue.  The investment needs that might be associated with that are potentially massive.  That is something that we do not have much of handle on at the moment.  That is where the climate action plan will be important.  However, climate will require much more deployment of funds than health and education in the times come.  This is not to say that health and education are not important.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s second point, which is important, is the various things may be driving housing, including the Government's investment plans and,as  Professor McMahon said, private savings.  One of the things that will do is that it will give a cyclical boost to the economy in the years ahead.  That will partly feed back to the Government in terms of revenue.  This would be a good thing.  However, that is not necessarily sustainable as a source of revenue, if there is to be a temporary boom in housing.  It would be nothing on the scale of what we saw in the early 2000s.  However, it is one thing that will flatter the public finances in the years ahead.  If one look at our projections for deficit, which is around 1.5% in 2025, the underlying position is much worse than that.  It is a structural deficit, at 2% or 3%.  We need, therefore, to be careful that we do not get confused by putting money into the economy, which would make public finances look better than they really are in an underlying sense.<\/p> <p>  The impact of house prices is always difficult to assess.  We have private savings acting and we also have Government policy.  One of the things we are calling for is more economic analysis around Housing for All.  While there is a lot of information about what the Government is planning to do, there is not much of an economic assessment of what it expects the outcomes to be or on how it expects it to work.  This information would be important in assessing whether that money will have a positive impact on the economy.  We need to see a much better economic assessment from the Government on what it is planning to with Housing for All.  That will helpfully tell us something about what Government thinks will happen to rents and house prices as a result of its own policies.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I apologise for omitting climate from my list.

We make regular efforts through wave and wind energy but they are related.  The wind energy will provide renewable energy for two thirds of the requirement in terms of time.  One third requires to be provided for elsewhere.  There are limited areas there.  The problem would appear to be a lack of investment in those areas in the early days.  We need investment now.

I just have one criticism to make.  I have enjoyed reading the report but we got it far too late.  Maybe they do not expect us to read anything beyond the summary but there are 70 pages in it.  I got an opportunity this morning to start reading it.  I found it really interesting.<\/p> <p>  The summary captures it.  Mr. Barnes managed to incorporate what I saw as some of the key elements into his opening statement.<\/p> <p>  There is so much in this.  I have said to the Chair previously that I like to take a non-partisan approach in the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight and assume the role of an outside onlooker who is trying to represent the best interests of all of the people.  Terribly noble and all as that sounds, I mean not to take a political approach to it.<\/p> <p>  Here we are again.  This is the fifth annual pre-budget report stating we cannot rely on corporate tax.  It is truly appalling that governments have failed to deal with this.  The first steps were taken in budget 2020.  That is very regrettable.<\/p> <p>  The rainy day fund had been suggested in 2016.  Even the worst critics of the former Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, would say he had the special savings interest account, SSIA, scheme developed to try to stop people spending and to put some of their money away so that it would not boost the economy.  There was &euro;20 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund which helped to reduce the impact of the crash, although not by much.  We have no such measures in place at present.<\/p> <p>  They mentioned human resource shortages and challenges.  I do not know if we are fully across that yet or if we fully know what the impact of material shortages will be.  It seems to be much more acute in terms of materials in some other countries and I am wondering why that is.<\/p> <p>  There is so much to respond to but I want to make one point to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.  I think IFAC could help the budgetary oversight considerably in this.  It was a suggestion made by Mr. Mark Little, the former RT&Eacute; correspondent, Washington correspondent and general bright guy.  IFAC is covered to comment on this under its role of assessing the fiscal stance.  We have, as a budgetary oversight committee, in the past number of years looked at gender-proofing budgets.  The only way to politically protect decision-making in budgets is a suggestion Mr. Little made, not for that reason but to future-proof budgets.  Ministers of the day need to be held to account for budgetary decisions they take now that will have a negative or disproportionate impact on generations coming down the track.  If that became an institutionalised requirement, it would help to head off some of these things that IFAC has pointed to.<\/p> <p>  Personally, I will be looking for spending on MetroLink and all the rest of it, and fighting for the budgets that are available.  That is the politics side of the House and I accept that.  I do not see any contradiction in it.  To be quite honest, nobody anticipated tax cuts after the year and a half we have been through.  They see the State heading for a &euro;250 billion debt.  They see the State having honoured that unwritten contract between itself and its citizens and their families and non-citizens to protect them when times get really tough.  The State stood up to that challenge and the public recognise there was a huge cost to that.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see the future-proofing of budgets.  I will return to this theme.  Every Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, every Minister for Finance and every Department head and Minister will have to ask what will be the impact of this decision on an 18-year-old, on a 25-year-old, on a 30-year-old, etc., and whether it will incur a disproportionately heavy debt burden on them on top of the climate action burden that is already on their shoulders to carry.  I am off my soapbox there but I will come back to it.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barnes does not mention Brexit.  He might comment on that.  I was very taken with his final comments about climate action that this could end up being much more costly than we anticipated.  Mr. Barnes gives some figures there and some context to it.  There are three issues I would like responses on.  What are IFAC's views on Brexit, the future-proofing of budgets and the climate action piece?  I ask Mr. Barnes to develop that theme a little more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#D00700","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lahart for those thoughtful comments, including the fact that we should send him a copy of the report as soon as we have it next time.

I will ask Dr. Adele Bergin to come in on Brexit and Professor Michael McMahon to come in on the general issues.<\/p> <p>  One point Deputy Lahart is right about is that as a medium-term strategy, the SES talks about how certain things will be dealt with, mostly the increase in public investment.  It does not talk about some other subjects which are important.  One of the neglected subjects is corporation tax.  It assumes there will be a &euro;2 billion loss, as the Government has been assuming for some time, from international tax developments but that is not developed.  There is no institutional response to that.  It is just baked into the figures.  The rainy day fund solution and the prudence account that we talked about at some point could all be good ways of dealing with that, but it is not really addressed.  There is also not much on the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is another major initiative that does not really figure much in the discussion on the SES.  Where that fits into the whole arithmetic could be better articulated.  As I have said, there is a lack of detail about many aspects, including the climate aspect that the Deputy talked about and how that fits in and whether it has been allocated.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right in terms of some of these deeper questions about the public finances.  As we have said, there is a need to prioritise between higher investment, higher current spending and taxation.  The consequence of not prioritising is taking more risk and shifting the burden onto the next generation.  In the past, we have re-emphasised how hard choices needed to be taken to meet the objective that the Government had, which was, essentially, to bring debt down at a steady pace to a more prudent level.  In fact, what has happened is those hard choices have been avoided and we have ended up taking more fiscal risk.  That was precisely the risk we warned about a year ago.<\/p> <p>  Maybe Professor McMahon will want to come in on the long-term issues.

It is not currently in our remit to discuss whether the adjustments fall more on one generation than another but when you assess the current fiscal stance, it is important to know the direction of travel.<\/p><p>When we published the first long-term sustainability report last year, what was striking as we went through the analysis, and what stood out in the report, was how if actions were deferred until they became very apparent and the glaring headlights were a couple of feet away, the actions that needed to be taken at that later point would be much larger and as, Mr. Barnes alluded to, fall on a generation of people who are 15 or 20 years down the road.  We proposed - and this applies both to the ageing population and issues such as climate, on which much more work needs to be done - it is exactly right to have that longer-term view when making these assessments.  Early actions that mitigate things can be taken and, as Deputy Durkan said, in some cases, it feels as though we should have taken early action years ago.  We do not have that ability, but we do have the ability to start thinking about and making the changes now.  That is the sense in our assessment of the proposed configuration of current spending, increases in investment and tax cuts being at the limit of what we think is prudent, especially when projecting further down the road, knowing that these hard choices will have to be made.  That is the basis for why this focus on the long term is a really important one that we can do as part of our assessment of the macro aggregate fiscal stance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I want to comment on the generational point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#E00200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Bergin to go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#E00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I was going to come in on the Deputy's question on Brexit.

On Brexit, as deadlines get delayed and the new regime is not fully implemented, it may be that we are living in an unusual period, but, as Dr. Bergin said, it is hard to read the data, partly because Covid is going on and many other factors are distorting the numbers.  There are many moving parts in the flow of trade, be it to the North, the UK or the Continent, and it is hard to read.  That is why we did not say much about it.  We are still carefully watching, but it is difficult to read.<\/p> <p>  On the EU fiscal rules, there is what is called the general escape clause, which the EU has said will likely apply until the end of next year.  For the moment, the Commission is providing advice but it is not enforcing the rules as they stand.  The existing rules should kick in at EU level at that point and, of course, the domestic rules also apply.  One question is whether there will be a change to the rules.  There is significant discussion about that.  The European Commission has a consultation out.  It is unclear what the direction of that is and whether anything will change.<\/p> <p>  One of our concerns is that the Government has not explained how the running of persistent deficits over several years is consistent with the EU fiscal rules.  On the face of it, it does not look as though it is, but the Government should explain its strategy.  There may be special circumstances related to the high-level investment Ireland is planning in the years ahead, but the current EU rules do not make any allowance for that.  The Government needs to think about this and it may constrain its plans.  It needs to make the case, if it wants to go ahead with what it is doing.  It is a constraint, which was not addressed in the summer economic statement, SES.  This is unfortunate, given these are the fiscal rules to which Ireland is committed.<\/p> <p>  The third aspect is corporation tax.  There is significant discussion internationally and things may change, as a result.  It is still very hard, even at a political level, to know what will happen, both internationally and in the US, which is obviously of major interest to Ireland.  There are two main channels for the effect.  One is a loss of corporation tax revenue.  The Government is assuming a loss of &euro;2 billion in its baseline.  Our baseline is a bit higher.  The kind of work we have done would suggest that with a more prudent approach, more than &euro;3 billion, and potentially, an even bigger figure.  The other effect is on the economy.  Either some firms will withdraw from Ireland, which seems relative unlikely, or new firms will stop coming here, because it is viewed to be less attractive when some of the tax advantages have gone.<\/p> <p>  What is difficult is that revenue is concentrated around a small number of companies and the very detailed things one would only know if one was the tax director of one of these companies could have an impact on whether a company continues to pay tax here and it is very hard to predict.  That is why we argue that Ireland needs to reduce its dependency on that, because there is significant risk.  A lot of money is coming in from a small number of sources, which could change relatively fast.<\/p> <p>  There are big concerns around costs and capacity in construction.  The Government, in Housing for All, has not really explained how it sees these issues playing out and how it sees the capacity in the sector developing.  This has economic implications.  If there was just a big run-up in costs in those sectors, that could be destabilising to the rest of the economy.  It could also just reduce the value for money.  There is no point just spending more money and having more demand for construction, if there is no more supply coming.  These are things that need to be monitored, particularly as the scale of the investments becomes so large.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Does the notion that we could end up losing &euro;2 billion or, as far as Mr. Barnes is concerned in another assessment, &euro;3 billion in corporation tax to the Exchequer, as a result of the OECD process, need some revision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#E00700","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>It is uncertain, so the distribution of risks has probably not changed that much.

It is one of the things we hope we will get more information on in the climate action plan.  That would then allow us to think more carefully about the fiscal implications of what will be major societal change with many impacts on the public finances.  In that context, changes in areas such as carbon taxes may raise additional revenues.  Additional expenditures, however, may also be required in the current form to compensate some of the people affected by some of the climate policies.

It will be one of the major issues.  Much additional information is required, but three types stand out.  One is the need to have a clear idea of what the Government is planning to spend money on.  For example, will more funds be allocated to construction, which would consequently push more resources to that sector, or will more money be spent on machinery for wind farms, etc., which is imported?  Very different impacts would result for the domestic economy in each of those contexts.  It would, therefore, be very useful to know that information.

We can imagine some of them will generate revenue for the Government and the economy.  Other projects may be more concerned with just limiting economic damage.

What does Mr. Barnes want to see in the national development plan that would give IFAC comfort in terms of the policies being pursued around the catch-up we are doing on the public expenditure side and the capital side?  It is peaking at 6% in coming years.  What rate would IFAC like to see that normalised to over time?  I have read the IFAC report and that is a feature.  We are doing catch-up.  We have come through a very difficult period since the crash in 2008 and with Covid and everything else.  With everything now moving in terms of the green agenda, we have to restructure our infrastructure in those terms.  Will Mr. Barnes deal with that because I would be interested to hear his thoughts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#G01600","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":298,"content":"<p>In terms of the national development plan and the question of doing an explicit review of it, I do not think that is within our mandate and, obviously, there are many issues in there that are much more microeconomic than the ones the council deals with.  However, it will be an input to our fiscal assessment report and our assessment of the fiscal stance.  It will be important to understanding the economic forecasts, the budgetary forecasts and then our overall view of the public finances.  Whether the national development plan provides us with comfort, as the Deputy suggested, or not will very much depend on what it says.  That is why it is a very important input for our sense of the public finances.<\/p> <p>  One of the big questions we discussed earlier was what the Government's own view of the normalisation is.  I do not think it is for us to say.  There is little doubt that public investment will be higher on average in the future than it was if we go back a couple of years.  To what level it should normalise, I do not really know, but it would be good to know what the Government&rsquo;s view of that is.  The specific question of whether the normalisation ends in 2026 or how the Government is going to unwind this is an important issue because it is a big factor pushing on the economy.  That is a big part of the information we are looking for.  It is about the composition and it is about the economics of it as well.  At the moment, we do not really have that information and it is legitimate that that should be in the national development plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#G01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Barnes looking for that?

It obviously does make a big difference.  There has been a lot of discussion internationally over the past few years about the benefits of higher public investment but it often does not take into account the fact that the impact on the public finances depends a lot on whether it is revenue generating.  Some of it indirectly generates revenue through encouraging growth but other things might not have that benefit.  The multipliers matter a lot.  There are some forms that will feed back relatively quickly into the public finances because they are quite employment intensive, for example, but buying imported things is going to have a lot less impact.<\/p><p>Of course, the NDP is about much more than just public investment.  There is a broader vision of the economy, which will be important for growth and issues such as climate change.  One of the things we need to understand is whether the measures in the NDP are going to meet the Government's own climate objectives.  If there is a shortfall there that would suggest that maybe more spending is needed than is in the plan, then that would, of course, be a concern.  If it is a plan consistent with delivering the Government's objectives, we would find that reassuring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#G01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I am not sure whether it has been touched on but I want to raise the new spending rule and the debt objective.  I assume one of the areas Mr. Barnes is commenting on in that regard is that IFAC have been looking for a fully-balanced budget by 2025.  The Government is looking to run a balanced budget on the current side but a deficit with respect to the capital side.  Can an argument be made that with an economy such as Ireland's, which is doing such a catch-up on the capital side, we are by definition going to be running deficits on the capital side for a period?  Is it a point of principle with the council?

That is one of the reasons we are interested in exactly how the capital is going to be done.  That this is in large part capital spending makes a big difference.  If the Government said it was going to run a deficit of this size just for everyday current spending, we would be much more concerned than we are when it is for public investment.  As we say in the report, there is a strong case for public investment at the moment, both because there are big needs and because interest costs are low.<\/p> <p>  What is important is that other factors must be looked at.  One is the capacity of the construction sector and the economy to deliver in a sustainable way these kinds of increases in investment and the deficit financing of it.  The other one is, of course, the sustainable level of the public finances.  Ireland enters this with a lot of debt.  If public debt today was 50% of national income then we would be having a different conversation about this.  The concern comes from the fact we start from a very high level of debt inherited not particularly from building up the capital stock but from the pandemic-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Yes, and the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#H00400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>-----and from the banking crisis and its consequences.

That is the kind of programme we were much more comfortable with.  That said, there are choices to be made around that and there is no exact science as to whether that path is the perfect one.

On the other, had the Government stuck to its earlier plans, that would have been achieved earlier and we would have gone in from a stronger position.<\/p> <p>  There can be little doubt the management of the crisis has been very effective from an economic point of view.  The economy took an extraordinary hit in terms of the level of activity falling, everyone having to stay at home and most places being shut.  It was quite incredible.  The government supports mobilised in Ireland and other places have helped the economy through that period in an effective way.  It is exactly the kind of countercyclical policy governments should run when the economy gets into trouble.  The Government also did a good job with the contingencies it put in place, both for Brexit and Covid.  Those also helped from a budgetary planning perspective so that even as some supports had to be extended, it was not moving the headline numbers, because the Government had made allowances.  That is a good strategy and one the council recommended.  It was good that is was pursued.  We are now in a different environment and people must understand that in a crisis it is possible, for a short time, to run generous supports for the economy and large deficits but that cannot carry on into normal times.<\/p> <p>  As we come back to normal times we must think beyond that and that is why we have the concerns in the report.

When we are talking about financial prudence, planning, strategies and where exactly we are going, one of the biggest issues I can see for business, budgets and everything is surety of energy supplies for our country.  If we do not have power, everything grinds to a halt.  There is an enormous cost being placed on people at the moment because of the ever-increasing cost of energy.  This is having a real distorting effect on our economy.  Every economic commentator will tell us the way things have changed so much in the past 18 months with the costs of our basic energy needs.  It is frightening and we might ask where it is going to stop.  The next thing then is surety of supply and whether we are going to have uninterrupted power for the next three or four months.  Even if we get over this winter, will we have an assured energy supply next winter?  We must look at the Government's decisions to date and think about what we are doing here.<\/p> <p>  Over the past number of days we have had the news breaking that 200 lorryloads of peat have been imported from Latvia because we have shut down Bord na M&oacute;na.  It might seem like a small issue but it is a really big issue.  The importation of peat briquettes from Germany goes on unabated as we have closed our peat briquette-making factory.  Returning to the matter of surety of supply, the Government is now faced with a scenario where the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is finally conceding we will need to hire generators that use gas.  This is going to cost an awful lot of money.  It is going to be very bad for our environment.  We must look at what the Government decided to do.  To make us look good, it shut down our power plants.  The result of that is we are bringing in generators to ensure the lights do not go out and that everybody who is so concerned about everything in the environment will have some way to charge their phones and boil the kettle.<\/p><p>The general transition probably will not work, ultimately, and we will just have to buy the power from France and England, which produce it with nuclear power stations.  We know what is happening in China, which is building hundreds of coal-burning power stations.  This type of policy will not do our economic credibility any good, including among people wanting to come here, like we have heard, including the Intels of the world, and their take on what our Government has done.  The reality of decisions taken over the last 12 months is starting to bite us.  From an economic perspective and a good economist's point of view, how are we looking to the world and to the rest of Europe because of what is happening to us?  If the lights go out in Ireland, that will be one of the worst financial damnations that could happen to us because it would show us up as having made really poor political decisions and having left ourselves extremely vulnerable to every type of financial market.  What will be the result for our industry if we cannot be sure that we can pump petrol and that we can keep computers turned on?  If we have a debate here today on anything to do with budgets or finances without discussing the result of what this Government of the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael has done, we will be ignoring the elephant in the room.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#H01000","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy that there is a complex situation with energy supply nationally.  It is driven by a number of things.  One relates to the impact of climate change and the policies that have been put in place for that transition.  That is why the climate action plan is extremely important.  The stakes are high, both with regard to safeguarding the climate and also the potential economic impacts.  The costs of doing the wrong things will make that situation worse.  That is why the climate action plan is important both from an economic and fiscal perspective.  None of us on the council is an expert on these issues.  Perhaps Dr. Bergin is - I do not know.  This is not really our area of expertise but it is something we follow closely because it is important.  There are some big risks associated with it and some big costs on the baseline.  These are important issues and things that we will look at increasingly carefully.<\/p> <p>  To the council's credit, two years ago, our annual conference was on fiscal policy and climate.  When we first set it up, it looked like we were maybe ahead of the curve and maybe not many people were thinking about the question.  We learned a lot from that and it underlined how important these issues are.  It has prepared us to look at them.  One of the problems is that other problems are being dealt with at the same time.  At the same time as climate change, there is also population ageing and other issues.  Many things affect public finances, which is why good planning is so critical.  If you try to fix one problem without thinking about how it interacts with other things, which the Deputy gave examples of, we could end up making some bad decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Has Deputy Healy-Rae any further questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#J00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":314,"content":"<p>No, but I think it is a sobering thought and it shows that the Government really did not think this through.

It is a bad start for our aims and ambitions with regard to climate action if one of the first things to happen is that we cannot guarantee energy supplies in this country.  The credibility of everything will be thrown into doubt and we will have to look seriously at what we propose to do in the future.  I do not think that the people will go along with giving the Government a blank cheque of support if they see that a result of this will be chaos in the markets and in their work and home lives if they cannot be guaranteed an energy supply.  One can look at simple things that have happened such as peat being imported from Latvia after people in Bord na M&oacute;na have had their jobs and way of life shut down.  Bord na M&oacute;na played an integral role in Irish society.  The result is now that the jobs are in Latvia, the briquettes are made in Germany, they are sent to us here and everything is fine.

I feel this would drive the economy and activity, reduce carbon emissions, put money back in people's pockets and increase their disposable income.

I have looked at the different ways that climate policies can be designed.  For example, if there is a tax on carbon, how you spend that revenue has different impacts.  Where is that going to be put in the spending programme?  Is it being used as a new revenue source or to pay off debt?  Is it being channelled into energy efficiency research and energy efficient technology which would help to speed up the transition process?  Will it be channelled into social protection to offset the costs that might be borne by some of the more vulnerable households in society?  There are many policy trade-offs.  It is not necessarily the council's role to identify the appropriate policy mix.

First, I wish to ask a couple of questions specifically around a thorny issue that we come up against in the committee all of the time, that is, what is good medium-term budgetary planning and what does that look like, and in regard to access to data and planning for demographic change.  Does IFAC consider access in this country to demographic data and disaggregated data in terms of health and the make-up of our communities is on par with other countries?  Is it an adequate methodology for IFAC to engage in meaningful medium to long-term fiscal planning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#K00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I will make two points.  On the point of medium-term planning in general, one of the extremely encouraging things about the SES was the move to the existing level of service basis for current expenditure.  As we have discussed in the past, in previous budgetary exercises, Government spending plans were not sufficient to even provide the current level of spending, taking into account inflation and demographics.  We said that was incredible and we were very critical of it.  That has been largely addressed through the existing level of service.  This is very close to what the council calls a standstill.  That is important because it gives one an idea of what the public finances will look like over the next few years, instead of some arbitrary set of numbers.  It could also be very important for medium-term planning because that could then feed into the expenditure ceiling.  Since 2013, there have been expenditure ceilings in Ireland.  These are multi-year ceilings at departmental level for spending.  The problem is that every year they are revised.  That happens because the overall level of spending in the forecast was too low and, consequently, that trickled down to the expenditure ceilings, which were too low, and so they were revised up as we moved towards reality.  This is potentially very useful because with the right top-down expenditure, forecasts like that translate into the ceilings and those can now be kept fixed.  There is no reason they should change.  That is good in terms of understanding what is happening to the public finances, but it also might be helpful to people in terms of the thinking about how to make the best of that money rather than them always being in a process of just thinking about how they can get their budget up in the following year.  There are encouraging signs in relation to medium-term budgetary planning, but the proof of that pudding will be in the eating.<\/p> <p>  On access to data, this is an issue on which I can only comment in the context of the council.  The OECD review of the council from February recommended that the council should have a statutory right to information.  As of today, the council has no right to information.  We rely on the goodwill of the Government.  The Department of Finance provides us with the information that we need.  We have a good relationship with that Department, but it does not always have all of the information we ask for - some of it may not even exist - and sometimes getting it takes time.  It is not a perfect process but it works.  We find that much more difficult in relation to other areas of government.  For example, in regard to health, it is very difficult for us to understand what is happening there.  We know there have been massive overruns in the pre-Covid period but we cannot understand that because we do not have access to that information.  There are some issues on the Revenue side and in all areas of government.  As the investment programme ramps up, that may also become more of an issue.  The OECD recommended that the council should have a statutory right to information.  That would change the nature of the dialogue we have with the Government, with a presumption that if we make reasonable requests for information we would be provided with it in a timely way.  We do think that is important.  I can only speak for the council.  It may be a wider issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes for that interesting response.  When it comes to health, it is possible some of that data is not collated and as such it does not exist.  This is going to be an issue going forward.  I am interested in Mr. Barnes's first point around meeting the core spending.  I noted in last year's budget, for the first time, that the mental health allocation was divided into spend for current services and spend for implementation of new programmes.  It was incredibly useful for the mental health sector to be able to see how that would play out.  In the application of new programmes such as Sl&aacute;intecare it would seem very important to disaggregate current spending and new programmes spend.  I hope to see more of that in the coming budget.<\/p> <p>  I commend IFAC on its report.  It is a fascinating read.  Towards the end of it, there is reference to higher investment, addressing priorities and how that might be costly.  In terms of economic oversight and fiscal planning, I take the point around capital investment and public spend on particular investment programmes or infrastructure.  I am mindful of the NDP, hopefully, being published soon.  From a climate perspective, is that a challenge for the witnesses, or is it something that you are mindful of, when it comes to forecasting requirements in terms of the economic outcomes of particular capital investments?  There may also be a requirement for economic forecasting on the lack of investment or the failure to do something.  I am thinking specifically of not just the physical impacts of climate change, for example, where we are seeing water infrastructure that is beginning to fall apart and has a knock-on cost to our health system or, perhaps, inward investment which may see our infrastructure as not fit for purpose, but also global policy changes and the expectation that Ireland would meet them.  IFAC has included the cost of investment in its report.  How difficult is it for it to include in these types of reports the cost of not investing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#K00500","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Those are excellent points.  The point made by the Chairman with regard to a distinction between new spend and what is needed for the current spending is really important.  It is important for the public to understand that, otherwise it can appear that the Government has allocated billions of euro in extra funding to a particular area and lead the public to wonder why a particular public service is not getting any better.  If that is essentially just the money that is needed to pay the wages as they go up for the same people or to reflect higher demographics, people need to understand that distinction between the ongoing costs and new spend.  That is an important distinction.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman makes a very good point in terms of climate and some of the housing issues.  On the one hand, we need to understand how it meets the Government's objectives, but that is not very clearly spelled out.  We are not really in a position to assess that but we would like to know Government thinking on that so that we can understand the risks around it.  On the other hand, we need to see a joined up approach to thinking on these subjects.  For example, in the housing area, one of the things that the Government spends a lot of money on is housing supports.  As rents go up in the private sector, that means more people need that help and it becomes more costly to provide.  There is a great deal of feedback going on the public finances and housing costs, housing generally and, as mentioned by the Chairman, climate and health and many other factors.  These are very good parts of economic planning, some of which would help us to understand the fiscal implications and many of which will help to understand the policies more generally.<\/p><p>Professor McMahon might want to come in on this too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I was going to make a similar point to the one just made by Mr. Barnes.  The Chair's question is a very good one.  It is complex and I do not want to sound like a broken record, but this is where the detail matters a lot.  An example that Mr. Barnes alluded to is social housing spending versus having the houses and the links with health.  It is difficult without the detail to be able to say anything.  For example, some investment plans have large ongoing maintenance associated with them whereas others do not, so it is not just about thinking about the benefits of not investing; it is also the fiscal costs of investing and not investing.  The point is well made but, without detail, it is almost impossible to even guess at what the interaction between these complex things are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McMahon.

I come from the small rural town of Drumshanbo in County Leitrim, a Border county.  I believe passionately in rural communities, community development and social inclusion.  I have seen first-hand the impact of the work of Pobal.  My lived experience is that diversity, equality, justice and inclusion make for a stronger society.  I know that these values give chance and opportunity to those who would not otherwise enjoy it.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of my educational background, I hold a bachelor of arts degree, a higher diploma, a master of arts degree in public policy and a master of science degree in organisational development.  I have studied equality and human rights and recently became a chartered director with the Institute of Directors, studying in detail governance, leadership, finance and strategy.  I have served on boards at local, national and international level and am currently serving as treasurer on the board of the International Coaching Federation.  I hope that these skills will help me make a better contributor as chairperson of Pobal. <\/p> <p>  Passionate about community development and the rural economy, I was a member of the Offaly county development board and have served as a volunteer with the National Adult Literacy Agency.  Key interest areas of mine are the role of women in society, the role of carers and gender equality.  Professionally, I have held key leadership roles in the public sector, most recently as national HR director in the Health Service Executive, HSE.  I am a chartered member of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and a qualified mediator.  I believe passionately in supporting individuals and teams and in developing supportive coaching cultures. <\/p> <p>  As chairperson of Pobal a key role for my board colleagues and I will be to support, challenge and lead our excellent and committed staff to deliver on Government policy, on our programmes and to remember one fundamental thing, namely, that Pobal is not an end in itself.  It is not the object of the exercise but a means to an end, and that end is a stronger society.  It is communities across the country where people, especially the most vulnerable, are better supported.  My time as a Pobal board member and my appointment as chairperson coincide with the conclusion of our current strategic plan which covers the period 2018 to 2021.  My colleagues and I, together with the executive team are deeply engaged with writing and agreeing a new strategic plan, a process that is now in its concluding stages.  <\/p> <p>  The work of positioning Pobal to deliver on Government policy in ways that helps communities most is critically important.  There are lots of metrics by which we can measure outputs but we must remember the fundamental fact that we exist to help people.  The scale of that help and its importance in people&rsquo;s lives is immense.  In 2020, 26,178 individuals and 2,687 local community groups were supported through the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, while 16,939 new participants were approved as part of the seniors alert scheme, SAS.  A total of 1,891 young people with disabilities have been supported through the Ability programme, through 27 organisations nationally, since the programme commenced.  Some 582 community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises received Covid-19 stability fund support, enabling them to continue to provide critical supports and services while 9,123 individuals were supported on T&uacute;s and 3,385 participants were supported on the rural social scheme, RSS.  Subsidies were administered to 46,606 children from 36,236 households under the national childcare scheme while 105,975 children were supported under the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme during the 2019-2020 programme year.  This is a sample of the scale of what Pobal is delivering and demonstrates that its reach into people lives is large.  <\/p> <p>  Every programme is about people and every life situation is unique.  We are there to be a helping hand and a real support.  If the programmes we support are effective then people&rsquo;s lives are enhanced.  That is the context in which my board colleagues and I are working on our strategic plan for 2022 to 2026.  The framework for our new plan will revolve around our vision, our mission and our values.  It is about delivering continuous improvement and about agility in that delivery.  Pobal is now in the process of drafting the content for the new strategic plan across a set of four pillars underpinning our strategic ambition.  Those pillars are people, systems and processes, customers and partners, and governance.  As we conclude the development of our strategic plan for the next five years, Pobal has been engaged in the periodic critical review process.  This periodic deep dive into public organisations is a very welcome opportunity for Pobal to reflect and to take account.  As a relatively new board member, about to become chairperson, I have learnt a lot and taken considerable assurance from the rigor of this process.  A key strategic priority for me as chairperson will be ensuring that the recommendations of the periodic critical review are implemented and that Pobal continues to provide a highly effective service for managing Government grants and payments to communities.  This must be underpinned by high standards in accountability, financial management, and in the support we provide to all those we work with.  Work to date on the periodic critical review evidences that Pobal engages and consults with supported organisations on an ongoing basis to ensure the effective implementation of the programmes they manage.  The ongoing periodic critical review process and our new five-year strategic plan will be the impetus for the standards and the vision that the board and I, as chairperson, want for Pobal. <\/p> <p>  Pobal matters because every day, in towns and villages across Ireland, Pobal staff are on the ground working with communities.  They are delivering services locally to combat social exclusion and enhance lives.  Pobal makes a difference to people&rsquo;s lives and communities every day and it is a positive difference I am convinced can be increased and built upon.  As Chairperson I will define, clarify and agree expectations.  I will invest in open, regular communication and respect the experience and input of stakeholders.  In partnership with the CEO, I will lead a values-based organisation, support and challenge as required, be responsive and ensure the delivery of a value-for-money service for Government which makes a difference for people and communities.<\/p><p>I will lead a board that is focused both on the highest governance standards and on excellent performance.<\/p><p> As chair designate, I want to acknowledge the excellent leadership and commitment to Pobal of every member of the board and, in particular, our outgoing chairman, Professor Deiric &Oacute; Broin.  Deiric has contributed enormously and I express my sincere thanks to him.  I want also to commend the work and dedication of the CEO, Ms Anna Shakespeare and all the staff of Pobal working alongside local and national community organisations to build stronger communities, to support families, to assist individuals and to nurture children every day.  I am deeply honoured to have been nominated by the Minister for Justice, Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands, Deputy Humphreys, as chair designate for Pobal.  I am conscious of the responsibility I have undertaken and I come here today to present my credentials and to pledge my utter commitment to the role.<\/p><p> As with other boards, I hope to demonstrate strategic leadership and to offer an approach that is collaborative and effective.  I very much see the relationship between the board of Pobal and that of this Oireachtas committee as a two-way process.  I would be very pleased to provide regular briefings that are appropriate and useful to the members.  I thank the committee for inviting me today and I look forward to engaging with members in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021092200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosarii Mannion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mannion.  We will now take questions from committee members.  One thing that many Members of the Oireachtas find frustrating is the fact that when agencies such as Pobal, right across the board, are established at arm&rsquo;s length from the various Ministers, accountability to the Oireachtas is only through the parliamentary committee.  The work programme of the parliamentary committee, dealing as our committee does with a broad spectrum of issues, does not lead to a situation where agencies are before the committee on a regular basis.  If some mechanism could be found so there is a clear avenue and route for Members of the Oireachtas to raise specific issues with Pobal and get responses, that would be very useful.  I and many other Members of the Oireachtas have done so in the past and have received detailed replies from Pobal regarding various issues, but having a formalised structure would be of benefit in providing a level of accountability.

I have been involved in many community development projects over a good number of years.  There is sometimes a sense that while the funding community projects are looking for is not a significant amount of money, the process they have to go through to go apply for that funding is not worth the time, energy and commitment they have to put in to complete the documentation and to go through all of that process.  Is there anything we can do, when it is a relatively small amount of money, to support such projects?  They sometimes just do not bother because it is too difficult for them.  They may be very small projects with maybe a manager and two or three staff.  They are managing the project and trying to grow, develop and build, and the Pobal funding would be a very small amount of their overall mainstream funding.  Could I have feedback on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021092200002#C00300","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

My commitment, working with the executive team, is that we are going to reduce those levels of bureaucracy, where we can, while at the same time holding that fine balance so we do not minimise or interrupt any standards of governance or accountability whereby we will be held to account.  There is a fine balance there.  We can do more and we will do more.  At no point should it be prohibitive for a local voluntary organisation working on the ground with communities to enhance social inclusion, community development and all the things I have spoken about in my opening statement.  At no point should our processes or systems be prohibitive to people in terms of engaging with funding.  It will be a key priority, perhaps the key priority, in the new strategic plan, and one that we will show form on and improve on.

One of the things we are all finding across the country is the challenges with funding models as a direct result of the pandemic.  I know Pobal has to make sure that the projects it is supporting are sustainable in the long term.  We are in a very unique circumstance at the moment and it is important that we would ensure there is a certain amount of flexibility during the current climate.  The opportunities to fundraise for community organisations are not there at the moment.  There are issues in regard to the sustainability of some organisations in the short term.  It is important that when assessments are done, they are not purely being done based on the here and now, which, as I said, is very unique, but that we look at the broader sustainability of these initiatives going forward.<\/p> <p>  One other point that I would like Ms Mannion to take away is in a broader area, and it is in regard to the level of female participation on public boards.  Ms Mannion is sadly in a relatively unique position in that she has been a member of a public board, not just in Pobal but also the county development board in Offaly.  That will give her a unique perspective in terms of the challenges across the midlands counties in particular.  We need to do more to encourage women to apply for State boards.  Ms Mannion is in an even more unique club in being a chair of a public board as there is only a small handful of women in that particular role.  As I  said as Minister and as a member of this committee, it would be great to be in a situation where the Minister of the day is forced to appoint a man to a State board in order to meet the 40% threshold.  That is what we should strive to achieve right across the board in order to have a mix of gender.  We also need a mix of background.  If we look at many State boards across the country, many of them are dominated by people from Dublin or the hinterland of Dublin, and people have a very different mindset than we see in the rest of the country.  It is important to get that regional balance.  I hope Ms Mannion can engage with colleagues and use her role to encourage more women and more people from regional locations, with regional perspectives, to apply for appointment to State boards and to act as chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021092200002#C00700","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I will start with the second point first.  Female participation and gender equality is an area that I am absolutely passionate about.  I am delighted to report that the board of Pobal has 60% female proportional representation at the moment.  I would obviously like to see greater participation across the board.<\/p><p>It is an area that has improved across State boards.  We have much more progress to make, but it certainly has been improved.  Excellent work has been done by Balance for Better Business, the Public Appointments Service and the Institute of Directors in Ireland.

I thank the Chair for his comments.<\/p><p> On the point about Covid-19, there is no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions have had a disproportionate effect on the most vulnerable and marginalised individuals.  Pre-existing social and economic inequalities are increasing as a result of the pandemic.  We are acutely aware of that in Pobal and we are not passive bystanders.

I am joined by D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Finnegan, CEO of F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann.  I am delighted and honoured to be appointed by the committee as chair of the board of Screen Ireland.  I would like to thank the committee for all the work it does, particularly during the ongoing Covid challenge.<\/p> <p>  I served two terms on the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  This experience has provided a strong grounding in oversight from a board perspective and an insight into the importance and value of a strong and cohesive board overseeing and supporting effective implementation of a robust agency strategy.  My time on the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland also gave me an insight into the value of film tourism, both in showcasing Ireland to the world and in terms of inward investment from large film studios.<\/p> <p>  I have extensive experience in business management from a variety of organisations and post-qualification experience as a chartered accountant with PwC.  I am also a chartered tax adviser and have a recent qualification in risk management, compliance and governance.  I believe the combination of my executive and non-executive experience, along with my professional qualifications, will inform my role as chair of Screen Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Screen Ireland is committed to building creative excellence in screen storytelling.  My first objective is to ensure that the industry recovers and continues on the steady trajectory of growth that it was on before Covid-19 to become a strong sustainable sector of the economy, supporting Irish companies to create high quality employment.<\/p> <p>  Screen content production is one of the fastest growing industries in the world.  Ireland needs to capture its share of inward international production, and, in parallel, accelerate the growth and financial stability of Irish production companies through continued Screen Ireland funding and the section 481 tax incentive.<\/p> <p>  My second objective is to continue to grow the training and skills development remit of Screen Ireland, which drives creative excellence and long-term sustainability.  My third objective is to create a wider understanding of the value of the industry as an important contributor to the economic and cultural well-being of the country.  My fourth objective is to increase the focus on the environmental impact of film production.  Progress in this area is essential.  It may be costly and time consuming but it is also a business and social imperative.<\/p> <p>  This vibrant, valuable industry needs to be more accessible to people from different backgrounds and regions in order that the full breadth of contemporary Ireland benefits and is represented.  Screen Ireland will shortly be publishing its three-year strategic plan that will include the objectives I have outlined today.  I am very much looking forward to contributing to an industry that creates such cultural and economic value.  We are pleased to answer any questions the committee might have today.s<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Bergin"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bergin very much.

Ms Bergin said that the priorities for the board during her tenure as chair are capturing the share of the inward international production market, as well as training and skills.  I am glad to hear that.  The content creation industry is a trillion-dollar industry.  In the UK it accounts for 7% to 8% of GDP and over Covid, one thing we have seen is a rapid growth in the demand for content in various forms.  I read recently that the average American consumer subscribes to four different streaming services.  I do not think that is quite the case here yet but we are moving in that direction.  I ask Ms Bergin to paint a picture of the course of her term, looking to 2025 and beyond.  Between construction and planning, we are going to have between 1 million sq. ft and 1.5 million sq. ft of studio space based here in Ireland over the next few years so there will be huge potential there.  I want Ms Bergin to be ambitious.  In 2025, what is the potential for Ireland in terms of what we can capture among the international content creation space, film, television, animation and other areas?  On the skills side, where are those skilled staff going to come from?  Who is going to drive that ambition?  Will it come through Screen Ireland, or what agencies will be specifically responsible for that?  What does Screen Ireland expect the Government to do?  How can we assist in order to achieve that?

We have a number of initiatives in place to develop talent across the country.

In terms of the inward production, studio space is growing in Ireland, as the Senator said.  Before now, the infrastructure has been insufficient and that was outlined in 2017 in the Olsberg report.  If all these studio spaces come online, it will open up an incredible possibility for a pipeline of big international productions to come to Ireland.  We had a very successful trade mission to Los Angeles before the pandemic with the T&aacute;naiste.  We met with all the major studios and streamers and the feedback was really clear that Ireland is a very attractive place to film and that we have a very competitive tax incentive.  There is always feedback on things we could streamline and we can look at some of our nearest competitors in terms of jurisdictions for things we could do.  The biggest challenge for Screen Ireland is twofold.  It is about maintaining the balance between international production and, as Ms Bergin said, the local productions generating creatively Irish-led stories, but also the depth of crews that will be required.  Our skills team have been doing a huge amount of work.  We recently launched two academies, a live-action academy and an animation one, to try to help build that depth of crew.  In our strategy we will also be announcing some crew hubs that are being built, which will hopefully cover the whole country with a view to expanding the crew base for when these productions come in.  On one production alone during the summer we had over 1,000 Irish crew.  There are great opportunities there but alongside the studio expansion, we need to ensure we have the right crew levels in place as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I would like to follow up because I was very conscious that Ms Bergin said in her opening statement that one of her key aims was to capture the share of inward international production but in response to my question her focus was on supporting the development of a creative indigenous sector.

I am a member of the executive council of the CTTC and managing director of Bartons Transport in Kildare.  I am joined by my colleagues on the executive council, Mr. James McGinley of John McGinley Coach Travel in Donegal and Mr. Mike Buckley of Kerry Coaches in Killarney.<\/p> <p>  The CTTC is the largest representative body for private bus and coach operators, with some key industry names among our membership.  We are a proactive organisation, focused on engaging collaboratively with stakeholders in the transport area and on delivering results for our members spread across every constituency in Ireland. <\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has brought severe disruption to the sector and to the membership of the CTTC.  International tourism has been brought to an especially abrupt halt, while domestic business for members disappeared during the successive lockdowns introduced from mid-March 2020.  With the country entering a new Covid-19 phase, passenger demand remains greatly dissipated.  This is exacerbated by the imposition of maximum capacity rates and low consumer confidence.<\/p> <p>  When the 2019 tourism season ended, little did coach tourism operators think that they would still be wondering about the viability of the industry in the summer of 2021.  In March 2020, the industry ground to a complete halt with the onset of the pandemic.  In 2019, a record 11.2 million overseas visitors came to Ireland and coach tour operators made a significant contribution to the overall success of our tourism product.  Responsible for directly attracting 2 million international visitors every year, coach tour operators invest substantial sums of money in marketing Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product abroad at no cost to the State or its agencies.  The industry carries coach passengers to every corner of Ireland, giving employment not just to coach tour operators and drivers, but also to the staff of hotels, retail and hospitality outlets, visitor centres and other small enterprises.  In 2018, coach tourism helped to contribute &euro;400 million to the Irish economy and therefore our strategic value to Ireland cannot be underestimated.<\/p> <p>  The Government last provided funding to the coach tourism sector in the July stimulus plan of 2020.  While this funding was hugely appreciated by the industry at the time, many operators had exhausted their resources by the time those moneys were allocated in March 2021.  No further support has been forthcoming in 2021 and this has created a major viability problem for a sector that is responsible, as I said, for bringing two million international tourists to Ireland annually.  For this reason, the CTTC is calling on the Government to urgently provide funding to the sector via a supplementary budget allocation in the upcoming finance Bill.  This is a necessary step to safeguard an industry with tangible and strategic value to the State and it would also ensure that the quality of the coach fleet remains at a standard that markets Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product positively.  Funding should be made available to cover losses incurred in 2021 and it should replicate the &euro;10 million provided under the business continuity scheme for coach tourism.  The implementation of such a measure should mirror the previous scheme.  Such an initiative would greatly help the industry and assist in keeping many operators in business as they await a partial return to normality in the 2022 tourism season. <\/p> <p>  The CTTC also recommends continued funding for 2022 under the business continuity fund for coach tourism to reflect the damage done to the sector.  The peculiarities of our industry mean there is a long lead-in time for international bookings.  With huge uncertainty engulfing us regarding the variants of Covid-19, the continued effectiveness of vaccines and a potential crisis in confidence affecting our consumer markets, it is essential that a support net is provided on a contingency basis in 2022.  This will be crucial to enabling us to be ready to scale up operations when the country&rsquo;s tourism revival begins in earnest.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee again for the invitation.

I thank the Deputy for the question.  Regarding the &euro;10 million, and to provide some historical perspective, we commissioned Mr. Jim Power, one of the leading economists in the country, to draw up a report for us after March 2020.  The impact of the pandemic hit us like a tornado and we needed to quickly see where our losses were accruing.  That economic report examined our fixed costs.  Our difficulty was that no revenue was coming into any of the operators dealing with international tourism or private coach hire because all events were cancelled.  We were facing a situation where no revenue was coming in, while we were still operating and had to insure our vehicles even as they depreciated greatly in value.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Power collected and collated a great deal of information from the sector and arrived at an estimate for our fixed costs of 17%.  Although no revenue was coming in, our costs were still running at 17%.  The final figure was arrived at by taking the overall figure for the revenue garnered by private coach tours and private hire operations in 2019, some &euro;250 million, and then taking 17% of that amount as representing fixed costs.  The total came to &euro;42.5 million.  We assumed at the time, in our innocence, that the pandemic was going to last six to nine months.  Until March 2021, therefore, we predicted that we would have losses of approximately &euro;32 million.  That is the amount that we requested in funding from the Government then.  <\/p> <p>  We were allocated &euro;10 million in the July stimulus of 2020 and we were very grateful for that funding.  To put the situation into perspective, however, that amount would cover the repayment capacity for two or three months of a touring coach.  These coaches in our depots and yards will not have moved for some 24 months by the time there is any smell of a recovery in the market.  In summary then, we were very grateful for the &euro;10 million in funding.  It was a lifeline to support operators and get them into 2021.  The difficulty that arose in the context of the new variants appearing and ongoing lockdowns is that the 2021 season has, effectively, seen business dissipate as well.<\/p><p>There was an opportunity towards the end of the year to generate international business, however, due to travel advisories in the US advising against coming to Ireland, a signal was sent out that the country was closed.  The amount of international business in September-October is minimal and only scratches the surface.  We were grateful for the &euro;10 million funding, but the original request was based on our fixed costs, which were &euro;42.5 million per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":416,"content":"<p>Mr. Buckley stated that for many businesses the Government support only covered overheads for two or three months.

We were grateful for the Government support.  The fact it was introduced helped in the negotiating with banks.  Most of our business are now in forbearance.  Nevertheless, they are accruing interest charges, which means when the loans have to be paid back and the repayments kick in, there will be additional costs.  Much of the money procured under the stimulus in July 2020 will go to defray some of those interest charges.  It really is a bandage on a major bleed or haemorrhage.  It has helped us because the majority of people in this sector have significant debts.  In the coach sector, the capital outlay on coaches is quite high.  For example, in 2019 more than &euro;80 million was spent by our members on new vehicles.

Even when consumer sentiment is high, if people cannot travel here, they will go to a different destination in the world.  There is a huge sense of uncertainty.  Certain outdoor niche markets, such as hiking, walking and golfing, may bounce back quicker.  Due to the nature of the virus, people who traditionally came to Ireland in large groups to travel together may become reticent.  Many of the incoming tour operators are telling us that people are simply not buying from their brochure tours.  As an anecdote, I know of one tour company operating a large coach that is travelling around Ireland at present with two American visitors in it.  There is a driver and a guide on that coach.  The tour company wanted to operate the tour in order to send out the message that Ireland was open for business.  They are the harsh realities of where we are at present.

Given a review of the school transport system is ongoing at present - I do not know if an answer can be given within three minutes - how would the CTTC solve the school transport challenge?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#H00700","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I will take the question on marketing.  We worked closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland during this pandemic.  We had meetings every two weeks and then every month.  We worked closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland as it put its guidelines back in place.  We also discussed, as we come through this pandemic and move into the next phase of recovery for 2022 and 2023, training and the investment needed for the training of new entrants in the market, such as new drivers and staff.  We have lost a number of drivers who have retired or left the industry for other industries.  We have a good working relationship with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  During this period of time, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and many others involved in tourism will have understood the positive contribution coach tour operators make to regional economies.  The sector is responsible for the transportation of visitors to retail and hospitality outlets and visitor attractions, the length and breadth of the country.  They include restaurants, evening function venues, visitor locations, such as Trinity College Dublin and St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and various different places similar to that.  They now know the importance of coach tourism.  This has been a collaborative process over the last 12 months or so, whereby we have tried to get our message across about how important this industry is, with it being responsible for 2 million visitors.<\/p> <p>  On the other elements of private transport, every aspect of private coach operation has been affected by the shutdown.  Operators who had previously operated school transport contracts have had the opportunity to retender for those.  Some of them operated extra 50% capacity vehicles.  In general, school transport not only encompasses going in and out of the school, it also encompasses travel to matches, swimming events and day trips to various locations.  In addition, school tours in 2020 and 2021, for which thousands of coaches had previously travelled the length and breadth of Ireland for, were cancelled.  It has been a massive blow to every aspect of the industry, especially to tourism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Feargal Barton"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I raise the question of the school transport challenge.

In general, the return of school transport has been positive for school operators.  Deputy Munster raised the issue of the loss of jobs.  While we have likely seen 100% job losses in tourism, some of our drivers were diverted into different areas, such as school transport, to try to keep them within our companies while we get through this period, in order to bring them back to tourism next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Feargal Barton"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Barton, Mr. McGinley and Mr. Buckley.

I thank him for the work he does in the area.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barton stated in his presentation that the last time the Government provided funding was in the July stimulus package in 2020.

At the moment, my main concern relates to operators I know from County Louth and the surrounding areas that have invested massive amounts of money in upgrading their fleets.  I am talking about hundreds of thousands of euro.  What happens if the Government does not give funding for 2021?  As far as I can see, the operators need the money.<\/p><p> Another issue of concern is the big shortage of drivers in this country.  I believe the UK and other countries are offering massive amounts of money to drivers to go and work there.  Can the witnesses hang on to their staff that they let go in the past couple of years?  Have any of them moved on?  It is frightening to hear that up to 40% of the fleets could be sold off.

Mr. James McGinley is in the waiting room.  He is trying to get in, but for some reason he is not able to get in.  Perhaps someone could help him.<\/p> <p>  Regarding funding for 2020, it was drawn down in March 2021.  It was done on a very specific basis with regard to the coaches we had in our fleet.  It was very specific on the year of the coaches because it was very much focused on tourism.  It was not for private hire or any other element of the coach transport sector.  Mr. Buckley gave an example regarding the funding for that.  We have been out of business since March 2020, but many of our operators have not operated vehicles in the tourism sector since November 2019.  The winter period is normally our quiet period and our busier period is from March to October.  During the pandemic, the revenue that would have been generated in the 2020 period was just not there, so a lot of operators went to their banks and put a stay on their payments.  When we received the funding, the operators went to the banks to say they received it and they were able to pay perhaps a lump sum off against a certain amount of payments.  As Mr. Buckley mentioned, the grant was per vehicle and probably covered about three months of repayments on one brand new coach, which we were very grateful for, but members can see already there is a huge gap in trying to fund those vehicles because they are parked up and not operating.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about what will happen as we move into 2021.  No doubt there will be casualties because some of the operators are nearly in a holding process and when they get back into operation again, they will have to start paying for their vehicles.  Part of the funding we are looking for will help those operators get to next year.  It is as if we are halfway across the ocean.  The Government has helped us to get to this point, but we need to get the rest of the way across, to get us to the next period when we can start to operate again on our own two feet.  That is the situation on the funding side.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the staffing side, we mentioned that there have been casualties in the business.  We lost a lot of good quality tour drivers.  Some left the business because of their age profile or because they decided it was time to step away after a long career.  Others have gone into other businesses and enterprises and they might feel that is more appropriate for them moving forward.  There is no question but there will be a staff shortage when we come back into operation.  That is already being seen in some areas, such as the school transport division, where there is a shortage of drivers.  Staffing will be an element, but part of the process will be to work with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to try to put training courses in place in order that we can upskill new staff.  If I have not addressed something, Mr. Buckley might address those issues as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Feargal Barton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632265200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>No, I think Mr. Barton has answered the Deputy's question.  The seasonality of the coach tourism business is very important in the overall scheme of things.  When the pandemic hit in March 2020, everybody had had a good, decent season in 2019.  To put figures on it, 11 million visitors came to Ireland in 2019 and 2 million of those were transported by coach tours around the country.  It would be remiss of me not to say that we get into every region in the country.  Coach tours take people to Gweedore in Donegal, the Dingle Peninsula here in Kerry and the wilds of Mayo and Wexford, so it is important to highlight the add-on that coach tourism gives to local economies, in particular in the more peripheral areas of the country, in shops, caf&eacute;s, small hotels and the attractions that are set up along the Wild Atlantic Way and on the south-eastern coastline.  These areas are hugely dependent on coach tourism going there.  What happened in March 2020 was that people had a decent season, their funds were exhausted and they were looking forward to a decent year in 2020 and, all of a sudden, no revenue was forthcoming.  That was the reason the panic buttons were pressed in March 2020 and why we commissioned Jim Power to do an economic report, which gives a very stark picture of where we are at.<\/p> <p>  I concur with what Mr. Barton says about next year.  There is still a huge amount of uncertainty about 2022.  Please God, when we do come back in March and April we will see coach tours operating around the country again.  However, we will have huge difficulties with staff shortages.  We also need support to get us to March 2022 because we do not have a season this year that would allow us to put a pot of money away to meet payments and continue existing in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":429,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Fitzpatrick happy with the responses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#J00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Could I ask one more question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#J00500","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021092200002#J00600","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1632265200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I know the sector got no money in 2021.
