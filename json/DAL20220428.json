The Government is doing everything within its powers to address the issue.  However, it is not possible to insulate people completely from these increases as factors causing them, such as the war in Ukraine, are outside our control.  We believe, however, that the tax reductions introduced strike a balance between passing a significant benefit to consumers while managing the tax base and respecting the constraints of the energy tax and VAT directives at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the Minister's engagement with Commissioner Gentiloni, the Deputy should note that, in his correspondence, the Minister outlined the various actions he had taken to mitigate the cost of energy for households and businesses in budget 2022 as well as the additional &euro;505 million package in February.  He also outlined the further March package of measures providing for a reduction in excise duty on petrol of 20 cent, on diesel of 15 cent, and on marked gas oil of 2 cent.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister acknowledged the importance of the energy tax and VAT directives, in particular the framework they provide for a consistent application of these taxes across all member states.  However, in the context of the significant increases in energy prices, he outlined the limitations of the recent changes to Annex III of the VAT directive, given the reduced rates may only be applied to gas and electricity.  Therefore, other fuels remain outside the scope of the reduced rates.  In this context the Minister asked the Commission to consider allowing member states to respond to the crisis with greater flexibility than is permitted under the directives.  On 23 April, Commissioner Gentiloni wrote to all ministers of finance in regard to energy and energy prices, responding to the points the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and his European counterparts had raised.  The Commissioner highlighted the current flexibility provided by EU directives, including the newly agreed amendment to VAT rates.  The Commissioner indicated the Commission does not envisage any further revisions of the EU taxation framework to respond to the current crisis.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and his officials will continue to engage with the Commission and with other European counterparts to seek the maximum degree of flexibility for member states to respond to the current energy crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800003#A00600","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1651132800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State will know, Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for the Government to engage with the Commission to secure a VAT reduction on household energy bills since November of last year.

We understood the process takes time, but I remind the Minister of State that these requests were met with opposition and derision from Government benches and indeed Government backbenchers.  While I welcome the fact the Government has belatedly adopted our position, I regret it was not until 10 March of this year that the Minister formally wrote to the Commissioner in this respect.  We have not seen the letter, we do not know the specifics of the request he made, and what the Minister of State read into the record in regard to this question, which is about home heating oil, did not mention anything in that regard.

This new arrangement came into effect on 5 April, so the Deputy can see discussions in regard to this were ongoing well before the end of last year.  Under the new arrangement, Annex III of the VAT directive was expanded to include gas and electricity.  This means Ireland can apply the reduced 9% rate to these products in line with other goods and services.  The Government has made the decision to avail of the flexibility from 1 May, which is the start of the next period.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to VAT on the heating oil, this new arrangement on VAT rates also preserved Ireland's historical derogation in regard to fuel and oil, despite it not being included in Annex III.  It is on this basis that Ireland applies the 13.5% reduced VAT rate to supply of fuel and oil for domestic and commercial purposes.

A third of households in the State use home heating oil as the primary source of heating their homes, and that increases to two thirds in the west and north west.

Our historical derogation covered electricity, gas, fuel and oil.  This meant Ireland applied the rate of 13.5% to those products in comparison with other European countries which applied it at a rate of more than 20%.  Had Ireland adopted the reduced rate on the basis of Article 102, it would have automatically removed gas and electricity from the historical derogation, meaning they would have reverted to the standard rate at the end of the temporary period.  The VAT directive now provides for the necessary flexibility for gas and electricity.

Officials in the Department and in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications are evaluating the potential for such a proposal.  The Deputy will appreciate that significant work would have to be undertaken as part of any such evaluation.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to tax generally, the trading profits of companies in Ireland are typically taxed at the standard corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  Some of the main features of the current regime are its simplicity and that it applies to a broad base.  Changing this rate or imposing additional levies on certain sectors could have unforeseen consequences.  There is a risk of such taxes leading to higher consumer costs and negative impacts on investment in the energy sector, in particular in the area of renewables.  These are the factors that must be taken into account in terms of whether it will affect investment.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has taken a number of measures to reduce the burden on consumers in relation to the cost of energy.  This includes providing &euro;200 worth of energy credit to every household in the country, reductions in fuel excise duty, and a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to energy policy, which is the remit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, a well-functioning EU electricity market remains crucial for the integration of the internal energy market at EU level and for providing investment signals for the integration of new renewables, which are essential ultimately to break our dependence on fossil fuels.  The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy.  Cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and generating power from our own renewable sources will ensure a cleaner, cheaper energy future in the long term.  Electricity and gas retail markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, which is independent of the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, is Ireland's flagship policy to deliver on the Government's target of up to 80% renewable electricity by the end of the decade.  Electricity technologies now compete through regular auctions under the RESS, as well as through other routes to market such as corporate power purchase agreements.  The RESS contains strong consumer protection measures, with wholesale market revenues above the auction price returned to electricity consumers through the public service obligation levy.  Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar generation, reduce electricity consumer costs by lowering wholesale electricity prices during periods when they are generating power, highlighting the need to accelerate energy system decarbonisation to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.<\/p>  <p>  The war in Ukraine has dramatically concentrated EU efforts to address European dependence on Russian oil and gas through proposed new measures to diversify fossil fuel imports, enhance security of supply, and accelerate energy system decarbonisation, as set out in the recent REPowerEU communication.  The European Commission is working closely with member states to protect the resilience of Europe's gas security of supply through solidarity measures.  Both the International Energy Agency and the EU have stressed that the current situation further strengthens collective resolve to accelerate the clean energy transition, in line with the European Green Deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800004#B00800","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1651133400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact the Government has finally come around at least to evaluating, to use the Minister's word, a windfall tax on extraordinary profits.

Next week, ESB's Electric Ireland will go ahead with a near 25% increase in electricity and gas prices.

Windfall taxes on energy companies require careful consideration.  A windfall tax could create unintended consequences.

Interventions such as windfall taxes may have the potential to reduce the energy costs for consumers through redistribution of additional tax revenues, but they may also themselves be a driver of costs to consumers in that, if a company's tax rate changes, it will factor that into its return on its investment and it will potentially add to the amount it will want to charge for its product.

It is no harm to revisit the matter here.  It is important to do so on this occasion.  Ireland's taxation on fuel is governed by European Union law as set out in Directive 2003\/96\/ED, commonly known as the energy tax directive, ETD.  The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all member states must comply.  ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in the Finance Act 1999, as amended.  This Act provides for the application of mineral oil tax, MOT, to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel and kerosene, that are used as motor or heating fuels.  MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component.  The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as \"excise\", \"fuel excise\" or \"fuel duty\".  In complying with ETD minimum rates, total MOT rates are taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  Kerosene used for heating purposes attracts a reduced rate of MOT which is comprised entirely of a carbon component.  The ETD minimum rate of taxation on kerosene used for heating purposes is set at zero.  When introducing the ten-year carbon tax trajectory in 2020, the Minister deliberately scheduled rate changes on heating oil to come into effect at the end of the heating season.  Therefore, the next scheduled increase in the carbon component of MOT on non-propellant fuels, such as kerosene, will come into effect on 1 May.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the carbon tax trajectory is a key element of the Government's decarbonising strategy.  The Government remains committed to the important signal that maintaining the carbon tax trajectory sends to society.  I note that due to recycling of carbon tax revenue for investment in energy efficiency measures and targeted welfare payments, the carbon tax has been recognised as a progressive policy supporting climate policies.  Therefore, the Minister does not intend to reduce the carbon component of MOT applied to kerosene.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800006#D01300","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1651134600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>The Minister of State might be aware that he and some of his colleagues are involved in a deliberate campaign of misinformation.  Indeed, it is right out of the Trump playbook.  Fine Gael representatives online, on radio and on television have all claimed no excise duty applies to home heating oil.  I suspect this was done to distract households who use home heating oil, and those who are struggling with the price increases they have seen, from Government inaction.  It is untrue.  Excise duty is applied to home heating oil at a rate of &euro;84.84 for 1,000 l and will rise on Sunday, 1 May, to &euro;103.83 for 1,000 l.  Under the European excise directive, this could be reduced to zero.  The Minister of State has admitted that.  This would reduce the cost of filling a tank by &euro;118 when VAT is included.<\/p>  <p>  Why does the Minister of State believe that we should not reduce the burden on these households when the price has increased by 127% in the past 12 months?

We cannot implement our principles unless we raise the revenue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the increases in consumer prices in recent months, in February the Government approved a package of measures to the value of &euro;505 million, including an energy credit of &euro;200 including VAT, to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of living.  The key drivers of these inflationary pressures are as a result of global energy supplies.

We can do that on Sunday night.  We can change direction.  Instead of the Government putting it up, we can reduce that cost on a temporary basis.  To do that until October would cost us &euro;74 million, which is well affordable.<\/p>  <p>  The second point is that no tax is hypothecated in this State under law.  No tax is ring-fenced for any purpose.

I am keen to continue my engagement with them and to hear their views on all matters regarding the Irish insurance market, while also ensuring that commitments to pass on cost savings arising from the insurance reform agenda in the form of reduced premiums to their customers are honoured.  In this context, I note that motor insurance premiums are approximately 40% lower than they were about six years ago, which must be welcomed.  They have decreased by between 12% and 14% since the Government came to office.  In these meetings, and in my ongoing engagement with industry, I have consistently stressed the importance of insurers reflecting lower claims costs through reduced premiums and the need for insurers to respect the guidelines by not settling for amounts that are inconsistent with them.

The Government recognises the importance of credit unions.  The programme for Government contains four specific commitments for the sector.  These can be condensed into one key commitment, which is to enable the credit union movement to grow.  That means growing credit unions' lending books.  I addressed the Irish League of Credit Unions AGM in Belfast at the weekend which was also addressed by the registrar of credit unions.  It was made clear at that meeting that the loan-to-asset ratio in the credit union movement is about 27%.  That is not a sustainable level, which is why many of them have difficulties because they are not generating enough income.  I have met many representatives of credit unions individually.  Some of them have told me that in years gone by, 60% or 70% of their membership would borrow from them at different times of the year but for many credit unions the percentage of members who borrow from them now is well below 20%.  Therefore, a key issue for the credit unions is not a shortage of savings but a shortage of loan applications.  I really encourage them to lend more.  The retrofit scheme is a perfect fit for the credit union movement because people who go into the scheme will need to borrow.  Credit unions will be able to give loans over a longer period than they could historically.  They will not have to take a charge on a house.  The major banks will not want to finance them as much because they will be giving out big unsecured loans and it will not be worth their while to take out security on a house for a loan that might be for a retrofitting project.  The scheme is perfect for the credit unions because they know their people and will be happy to give out unsecured loans.  That is what I would encourage the credit unions to move into.  They have lost business.  Over the years, people used go to them for car loans but that is all done through garage finance now.  It is a big issue and we are working constructively with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800007#E01600","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1651135200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and acknowledge the work he has been doing on this.  I hope he will manage to finish his work on the area because the targets are very laudable.<\/p>  <p>  The credit unions tell me they see themselves as being punished for taking on members' savings by having to put aside at least 10% of all savings in reserves.  They maintain that this can only be funded by making a surplus and putting it into reserves.  They say that this is money that should be given back to members through dividends and rebates.  They also maintain that no other financial institutions in Ireland, including the banks, have to do this.  They have the most restrictive capital requirements of almost any financial institution globally.  I acknowledge what the Minister of State said about the unprecedented growth in savings in recent years.  That is why most credit unions have to limit the amount of savings that members can save with them.  I tend to agree with the Minister of State that this is not good given the declining number of options to bank in our towns and villages.

There is much work in that and it is important.<\/p>  <p>  The capital requirement is very important.  There is a requirement for 10%.  As I said, I was at the AGM of the credit unions.  The unions themselves voluntarily have reserves at 16% nationally, so they can reduce the reserves they are talking about from 16% to 10% without any impact from the Central Bank.  They are saying the 10% is a problem but very few credit unions are down at the 10%.  Most of them are over 12%.  If one got below 12% the Central Bank would look but there would not be two out of the whole 200 in that category.  All the other credit unions in Ireland have reserves way in excess of what the Central Bank requires them to have and they are doing that themselves.

In many of our towns and villages An Post is finding it difficult to get people to get on its mandate.

I am loathe to suggest collaboration as I do not know that the credit unions would appreciate that but there is a logic in what the Deputy is saying.

We have jumped quite a few questions because people are not here this morning and I want to get my folder in order.  I thank him for raising the issue.  The research and development tax credit allows companies to claim a 25% tax credit in respect of expenditure incurred on qualifying R&amp;D activities.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude our conversation of a few moments ago on the credit unions, if there is anything the Deputy wants to contact me directly on I would be very happy for him to do so.  We can take up any individual issue relating to the credit union movement.  On levies, since we came to office, this Government has reduced the levies by 53%.  It is a phenomenal reduction.  I understand people would prefer to have little or no levies but it is important the credit union movement and credit unions themselves have adequate resources to meet all their requirements.  We saw last week's AGM was mostly consumed with the issue of funding potential deficits in the pension scheme and I think the credit unions are dealing with that.<\/p>  <p>  Returning to the current question, the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, recognises the importance of research, development and innovation as these are recurring themes across a number of the mission aims.  Specifically in relation to small business taxes, there is a commitment to continue to encourage greater take-up of the R&amp;D tax credit by small domestic companies by building on recent changes and examining issues with respect to preapproval procedures and reduced record keeping requirements.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the R&amp;D tax credit is taking place during 2022, alongside an evaluation of the knowledge development box.  As part of this review, my officials published a public consultation relating to the operation of both reliefs.  The consultation documents include questions on the interaction by small and medium enterprises with the R&amp;D tax credit.  The purpose of this public consultation is to consider the current challenges facing firms that are active in the R&amp;D and intellectual property, IP, space as well as the implications of recent domestic and international tax reforms for these two reliefs.  It is a fantastic scheme for the businesses that do it.  Depending on their profits they can get a cash payment back to the company and if their taxation situation does not allow them to get it by way of tax they can get it back directly as a credit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800008#F01500","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1651135800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that response and his reply to my earlier question.

On the expenditure side, a social welfare package worth &euro;558 million was introduced including, among other measures, a general &euro;5 rate increase for working-age and pension-age recipients, and a &euro;5 increase in the fuel allowance.

While it is regrettable that Ulster Bank and KBC Bank have decided to exit the Irish market, the Deputy will understand that the Minister for Finance does not have a role in relation to the commercial decisions of the banks.  The Minister's priority is to ensure each bank withdraws from the market in an orderly manner.  That word - \"orderly\" - is the most important one I will use here in this context.  It must be done in an orderly manner.  Ulster Bank has commenced issuing letters on a phased basis.  KBC Bank is doing so as well.  It is important that this happens in an orderly manner.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a consumer protection role in relation to this matter and I believe it is watching this clearly.  Not long ago, it issued a report on how long it was taking the main banks to answer their phones - people could not get through when they were ringing - and that was a forerunner to what it could see as a problem that can happen.  If one cannot get through on the phone, how does one get to make an appointment to open a bank account?  The fact that the Central Bank issued this report a while ago shows that it is alert to the situation.  It is watching it carefully.  The Central Bank is briefing the Department of Finance on a monthly basis.  I stress that all these regulatory matters are matters for the Central Bank, and the Department of Finance does not have a direct role.  The Central Bank is independent of the Government and the Minister cannot direct the banks which are leaving.<\/p>  <p>  NatWest, which is selling Ulster Bank, is taking a share in Permanent TSB and that group will continue to have a presence in Ireland.  That will be a further reason to ensure everything is done in an orderly manner.<\/p>  <p>  In recent days, Ms Derville Rowland from the Central Bank has written directly to all the major banks and the 20 main direct debit instigators and companies to make sure all of them work together.

There were resolutions last night with respect to Revenue issues.  The debate we have had this morning has covered a number of issues around the cost of living and the impact of inflation.  Everybody accepts that the projections for inflation are much higher now than they were before the war in Ukraine.  This is a matter that can have implications for everybody in Ireland.  The people know that no government can fully insulate a country from the effects of the ongoing war in Ukraine.  However, this Government is putting in as much effort as it can with the significant &euro;2.1 billion in funding that was announced last October and which will run until the summer.  Most of that money has been targeted towards the areas that need it most, which is important.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, all of this is coming at a time when we have emerged, or are still emerging, from the pandemic.  The worst effects of Covid, and the allied restrictions on the economy, have been lifted.  There is pent-up demand.  Many people were waiting to get work done and that has led to a surge in prices because everybody knows it is difficult to get tradespeople to do work in the construction industry and in many other sectors of the Irish economy.  That in itself is a good point.  There are now 2.5 million people in the workforce, which is the highest number ever in the workforce in Ireland.  That figure is even higher than it was before the onset of the pandemic.  People are getting back to work.  More people are working now than were working before the pandemic.

I put it to the Minister of State that the Government is washing its hands of the poorest in society and those who have the lowest incomes, particularly those who are dependent on a fixed income.  Social welfare recipients saw an increase of approximately 2% in the most recent budget.  Inflation is going to run at over 6% for the year and will be higher than that over the coming summer months.  The Government is telling those families it is okay that they are going to be poor.  Those families are going to be poor this year.  The likes of the people in this House who are well paid, and Ministers who are very well paid, will suffer from inflation as well but they have the resources to deal with it.  People who depend on social welfare, disability payments and fixed incomes do not have the ability to deal with the high cost of living and the fact that the Government has not brought forward a social welfare package is disgraceful.

That is a high figure and the people who benefited are the most vulnerable in the country.  It is a fuel allowance.  Since its inception, it was never meant to cover the entire cost of fuel.  It is an allowance towards the cost of fuel.  It was never intended to cover 100% of the cost of fuel.

The Government has not responded by increasing core social welfare payments.  That means the decision that has been made by the Government, with which it is satisfied for the next number of months, is that these families will become poor.  Many of those families were already in poverty or at risk of poverty in the first place.  Many are in homes that are poorly insulated and, therefore, have higher energy costs than many other homes.  The Government is turning its face against an increase in social welfare payments.  Let me be clear when I say I do not care if a social welfare Bill is required or a measure is introduced.  What I want is the political will to do it.  The legislative process is not blocking the Government making a change.

The section 481 tax relief provides a 32% payable credit for eligible expenditure on film production in Ireland.  The expenditure has to be incurred in Ireland, meaning the benefit of the jobs and employment is here in Ireland.  Historically, there was a situation where some of the expenditure did not have to be incurred in the State so the benefit was not accruing to people in employment in the State but that is no longer the case.  The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of the Irish culture.  It is the expectation that the provision of such opportunities will be compliant with all applicable employment obligations, including legislative obligations and policies and procedures to ensure dignity at work.<\/p>  <p>  To grow the industry in Ireland, we want quality and sustained employment and training opportunities in the sector.  This is reflected in the undertaking of quality employment, which is required to be signed as part of the application process for section 481.  I stress that the quality of employment undertaking must be given.  There has been good progress over the last two years in negotiations between employer and worker representatives in the sector.  For example, from January 2021 a modernised crew agreement was introduced which promotes good practice, regularises evolving work practices and provides for an industry pension scheme operating under the construction workers pension scheme.  That is a very important development because many people may not be employed on a full-time basis and may be moving from employer to employer.  It is very important that that is now there but it has only been in place since the beginning of last year.  A monitoring structure to oversee the operation of the scheme is included, as is a commitment to developing the first work-life balance policy for the film and television industry.  The agreement acts as a framework for the industry, covering all grades except film construction.  I understand discussions are ongoing with a view to reaching an agreement covering film construction workers.

My Department is also responsible for maintaining the national frameworks within which Departments operate to ensure appropriate accounting for and value for money in public expenditure such as the public spending code.  Management and delivery of individual investment projects within the allocations agreed under the NDP and within the national frameworks is a core responsibility of every Accounting Officer and Minister.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the context for the delivery of the projects funded by the NDP allocations, my Department continually monitors construction sector trends, including inflation.  As the Deputy is aware, there have been significant and sustained increases in the prices of a broad range of commonly used materials in the construction sector throughout 2021, in the aftermath of the pandemic and as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  If these developments persist for a prolonged period, they would represent a risk to delivery of the ambitious public investment programme set out in the NDP.  In response to this risk, I introduced a series of measures.  In November 2021, the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, issued procurement guidance to assist public bodies in managing the challenges they face concluding live tenders.  In January this year, the OGP introduced measures applying to new public works contracts, including a reduction in the fixed-price period and a mutual cost recovery within the fixed price period for material price changes in excess of 15%.

The contracts they enter into are often fixed price.

Formal stakeholder engagement commenced last November.  A public consultation exercise, based on a detailed policy approach set out in a public consultation paper, launched in November 2021 and closed in mid-January 2022.  Ten responses were received, including a limited number on behalf of individual citizens, as well as submissions from political parties and bodies such as Transparency International.<\/p> <p> Key elements of context for the review's findings have been prepared, including a detailed survey of Ireland's current provisions and a survey of the arrangements in some comparable jurisdictions.

Very broadly, this involves consolidation of the statutory framework for ethics and giving effect to relevant recommendations of the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals.  In particular, it would see a significant strengthening of the legal obligations on public officials to disclose, as a matter of routine, actual and potential conflicts of interest, including, for the first time, provision for the confidential disclosure of liabilities over a certain threshold, in addition to sources of income and assets.  In this, my ultimate goal is to build a fit-for-purpose, easy-to-understand and user-friendly statutory framework for ethics that contributes to the quality and effectiveness of our public governance and, by so doing, enhances trust and confidence in public officials and our democratic institutions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800012#K01400","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651138800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire.

Ultimately, it is about ensuring we have openness and transparency in public life and the way in which we as elected representatives conduct our business and also how our public officials and non-elected public servants do so.

As such, there are no separate reduced pay scales for civil and public servants.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 to 2020, it was agreed to examine the remaining salary scale issues associated with the addition of the extra points for those recruited to entry grades after January 2011.  The report, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in March 2018, estimated the point in time cost of advancing new entrants to the public service two points along their incremental scales.  The report estimated a cost of just under &euro;200 million in respect of 60,513 new entrants, an average cost of &euro;3,300 per full-time equivalent.<\/p>  <p>  Following this report, negotiations with the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, took place over 2018 resulting in an agreement on new entrant salary scales being reached in September 2018.  Further detail on this will be placed on the record.<\/p>  <p>  For new entrant teachers, the parties to the current agreement, Building Momentum, agreed that in final conclusion to the arrangements put in place in September 2018 as part of the previous agreement, the following measures will be implemented to resolve in full the remaining salary scale issues pertaining to new entrant teachers.  New entrant teachers who have been recruited since 1 January 2011, after progressing to point 11 of the teaching salary scale, will, on their next increment date, move to point 13.  New entrant teachers, recruited since 1 January 2011, who have already reached point 12 or higher on the teaching salary scale, will, on their next increment date after the commencement of the agreement, move one point further than they would under normal incremental progression.  These arrangements are set out in section 4.3 of the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, Building Momentum provides for a sectoral bargaining fund, which is the mechanism available to the parties under the present pay agreement framework to make progress on various sectoral pay matters of importance to them.<\/p>  <p>  The arrangements are complex but I believe the issue has been dealt with.

Measures in respect of the fuel allowance, school transport, the drugs payment scheme, public transport and the working family payment were also prioritised.

The Government is acutely aware, however, of the challenges still facing many households, in particular relating to energy bills and especially for those on lower incomes.  In response to previous questions, I set out a number of measures the Government has brought forward.  In February, there was a package of more than &euro;500 million, which continues to be implemented, including the energy credit of &euro;200 inclusive of VAT.  The Government has also placed an emphasis on trying to reduce the costs individuals and families face, which is why, for example, the reduction in the drugs payment scheme threshold to &euro;80, benefiting more than 70,000 families monthly, is a very important measure.  In addition, there has been a reduction in the school transport fees families face, an important measure that was welcomed by many, and a reduction in public transport fares, benefiting about 800,000 people.  That has been implemented in the Deputy's and my city and county of Cork and I think it is to be implemented in Dublin as well in May.  That measure will certainly help and make a difference.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, much of the focus in respect of the cost of living pressures has been on the area of fuel and we have done our best as a Government to make progress on that issue while having to comply with the constraints we are acting under, such as the energy tax directive, a European directive with which we must comply regarding minimum levels of taxation that must apply to diesel.<\/p> <p>There are also constraints in respect of VAT.  We have made changes in that regard but these must be consistent with EU law and the Government has gone as far as it can at this point with those measures.  We have introduced a range of measures we believe will help, although we are not for a moment suggesting they go all the way or fully offset the costs people are facing.

I will follow up on that.  I am probably straying into the territory of the Department of Social Protection or even the Department of Finance, but is there something we could do in respect of the household benefits package?

As a percentage of national income, annual capital investment is now among the largest in the European Union.  In the current year, almost &euro;12 billion will fund vital infrastructure in areas such as housing, transport, education, enterprise, sport and climate action.  There are at least 50 proposals in the Exchequer-funded element of the NDP that are considered major public capital projects, that is, those with an estimated cost in excess of &euro;100 million.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for the public spending code, which sets the value for money requirements and guidance for evaluating, planning and managing Exchequer-funded capital projects.  The management and delivery of investment projects and public services within allocation and within the national frameworks is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister.  The majority of public investment projects are delivered on budget and on time and there is a high level of professionalism across the sectors.  However, noting the higher risk profile of larger projects, it was recognised that new procedures were required in order to improve project outturns, avoid cost overruns and avoid delays to project delivery.  Responding to this need, my Department put in place an external assurance process to provide independent scrutiny for major public capital projects, which cost in excess of &euro;100 million.  This will involve independent expert reviews at two key stages in the project life cycle under the public spending code, that is, at the approval-in-principle stage and prior to tendering.  The purpose of the new process is to improve value for money and to support funding Departments and the Government with expert insight relating to project risks, delivery feasibility, and robustness of costings, governance and procurement, among other issues.<\/p>  <p>  The major projects advisory group has also been established by my Department.  It will support my Department in assimilating the outputs from the external reviews, and aid Departments and agencies in improving the quality of project proposals.

The draft stability programme update, SPU, 2022, published on 13 April, outlines the latest fiscal and economic projections for 2022.  The SPU outlines core expenditure of &euro;80.1 billion for 2022.  With non-core expenditure of &euro;7.5 billion, including in respect of Covid funding and the Brexit adjustment reserve, this gives an overall Government expenditure ceiling of &euro;87.6 billion.  This compares to overall gross voted expenditure of almost &euro;87.5 billion in 2021, inclusive of capital carried over.  While in year-on-year terms expenditure is broadly flat, there is a significant reduction in Covid expenditure that is offset by an increase in core expenditure.  As outlined in the SPU, there is an increase of &euro;2 billion in capital spending this year compared to last year.<\/p>  <p>  The Government expenditure ceiling set out in the SPU is in line with that set out in the Revised Estimates 2022.  The overall gross expenditure amount in the Revised Estimates was inclusive of an unallocated Covid-19 contingency reserve of &euro;3.9 billion.  At this stage, taking into account the increased supports introduced in response to the December wave of the virus, and additional funding required for the one-off cost-of-living measures introduced in recent months, about &euro;1.5 billion of this reserve is now committed.  In addition, there will be additional Covid-related expenditure that will need to be met from this reserve later in the year, in particular, as we enter the winter period.  This reserve funding will also need to be utilised for the provision of supports to refugees arriving from Ukraine.

That was fine when that money was coming at virtually zero cost but we know that due to high inflation central banks worldwide and the European Central Bank are now talking about putting interest rates up.  It would appear that particular period is coming to an end, which means that we all have to be a little more careful about balancing the books.<\/p>  <p>  I will separate capital expenditure from current expenditure because, as far as I am concerned, the former is investment while the latter is gone in the year it happens.

If we look at the current spend, taking all the contingencies we now know about into account, such as Covid, as the Minister outlined in detail, and the Ukrainian crisis, how near to projection will the current spend come in at the end of the year based on what we know at present? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800020#S00700","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1651143000,"counter":280,"content":"<p>In the current year, we provided for a reserve of almost &euro;4 billion, &euro;1.5 billion of which has now been spent or accounted for.

We have said that the cost of looking after Ukrainian refugees who come here will also be met from that reserve.  We have an overall Government expenditure ceiling of &euro;87.6 billion.  It is my expectation that expenditure in overall terms will be managed within that ceiling, which was agreed on budget day and brought forward in the Revised Estimates volume in December of last year.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to point to elevated debt levels.  Our debt now stands at approximately &euro;236 billion.  We spent &euro;30 billion in direct expenditure measures across 2020 and 2021 related to Covid and made an overall provision in the current year of approximately &euro;7 billion.  We are seeing Covid spending fall but core spending is increasing.  As the Deputy knows, we now have a medium-term fiscal framework that anchors growth in core expenditure to the underlying trend growth rate in the economy, which is about 5%.  That is built into our framework.  Although there are always pressures, I am determined to ensure that we manage our public expenditure in a sustainable and responsible way.

It is putting real pressure on workers and families throughout this State.  Last night, the Government rejected a Sinn F&eacute;in motion that would have given real relief to households.  It would have reduced the cost of home heating oil and prevented the Government from increasing it by imposing additional carbon taxes, as it plans to do on Sunday.  We also sought to prevent the Government&rsquo;s proposed ban on selling turf from 1 September.  Despite the huffing and puffing from Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers and backbenchers, they dutifully rolled in behind the Minister and his party last night to prevent sense prevailing.  I must say there is a notable absence of those huffing and puffing Deputies in the Chamber this morning.  They are happy to go on local radio and give quotes to local newspapers but when push comes to shove they fall into line with the Green Party and its out-of-touch proposals in respect of home heating oil and carbon tax.  It is political cowardice of the highest order.<\/p>  <p>  Turf has been one of the only forms of heating not to see prices spiral in recent months, yet the Government still plans to punish individuals and communities who rely on turf from September.  Instead of introducing measures to support communities in transitioning away from this form of heating in a way that is fair and sustainable, the Minister plans a ban.  Ill thought-out policies like this proposal damage environmental protection because they alienate communities.  We know that the days of fossil fuels are coming to an end.  All of us in this House recognise the need for climate action.  However, the way the Government is doing it is causing deep anger, upset and resentment in communities right across the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister should not naively believe that a ban on turf is a solution because it is not.  Across the State, 4% of households rely on burning turf as the main energy source to heat their homes.  That figure rises to 9% in rural communities and in some counties it is over 30%.  These communities need to be supported instead of facing the punishment the Minister is dishing out when there is no realistic alternative for them to heat their homes and keep their families warm and safe.  Where is the just transition in telling these households who rely on burning turf as the main source of heating their homes that it is to be banned from September of this year?  After weeks of chaos, confusion and contradiction, what is the Minister's position on the turf ban?  Does he now accept that the turf ban idea was daft and needs to be ditched?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800021#T00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1651143600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>My view is we must stop the 1,300 deaths that occur every year.

It would be so easy to walk away and say we will not do that because it is difficult but what number of deaths should we tolerate?  What should we do in ignoring that reality across the country?  I do not believe we should ignore it and we will not do so.  This Government will act and will deliver practical measures that are not there to punish anyone.

This morning, Labour Party Deputies and Senators wrote to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, who is taking overall responsibility for co-ordinating the national response.  We wrote to offer our support in assisting with that national response and effort and to offer constructive engagement in highlighting issues that have arisen in cities, towns and communities around the country.  We have copied that letter to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and also to the Taoiseach.  We did so because we believe that in the face of war and barbarism and this brutal Russian aggression, our best outcomes will come from co-operation, constructive engagement and not from the sort of macho posturing and shouting that sometimes passes for democratic debate in this Chamber and about which the Ceann Comhairle has rightly been critical.<\/p>  <p>  In the spirit of constructive engagement we have welcomed the initiative of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, seeking support from Opposition parties in offering suggestions for vacant housing sites that could be used to house those coming here from Ukraine on a temporary basis.  We have welcomed that call and are compiling a list of sites in conjunction with our network of local councillors around the country.  We will be sending that list to the Minister.  In my and the Minister's constituency of Dublin Bay South we will be proposing Baggot Street hospital, which has been mooted by my colleague, Councillor Dermot Lacey, and others, be utilised and that other vacant institutions such as, for example, the Avalon hostel on Aungier Street, could also be utilised for accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a really strong response in Ireland and the awful war has shown the people's generosity of spirit.  However, issues have arisen that are not trivial and require a co-ordinated response.  In particular, we want to know what format the newly announced Cabinet subcommittee on co-ordinating the Ukraine response will take.  With respect to accommodation, what is the role of International Protection Accommodation Services, IPAS, compared with the role of local councils, in co-ordinating the accommodation of our Ukrainian guests?  We have heard concerns at local level about access to safeguarding measures for women and children in congregated settings and access to primary healthcare, GPs and mental health supports.<\/p>  <p>  I am also hearing from local council officials of the need for a clear funding stream to enable councils to work with local and community voluntary groups to offer supports to Ukrainian guests and those who are hosting them here.  I am thinking of the sort of networking events we have seen so successfully carried out in the Swan leisure centre in Rathmines and in other settings across the country where groups have come together on a voluntary basis to assist and support Ukrainian families and individuals coming here.  We need that clear funding stream.  As such, I would welcome a response from the Minister on that co-ordination of an approach to welcoming and showing support to Ukrainians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800022#U05300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1651144200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I agree with her comments on the need for a co-ordinated response to how we welcome, look after, care for and get back on their feet the people displaced by the war in Ukraine.  I also agree with her on the form of politics that is going to work best to deliver that and very much welcome her willingness to work with the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and Darragh O'Brien, in coming forward with practical solutions because we must be practical and quick here to provide housing, shelter and a whole range of other different supports.<\/p>  <p>  I also agree with the Deputy regarding the example of the Baggot Street hospital.  It is a perfect example of such a facility.  In the Cabinet's discussion on Tuesday it was included as one of the projects we are looking to refurbish and bring back into use.  The Deputy knows Baggot Street hospital.  While there has been some work going on it for the last decade or two, it has been lying idle and empty in the middle of a city-centre village.  I support bringing it back to life, initially for displaced Ukrainian people, but also then getting over this inertia that seems to be in our system that allows buildings to lie derelict and has allowed vacancy to exist during a housing crisis.  In some ways, one of the advantages we can take out of this crisis is that we then develop and open up buildings that have been shut for so long and refurbish them quickly.<\/p>  <p>  The role of IPAS is critical because it has the expertise.  This is a very complex and difficult issue.  We have experience from the Syrian refugees and the Afghan refugees more recently.  Going back over the years, IPAS has the best expertise on how we integrate and bring a welcome.  However, it cannot shoulder the burden on its own.  It cannot be responsible for the long-term assimilation of people.  The whole discussion at Cabinet and the paper the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, brought to us this week, which was agreed, was to ensure the Department with responsibility for housing really steps up now, as well as local authorities.  They have a critical role.  We must designate key individuals within local authorities who work with community groups and other agencies of the State and accommodation providers, so this matter is not just left to IPAS.  The service will not be able to manage the numbers, scale and long-term work that needs to be done.  Its expertise is in managing immediate crises.  It is about a co-ordinated approach between the local authorities, the Department with responsibility for housing and a range of other Government bodies, including the Departments of Social Protection, Health and Education.  Central and critical to that will be a new Cabinet subcommittee being established so we as Ministers can ensure the system is responding.  That door is open for co-operation with Opposition parties of every colour and hue to help make it work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800022#U05400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1651144200,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the response and the constructive engagement.

It is about co-ordinating the response and co-ordinating the national effort.<\/p>  <p>  The point the Minister made about IPAS is welcome.  It is clear local authorities are stepping up in a huge way.  They and council officials are dealing and will deal with a large number of front-line measures to support Ukrainian families and individuals coming here.  However, they need clear funding streams to enable them to do that.  They need flexibility in working with community and voluntary groups that have also stepped up.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to see supports in place for the Red Cross, which has taken on a huge responsibility in assessing the suitability of accommodation and has already reached out to other entities and agencies for support in that.  There is, for example, a way in which current or retired community welfare officers could be engaged to help those seeking to access supports.  Visiting the Ukraine support centre in Cork Street, I saw just how many civil and public servants are already doing that and offering that support.  However, in recent weeks I visited a community hall in my and the Minister's constituency where families were sleeping on mats on the floor.  Clearly, that is not ideal and it was only short-term but there is a real uncertainty about the national co-ordination of what should be a national and collective effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800022#U05500","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1651144800,"counter":381,"content":"<p>There has been and is, and the fact is that we have been able to manage 25,000 is unprecedented.

I have sold commercial green energy solutions.  I was part of a consortium that successfully lobbied in Brussels for changes to alternative fuel feedstock specifications.  I am no climate denier.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has warned us on many occasions about the urgent need to address climate change and I have a warning of sorts for him.  I have outlined in this House to both the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste the lack of funding that is being directed to the south-east region and its population.  As a partner in government, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, bears responsibility for this also.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is almost half-way through his Government term and the pattern is now set.  We have seen the Minister in action.  We have seen what the Minister really cares about.  At this point, it is my view that the Minister has lost the south-east region and that at the next election, the voters of the south-east will turn away from him and, more importantly, from his green agenda.<\/p>  <p>  The Green movement received a mandate from the south-east.  Ten per cent of the country has given the Greens two of its D&aacute;il seats.  That is the same mandate given to Fine Gael.  If the south-east turns on the Minister, it will not be because of climate change denial but because of the Minister's failure to deliver on the mandate entrusted to him.<\/p>  <p>  Job number one of this Government and Deputy Eamon Ryan's Department was the Dunkettle interchange signed off with undue haste.  Deputy Eamon Ryan bent to the Cork cabal with what, in percentage terms, is a project further out of budgetary control than the national children's hospital.  Meanwhile, the M24 Limerick-Cork-Wexford pivotal route infrastructure for the south-east was binned.  An entirely preventable blood price continues to be paid on the N24 and N25 for spending decisions made in this House by the Department, and now by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Waterford Airport is fighting for its life, closed off from regional airport funding of &euro;160 million which is being bunged largely into dysfunctional DAA outfits and disproportionately into Cork Airport in what was the fastest capital project completed in the State.  At the same time, Deputy Eamon Ryan's Department withdrew all support funding previously committed to at Waterford Airport which is now threatening its very existence.  In University Hospital Waterford, the south-east regional trauma and cardiac centre continues to be starved of capital resources and head count and continues to have one of the highest outpatient lists in the country and there is still no relief in sight coming for the most underfunded model 4 hospital in the State.  This is what the voters of the south-east see when they think, \"Want Green, Vote Green\".<\/p>  <p>  We also see the Minister's partners in government strategy of waiting him out on the M20, the Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal, Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and other multiple initiatives.  Failure to deliver for the south-east these things that are commonly being delivered elsewhere will, in my opinion, implode Green politics in the region.  Mark my words, the south-east is not at Cabinet and yet, day by day, we look on appalled by Deputy Eamon Ryan's Government's decision-making and the inequity around it.  My question to the Minister is, in the remaining time of the Government, what will he deliver for this region, a region that has given him his mandate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800023#V00400","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1651144800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>No Deputy in this House needs to explain, burnish or think one is better than the other in terms of green credentials.

We have also been told that a home care package will be in place by the end of the year.  In that context, I ask the Minister about the Government and the Green Party position on the important issues relating to carer's allowance.  Carer's allowance is means-tested.  That means any household with a total gross income, before tax, USC etc., of less than &euro;37,000 is entitled to full carer's allowance.  That is a minimal amount of income.  If the total gross income of a household is between &euro;37,000 and &euro;62,000, there is a sliding scale and a successful application for those earning &euro;62,000 would mean approximately &euro;10 per week in carer's allowance.  Anybody earning &euro;62,000 in gross income pays at least &euro;20,000 in tax and USC.  That shows how low the income disregards are.  A person with a second property or savings of more than &euro;20,000 starts to lose the carer's allowance.  The Government has stated that will increase to &euro;50,000 by June, which is positive and I am not minimising that change.  However, it is still not enough.  It is estimated that 25% of carers get carer's allowance.  I know they are not all giving care full time but the Government needs to review those income disregards and get rid of the means test, which I have heard described as a \"mean test\" over many years.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to remember that to get carer's allowance, the person cared for must be medically assessed to be in need of full-time care.  Crucially, carer's allowance is taxable, which means those who benefit most get the most income from carer's allowance.<\/p>  <p>  However, this issue is not just about money.  The Citizens' Assembly has said that care must be recognised in the Constitution and that Article 41 should be replaced by an article on care.  That would mean the State would be obliged to support carers.  The assembly also suggested the Government should increase the disregards on carer's allowance.<\/p>  <p>  We are all aware of the cost of caring.  Just a week or two ago, I was happy to launch, with Family Carers Ireland and the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, another report on the cost of caring.  The main costs are around energy and transport.  In that context, will the Minister commit to working to ensure carer's allowance is a qualifying payment for the fuel allowance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800024#W01000","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1651145400,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I agree with the points the Deputy has made.  It is important we recognise it when we increase payments because otherwise the political support for further increases will not be there.  As the Deputy said, as part of the most recent budget, the capital disregard for carers increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000.  That was not insignificant.  The improvements in the income disregard went from &euro;332.50 per year to &euro;350.  That is not as much of an improvement as we might want but it is still a significant increase.<\/p>  <p>  I will record what has been done with regard to the carer's support grant in the past year because it is important to record things with which we might want to go further so they are not just ignored and forgotten about.  The grant was increased to &euro;1,850.  The qualified child allowance also increased and there was an underlying increase of &euro;5.  There are a number of ways in which this Government has recognised that what the Deputy has said is true.  We need to support caring and the whole variety of roles that carers play.  This is not just about the economy and getting everyone working.  There is critical value in caring work we need to recognise and support.<\/p>  <p>  I agree about the potential involved.  If I heard the Deputy correctly, what might be called the woman's place in the home referendum will give us an opportunity to redefine the Constitution not only to remove some of its sexist aspects but also to retain what was intended by the original wording, as I understand it, and value caring work.  I agree with the Deputy.  That is an opportunity the Oireachtas needs to grasp to ensure we get the right wording so that we do, in our Constitution, support caring work in the home and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the energy and food price crisis.  There will be increases in the cost of food and other materials as a result of the war in Ukraine.  We have introduced a range of measures.  We are going to have to think about what we do in next year's budget.  It will take time and we need to talk to our social partners and others, and think about how to address this cost-of-living crisis.  My sense is that we should be targeted in what we do because those on the lowest incomes or facing certain circumstances may be caught out most.<\/p>  <p>  I had a meeting yesterday with the team in my Department that is looking at the issues of energy security and our response to the crisis.  Mr. Alan Barrett from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is helping to co-ordinate work we are doing with the modelling from the ESRI, University College Cork and University College Dublin to try, in the period as we approach the budget, to target areas where there is the most need in the context of the cost-of-living increase.  That might provide the opportunity for what I sense the Deputy is looking for, that is, detailed modelling to target those most at risk, which may be those in the role of carer.  That modelling work may help us to target them and design a solution to protect them most in any response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800024#W01100","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1651145400,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I have heard what he has said about targeting.  Whether the Government gets rid of the means test or increases further the income disregards, we will see the outcome when the modelling is done.  The Government needs to take one of those measures because that is what the Citizens' Assembly has asked it to do.  The Citizens' Assembly also made another important point.  Gross income is taken into consideration.  This means family carers, male or female, are relying on their partner's income to support them and to support care in the home.

That is a broad issue that goes back some 20 years.

The SFPA confirms that the master of the vessel and the operator objected to the process for weighing upon landing, as set out in the interim EU control plan.  The master and the operator were offered the use of an industry-owned water separator, which would preserve the quality of the fish during the process.  They opted not to avail of this and, subsequently, the master of the vessel chose to leave the port.  The SFPA has notified the relevant regulatory authority of the EU member state in which this vessel is flagged of this interaction.

We in the Labour Party previously brought forward a Bill to restrict the use of companies like Airbnb for short-term lets.  We are asking the Government to take more urgent action to ensure such short-term lets will not outstrip the supply of long-term lets.  Research and analysis by my colleague Senator Rebecca Moynihan has shown that, at a given time in March in nearly every county in Ireland, there were more properties advertised for short-term rental on Airbnb and other sites than on <i>daft.ie<\/i>for long-term rental.

However, we have to be slightly careful because the measures that were introduced in the Housing for All strategy, which is the best way to address the rental crisis, apply those restrictions or requirements on local authorities in counties where rent pressure zones apply.  We have to be careful because many of the counties that have been mentioned are not in rent pressure zones and therefore I imagine the local authority would say it was not required to do anything.

I acknowledge that.  The Minister did not accept some of the recommendations, however.  First and foremost of these is the recommendation for the names of three nominees to be ranked in order of preference.  Should the Cabinet decide not to go with the recommended ranking, it would have been required to provide a written reason for doing so.  This is really crucial and it is one of the main points I will cover.<\/p>  <p>  The ranking of candidates has been very specifically asked for by senior judges, legal academics, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, GRECO, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Law Society and the Bar Council.  How could we, in good conscience, ignore this when many legal experts and anti-corruption bodies have been seeking this measure for some time?  Allowing the commission to provide the Government with a small number of ranked candidates would only provide greater transparency and limit the degree of real or even perceived political influence exercised in making judicial appointments.  What is the purpose of the Bill if it is not for that?<\/p>  <p>  If the Government is serious about reforming the judicial appointments system, this must be done.  We cannot have a repeat of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, Bill where reforms fell short because there was a reluctance to relinquish political control.  We need a proper merit-based appointments system for judicial appointments.  The Minister cannot, in good faith, say the Bill will achieve that goal without candidates being ranked.<\/p>  <p>  A ranked list would not be unconstitutional and it is disingenuous to suggest all those legal bodies in the country have somehow got this wrong.  The Executive would, of course, retain discretion in the appointment of judges and it can be explicitly indicated that the ranking is not binding but merely advisory.  If the Cabinet chooses to pick a judge who is not ranked first, it would be entirely possible for it to do so.  All the benefits of the independent merit-based assessment would be undermined if three unranked names were to be sent to the Cabinet, as the coalition partners could divvy the names between them.  All the accountability and transparency we are building into the appointments process will fall at the last hurdle if, in essence, we retain the exercising of political choice over judicial appointments.  We are trying to get away from that.  The GRECO evaluation team explicitly criticised the proposal to have an unranked list of nominees sent to the Cabinet and called on the Government to really tackle the matter of Executive influence over the judicial appointments system.<\/p>  <p>  The argument given during pre-legislative scrutiny against the ranking of nominees really does not stand up.  It was argued that excessive constraints on the discretion of the Executive may be unconstitutional but the Executive would not be bound by ranking, which would be purely advisory.  It was argued that some nominees may be of equal merit and that can be catered for by having a joint position.  It is perfectly possible to do that.  It was also argued that ranking would result in possible reputational damage but the entire appointments process protects candidates from such damage.  The selection process is exempt from the freedom of information framework, for example, and the Cabinet is bound by Cabinet confidentiality.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that amendments will be put on Committee Stage seeking the Minister to accept the change so we can get ranked candidates.  I ask sincerely that the Minister would seriously consider the matter.  It is a mistake and its consequences can be foreseen.  This undermines the very objective we are trying to achieve.<\/p>  <p>  Like previous speakers, I also have concerns about the role of the Attorney General in the process and ask if it is appropriate.  The Attorney General would not have a vote in the selection process but it is undeniable the Attorney General would play a central role.  We all know we look to certain people for influence and advice, etc., and there is no doubt the Attorney General would be in such a position.  When the names are sent to the Cabinet, the Attorney General would again have a significant influence on the final pick.  Nobody doubts the qualifications of an Attorney General but it is a political appointment nonetheless and having a representative of the Government at the judicial appointments commission would undermine its supposed independence.  Others have made the point as well and I would like it considered seriously.<\/p>  <p>  It is not standard in other jurisdictions that a position like the Attorney General would have this role.  The Attorney General is also responsible for purchasing many legal services in the State and there are significant risks of conflict of interest that need not arise if a change is made to the Bill here.  If the Government decides the nominees should remain unranked because it wants to make a decision as independently as possible, the Attorney General should not be involved in the judicial appointments process.<\/p> <p>There is also an added complication whereby many Attorney Generals take on a senior role in the Judiciary when they leave office.  With that being a well-established precedent, it is entirely inappropriate for the Attorney General to sit on the judicial appointments commission.  I am looking for that be re-examined.<\/p> <p> There were some blanket comments made that we have all been well served by the Judiciary.  At times we have not been.  Some of the changes will be helpful, for example in terms of training.  Sentencing can be very inconsistent.  We might look at the kinds of resources that have been put into designing and upskilling judges in other jurisdictions.  The UK would be a case in point.  It is not just about legislation.  It is about the resourcing, in order that we do work that builds confidence.  I say this because on occasion people will ask about it.  This is particularly true in cases where there has been a sexual assault.  It is hard enough to get people to go to court.  Sometimes there will not be a custodial sentence for a crime that is on the high end of the offences.  I think that undermines the Judiciary.  The resources will be just as important in building up that capacity.<\/p> <p> The number of judges is another issue.  Again, the legislation does not necessarily deal with it.  While you can have very good legislation, if do you not have the resources to deal with matters appropriately, you will have difficulties.  In the District Court, for example, the priority will obviously be given where there is a criminal case.  As a result, civil cases and planning cases can take years to go through the District Court.  Sometimes they get scaled up to the Circuit Court.  Sometimes you find an injunction at High Court level because the District Court takes too long.  There is a huge waste of time at local authority level, for example, when people go down to the courts to wait for a case so that they can get a date, but it keeps being postponed.  There is a real issue with the capacity to deal with the number of cases at every level.  I ask the Department and the Minister to take that on board.<\/p> <p> The point and provision that has been made for diversity is important.  That goes across gender, socioeconomic status, people&rsquo;s racial background and maybe their experience in other jurisdictions.  It is important that we see it in practice.  It will be important to see how that happens in practice, given the closed environment that is in place in some aspects of the system.  It will be necessary to get to a point where we get the kind of diversity that is needed to have an understanding of people&rsquo;s lives.  We do not want the kind of potential groupthink whereby the Judiciary is drawn from the same socio-economic cohort and background, for example.<\/p> <p> Those are my main points.  There is a lot to be welcomed, as I said when I started speaking on this Bill yesterday, not least that the Bill has come before us in the first instance.  However, changes are required.  The changes in relation to resourcing issues will require much attention if we are see our criminal justice system functioning as well as it can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800029#EE00300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651148700,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I spent much of my time in the previous D&aacute;il debating judicial appointments commission Bills.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle contributed to those debates as well.  I am sure Deputy Martin Kenny, who I see across the Chamber from me, did likewise.<\/p>  <p>  I bring to this debate a certain amount of knowledge of those Bills, which ultimately got caught up in the politics of the last D&aacute;il, unfortunately.  In October 2016, my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and I introduced a judicial appointments commission Bill.  It got the support of the Government on Second Stage.  It then went to Committee Stage, but it did not get through Committee Stage because the Government decided not to provide a money message for it.  However, the Government said it was committed to introducing its own judicial appointments commission Bill, and that was subsequently introduced in May 2017.  The history of that Bill's progress through the Houses of the Oireachtas could be written in about four volumes.  It got through the D&aacute;il fairly rapidly and then it went off to the other House, Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  In fairness to the then Minister, Deputy Flanagan, I think he spent 30 or 40 days there debating amendments to the Bill, which ultimately was not enacted.  In fairness to the Houses of the Oireachtas, I think that we were right in the last D&aacute;il and Seanad not to enact that legislation because it was not good legislation.  Unfortunately, it got wrapped up in the politics of the last D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be clear that we should try to get consensus on this.  It is difficult to try to set out a statutory mechanism pursuant to which people would be recommended to be members of the Judiciary.  As we have all stated before, on balance we have been well served in this country with the Judiciary we have had since independence.  The most important feature of the Judiciary is that its members have been independent.  They have been able to say to governments, &ldquo;You are not allowed to do that&rdquo;.  They have been able to say to the Oireachtas, &ldquo;We are striking down legislation because it is unconstitutional and infringes the rights of others&rdquo;.  They have been able to do so without any fear of the consequences.  The reason they are able to do it without fear of the consequences is because it is extremely difficult to remove a judge in this country, as it should be.  The last thing we want is the type of tyrannical regime we see in other countries, whereby judges whom the government does not like can be removed very easily.<\/p>  <p>  We have never really had a satisfactory mechanism or scheme for the recommendation of people to be judges.  I want to point out that it is a difficult task to do.  First, it is difficult because you are selecting from a very small group of people.  The only people who are eligible to become members of the Judiciary in this country are qualified, practising lawyers: qualified, practising solicitors and qualified, practising barristers.  That will be changed under this legislation.  I welcome the fact that it will now be extended to include certain legal academics who also have experience of practice.  However, necessarily, you are dealing with a small number of people.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of what Deputy Catherine Murphy has said about increasing diversity.  That will happen once the professions reflect increasing diversity.  We have seen it happen already with gender balance.  Approximately 20 or 30 years ago, very few women were on the High Court.  Mella Carroll, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will remember, was the first woman appointed to the High Court.  The main reason for that was that very few women were eligible for appointment to the High Court.  That has considerably changed over the past ten years.  This Government and the Minister are to be commended on the appointments that this Government has made.  There has been virtual gender balance in the appointments to all the courts.<\/p>  <p>  It is a difficult task to do.  You are trying to identify what type of person you think would make a good judge.  My experience is that people who are good lawyers do not necessarily make good judges and, similarly, people who are bad lawyers can sometimes make good judges.  I emphasise that it is not possible to be a good judge unless you have a good understanding of the law.  You could be a bad lawyer or, I suppose, an unsuccessful lawyer, but make a very good judge.  However, in order to be a judge, the fundamental requirement is that you have a good understanding of the law.<\/p>  <p>  We might look at other countries.  It is obviously a political issue in the United States of America as to who is appointed for instance to the US Supreme Court.  Fortunately, we have overcome that issue in this country.  In this country, we resolve our complex social issues through political debate and, ultimately, through referendums.  That is how we have dealt with contentious social issues in the past ten to 15 years.  In the United States, they do not do it like that.  They do it on the basis of how the US Supreme Court interprets their constitution.  Necessarily in the United States, therefore, it will be a political decision as to who is appointed to the US Supreme Court.  We have seen that in recent years with the appointments to those courts.<\/p>  <p>  One of the contentious issues about this Bill has been what is contained within section 9, which relates to membership.  The Bill I introduced in October 2016 proposed 12 members.  <\/p> <p>In the Bill that the Government proposed in 2017, there were 13 members.  In this Bill, there is a proposal for nine members.  Having looked at all three Bills again, this one is better than mine and the one the Government previously published in 2017.  It is far better-off to have a situation in which one does not have the President of the High Court on a statutory body that advises on appointments to the District Court.  It makes much more sense just to limit the body to the president of the court where one seeks to make a recommendation in respect of a judge.<\/p> <p> I know the fact the Attorney General is included in the statutory body under section 9 is contentious.  My recollection of the Bill that Fianna F&aacute;il introduced before is that he or she was not included.  The reason for that was one would have the Attorney General at Cabinet.  What would be the purpose of having him or her there at the early stage?  However, I have to say that ultimately when it comes to ensuring that good and qualified people are nominated to be judges, the Attorney General plays an absolutely crucial role.  I commend the current Attorney General on the nominations he has advised on so far.<\/p> <p> On balance, it is not something about which we need to have a huge row.  He is on this statutory board but he does not have a vote.  One of the most powerful parts of the legislation is section 51 which expressly states that the Government cannot consider for nomination anyone who is not recommended.  That certainly goes further than any other legislation.  On balance, I welcome it.  Let us take our time and get it right.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Attorney General for the excellent work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800030#FF00200","speaker":"1553","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651149300,"counter":512,"content":"<p>There are concerns with this Bill.

More importantly, the Minister has had to correct the record on responses to parliamentary questions.<\/p>  <p>  The days of the old boys' club has to end.  People voted for change because they are sick of friends helping friends and of the State being run by a cosy circle and the revolving doors of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.

This Government has shown again and again that it is not capable of transparency and accountability.  It is time for a general election.

I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan that it is the best of the iterations that have come out over the past number of years.  I thank the Minister of State for the response to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice recommendations and the work on the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Gould, the Judiciary has among the strongest support from the people in terms of institutional independence.  It is internationally recognised in the top ten along with other countries such as Norway, Finland, New Zealand and Australia.  New Zealand in particular is interesting because it appoints all its judges entirely by political means with no external reference.  It is the attorney general who leads on that point.  Therefore, it are not necessarily connected that political appointments mean a judiciary that is not respected or independent.  It is much more complex than that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy said that the reform of the judicial appointments system in 1996 fell short of real reform.  It was a real reform because before then the Government could appoint absolutely anybody it wanted as long as that person was ten- or 12-years qualified.  It made a considerable reduction on political discretion for the Government.  Instead of the universe of people being everybody who was qualified, it was now the seven names recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  What happened was not the application of the legislation by the Government but most bizarrely by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which was set up and given extraordinary powers to reduce the universe of Government discretion from everyone who was qualified to the people who applied and the seven names it recommended having assessed them.  From approximately 1995 to 2002, it recommended approximately seven names as the legislation described.  It had the power to recommend fewer than that if that was what it wanted to do.  That happened until 2002 or 2003.<\/p>  <p>  At that time, the membership of the board decided to take a different approach which was to recommend all of those people who were not unsuitable.  It got senior counsel advice to say whether the board was acting constitutionally.  I do not know why it needed senior counsel advice when one looks at the composition of the board which included the Attorney General, the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court.  It reinterpreted its own function under the legislation.  I do not know why.  I have never managed to figure out why it did it.  However, the effect of what it did, which was not at the request of Government or the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and was never reviewed in any meaningful way, was to recommend all of those people who were not unsuitable.  If one had 150 applications for a District Court position, approximately 100 of those would be deemed suitable under the Act.  Instead of recommending seven out of the 100 suitable, it recommended all 100, which gave all of the political discretion back to the Government.  It was not at the Government's request or behest, but because of the decision-making of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  It is genuinely inexplicable.<\/p>  <p>  That continued until 2014 or so when it was described publicly.  It then brought its practice back to in and around seven.  The question of political discretion is bandied about as though the Government wants it all the time and is trying to acquire as much as possible.  The Government actually restricted its own discretion in 1995-96, got it all back from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, pointed out the problem and the discretion was reduced again.  It is just not true to say it is some sort of cosy cartel of the Government trying to grab all this discretion for itself at all times.  It is just not the way it worked.  It was the procedures of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.<\/p>  <p>  The other things it did not do well unfortunately was that it never interviewed.  Despite having the statutory power, it never interviewed anybody.  It could have but it did not for various reasons, mostly because it felt it did not have the expertise or capacity to do it.  What that meant was that the Government had no real detail about who was being recommended to it or why.<\/p>  <p>  We talk about whether it should be ranked.  The political discretion point I make is important because it is an important constitutional point.  However, it does not really matter if the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board or the commission will not engage in serious analysis of the candidates in a professional way, in the way that the Public Appointments Service does and Top-Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, do, and give quality information to Government about why it has picked this person and the person's relative merits and strengths and make an analysis.<\/p>  <p>  It is perfectly possible to have candidates of equal merit who are candidates for very different reasons such as a very good commercial or criminal lawyer.  There are many different types of candidates and it is important for the Government to make political choices between those people but they are not political choices with a capital P.  They are not party political choices but subtler political choices such as that made by the Government in 2011 to remedy the gender deficit on the courts.  That was a political choice to have two out of every three appointments being female.  Those are the sorts of broad political choices that are needed.<\/p>  <p>  I discussed this with Deputy McLoughlin, as he was in 2014 or 2015, on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and pointed out that if he or Deputy Kenny were Minister for Justice, they might wish to make broader political choices between three competent qualified people who have been assessed under a statutory process where there is quality information going.  It is a sort of simple political charge that it is not being ranked and therefore the Attorney General is involved.<\/p> <p>It is a little more complex than that.<\/p> <p> This Bill is the best iteration, as Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has said.  It is important that all appointments go through this, and it is important that the Minister be aware of all the people who have applied.  In that way it gives the Minister a safeguard to be able to assess whether diversity really is coming through the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The board publishes its annual reports every year and gives a breakdown of who applied - the gender breakdown, the professional breakdown and so forth - but not of who came out the other side, which is a barrier to being able to assess whether real diversity is coming through the JAAB.  It was impossible for the Government.  Although it had the statutory power to appoint somebody other than a person who was recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board it only ever did it once, in the case of a person who subsequently became Chief Justice.  The fact that it had the discretion to do it was statutorily relevant, but in practice it was irrelevant because it never did it.  Again, there is this bandying about of political this and political that, but if one looks at the vast majority of the applications by the Government of the Act, it never used the scale of political discretion that was available to it all the way through.  In fact, the real difficulty, which I am sure will be remedied in the case of the new judicial appointments commission, was the institutional drift that the body went through.<\/p> <p> The Bill is very welcome and I will enjoy taking it through Committee Stage to continue the debate about the role of the Attorney General, rankings and so forth.  However, there is a strongly independent Judiciary in Ireland and a very good system that is comparatively benched.  This is an important institutional reform and improvement, but that is all it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800031#GG00500","speaker":"1480","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651149900,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It seeks to enact a wide range of reforms which will change the way in which judges are appointed in Ireland.  We support the Bill although we will propose amendments to it to make it stronger.  We must see the appointment of judges who truly reflect Irish society, not just a certain section of society.  We must have judges who are in touch with all communities, especially working class communities because those communities live with the brutal reality of drug-related crime and antisocial behaviour.  It is consistently said to me that judges are out of touch and leave garda&iacute; fighting crime and social disorder with one arm tied behind their backs.  Countless garda&iacute; have told me how frustrating and disheartening their role has become due to out-of-touch judges.  There are countless examples of violent offenders with 70 or 80 previous offences receiving suspended sentences from judges.  Many violent offenders feel untouchable.  This is having a devastating impact on local communities.  It infuriates local residents and undermines the role of the garda&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  Previously in this Chamber I have raised various gang feuds and the ongoing social disorder.  Recently, it was in Creighton Street in City Quay and prior to that it was in Grand Canal Docks.  The garda&iacute; struggle for the required resources, but they do a great job with the limited resources they have.  We must have judges who are not afraid to hold offenders accountable.  Some absolutely horrible crimes are committed in communities across the country and the leniency of the sentences takes one's breath away.  Residents tell me that judges are out of touch with inner city communities.  As was mentioned earlier, the cohort of people who are qualified to be judges is small.  It will be extended slightly.  For me, the challenge is that we cannot wait for the natural change to happen.  We have to be proactive to ensure that the judges reflect the increasing diversity sooner rather than later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800032#HH00200","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1651149900,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, for bringing it forward.  I also thank the members of the justice committee, two of whom, Deputies Martin Kenny and Carroll MacNeill, are present, while others have contributed, for their work on this Bill.  Shortly after the Oireachtas Committee on Justice was established, this Bill came to it for pre-legislative scrutiny.  It might have been the first Bill to do so.  We now see it on Second Stage in the House.  I note that a number of the recommendations we made following pre-legislative scrutiny have made it into the Bill.  It is a good example of collegiate, constructive work across the Houses through the committee system.  As chair of the committee, I thank the members for their constructive inputs throughout.<\/p><p>As Deputies Jim O'Callaghan and Carroll MacNeill mentioned, the Bill has taken probably the best from both previous Bills while removing some of the more problematic aspects that were attempted in the previous D&aacute;il.  The former Minister, Mr. Shane Ross, was particularly culpable, shall we say, despite not being the Minister for Justice, in driving certain views.  Some of those issues have been addressed in this Bill and some have been removed where appropriate.  The good in that Bill and, indeed, in Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's effort is taken forward in this new composite Bill.  That is very welcome.  The Bill is not a panacea and there is still much to do - &quot;A lot done, more to do&quot;, as a famous previous Member of this House said, which is true of many things.  It is certainly progress and I welcome it.  It is important that we move it forward.<\/p><p>One thing struck me at the outset of this consideration to my great surprise.  I had always imagined the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to be a type of selection or assessment process, and I had understood that it would make recommendations, prioritise and present a slate from which the Government could choose.  I was surprised to find that it really served as largely a form of clearing house, akin to no more than a Garda vetting, whereby somebody was eligible for a role as opposed to being particularly suitable or particularly useful, and there did not appear to be any ranking or assessment, which was a pity.  I understand the freedom and power of the Government to appoint judges has always been constitutionally guaranteed, but that issue has been addressed in the Bill in terms of the far more rigorous, useful and practical process to shortlist and make a number of recommendations.  The Government will then choose from those recommendations, as opposed to having a process and procedure, going around the houses and ignoring it by picking somebody off the bat, which was an issue previously.  We know it happened.  It happened many times in many jurisdictions.  Perhaps many of those appointed worked out very well in the end, but a process to screen candidates, shortlist them and present them for appointment in an assessed manner makes far more sense.  It is very welcome.<\/p><p>I mentioned that the Minister has taken on board some of the recommendations from the committee.  One in particular, recommendation 6 made by the committee, referred to the definitions of experience required for academic selection.  The concept of appointing academic practitioners or academic personnel to the Bench is not new.  We have some very eminent jurists and legal scholars on the Bench in Ireland and we have benefited from their expertise, but what they have in common is that they have practical experience as well.  That is very important.  Something that is perhaps not always understood fully is that our appellate courts have a panel and a division.  They have a number of judges sitting in parallel together.  They consider an appeal on a point of law.  It is very technical, detailed, scientific or academic.<\/p><p>However, the majority of decisions in the first-instance courts, which include the High Court, Circuit Court, District Court and all courts below the Court of Appeal that the majority of cases come through, are far more practical.  They are all about inquisitions into fact-finding and also on any morning of the week managing a list, managing quite an unruly room at times, trying to put some type of structure on a number of cases that are being put before the court, trying to second-guess or read the room, trying to decide whether some <i>ex parte<\/i>application takes priority over some motion that was filed two weeks previously, whether some other matter is urgent and needs to be heard or whether a witness can give evidence or whether it is on affidavit only.  There are all these practical considerations to manage a courtroom.  For an academic non-practitioner to come in, who might have a fine and thorough knowledge of the law at academic level but has never set foot in a courtroom in his or her life, it would not be very practical and would not lead to good management of that courtroom.  The point I made in the committee is that it is akin to taking a very eminent medical scholar who had never practised medicine and appointing the person as the head of a busy emergency department on a Saturday night, where the person with the least experience would be the most senior person in the room.  It would not have good results.  We made the same point in this context.  Certainly, academics are very welcome and will enhance the Bench, but the requirement that has now been incorporated in the Bill is that they have a minimum of three years' experience.  Three years is actually quite low, but that there be some degree of practical experience present before coming in is very welcome.  I thank the Minister for taking that point on board.<\/p><p>Another point to be made in this debate is that we need to look at our <i>per capita<\/i>rate in terms of the numbers we have in the Judiciary to serve us.  Ours is quite low compared to elsewhere in Europe and internationally.  It is a fact that emerged in a number of inquiries in the committee, among many unexpected topics.<\/p> <p>A point made by many stakeholders is that we need more judges.   We need more people to hear court cases, hold proceedings and pass judgment because there are many matters to be dealt with.  For example, a victim who is waiting time and again to come back to court and who sees matters delayed is being re-traumatised every time they have to appear in the court.  Sometimes, a complex area of law has to be clarified for the benefit of this House or of other stakeholders or a particular sector, and there can be logjams in the employment courts and across the board.  It is very important that we address that.  I would say to the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and the Minister, Deputy McEntee, that we need to do that.  The Government is doing that and it has made a number of appointments over the last year, but we need an injection to get us up to the level that would be seen in comparable jurisdictions.<\/p> <p> On a point that is not covered by the Bill, I believe the Judicial Council is considering the issue of judicial conduct.  There is a lot of talk these days about safe spaces and dignity at work.  Sometimes, particularly in the lower courts, one can be a king or queen of one's own castle.  Dignity is not always afforded to those practising or appearing as witnesses, or to garda&iacute; or officials.  The Judicial Council is looking at some form of disciplinary or internal complaints procedure.  It is needed and is something we have in every other walk of life.  Just because somebody is sent to the Bench, they should not be immune from being asked to be accountable in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800032#HH00300","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651150500,"counter":520,"content":"<p>From the Rural Independent Group, I call Deputy Michael Collins, who is sharing time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800033#JJ00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1651150500,"counter":521,"content":"<p>Judicial appointments have been covered by politics for as long as appointments have been made.

There is no point in the Judiciary stating that we have to separate the Judiciary from the political system as most of the judges are here because of politics.  They are linked and I have no doubt that many cases that come before the courts have been on the desk of a local Deputy at some stage.  We, as well as the Judiciary, should play a part in law cases in this country to rid the country of crime.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to strengthen the extradition laws of this country, especially with European countries which we have locked arms with.  I know of some very suspicious characters in this country who roam the countryside free because they have escaped extradition.  I call on the law of the land to rectify this.  If they are as innocent as they claim to be, why not go to the country that is most affected by the crime that was committed and either clear their names or face jail for the rest of their lives if found guilty?  We seem too relaxed in this country about extradition and fall on the side of protecting the guilty, which in turn makes it look like we made mistakes in the lead-up to these people being brought to justice, and in turn these people try to make our garda&iacute; look weak, which if looked into properly, is not true.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen law cases in this country where garda&iacute; have been attacked and, to my astonishment, the criminal gets a very small sentence.  How can garda&iacute; apprehend hardened criminals when the law of the land fails to protect these garda&iacute;?  Garda&iacute; end up being badly injured in the line of duty.  Sentences for these types of crimes need to be stronger.  We need to show this country and the world that Ireland does not go easy on the thugs who commit these crimes.<\/p>  <p>  On my behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group, I thank the Master of the High Court, Edmund Honohan, for carefully crafting the Impaired Farm Credit Bill 2022, which has been sponsored by the Rural Independent Group.  This is an innovative Bill which aims to protect the family farm from vulture funds and boost low interest credit for farmers.  It was cleared for debate in the D&aacute;il on Tuesday last.  For too long, the Government has facilitated the vulture funds and banks to seize and sell family farms in Ireland.  This Bill would create a policy platform to tip the scales back in favour of landowners and farmers.  It is all about protecting the small man or woman against predatory financial institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800033#JJ00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1651150500,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy that this is the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800033#JJ00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1651150500,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I have spoken on that and I will refer back to that again.

It is unfortunate the Minister of State did not attend the audiovisual room the other day when he was here discussing what was before us in regard to this Bill.  The Minister of State would have found out a lot more.<\/p><p>Farmers are under attack from all quarters.  First, the Government is targeting deep cuts to farmers&rsquo; ability to earn a living through climate action reductions and an inadequate CAP programme.  Second, banks and vulture funds continue to seize and sell off family farms all over the country, with Government policy stacked in favour of these institutions.  We have observed at first hand the destruction and crippling impact that these vultures have caused to families and rural communities.  That is why we have brought forward this imaginative new Bill.<\/p><p>This would not be possible without the exceptional and invaluable contribution of the Master of the High Court, Edmund Honohan.  His first-hand knowledge of the difficulties faced by farm families and his exceptional legal expertise have been instrumental in the publication of this Bill.  The Master of the High Court, Edmund Honohan, has himself stated that the new world of banking is not geared towards agricultural lending.  It is simply that the banks do not get agriculture and their business model will not allow it.  Between banking as we know it and agriculture as we now know it, there is a grave mismatch and it is farmers and their families who are the losers in the process.  This Bill provides an approach to credit and impaired credit which is <i>sui generis<\/i>, or of its kind, and unique to the farm enterprise.<\/p><p>The Bill is an invitation to all stakeholders to engage in a searching reappraisal of the current dysfunction in the banking model as it applies to Irish agriculture.  Naturally, the usual gang of anonymous and highly paid banking lobbyists will beat a path to the door of any Minister who might appreciate a briefing on the measures in this Bill in a desperate attempt to block or delay open discussion and to protect the interests of the banks.  Instead, we invite all of those individuals and institutions to come on record and direct their observations to the committee of the Oireachtas, where they can be subject to constructive analysis.  After all, it would be nice for once to hear a Minister undertaking to put on the record of the House a full record of all comments he receives from front-door or back channels when it comes to this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800033#JJ00900","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1651150500,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I know the Deputy is doing his best to make it relevant but it eludes me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800033#JJ01000","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1651150500,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

It is very loose and very weak and, unfortunately, it is not doing what it says on the tin or what it was meant to say on the tin.  The Minister needs to get that opener for the tin and open it, because we know what happens to the fruit inside if it is left too long - it goes out of date.  We are stale.<\/p>  <p>  Mention was made of a former Minister for Transport, Shane Ross, who I fought with tirelessly with regard to rural issues.  However, I supported him with regard to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board Bill that he was trying to bring forward.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan mentioned that political shenanigans in the last Government stopped it.  There was no appetite for it.  The former Minister did his best and I salute him for the large amount of work he put into it.  He wrote about it before he came into the House and he made promises to people.  He did his best and more than his best, but it was not to be because of the political masters of the day, unfortunately, with no disrespect to the Minister of State, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or anyone else who has served at the Bar, as a solicitor or at legal level, and there are a lot of good people.  However, there is a huge job in shifting the balance from across the river to here.  Power is meant to lie here and, unfortunately, it is across the river that the power seems to rest.  Goodness, we have seen that in many cases, most recently with the so-called and very poorly named \"golfgate\", when there was a lot of media and it was a circus really, but that was a superficial war dance.  There are a lot of serious issues and many families are very hurt by the justice system in this country, which has not served us well.<\/p>  <p>  The joint committee&rsquo;s report set out ten recommendations in regard to the Bill.  A number of changes have been made to the general scheme following the pre-legislative scrutiny process and subsequent recommendations of the joint committee.  However, certain concerns remain regarding the role of the Attorney General and the fact the recommended candidates are not ranked in order of merit.  The system is going to pick the three candidates and send those three candidates forward to the so-called commission, but there is no ranking, so it is going to give the Minister of the day the political choice that he or she wants.  That is what it is and that is what is going to happen.<\/p> <p>Three names will go up.<\/p> <p> I have some experience of discussing these issues with Ministers for Justice.  I was involved in a strange court case following which I was cleared by a jury of my peers in County Tipperary, thankfully, after spending a long time in the court.  I thank the jury and all the legal people who were involved.  I met the then Minister and was very frustrated.  This happened after the court case, not before it.  I was told that Minister had not appointed the judge but had received a bit of paper from the then Taoiseach to tell him to appoint the person.  That is the way it works.  It stinks to high heaven and has done for a long time.  The system must be cleaned out and it is wrong.  I could highlight countless cases from counties Tipperary and Waterford in which justice was not served for ordinary citizens by a long shot.<\/p> <p> Deputy Michael Collins mentioned the former Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan, who offered a briefing to any Member who wanted to attend it on Tuesday evening last.  He gave us a wonderful briefing and he gave us a great help.  In fact, he drafted our Impaired Farm Credit Bill.  Deputy McGuinness, Senator Norris and other Members did their best in this area previously.  Anybody who stood before this very humble, decent, upright and respectful man of the people, whom the justice system is meant to serve, in his chambers was treated with dignity, respect, the utmost decorum and fairness and was made to feel human.  I have attended many court cases along with distraught families.  The system in many courts is not very humane, and it got even less humane earlier in the Covid pandemic.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  People were locked out of court cases.  Businessmen and farm families throughout the country have been put through nothing short of a torture chamber, and some members of the Judiciary have no halos above their heads after what they did.  We have seen this before, where massive sums have been written off by banks for certain individuals, and they have then sat on a case instead of recusing themselves because they have a vested interest in the form of an investment with the bank.  That would not happen under Putin, as awful as that man is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800033#JJ01200","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651151100,"counter":532,"content":"<p>Is that related to the Bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800034#KK00200","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1651151100,"counter":533,"content":"<p>It is, of course.  This is supposed to be a reforming Bill.  I thank the Acting Chairman for his advice but I am, of course, referring to the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I am referring to serious anomalies.  There will be no lay chairperson, a major flaw.  What does the Government have against laypeople?  Is everyone not entitled to exercise his or her intellect and to respect, whereby he or she can bring another perspective to the table?  No, the legal eagles want the power.  The Attorney General, the highest legal officer in the land, will be there in an advisory capacity, even though there have been some recent decisions in which he has scratched his head and asked what had happened.  I mean nothing personal against the Attorney General but his office was there.  There will be four on four and the legal eagles will win out again because there will be no lay chairperson, a major fundamental flaw.  It is a major design, architectural flaw that will ensure the Bill will not reform, will not do what it says on the tin, will not do what people are waiting for, and will do nothing along the lines of the efforts the former Minister, Shane Ross - I again salute him - made to tidy up the issue and to bring some sense of normality and fairness to the process.<\/p>  <p>  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, and the Minister for Justice may have attended an earlier session of the debate.  I understand the Minister of State has some skin in the game, given he is a qualified barrister.  I say \"fair dues\" to him in that regard - I have nothing against that - but whenever a debate gets around to our, smaller groups' speaking slots, the senior Minister will have left the Chamber, like a cat out through a skylight.  You would think someone was chasing after them with a pellet gun.  You cannot do that, of course, because of animal cruelty laws, but that is the way it is.  It is patently insulting and downright disrespectful to the section of the electorate that sends us here.  I refer to me, my colleagues in the Rural Independent Groups and other small groups as well.  It happens all the time.  Surely the Government can organise a structure whereby if the Minister has to leave before the debate has concluded and if a second session has been scheduled, a Minister can attend the second session for a while to listen to our views.  Our views are not weird or off the wall.  Our voices, and the voices of the people who put us here, have to be heard too.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the Bill, the three names will be recommended to the Government.  I have sat on many an interview board as a voluntary board member of both a national school and a vocational education committee, VEC, school.  There is always a ranking system.  The interview panel tries to get the best person available and, in second level at least, there was always an education inspector who was very good and gave sound advice.  On many occasions, there were two wonderful ladies who had retired from the Sisters of Mercy order, who were brilliant in their knowledge and their in-depth line of questioning and advice for us laypeople.  I was the chairman of the panel many times and I would not have been able to do that without the expert advice of those people.  We recommended the candidates in order of our preference in case, for some reason, the number one choice could not leave their previous job or could not take up the new job.  We always had to do that and we would give three or four options in order of preference, but that will not be the case following the commencement of this Bill.  Three names will be handed to the Secretary General and the Minister's Department, and there will be a pushing and shoving at the Cabinet meeting, a nod and wink and whatever.  The political appointee will get the job every time.  It is plain and simple.  If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, it is a duck.  The Bill will not change that one iota.<\/p>  <p>  We talk about juntas in African countries and elsewhere.  We fought here and got our freedom and our democracy.  We got the courts and the legal system but it has not served us well.  It may have served us in the main, but I could mention countless instances where it has not.  I could mention Tom Kennedy's family in Tipperary, who have suffered an appalling vista of abuse, Kieran Hartley, whose case is currently before a Waterford court, where the witnesses were locked out of the court, or my own case, but I will not because, thankfully, the jury saw through what was going on.  It is totally, scandalously political and it is what is going on up and down this country.  That needs to be tackled and it is what the then Minister, Mr. Ross, was trying to tackle.  As I said, I fought with him on transport issues and many other issues relating to rural Ireland but I am that kind of person.  I deal with issues as they come before me.  Above all, I like to be straight and honest and support issues where I can and if I can point out flaws, that is what I do.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill contains many failures and inadequacies, the main one being that relating to na tri&uacute;r ainmneacha.  They will be on a piece of paper in a white envelope with no ranking.  That is not an interview process.  An interview process is meant to pick out the best person from the four, eight, 100 or however many people come before the panel.  It should pick the best person who has applied to do the job, in the opinions of the eight people on the panel, with the advice of the Attorney General.  There will be plenty of advice in the room.  Moreover, although I may stand to be corrected on this, the Chief Justice will chair the meetings and will be available to offer advice.  In any event, there will be plenty of advice on the legal side, so why will the Government not allow for a lay chairperson?  He or she would not be Mattie McGrath coming in, running amok and wrecking the place.  That person would respect the place.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;, mol na daoine agus tiocfaidh said.<\/p>  <p>  We should get people of valuable experience.  I do not mean people from NGOs.  I was shocked to learn we now have 36,000 NGOs, costing &euro;5.5 billion annually.  I want ordinary, true laypeople to be involved.  I refer to people of the country, that is, ordinary people who have lived their lives and raised their families like any normal person and who have a lot to offer.  Many of them have done tremendous work in voluntary organisations throughout the country, unlike the NGOs.  You are nobody now if you are not an NGO.  We need to re-evaluate that system also, although that is not included this Bill and I will not get into that.  The Group of States Against Corruption, GRECO, has on several occasions criticised what is going on, the delay, the inaction and the obfuscation that went on when the then Minister, Mr. Ross, was trying to make changes.  I have ears and can hear what goes on.  T&aacute; dh&aacute; chluas agam.<\/p> <p>I could hear what was going on in this building, outside of the Chamber.  People said they would make sure it was buried, and it was buried.  All that was lacking was the funeral and the praise.  It was buried because it was not wanted.  It was not because of who the former Minister, Shane Ross, was but because it was unpalatable to some.  It was trasna na habhann, across the river.<\/p> <p> We had a seismic shift here.  I am looking at the Acting Chair here.  I should not comment on the Chair but I am looking at Sinn F&eacute;in, which is champing at the bit to get into power.  It has made many promises.  I will live in hope and wait and see.  The system is so cumbersome now that it will take a fair amount of courage and dedication to change it.  You would need a jackhammer or a pickaxe to get the hands of the very senior civil servants, such as Mr. Watt and others, senior officialdom, some NGOs and the whole cabal that exists off the handlebars of power and to give a small bit back to the people and to his House.  We have token power here.  We saw this in how this House acted during the Covid pandemic.  Any legislation requested was passed.  We saw legislation on hearsay included in emergency legislation on health during a pandemic.  That was the biggest joke of all time.  There was not a word from any of the major parties here, including the main Opposition party.  That was put in.  That was the boldest, most audacious move.  The Government thinks it can do what it likes with the people, including the people in here as seen in the inclusion of that legislation on hearsay.  It is devastating that hearsay can be allowed as evidence.  D&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i go raibh fear i dTiobraid &Aacute;rainn a bhfuil p&oacute;ca ina l&eacute;ine aige.  That is what hearsay is.  I will finish but this is useless, toothless and fruitless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800034#KK00300","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651151700,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I have great respect for Deputy Mattie McGrath but I do not agree with him that this is toothless, fruitless and useless.  In fact, I welcome the Bill and the amount of work the Department and the Minister have put into it.  I often criticise written speeches but I will not on this occasion.  It was succinct and to the point.  Of course, it does not deal with the issue of the Attorney General or the thorny question of the concerns raised in that regard, but it deals with the matters it deals with.  It talks about fundamental reform and I acknowledge that.  This is fundamental reform and I acknowledge that openly.<\/p><p>However, what is missing from the speech is the context.  It is as if this Bill has arrived from nowhere.  The background to this is that it has been a long time brewing.  Let us put it like that.  I have read all of the submissions and I once again acknowledge the work of the committee.  In fairness, it highlighted the different opinions among its members.  It did not come down on one side or another but certainly highlighted different issues, including the issue of rankings, concerns over the Attorney General being placed on the committee and so on.<\/p><p>Why do we need this?  It is not a reflection on the judges.  I will put up my hand and say that, in a different life, I was there.  I am highly critical of any institution, including the Judiciary, when necessary but the older I get and the more time I spend with institutions, the more I realise they are the last bastion of the people who managed to get there.  Unfortunately, not everyone has access.  I wish we were discussing equality before the law in terms of access and the number of judges we need rather than this but this is the first step in looking at that.<\/p><p>We have at least four academics, including three in Ireland and one from outside, acknowledging we need a fair, transparent and rigorous process.  They say this Bill goes a long way towards that.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, which we often quote here, tells us that an independent, fair, transparent and effective judicial appointments system is crucial for protecting the independence of the Judiciary and the right to a fair trial.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission tells us, &quot;An independent and diverse judiciary are fundamental components of a functioning democracy.&quot;  It also points out that, &quot;Judicial independence is a cornerstone of the rule of law and access to justice.&quot;  Access to justice is another thing we do not talk about in here.  It goes on to say, &quot;Independence of the judiciary is an essential element for an individual&rsquo;s perception of the judiciary and confidence in the judicial system.&quot;  Perception is very important here.  The commission states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tPerceptions about the independence of a judiciary can affect an individual&rsquo;s decision to:  \t&ldquo;bring cases to court, to refrain from legal action or, if available, to use other methods of dispute resolution&rdquo;. Interference with judicial independence and attempts at influencing judges can severely undermine the protection and recognition of human rights. <\/blockquote>  <p>It also states, &quot;Furthermore, from a rule of law perspective, a judiciary should be representative of the diversity nature of society.&quot;  I could go on but these fundamental principles have been pointed out for quite some time.<\/p><p>We are here today with a Bill that certainly is reforming.  There are many positive things in it.  I do not agree that the former Minister, Shane Ross's Bill was the right way to go about this.  It was most unfortunate that it served to deflect from the real necessity for a debate on justice, access to justice, diversity of the Judiciary and many other issues.  If this is the start of that debate, I welcome it.  The positive aspects include the fact that, for the first time, judges will be appointed based on merit.  That is set out in legislation.  There will be published criteria, selection statements and diversity statements.  An interview will be essential.<\/p><p>The number of candidates from which the Government must select a judge has been reduced to three.  That is welcome.  All of the organisations I have mentioned, as well as international organisations like the Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, have said that a big number of names going forward to any government is unacceptable.  The reduced number of three is acceptable.  I have an open mind with regard to ranking.  I know a lot of issues have been raised in that regard.  I feel that concern has been met to some extent by reducing the number to three, which still leaves the Government the discretion it must have under the Constitution.  A good balance has been struck there. <\/p><p>I welcome the underlining of the importance of education and training.  It is fundamental.  I welcome that there is to be a diversity strategy published with the particulars set out.  I may come back to that point.  I welcome that all applicants will go through the same system regardless of their position.  The existing system, under which there is a difference, is unacceptable.  The proposal in the previous legislation put forward on this issue, that there would be a trinity, including the Attorney General, to appoint the top judges, was simply unacceptable, so I welcome that, under this Bill, all applicants will be treated in the same way and will have to go through the same process.  I welcome that eligibility has been extended to include the President of the High Court and legal academics.  Although I know the Bar Council has some concerns with regard to experience, I do not share that concern.  I believe it is a welcome change that legal academics are to be allowed in.<\/p><p>I welcome the accountability and that a report will be produced annually and presented to the D&aacute;il.  I welcome the built-in review in the legislation, which will go some way towards bringing about accountability, although I have concerns about a matter that is not set out - perhaps I have misread it - which is the review not being publicised.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify that point.  The review that is to be conducted by the commission in due course is to go back to the Minister but I do not see any provision for it to be sent to the D&aacute;il.  If we are seriously interested in increasing diversity among judges at every level, it is essential we see what the commission is saying, what we are learning and what further changes from the D&aacute;il are necessary.<\/p><p>I welcome all of those changes but I will now move on to some of my concerns.  I see no reason for including the Attorney General in the judicial appointments commission.  The judicial appointments commission is to replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB.  It is a change of letters but it may theoretically be a lot more than that, depending on how the replacement is implemented.<\/p> <p>If it is implemented properly and the review is carried out properly, it will ensure fundamental reform.  Practically every single submission expressed serious concerns about the presence of the Attorney General, with the exception of the Bar Council.  Its concern was simply that there was no provision for a replacement when the Attorney General steps out where he or she is going for promotion and would have no part in the process.  That is the most basic requirement, that he or she would step out.  If the judges on the commission are going for promotion, they must step out and there is provision for their replacement.  The Attorney General is on the commission, but if he or she steps out, there is no replacement.  That is one practical problem the Bar Council pointed out.<\/p> <p> However, there is a far more fundamental problem that is totally at odds with the fundamental reform in this Bill that I am praising and which the Government is praising.  There is no fundamental reform if we have the Attorney General on the commission, albeit in a non-voting capacity, because he or she will be there every step of the way, as has been pointed out, and will be there at the end when the Government decides.  As pointed out by the submissions, the Attorney General will inevitably be involved in the final selection once names are sent to the Minister.  Therefore, having the Attorney General sit on the appointments commission, albeit without a vote, seems to give an overly dominant - I would say influential - role.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has pointed this out, the legal academics who made submissions have pointed this out, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has pointed it out.  Specifically, IHREC says the rationale for the presence of the Attorney General on the judicial appointments commission is unclear.<\/p> <p> Significantly, there is a gap in the speech where there is no reference to it at all except one line saying it will be a non-voting role.  It does not deal with the issue raised after the process of consultation has been completed and when the vast majority of submissions have raised the most serious concerns in regard to having the Attorney General on the judicial appointments commission.  I would love if the Minister dealt with that, with why we are avoiding dealing with it and giving us a rationale.  It does not make sense.  I think the rationale that was given by a colleague &ndash; it has gone out of my head but I might come back to it, and I think it was Deputy Lawless but I had better check - certainly did not ring with me as a rationale for having the Attorney General on the commission.  The Attorney General is the Government&rsquo;s legal adviser and arguably this provides a means of Executive involvement in the judicial appointments commission&rsquo;s proceedings.  This is not me talking - it is from the submissions - but I fully endorse this.  This is particularly so given the Attorney General also sits at the Cabinet, again in a non-voting role.  The risk is that having the Attorney General on the judicial appointments commission presents the obvious risk of double counting the view from the Executive.<\/p> <p> Independence from the Executive and the Legislature was precisely the issue, and this has been pointed out and gone into in detail, and I share all of those concerns.  The Law Society of Ireland said it is not appropriate to have the Attorney General on the judicial appointments commission.  It outlines six different persuasive reasons the Attorney General should not be on it.  There is also a suggestion the Attorney General should be ineligible for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal for at least a period of 12 months after leaving office.  That is another concern that has not been dealt with.  As I mentioned already, the Bar Council said there is no provision for a replacement for the Attorney General when he or she steps out of a commission meeting.  Obviously there cannot be because there is only one Attorney General.  That in itself is a problem.<\/p> <p> The Bar Council raised an interesting point in regard to the cost analysis and the danger of a new quango.  I fully agree there has to be a judicial appointments commission and that it has to be staffed, but the Bar Council raises serious issues in regard to the creation of a new State body and whether it is proportional to the function for which it is created.  In any given year there might not be any judges appointed and we are providing an office, funding and a director.  The basis for the potential extra expenditure has not been identified in the Bill.  Perhaps it has somewhere and I am not aware of it.<\/p> <p> There are concerns about confidentiality, which is another concern of mine, where an offence has been put into the Bill.  Only one submission raised this and it was the academic who is, I think, based in Oxford.  He raised the question of the necessity for creating an offence for canvassing or for disclosure of confidential information.  I understand in the previous legislation there was simply a prohibition on disclosure.  Now we have gone further and created an offence.  It could may well be that there is a need for that but I see no evidence.  Has somebody broken that in the past?  Have they contravened the prohibition?  Why do we need that?  How is that dealt with in relation to the Attorney General?  He or she sits on the judicial appointments commission and then goes back to Cabinet and talks to the Ministers and so on.  Where does confidentiality come into that?  Will that person who is Attorney General be treated differently in regard to confidentiality?  I would like that to be clarified.  If we are going this far, and I think it is a major step in fundamental reform, why shoot ourselves in the foot by keeping an Attorney General on a commission when there is no rationale for it?<\/p> <p> I mentioned already that ranking was a serious concern of many of the submissions.  It is not a concern for me now that the numbers have been reduced down to three.  The other matter was in regard to judges being elected by their peers.  It is not clear to me if that is the case or whether they will be nominated.  It would seem to be an international practice that they would be by their peers.<\/p> <p> In regard to diversity and gender equality, it took 101 years to get the first two females appointed to the Bar.  We are dealing here with 100-year periods.  The year 2021 marked the centenary of the call to the Bar of the first two women, Frances Kyle BL, and Averil Deverell BL, in November 2021.  They were the first two to be called to the northern bar.  That was the 100th year.  It took another year to break the barrier for solicitors, and they were appointed in 1923.  Mary Dorothea Heron was the first woman to be appointed.  I think great strides have been made.  Some 40% of barristers are now female, although there is a complete imbalance in regard to senior counsels, of whom only 17% are female.  However, the promotion of judges is from the pool of senior counsels.  I acknowledge Deputy Carroll MacNeill&rsquo;s work in this area, the book she has written and the research she has done.  It has taken quite a long time to get this far where 40% are female.  The diversity strategy and the gender strategy need to mean something in reality.  The first review that is carried out will be essential to learning and to seeing whether we mean what we are saying when we pass this legislation.  Will it be implemented?<\/p> <p> The other thing, when I looked at this, is that very often there can be strong legislation and strong strategies, as they have in England, and it does not make a difference.  We are actually ahead of England in terms of gender equality, as I understand it.  Having it is one thing; implementing it is another.<\/p> <p> In regard to diversity in terms of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds and so on, we have no data.  It is another fact that jumps off the pages.  We know anecdotally the judges do not reflect society, that they come from a particular background and a particular education system, which is absolutely no reflection on them.  In my opinion they do a good job, relatively speaking, compared with other institutions, as I said earlier.  We need data urgently.  One of the first jobs for the commission is to have data and to commission and carry out research.  Its strategy should be based on that.  It should have targets and objectives that should be reviewed.  It should be brought into the D&aacute;il or the relevant Oireachtas committee in order that we can look at it.<\/p> <p> Why do we need this Bill, besides any of the political debates that have gone on about it?  Given the recent developments in Poland and Hungary, and again this has been identified in the submissions, it has become all the more clear that we cannot rely on convention or tradition alone and assume the goodwill on the part of any future government.<\/p>  <p>We need an independent process inasmuch as we can do that under the Constitution.  I think this strikes the balance in that regard.<\/p> <p> I will finish by saying that I would love a discussion in here when we have this done and the system is set up to monitor it, the targets that are set and on access to justice.  The President of the High Court, Mary Irvine, has pointed out repeatedly that there is an absence of judges and the five recent appointments in the past year were already counted, so we need more judges.<\/p> <p> In response to the argument that judges are a cabal, let me point out that back on 30 January 2014, eight years ago, the Judicial Appointments Review Committee set out 16 recommendations in a report.  They are fundamental.  It was stated that: \"The present system of judicial appointments is unsatisfactory.\"  That is the senior judges speaking.  They also stated: \"As a matter of principle, political allegiance should have no bearing on appointments to judicial office.\"  They went on to say that there should be no distinction between the appointments of judges on a higher level and a lower level.  They asked for ranking in recommendation 16.  There were the senior members of the Judiciary crying out for change.  I agree with a lot of what Deputy Carroll MacNeill says, but not on this.  The Judiciary itself highlighted that reform was necessary and that it should not depend on political patronage.<\/p> <p> The final issue that is not addressed is what happens if the judicial appointments commission fails to nominate somebody, if it does not pick anybody or it is not in a position to recommend anyone.  I do welcome the fact that the Government has to pick from the three candidates, but what happens if three candidates are not chosen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800035#LL00200","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651152900,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important legislation, which was very laborious in its birth, had a long gestation and on which we anxiously awaited the outcome.  I agree with many of the points made by the previous speaker, but I want to warn about a couple of issues that cannot be remedied in a small country.  No matter what board comes up for renewal, in what capacity it comes up or on what basis an interview board is set up in this country, it is a small country and there is no way we can be certain that nobody on the board knows the person who is being interviewed for appointment.  It cannot be done in a small country.  Neither can it be guaranteed that they do not know their relatives or something about them.<\/p>  <p>  I have the highest respect for the Judiciary and the need to keep the separation between it and the political system because of our constitutional requirements.  That must not change, because if there is any movement towards change it would give rise to a problem that would manifest itself in early date.  Like many of us in this House, I have been before most judges.  I have been impressed by many of them.  I found the judges of the High Court, Supreme Court and all the other higher courts to be exemplary in the way they discharged their duties.  I would be the first to say that.  Occasionally, in some of the lower courts one would raise questions about decisions taken or the basis of the decisions taken, which could be on whether a person liked politicians.  For instance, I have been a witness in a case where a judge refused to allow the witness to speak on behalf of a defendant.  I know as much about this system as they know about the system in that regard.  A witness is a witness.  Whether he or she is a public representative or not, he or she is entitled to be a witness.  I have seen various witnesses in courts discharge themselves admirably and I have seen witnesses discharge themselves dubiously as well.  We would ordinarily expect to be in a position to quiz them as to their authenticity and so on, and it might not always work.  I remember being told by a judge that the court was not a political arena, to which I had to respond that I was not there in a political capacity, I was there as a witness, a distinction that has to be observed.<\/p>  <p>  In the system that now prevails there is no way that we can be certain that we have taken all the knots out of the woodwork in the course of our work.  It was a good system heretofore which worked well generally.  There was the odd one here or there, but sure there is the odd one in this House from time to time and I ask how they got in here, and they could say the same about us.  The point is that in a small country it is well nigh impossible to get an interview board at any level whereby somebody who is being interviewed does not know somebody who knows those carrying out the interview.  It is not possible to do it.  For example, they might know the school they went to.  They all know that, and there is no use in pretending otherwise.  Despite the fact that this was a long drawn out debate, some of the debate was well placed and some of it was not.  We have to depend on two things in our system: the integrity of the judicial system and its separation from the political system.  There must be a strict observance of that division at all times.<\/p>  <p>  In the past, I and I am sure many other people in this House have challenged whether somebody was stepping over the system and wandering into each other's territory.  It is not possible to do that.  It is not possible for the Members of this House to sit in judgment on every judgment either.  There may be judgments that we can question and that the public will question, but we cannot go through every case.  It is not possible to do that.  In fact, it is a dangerous thing.  The courts should not be looking behind them in the rear-view mirror wondering whether or not something would meet the approval of the political group.  That is not the way the system works.  It is not supposed to work that way and it should never be that way.  Let us hope that this system irons out some of the perceived kinks that were in the system.  I say \"perceived\" because there are always explanations as to why different decisions were made.  We could all raise questions, but the fact of the matter is that we have to respect the integrity of each other's positions and the importance of the Constitution in this country.  We look across the water at our nearest neighbour, which does not have a constitution - it has a different system there.  We do have a Constitution here which must be strictly observed whereby the State and the judicial system are completely separate and independent.<\/p>  <p>  Dependence on the integrity of this system is important to every citizen, whoever it may be, whether he or she is an influential or important person or of no importance at all as far as the general public are concerned, but people are entitled to their day in court.  They are entitled to justice, in so far as they can get it, but what they get in court is the law, in many cases, as opposed to justice.  We recognise that if the law says a particular application must be made in a particular way, that is the way it is going to be.  That is where solicitors differ.  Some solicitors say we can change that, and some lawyers say they can challenge that.  Sometimes they win and sometimes they do not.  That is as it should be as well.<\/p>  <p>  In the final analysis, I hope this works well.  I also hope that people recognise that we are a small country, and everybody knows everybody else in some way, shape or form.  It is impossible to avoid that.  I hope we will learn to live with the new system, get the benefit from it and as a result get improved stature for the system - both the system of politics and the judicial system, and that both will grow in strength.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800037#NN00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1651152900,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  We have had an interesting debate both on the previous occasion and today and very useful contributions.  This legislation meets the commitment in the programme for Government to overhaul our judicial appointments system.  We are debating serious and meaningful reform.<\/p> <p>It is significant that all judicial offices in the State and outside the State will come within the commission's remit to recommend.  It is critical that all applications must be made to the commission, and only to the commission, including from serving judges.  It is important the Government may only appoint or nominate a person recommended by the commission.<\/p> <p> I may not have the opportunity to cover all issues raised, but I will endeavour to respond to some key points.  Deputy Martin Kenny welcomed the Bill and questioned the chairing and lay complement.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is, and has been for about 25 years, since its inception, chaired by the Chief Justice of the day.  The Chief Justice has a unique perspective on the workings of the entire judicial system and has a particular understanding of what is required to become a judge at any level of the judicial system.  The Chief Justice is chair of the Judicial Council.  I accept that the commission we are providing for and the council are not the same and have different functions and objectives, but I believe there is not a person better placed to guide and lead the function of selecting judges into the future.  It is not always the choice of comparable jurisdictions to have a leading judge heading up this role, but some jurisdictions, such as Northern Ireland, have this arrangement and I am satisfied that it works particularly well.<\/p> <p> The context is increased lay involvement.  Judges and lawyers outnumber laypersons on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board by eight to three.  The Bill represents a large vote of confidence in what previous and existing lay members will bring to this function and the future expertise lay members will bring to the commission under section 13.  Under section 9, four lay members, openly recruited, will have the exact same weighting on the commission as judicial members, that is, four to four.  A smaller commission with a balance of lay and judicial voices will be efficient and effective at making recommendations to the Government.  The judicial membership has been reduced from what was previously planned and what currently pertains under the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  There is no particular need to have all court presence sitting all the time.  The Bill provides for the fixed membership of the President of the Court of Appeal only.  Other presidents will come in and out as members, depending on which court vacancies are being considered.  Overall, with the Chief Justice's chair, this is a sound, effective and balanced arrangement.<\/p> <p> Deputies Martin Kenny and Catherine Murphy also mentioned ranking of candidates or an order of preference among the three recommended names.  The Minister's advice is that, for the Government to discharge its function under the Constitution, it must have a choice of candidates.  The Minister is of the view that three names, without an order of preference, is essential to maintain this balance.<\/p> <p> Deputy Howlin reminded us of the context of the inception of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board arrangements.  He also touched on the important context of the rule of law in the EU for the Bill.<\/p> <p> Deputy Howlin and others also referred to the position of the Attorney General on the commission.  This matter was the subject of the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report and thank them for raising it.  As noted in the committee's report, the general scheme of the Bill provided that the Attorney General shall not, as a member of the commission, have a right to vote, and section 9 provides for that.  The committee's report notes it was argued that the general scheme of the Bill contained a significant weakness in the proposal for the senior judicial appointments advisory committee including the Attorney General.  However, the Bill does not include this proposal, as the Minister mentioned yesterday.<\/p> <p> As the legal adviser to the Government and the chief law officer of the State under the Constitution, the holder of the Office of the Attorney General is a suitable person to be a member of the judicial appointments commission in the performance of its functions under the Bill.  The provision that the Attorney General shall not have a vote as a member of the commission allows for an appropriate balance between the four judicial members and the four lay members.  Under Article 30 of the Constitution, the Attorney General shall not be a member of the Government, and the Attorney General does not have the role of representing the Government on the commission.<\/p> <p> Several Deputies mentioned the importance of the diversity objective.  I agree this is a concern and I thank them for raising this important issue.  I have two points to make.  First, section 28, in a development of the general scheme, now provides for the periodic publication of a diversity statement by the commission.  This will set out the manner in which the commission gives effect to the objective, set out in section 39, that membership of the Judiciary in each court shall reflect the diversity of the population of the State as a whole, as well as related matters specified in section 28.  The commission must prepare such a strategy periodically.  It should be noted that section 61 requires a review of how the key objectives of the Bill, including diversity, are being met.<\/p> <p> Second, focusing more so on the legal professions, the Minister is engaging with the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, LSRA, on the matter.  The Minister asked the LSRA to examine further the remuneration of trainee barristers and solicitors, the other costs associated with joining each profession, the information available to prospective trainee barristers and solicitors on available masters and solicitors firms, the information available on the terms and conditions available and how they are selected, and any other barriers facing young barristers and solicitors, including the ability to take maternity leave.  The Minister asked the LSRA to pay particular attention to equity of access and entry into the legal professions and the objective of achieving greater diversity within the professions.  The authority has reported on the matter and the Department is currently engaging with the authority.<\/p> <p> Deputy Connolly raised the issue of access.  Access is an important component of Mr. Justice Peter Kelly's review, wherein 90 recommendations were made, including several relating to access.  An action plan will be brought before the Cabinet shortly in the implementation of these recommendations.<\/p> <p> As to the number of judges, there was a recent increase in the number of High Court judges, from 37 to 42, and a review is being carried out to assess the need for judges across all courts.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputies once again for their engagement with this topic.  There is clear acknowledgment of the importance of a judicial appointments process and the need to get the various aspects and balances around the procedure right and fit for purpose.  The selection, recommendation, and appointment of persons to these critical roles with such a bearing on peoples' lives and on communities and greater society is a focal point of the administration of justice.  This will be enhanced by the reforms put forward in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800037#NN00300","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651153500,"counter":541,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2022: Referral to Select Committee","time":1651153500,"counter":542,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800038#OO00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1651153500,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I move<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice pursuant to Standing Orders 95(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 181(1). <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800038#OO00400","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651153500,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage","time":1651153500,"counter":545,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800038#OO00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1651153500,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to reform the existing guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system.  At present, guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>, GALs, are appointed by the court for children who are the subject of child care proceedings under the Child Care Act 1991.  The GAL's role is to ascertain the views of the child and communicate these to the court.  The GAL also makes recommendations to the court as to what is in the best interests of the child.  This is an important role that gives a voice to vulnerable children during care proceedings, yet the current legislative provisions do not set out the qualifications and experience necessary to act as a GAL.  The status, role, and functions of the GAL are not defined.  There is no requirement on the court to appoint a GAL, which means that appointments are <i>ad hoc<\/i>and inconsistent.<\/p><p>The Bill will address these issues by repealing section 23 of the Child Care Act, and inserting a new Part specifically relating to guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  The Bill provides a statutory basis for a national GAL service that will provide high-quality assistance to both vulnerable children and the courts.  The reforms set out in the Bill have been welcomed by children's rights campaigners and are in line with the Oireachtas joint committee recommendations and submissions received by my Department.  The publication of this legislation is delivering on commitments in both the programme for Government and in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the national policy framework for children and young people.<\/p><p>I would like to discuss some of the policy considerations that informed the development of the Bill before I outline the main provisions in detail.  The children's right referendum of 2012 saw the passing of the thirty-first amendment to the Constitution.  In addition to recognising children as rights holders, the thirty-first amendment provided that, in the resolution of all proceedings involving children, the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration.  In recognition of this, the Bill specifically provides that in any proceedings before a court in relation to the care and protection of a child under the Child Care Act, the court is obliged to regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.<\/p><p>The Bill further provides that where a child is capable of forming his or her own views in any child care proceedings, the court must determine how to facilitate the child in expressing his or her views.  The court must then give due weight to any views the child wishes to express, having regard to the age and maturity of the child.<\/p><p>In its 2015 annual report, the Comptroller and Auditor General considered the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service.<\/p> <p>The report noted a lack of transparency surrounding selection, registration and vetting of GALs.  It also highlighted a lack of oversight regarding costs and found that payments made to GALs in Ireland appear to compare unfavourably to the contracted early rate of GALs in other common law jurisdictions.  The report further expressed concerns that while GALs in this country are paid a standard hourly rate, they do not necessarily deliver a standard service.<br\/><br\/>Under the current legislative provisions, a GAL may engage legal representation if he or she feels it is in the child's best interest to do so.  The selection and appointment of legal representation is a matter for each individual GAL as GALs are not employed or managed by a public body.  This situation means that despite the large sums of money involved, there is no open, competitive, tendering process in place for legal representation for GALs.  The Comptroller and Auditor General report, therefore, recommended that my Department examine options for engagement of legal representatives by GALs.  This issue has been addressed in the specific section in the Bill on legal representation for GALs.<br\/><br\/>Deputies may be aware that a similar Bill to regulate GALs was introduced in 2019 and fell with the dissolution of the previous D&aacute;il.  The lapsing of that Bill gave my officials further opportunity to consider issues that have been raised by stakeholders and to further refine its provisions.  The general scheme of this Bill was then examined by the Oireachtas joint committee in pre-legislative scrutiny.  The committee's report focused on two key issues that have been the subject of lengthy debate.  These are the appointment of GALs and the status of GALs.  The committee recommended the mandatory appointment of a GAL in all proceedings before the court under the Child Care Act.  The Bill provides for mandatory appointment in all proceedings under section 25 of the Mental Health Act 2001 and in special care proceedings before the High Court.  I believe the automatic appointment of a GAL for a child in these types of proceedings is an important safeguard for a child who could potentially be deprived of his or her liberty.  However, in relation to all other childcare proceedings before the court, the Bill provides for a presumption in favour of appointment.<br\/><br\/>I have considered the recommendations of the committee and have decided to retain this presumption in favour of appointment rather than making appointment compulsory.  I am of the view that imposing mandatory appointment of a GAL on an older child, who clearly articulates that he or she does not want a GAL, would be disregarding the voice of that child.  It would deny children the opportunity to make a direct input into crucial decisions affecting their lives in circumstances where they may prefer to engage directly with the court rather than through a GAL.  The presumption in favour of appointment should also be considered in conjunction with proposed family court reform.  By not providing for mandatory appointment, we are attempting to avoid rigidity in how a child or young person may engage with a court.  The specialised family courts may, once established, be able to provide alternative mechanisms for hearing the voice of the child in addition to, or instead of, a GAL.  I believe that providing for a presumption in favour of appointment is the most appropriate course of action.  This approach is one that is supported by many stakeholders, including the special rapporteur on child protection.<br\/><br\/>The Oireachtas joint committee also considered the issue of whether a GAL should be a party to the proceedings.  While providing that GALs have all of the necessary powers to fulfil their role, the Bill confirms that the GAL is not a party to proceedings.  However, the Bill explicitly confirms the discretion of the court to allow a GAL to exercise certain party-type rights, where appropriate, in the child's best interests.  The court may also direct GALs to carry out further duties, as the court considers necessary, in the interests of the child and in the interests of justice.  I have considered the recommendations of the committee carefully and while some differences of opinion remain, I believe the Bill addresses many of the concerns raised.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 sets out the definition of key terms used in the Bill.  It defines the Child Care Act 1991 as the principal Act.  Section 2 provides for the repeal of certain provisions of the Child Care Act 1991 and the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011.  These repealed provisions will be replaced by the provisions of this Bill.  Section 3 amends the interpretation section of the Child Care Act 1991 for the purpose of inserting a definition of the data protection regulation.  Section 4 amends the principal Act by substituting a new section 24 for the existing section.  The purpose of this amendment is to reflect the intent of Article 42A of the Constitution by confirming that in any childcare proceedings under the principal Act, the court must have regard to the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.  Section 5 inserts a new section 24A into the principal Act.  The new section provides that where a child is capable of forming his or her own views in any proceedings under the principal Act, the court must determine how to facilitate the child in expressing those views.  The court will be required to give any views that the child wishes to express due weight, having regard to the child's age and maturity.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 amends the <i>in camera<\/i>rule by inserting a new section 5B into section 29 of the principal Act.  This new subsection provides that the Minister may grant an approval to an official, which will enable that official to attend childcare proceedings in specific circumstances.  An approval may be granted if the Minister is satisfied that attendance by an official would assist in the promotion of good practice by GALs or where such attendance would assist in the review of the operation of the Child Care Act.  These amendments provide clarification on the documents that the Child Care Law Reporting Project may also access.<br\/><br\/>Section 7 inserts a new Part, relating to guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>, into the principal Act.  This new Part comprises sections 35A to 35Q.  Section 35A sets out the definitions used in this Part.  Section 35B specifies that a person is not appointed as a GAL for a child unless an order directing such an appointment has been made under this section.  It provides that the High Court will appoint a GAL for all children in special care proceedings.  It creates a presumption in favour of the appointment of a GAL in proceedings before the District Court.  Where the District Court decides not to make an order appointing a GAL, the court will be required to give reasons for this decision in writing.<br\/><br\/>Section 35C requires the Minister to appoint a GAL where an order is made by the High Court or the District Court, or if the court has made a direction to keep proceedings under review.  Section 35D deals with the provision of legal advice and legal representation for GALs.  It requires the Minister to provide legal advice and legal representation to GALs appointed in special care proceedings.  The Minister will be obliged to arrange for the provision of legal advice to GALs who have been appointed for a child in proceedings before the District Court upon request.  The Minister may also arrange for the provision of legal representation to a GAL in the District Court, if the Minister considers it is in the best interests of the child to do so, having regard to the list of factors set out in this section.<br\/><br\/>Section 35E sets out the functions of a GAL.  A GAL will be required to ascertain the views of the child, where the child is capable of forming his or her own views.  Having considered those views, the GAL is then required to make recommendations to the court on what is in the best interests of the child.  This requirement to make recommendations to the court also applies in circumstances where a child is not capable of forming or expressing his or her views or where the child is unwilling to express his or her views.  The GAL is required to furnish a report to the court that sets out the views of the child, the GAL's recommendations and the rationale for those recommendations.  Having regard to the child's age and maturity, the GAL will also be required to inform the child of the recommendations contained in his or her report.  The GAL must also inform the child about the outcome of the proceedings, and any other matters relevant to the proceedings, that he or she considers appropriate.  The GAL must also inform the court of any additional matters that are relevant to the best interests of the child which come to his or her attention during the course of the performance of his or her duties.  GALs may also be required to perform such additional functions as may be directed by the court.  When determining whether to direct the GAL to perform additional functions, the court is required to have regard to the nature of the case and to consider whether directing the GAL to perform additional functions is necessary and in the best interests of the child.<br\/><br\/>Section 35E further provides that a GAL is independent in the performance of his or her functions and, in performing those functions, the GAL will regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.  The section explicitly provides that a GAL is not a party to the proceedings.  However, under subsection 11, the court may, where it is satisfied, having regard to the nature of the case, that it is necessary and in the best interests of the child and in the interests of justice to do so, order that the GAL shall have such party rights as it may specify.  The court may specify whether the exercise of these rights is for the entirety of the proceedings or in respect of particular issues in the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>Section 35F sets out the powers of a GAL and provides that a GAL is permitted to apply to the court to request that a report be obtained on any question affecting the welfare of the child.  A GAL may make an application where there is no existing report, or where there is a report but the information contained within it is out of date.  Before making an application to the court, the GAL is required to consult the parties to the proceedings, or the counsel or solicitor, if any, representing the parties.<br\/><br\/>Section 35G allows the GAL to make a request to Tusla for information relating to the welfare of the child which is necessary for the performance of his or her functions. Subject to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the Data Protection Act 2018, Tusla is obliged to comply with such a request.  In the event that the agency refuses to comply with a request from a GAL for information, the GAL may apply to the court for a determination on the dispute.<br\/><br\/>Section 35H specifies the circumstances in which an order appointing a GAL in either special care proceedings in the High Court, or proceedings in the District Court, ceases to have effect.  It further provides that where a child for whom a GAL has been appointed becomes a party to the proceedings, the court shall determine whether the order appointing the GAL ceases to have effect.<\/p> <p>Section 35I provides that the Minister will pay any reasonable costs or expenses incurred by a guardian<i>ad litem<\/i>while exercising his or her functions under this Bill on or after the relevant date.<br\/><br\/>Section 35J provides that the Minister may develop a regulatory framework for the purpose of ensuring that guardians <i>ad litem <\/i>are held to high professional standards when performing their functions under the Act.<br\/><br\/>Section 35K provides that the Minister may ask a GAL to provide information relating the guardian's functions, including information relating to the proceedings in which the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>has been appointed.  Subject to the general data protection regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018, a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is required to comply with such a request.  This provision allows for the appropriate management and supervision of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Section 35L provides that the Minister may issue an authorisation to those persons he or she considers appropriate to perform the functions of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  A person will not be considered as an appropriate person to perform the functions of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>unless he or she fulfils the requirements which are to be set out in regulations to be made under this section.  The regulations may prescribe matters such as the particular professions from which guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>may be authorised and the qualifications and minimum levels of professional experience required.  It is intended that guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>will be required to hold relevant qualifications in social work, social care, psychology or psychiatry, with at least five years' experience.<br\/><br\/>Section 35M provides that a person who has been authorised to act as a GAL<i><\/i>is required to notify the Minister in writing of any relevant matter which would affect his or her authorisation within the timeframe specified.  &ldquo;Relevant matter&rdquo; is defined as a criminal record within the meaning of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.<br\/><br\/>Section 35N sets out the circumstances in which the Minister may revoke the authorisation of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Section 35O sets out the circumstances in which a GAL<i><\/i>authorisation will cease to have effect.  It further provides that where a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>has been appointed for a child and his or her authorisation is due to expire before the conclusion of proceedings, the Minister has the discretion to extend the authorisation.<br\/><br\/>Section 35P provides that the Minister may enter into contracts for service and issue an authorisation with persons considered appropriate to perform the functions of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  This will enable the executive office to operate a panel of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>on contract.  While it is intended that the vast majority of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>will be directly employed by the executive office, this provision is intended to allow some flexibility.  It may, for example, be necessary to be used where a GAL needs to be appointed for a child who lives in a very remote area and no employed guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are available in that location.<br\/><br\/>Section 35Q sets out the transitional arrangements which will apply.  These arrangements will ensure that there is minimal disruption to ongoing childcare proceedings in which a GAL was appointed before the date on which this Bill comes into operation.<br\/><br\/>Section 8 makes consequential amendments to the principal Act in order to insert references to the new part on guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>which is proposed to be inserted by this Bill.<br\/><br\/>Section 9 amends section 71 of the Children Act 2001 for the purpose of inserting a reference to the new Part which is proposed to be inserted by this Bill.<br\/><br\/>Section 10 amends section 25 of the Mental Health Act 2001 by substituting a new subsection for the existing subsection 14.  The new subsection provides that in proceedings before the District Court relating to the involuntary detention of a child, the court must appoint a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>for that child and, furthermore, the GAL is entitled to both legal advice and legal representation for the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>Section 11 amends the National Vetting Bureau (Child and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 by inserting a reference to guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>into Schedule 1 to that Act.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure the provisions of the vetting legislation apply to guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Section 12 amends Schedule 2 to the Children First Act 2015, which sets out a list of mandated persons under that Act.  Its purpose is to ensure that guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>continue to be included in the list of persons who are obliged to make mandated reports to Tusla.<br\/><br\/>Section 13 is a standard provision that provides for the Short Title, collective citation and commencement of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Deputies will have noted that the Bill does not explicitly provide for the establishment of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>executive office.  Instead, it gives the Minister all the necessary powers, including regulation making powers, to establish the office.  It also provides for a transitional period in the first year of operation in order to ensure that there is a seamless transition from the current system to the new national guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service<br\/><br\/>Before I conclude, I draw the attention of Deputies to one final matter.  The Government wants to ensure that Ukrainian children have a right to access subsidised childcare services under the Childcare Support Act 2018 via the national childcare scheme, NCS.  Working with the Attorney General, we are considering whether this requires a small amendment to primary legislation.  I am mentioning this issue as, depending on what the advice is, I may need to bring an amendment to the Childcare Support Act on Committee Stage of this Bill.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of reform in this area is to regulate and expand the provision of GAL services in a consistent manner across the country.  The provisions of the Bill will enhance the rights of children and the capacity of the courts to make the right decisions in helping children and their families.<br\/><br\/>The Bill will help our legislation to better reflect the ideals of the thirty-first<sup><\/sup>amendment of the Constitution and, most important, it will put these ideals into practice in a very real manner in childcare proceedings.  Under this Bill, GAL provision will no longer be <i>ad hoc<\/i>and unregulated, but will instead be an organised service that will benefit children regardless of where they live in the country or where their case is heard.<br\/><br\/>This Bill covers a crucial section of much wider legislation, the Child Care Act 1991, which is currently under review in its entirety by my Department.  This reform also takes place against the backdrop of a much greater programme of change, namely, the planned creation of specialised family courts.  I look forward to bringing forward that significant amendment Bill to the Child Care Act 1991, probably in the next year, and I look forward to working with the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on progressing significant reforms and modernisation in that area.<br\/><br\/>I commend the good work that many guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>do across this country, supporting children in very vulnerable situations around public law childcare proceedings.  We are grateful for their support and work to create an even better service for all children in every part of the county.  I thank them and all the stakeholders who have contributed to the development of this Bill.  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to outline its provisions and I look forward to hearing Deputies' responses.  I also thank the joint committee for its very swift work in bringing forward its recommendations.  I commend the Bill to the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800038#OO00700","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651154700,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is good legislation.  The Minister outlined the <i>ad hoc<\/i>nature of the current system.  The work that guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>do is an important service.  Where it works well, it works really well.  However, we must always look at situations where it may not work well or is a little <i>ad hoc<\/i>.<\/p><p><i><\/i>I have a few questions that the Minister might answer in his response.  I welcome the presumption of the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  I see the point on the potential difficulty of a mandatory situation.  I strongly feel that there is not much point in a mandatory situation if it is not working well and is not fit for purpose.  In such circumstances, it becomes a tick-box exercise.  I know there is a presumption that a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>will be appointed.  Is an appeals mechanism available in cases where someone believes he or she should have been appointed a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>and none was appointed?<\/p><p>For me, the crucial element is the status of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  I am open to correction but I understand that guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are sometimes referred to in this legislation as &quot;witnesses&quot;.  Maybe that has been changed but it is important that the language makes clear that they are representatives because that is exactly what they are.  They represent the child's voice and it is really important that they do that, particularly for vulnerable children but also in general.  We have had a lot of discussion, particularly in the last few days, around language and its importance.  Last night, the House discussed the Birth Information and Tracing Bill.  It is important that they guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are referred to as representatives rather than witnesses.  As I said, I am open to correction in that regard.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs in the previous D&aacute;il which carried out pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, and I know some significant changes have been made to the legislation since then.  I will admit that it is a change that may have been made of which I am not aware.  Are guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>listed as representatives?  If not, can that be changed on Committee Stage?  It is important that guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are not relegated to the status of a witness, who have a much different status in court proceedings than someone who is a representative has.<\/p><p>I understand the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is currently entitled to access the full Tusla file.<\/p> <p>I notice there is reference to it possibly being able to apply to the court for a file or for a report.  However, are they not given that as an automatic right?  If not, is that something we could consider changing on Committee Stage?<br\/><br\/>The three key concerns are whether there is any sort of appeals process if a person feels he or she should be appointed a gaurdian <i>ad litem<\/i>, GAL, and has not been, the status of the GAL <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>whether he or she is a representative or a witness and then the matter of accessing the full Tusla file, as currently.  Maybe that is still going to be the case and the Minster is referring to potential additional information.  The Minister might clarify those two points when he responds.<br\/><br\/>In general, I welcome the Bill.  It is good.  As I said, we had it in the last D&aacute;il and it never progressed further so it is good to see it at this Stage.  It is important the area is regulated.  With anything relating to the voice of vulnerable children, it is important we have it 100% above board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800040#QQ00200","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651155300,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I hope it results in the proper regulation of guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>going forward.  These reforms should be of real benefit and should bring Ireland in line with best practice.  The work of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is vital.  They represent the voice of children in some very complex cases.  The voice of children in these cases cannot be lost and it is important their views are front and centre when considering a case that could potentially impact the next few years of a child&rsquo;s life.  I know from my own personal experience the key role GALs play.  Children build up excellent relationships with their GAL and there is a real sense of trust.  For many kids GALs are a stable and positive influence in their lives and the importance of that cannot be overstated.  With the passing of this Bill, GALs will now be properly regulated and this will ensure they are accountable on behalf of the children they represent.<\/p><p>The committee on children conducted pre-legislative scrutiny in February.  It had six recommendations and they need to be addressed in this Bill.  One recommendation was that a judge would have the ability to appoint specific GALs, especially where the GAL is already involved with siblings of the child.  This makes an awful lot of sense given the child will already be familiar with the GAL.  I hope the Minister takes that on board.  We need to ensure that the role of the GAL is adequately recognised by the courts and as pre-legislative scrutiny recommended, that needs to include the District Court.  Dr. Conor O&rsquo;Mahony spoke about this Bill in recent months and had concerns with the wording around the appointment of GALs.  He wanted the Bill to include an automatic entitlement to a GAL.  This was also a recommendation of the committee in its PLS report.  I hope this is something we can revisit on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I welcome sections 4 and 5 of the Bill which ensure the best interests of the child are paramount in considering any actions by the court and that the views of the child are properly heard while keeping in mind the child&rsquo;s age and maturity.  Section 7 relates to the regulation of GALs and is quite detailed.  It outlines the role of a GAL and the functions he or she needs to allow him or her act in a way he or she believes is in the best interests of the child.  This is all really welcome but it is important that the ability for a GAL to challenge proceedings is included and that the GAL has access to Tusla files relating to a child and is protected.<\/p><p>We need to ensure we get this Bill right and that the best interests of children are reflected in every area of it.  It has the potential to reform how the voice of a child is heard for years to come and ensure that the child is recognised and prioritised in court proceedings.  My colleague, Deputy Funchion, intends to amend parts of this Bill on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister can listen to the concerns that have been raised and that we can all work together to ensure the voice of the child is heard.  I hope we work together to make an impact that will really improve their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800041#RR00200","speaker":"1464"},{"type":"speech","time":1651155300,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I too am happy to speak on this Bill.  Like my party colleagues, I am happy to support it in general terms.  Guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>have at times been a source of public interest and contention when the eye-watering fees paid to a number of them were published.  For example, during 2018 guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>were paid &euro;8.44 million in fees by Tusla.  The legal fees they incurred amounted to a further &euro;6.21 million that year.  The guts of &euro;15 million is a lot of money by any standards.  In 2017 the Committee on Public Accounts heard the average GAL income was &euro;126,000 the previous year, with one GAL being paid almost &euro;250,000, which the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, correctly declared to be more than the President of Ireland.  The average GAL income of &euro;126,000 was based on 1,000 hours work, which was said to be two and a half times what similar practitioners in England, Scotland and Wales were getting.  I am glad to see the Minster is willing to address that here.  Then came the necessary reform of the law governing guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>in the Bill that fell with the dissolution of the previous D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>The current Bill sets out to reform the existing <i>ad hoc<\/i>GAL arrangements for children who are the subject of court proceedings.  A key aim of the Bill is to ensure the GAL informs the court of the views of the child where that child is deemed both capable and willing to express his or her views.  It also allows the GAL to make recommendations to the court on what is in the best interest of the child, after considering the child&rsquo;s view.  It also sets out to provide for mandatory GALs in all special care proceedings.<\/p><p>On the best-interest-of-the-child principle, I wish to broaden my remarks because this principle has become a kind of holy of holies that some people believe applies to all matters involving children in this State and of course, to our great discredit, it does not.  It must and it should.  In fact, in the broader State responsibilities, it is simply a mantra that allows for all the feels and statements about upholding the rights of children.  It is as if we are saying look at us and how great we are, but it is nothing more than optics.  This nonsense is why we have 732 children in special education without a designated school place last year and why we have children's spines turning into S bends while they await spinal surgery.  It is why we have children living in log cabins, on their granny&rsquo;s sofa, in a prefab or in the recent case of a child in my constituency, a caravan.  The child was afraid the caravan would blow away in one of the recent storms.  The Minister might therefore forgive me for noting much talk of the lauded and much-promoted best-interest-of-the-child principle is galling for those people who I hear and listen to every day.<\/p><p>The voice of the child is indeed critical and it must be heard.  In the context of the family law courts I am aware of a number of section 47 cases where the children told me their voices were not heard at all.  I welcome any move that strengthens this provision for our children involving the family courts.  While we welcome the Bill, we will be proposing a number of amendments on Committee Stage because it needs further strengthening.  For example, we want to ensure the role of the GAL is fully recognised in the eyes of the court and to ensure there will no watering down of GAL access to Tusla files.  We cannot hide behind GDPR on that.  GALs must have the information they need to give children the best voice, opportunity and protection to which they are entitled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800041#RR00300","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1651155300,"counter":553,"content":"<p>The need for reform of the law governing the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system is long overdue.

They advise the courts about the wishes and needs of young people and need to represent the interests of young people in the highly stressful atmosphere of a court.<\/p><p>The current Act, as the Minister mentioned, is over 30 years old and does not set out the qualifications required to act as a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  It does not set out the criteria for their appointment, nor does is it define their role or powers.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting this Bill.

Deputy Cronin previously mentioned that.<\/p> <p> In 2009, the Children Acts Advisory Board published guidance on the role, criteria for appointment, qualifications and training of GALs.

Tiglin provides a full holistic service for care leavers.  It has a warm and friendly person-centred approach which supports the educational, training, employment and social needs of residents and this will be offered to all.  Its aim is to empower each resident to achieve independence and to become a valued member of the local community.  I cannot speak highly enough of its work and I wish it every success.  However, it is scandalous that it receives no Tusla funding because Tusla believes there is not sufficient demand.  Tusla needs to revisit this decision because the number of care leavers I have assisted over the past two years would have filled this place twice over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800041#RR00400","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651155900,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I am glad to speak for the Labour Party in support of this important Bill and to welcome its introduction today.  As others have said, it is hugely important that we see regulation in place on the principle and the practice of GALs.  Indeed, this is a Bill that has had a long genesis.  The Minister alluded to that.  A previous iteration of it fell in 2020.  It is long overdue.<\/p>  <p>  I should say that I am somebody who, in practice as a barrister, represented GALs in quite a number of cases.  I came to know several GALs very well and was hugely impressed by the way in which they carried out their work and by the enormous merit of the GAL process.  All of us are conscious that GALs have been operating in an unsatisfactory legal context.  There was little set out in law on their role or functions, and yet the seasoned and experienced GALs with whom I worked performed hugely important work in a very traumatic context.<\/p>  <p>  The State exercises one of the most extreme forms of State power when it takes a child into State care and away from his or her parents, who are often themselves in deeply traumatic circumstances and contexts.  Obviously, huge issues have to be in place before the State would contemplate this.  In these scenarios, GALs often act as an important bridge between parents and social workers.  Indeed, they fulfil the important mechanism of conveying to the court what is in the child's best interests or, where the child is old enough, the child's own views.  They provided a way of expressing those views and the voice of the child to the court in the years even before we passed the referendum to insert Article 42A into the Constitution, which now requires the voice and the views of the child to be heard.  Therefore, GALs have been hugely important.<\/p>  <p>  In my experience, there has been greater concern in many child care proceedings where GALS have not been appointed.  This can make court proceedings more difficult and often more protracted.  I have seen GALs - sometimes this point is missed - perform a valuable function not only in the substantive conveying of the interests of the child and ensuring the child's interests are protected, but also in enabling the more efficient and effective functioning of child care courts.  It is a much better way for a judge to come to make a decision where he or she is presented with a report from an experienced GAL and where the GAL is intervening to assist in the making of very difficult decisions around care proceedings.  I say all of that not only to commend GALs but also to defend the system that is operating in spite of this legal vacuum without adequate legislative governance.  I welcome the new provisions that will give us for the first time a proper statutory framework for the exercise of GAL powers because these are weighty powers and proceedings where we are talking about children being taken into care.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that this is not the final stage in regulating the practice of GALs.  This morning, the Joint Committee on Gender Equality heard from the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, who discussed with us the new proposals around the family courts system in the context of measures to address the needs of survivors and victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  There is a real awareness among NGOs and any of us who have worked in the courts system of the current problems that arise where there is insufficient co-ordination between criminal courts and family courts.  I refer, for example, to circumstances in which domestic violence issues are before the criminal courts and at the same time there are parallel proceedings in the family courts involving private family matters around custody of and access to a child.  It is essential that there would be greater co-ordination in such circumstances.  We should have a family court system that can deal with all of these questions together in a unified and co-ordinated fashion that is in the best interests of the survivors of abuse but also, of course, of children who are involved in such proceedings.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that, as the Minister has said, there will be fuller legislation coming forward, not only on the basis of the review of the childcare legislation that is being carried out but also on the basis of the overall reform of the family court system.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has talked about family hubs.  In that context, it is worth mentioning one area where GALs are not involved.  In private family disputes, we have often extremely protracted, difficult and traumatic proceedings going on around contested custody, guardianship, care and access arrangements in respect of a child.  These are scenarios where many practitioners, judges, social workers and, indeed, parents might be of the view that it would be helpful to engage an independent impartial advocate for the child.  Judges may, of course, seek reports, such as private reports and written reports, on children's views but it is very different from the GAL process.  The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, has expressed concern that children in private family law cases may not be getting the same opportunity to have their views expressed in court as children who are represented by GALs.  Therefore, the question of extending a similar mechanism arises.  Ms Freda McKittrick of Barnardos, which, of course, runs the country's largest GAL service, has spoken about the need for a family court welfare service - a one-stop shop - which would allow families to access a range of services and thereby enable more joined-up co-ordination when there are a number of different issues before the courts dealing with one particular family.  This is part of the broader reform that the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and McEntee, have spoken about but it is an important context in which we are debating this particular legislation.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister stated, the legislation has been welcomed by NGOs and experts alike and there will be longer term arrangements made to ensure the establishment of the new executive office, and this legislation is enabling the Minister to do that.<\/p>  <p>  Looking back at our recommendations from the pre-legislative scrutiny from the joint Oireachtas committee, I will address a couple of those points.  Like Deputy Funchion, I was interested to hear what the Minister said about introducing a presumption rather than a mandatory appointment in all proceedings.  I take the Minister's point that it may be a better way to ensure the voice and views of the child are heard but we will need to consider that further on Committee Stage because the GAL should be, and normally is, the best way of expressing a child's view.  There may be cases, of course, where the child is an older teen and where that is not necessary.  The way the Minister has framed the legislation means that the presumption will be displaced where the court is satisfied that it can determine other means by which to facilitate the expression by the child of his or her views.  It may be necessary to spell out in a little more detail how that decision is to be made by a judge and that may be part of a broader reform involving more of an overarching family court welfare service.<\/p> <p>Another of the concerns the committee had and that we will need to address, perhaps on Committee Stage, is the appointment of a specific guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  Other speakers have raised this issue.  Where a guardian has been involved in respect of a child's siblings, for example, or has knowledge of a particular family, there should be a facility whereby the court can appoint that specific guardian.<br\/><br\/>The issue of the access of the guardian to information from Tusla was raised at the committee.  Section 35F gives the power to the court to order a report on the application by a guardian for same.  Section 35G gives the guardian the power to request information from Tusla.  I see there is a mechanism for the court to adjudicate when there is an issue about access to information.  My own experience, and this is self-evident, is that the guardian process is at its most effective when full information is provided and, indeed, that is the practice because without that, the guardian cannot give a full report, particularly if the child involved is very young.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Bill.  There is a lot of technical material in it that will be better dealt with on Committee Stage.  However, I repeat that the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>process, as it has evolved, has been significant in providing a better mechanism for children's interests to be represented before the court than any previous process.  We have, of course, become cognisant of the need to ensure there is better governance of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>and I welcome, therefore, the technical provisions around how to authorise guardians and the sorts of qualifications required.  I know a lot of the detail will be dealt with by ministerial regulation rather than via the primary legislation, as is appropriate.  It is also appropriate that we see clearer provisions around the appointment of legal representation to guardians because like the guardian practice itself, that has been <i>ad hoc <\/i>until now.  I have seen that myself.  It will be a welcome change to ensure we have proper regulation of all of these areas.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the legislation and commend those who are currently involved in providing the important services guardians <i>ad litem <\/i>provide.  I look forward to further debate and discussion on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800042#SS00200","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651156500,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill.  The Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2022 incorporates some welcome policies and provisions that have been a long time coming.  We are all glad this legislation is finally before us.<\/p><p>The Child Care Act 1991 is currently the primary legislation governing the welfare of children and young people in need of care and protection.  It provides for guardian or guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>appointments in care proceedings where children or young people are not party to the proceedings or where it is in the best interests of a child or young person, and in the interests of justice, to have a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>appointed.

In fact, the Act fails to outline how a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is appointed or how one even qualifies to become a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  In addition, the 1991 Act fails to outline the functions and powers of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>in proceedings.  My fundamental concern is that it does not support the 2012 children's referendum which the previous Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, former Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, brought before the people of Ireland and which I, like so many others, campaigned for in order to ensure the rights of children were strengthened and protected.  It is high time the 1991 Act was amended, as has been asked for by many people with direct experience of the system and organisations representing them, including the likes of Barnardos.<\/p><p>The courtroom is not a natural place for a child or young person to be.  It can be a scary and intimidating process to go through for an adult, never mind a child.  While the courts make great efforts to accommodate young people in a child-friendly manner, there is much room to improve.  Introducing this Bill will ensure that our legislation better acknowledges and maintains the rights of the child.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister and his Department for their commitment to addressing the disparities of guardians <i>ad litem <\/i>in the 1991 Act and I welcome this reform as it will be beneficial to all children and young people subject to care proceedings.  The welfare of the child is central to court proceedings and it must be.  The courts must regard the best interests of a child in all proceedings relating to care and protection, and I welcome the provision for courts to consider children's views, where they have chosen to express them, and to consider those views in light of a child's age and maturity, as well as any special circumstances or harm that the child is, or potentially could be, suffering from.  That is important.  It is fundamental that the court considers the child's environment and gives weight to any views expressed by that child.  It is necessary that a child's views are heard and that a court must determine the best method for a child to be accommodated in expressing his or her views.<\/p><p>I am pleased to see that provisions have been made for the mandatory appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to replace the previous <i>ad hoc<\/i>nature of the appointment and, principally, to extend and regulate the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system so that it benefits the greatest possible number of children and young people.  It will provide high-quality service to children and young people in care proceedings and as public representatives, all of us must listen to and respect the views of children and young people.  We have a duty to serve them as well as those who vote for us.<\/p><p>This Bill has great potential to transform the 1991 Act.  We must legislate for a system that is adequate, modern and fit for purpose.  We must create flexible and adaptable legislation because society flexes and adapts.  Society continues to change and to hold different principles and perspectives.<\/p><p>The best interests of children must always be at the core of any decision-making affecting them.  The best support must be granted to every child requiring representation.  Each child will be affected by a court's decision and so I welcome the provisions in this Bill and look forward to seeing it progress and improving the court process for young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800043#TT00200","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1651156500,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Reform of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system is welcome.  It is an issue with which I have dealt over the years.  I have engaged with youngsters and guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>who represented particular children.<\/p><p>Guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are important in childcare cases; there is no doubt about that.  Their role is to convey the voice of the child to a judge to ensure the child's own opinion is heard regarding his or her welfare.  That is essential.  The age of the child will matter in that regard but the ability to listen and understand what the child requires is important.  Guardians <i>ad litem <\/i>have the option to form their own view about what they think would be in the interests of the child and that does not always match up with the opinions of the child.  It is incredibly important to have an expert in these situations who can truly listen to a child and make him or her feel heard and included in these procedures.  It is important that children understand the procedures and how decisions will be made on their behalf.  Guardians <i>ad litem <\/i>need to have emotional objectivity.  That is also important.  <\/p><p>There are approximately 6,000 children currently in the care of the State.  I did not hear all of the debate so this may have been said already, but in childcare cases, it is currently up to the individual judge as to whether a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is appointed and the frequency varies by region.  As the Minister is aware, a study on childcare proceeding in three counties between 2011 and 2015 found there was complete inconsistency in the appointment of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  In one county, it was the exception rather than the norm, while in another, they were appointed in the majority of cases.  The Child Care Law Reporting Project 2013-2014, which collected data on 486 childcare proceedings, found that guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>were appointed in only 18% of cases in Clonmel and 80% of cases in Dundalk.  Guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>were more likely to be appointed in Dublin than in most other cities, with 68% of cases having guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  There may be other factors relating to courts that influence those figures but it is important to know that there are differences in the frequency with which guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are appointed.  It is essential that we remove any kind of postcode lottery in these proceedings.  Children should get the same standard of care in court proceedings in Clonmel as they do in Dundalk, Dublin or anywhere else.<\/p> <p>There is no definitive published information relating to the frequency of the appointment of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>in public childcare cases.  This issue is not unique to childcare.  We are not very good at collecting data and the absence of those key data makes it difficult to estimate what the demand for the service will be.  This legislation makes a welcome shift towards presuming guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>will be appointed in all cases, with some exceptions.  I recognise the need for exceptions.  There will of course be cases where the services of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are not needed, but I wonder whether the exceptions are a little too broad.  We have seen the interpretations by judges.  Section 35B refers to where &ldquo;the court is satisfied ... that the best interests of the child can be determined without such appointment being made&quot;.  I could foresee a situation where a judge would make that judgment call and presume it should be the exception when that is not the case.  I am concerned that that provision is a little too open.  Given that the current allocation of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>fluctuates massively, we need to make sure that discretion is not misunderstood.<br\/><br\/>The Child Care Law Reporting Project recorded 1,194 District Court childcare cases between December 2012 and 2015.  While we can only guess how many of these cases would have required a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>under the conditions outlined in this Bill, it raises some alarm bells about the capacity of the system.  The latest estimate I have seen for the number of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>in the State comes from a 2015 report, which stated that there were only 65 in the country.  One would have to wonder about caseloads.  We are deplorable at enacting legislation and not considering its impact on resources, or not pre-empting the requirements with training and so on.  Does the Minister have an update on the number of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>in the State?  Does he have any estimate of the capacity that will be required?  Unless that number has increased significantly, it is clear there will be a need for a recruitment drive and training processes if the legislation is to be meaningful from the get-go.<br\/><br\/>This Bill allows the Minister to set out the requirements to qualify as a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, which were not set out in previous legislation.  Setting out this detail clearly will be very welcome, but I have some concerns about previous proposals that guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>must have a qualification in social work.  While social work qualifications would be incredibly advantageous for this role, we only have so many social workers in the country.  We already know about the caseloads in Tusla.  Very often, the workload is just not manageable.  Social workers become burned out but it also results in queues and that is not satisfactory for anyone.  Assuming guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>will be required to have a number of years' experience in the sector, I foresee a danger that we will lose badly needed front-line people in the child protection area, particularly social workers.  There will be very tough cases and cases that are not so tough and they may well fall into the latter category.  We need to ensure the preventative side of child protection is not weakened as a result of a recruitment drive for guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>It is not clear to me why there is no legal provision for the appointment of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>in private family law cases.  These cases often require written reports on the child&rsquo;s view.  Again, there seems to be very little data about exactly what is happening in practice and how well this system is working for children in that context.  If we have come to the rightful conclusion that guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are necessary in childcare cases from a children&rsquo;s rights perspective, it seems a bit out of step to make a distinction when it comes to private family law cases.  Was this looked at when the Bill was being developed?  If so, I ask the Minister to outline the reasoning for not including it in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Overall, setting up a national agency for guardians <i>ad litem <\/i>is incredibly welcome.  While there are some guidelines for guardians currently, there is no oversight or monitoring so this agency is obviously very welcome and much needed.  In light of the Kerry CAMHS case and countless others, we need to ensure services for children and vulnerable people have strong governance and oversight structures.  This Bill is a part of a wider range of reforms we need in the family court system, where we need to ensure a truly child-centred system is put in place.  I welcome that we are dealing with this Bill.  I remember speaking on something like this in 2016 or 2017.  It seems to have taken a very long time to get to this point but it is welcome that we have got here.  I ask the Minister to respond to the points I have made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800043#TT00300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651157100,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I have spoken to guardians this week and they told me how delighted they are to see this legislation being brought back better in this D&aacute;il term.  As previous speakers said, this seems to have been going on for years and it is good that this legislation will soon be passed in this D&aacute;il.  I see the changes the Minister has made.  I know he made them because he listened to stakeholders but, most important, he has listened to children on this - the children who never have a voice.<\/p>  <p>  Our current guardian system has huge issues.  One issue we have been aware of is that some guardians can earn much more than others depending on where they are.  For example, depending on the District Court area, children can be represented in court by a guardian in 90% of cases but in another area it might only be in 10% of cases.  This is unacceptable and for this reason, I support the proposal that within District Courts judges shall appoint a guardian unless two criteria are met.  Hopefully, this will go some way towards addressing the significant differences in the use of guardians in District Courts in Ireland.  It is important that there be a greater degree of consistency in the appointment of guardians across the State.  Children cannot continue to be better represented in one area than another.  We must have equality across the State.<\/p>  <p>  While I am hugely supportive of giving children better representation in these cases, I have concerns and I believe there are opportunities to improve and strengthen the legislation.  There is still an imbalance whereby parents and Tusla are parties to proceedings and represented by lawyers, while the child is not a party despite the proceedings being focused on the child&rsquo;s safety, welfare and development.  It is unfortunate that the opportunity has not been taken to place the status of the child in these proceedings on a par with parents and Tusla.  Section 35D provides legal advice and representation to guardians but this would not be needed if they were put on the same ground as parents and the State.  Guardians should, on behalf of the child, have the same ability as the other stakeholders to inquire of the court, to challenge something important for the child's interest in the course of the proceedings and, where necessary, to make an application to the court.  This is especially important considering the acceptance in the Bill of the need for guardians to make recommendations in the best interests of children in cases where the children are unable, for whatever reason, to express their views directly.<\/p>  <p>  Given that many children going into care are very young, non-verbal or struggle to communicate, I would go further and suggest we need to ensure guardians have a wide range of expertise, especially as we now live in a changed Ireland where we must have sensitivity around cultures, traditions and languages, in cases where English is not the child's first language.  There is a lot of noise in these cases and it is the judge's job to separate this out.  A guardian having equal footing with the parent's representative and the State representative is in the best interest of the child.  A judge should be able to request the appointment of a named guardian in specific circumstances where particular expertise is required, such as a translator or someone with cultural expertise or where a guardian is already involved with the siblings of a child.  The Minister might take these matters into consideration for the next Stages of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800044#UU00200","speaker":"1511"}]
