Every pharmacy is legally required to have a qualified pharmacist on the premises for filling prescriptions and so forth.  The main issue the pharmacy owners raised with me is the crazy bidding war that now takes place when they seek locum cover.  Many pharmacy owners are forced to use a website called Clarity Locums to book a locum pharmacist.  Last minute bookings through this site can see hourly rates rise to &euro;150 per hour.  One person I spoke to was paying &euro;149 per hour.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is so lucrative that many pharmacists are walking away from full-time jobs and working as locums.  They see far greater financial outcomes from that.<\/p><p>This is absolutely unsustainable and these practices further inflate the crisis facing the sector.  We need to see the Department intervening here.  There are four different areas where I will suggest action but the Department must take concrete and targeted steps to support the industry.  I know now of pharmacies that have been forced to reduce their opening hours because of a lack of available pharmacists or the sky-high hourly rates that must be paid.  Pharmacies are an essential public service and so many people right around the country in our local communities rely on them.  We must support that service.<\/p><p>We must see action by the Department to aid recruitment into the sector.  It is my understanding that many non-EU pharmacists cannot work in Ireland because their pharmacy degrees are not recognised here.  They need to study for a further year to 18 months in order to register as a pharmacist.  I know the Minister of State is doing much excellent work in supporting Ukrainian refugees coming here and many of these are very highly qualified people in the area of health, pharmacy, medicine, etc.  I honestly believe there should be a derogation for those who are qualified and come here.<\/p><p>It is possible to declare retail pharmacy as a critical skill shortage.  I read a report that the UK Home Office did in March this year on speeding up the process of registering EU and non-EU pharmacists.  It is something we must definitely do because the process here is very cumbersome.  Retail pharmacies could also be allowed to sell non-prescription medication without the presence of a pharmacist.  Otherwise we will see pharmacies closing early or not being open for bank holiday weekends or even ordinary weekends, as they are now.<\/p><p>In the longer term, we must have an increase in the number of Irish university places for the pharmacy sector.  Currently, there are only 240 per year and we have been outsourcing pharmacy education to the UK and other areas.  They are now having problems with recruitment as well.  We must also have a new pathway for experienced pharmacy technicians to become fully qualified.  That should be considered.  There are a number of areas here and the issue crosses higher education and retail.  That is the crux of the matter.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#A00500","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.<\/p> <p>The Minister is fully committed to any and all actions, underpinned by meaningful engagement, that might mitigate any challenges arising in the context of health workforce availability.  The Senator has outlined the various challenges affecting pharmacies in particular, which are an essential service.  Pharmacists are required on-site at all times to provide the service.  I am taken aback to hear of a bidding war for locums and the rates being paid.  It would be far more lucrative to be on the WhatsApp group panel than having a full-time job from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.<\/p> <p>The invaluable contribution of the pharmacy sector and professional pharmacists over the last two years in an extremely challenging environment reinforced the importance of pharmacists in the healthcare system as a whole and the contribution made to patient and public health on a daily basis.  The regulation of pharmacists in Ireland is provided for under the Pharmacy Act 2007, and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, is charged with carrying out this role.  The oversight and governance of the regulator is a matter for the Department of Health and my officials have engaged on the matter raised.<\/p> <p>It is the Minister's understanding that the regulator is cognisant of reports of challenges that may be emerging in the availability of a pharmacist workforce.  The PSI's corporate strategy for 2021 to 2023 contains an action for the PSI to \"take steps to identify and mitigate risks to the continued availability of the professional pharmacist workforce, particularly within the community pharmacy sector\".  This has materialised as the PSI's Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce project, which is a multi-annual project due to run across 2022 and 2023.<\/p> <p>In the PSI&rsquo;s 2022 service plan, the project is set to \"assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland\", with this work currently at the scoping and planning stage.  The Senator identified the issue and we cannot stand back.  This process must be expedited.  The PSI is to convene an expert stakeholder advisory group to advise and inform at key phases throughout the course of the project as to the key risks which are affecting and could affect the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce.  It will also make an input into proposed strategies to address these.  It is expected that proposals for the necessary next steps will be brought to the PSI council by the end of 2022.<\/p> <p>That would be a welcome opportunity for the PSI to identify the gaps outlined by the Senator, including shortfalls in university places and opportunities for a technician to upskill.  Perhaps that is something we can consider within higher education or the apprenticeship model.  Ultimately, a pharmacist is legally required to be on-site and the doors cannot open otherwise.  We do not want pharmacies closing in rural towns and villages because they cannot get a workforce.  We certainly do not want people leaving hospital settings to be on a particular panel where they can choose their own hours and where to work.<\/p> <p>The Senator has provided a shortcut for the PSI.  The stakeholder group could start working as soon as possible.  Perhaps it could lead to us having a proper plan even for next year's school setting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#B00200","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

This is a crisis and if the Government does not act, we will see community pharmacies cutting hours and not being open at crucial times.

His colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has quite correctly described Yemen as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.  It is one I have regularly raised in the House.  Since 2015 a brutal war has been prosecuted on the Yemeni people by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  The death toll around the crisis is truly shocking.  A total of 377,000 Yemenis have died due to direct and indirect causes of war.  A minimum of 10,000 children have died since 2015.  A total of 4 million Yemenis have been displaced by the war, 79% of whom are women and children.  A total of 21 million Yemenis are in dire need of humanitarian assistance, including 5 million on the brink of famine.<\/p> <p>Saudi Arabia has also enforced a criminal blockade, thus preventing vital aid reaching more than 80% of the Yemeni population that depend on it.  Every ten minutes a Yemeni child dies due to the cruel blockade.  A total of 400,000 Yemeni children are at risk of dying according to the director of the UN World Food Programme.  The Minister of State knows the Saudi regime decapitates gay people and dissidents, brutalises women and provides, in the words of Hilary Clinton, clandestine financial and logistical support to terrorists.  This is the regime that chopped a journalist into pieces in a foreign embassy and incinerated Yemeni children travelling on a school bus on their way back from a picnic.<\/p> <p>I have parsed previous statements by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and they have been carefully worded.  There has never been a call for sanctions despite the horrendous actions of the Saudi and UAE governments.  What really worries me is that to date I cannot see one statement from the Government explicitly condemning the Saudi dictatorship for its war of terror on Yemen.  I am hopeful the Minister of State will change this today with a very clear condemnation.<\/p> <p>Then there is the issue of arms sales to Saudi Arabia by the US, Britain and EU countries.  In a debate in the Seanad a few years back, the Government went as far as acknowledging that arms sales are prolonging the war in Yemen.  Recently, the Minister for Foreign Affairs came out with a much weaker statement.  When asked about EU allies selling weapons to the murderous Saudi regime, the Minister said arms exports are a national competence of the EU and it is for each state to make this assessment as a national competence.  It is an absolutely disgraceful abdication of a responsibility to condemn the arms sales to this heinous dictatorship.  BAE Systems has sold &pound;17.3 billion worth of military equipment since 2015.  Does the Minister of State really have nothing to say about this?  What will he say about it this morning?<\/p> <p>It is not enough for the Government to say how awful the conflict is.  We need to take responsibility.  We have a seat on the UN Security Council.  Unfortunately the Government's stance is even worse than I have described.  Two weeks ago, the Government sent a Minister of State to Saudi Arabia to tout for more business.  At that time the regime was just preparing to engage in a series of executions.  There were 81 executions in one day.  We sent a Minister of State to tout for more business even as Saudi Arabia was continuing to bomb the people of Yemen, as it continues to do today.<\/p> <p>There is the disgraceful ongoing gift of Shannon Airport by the Government to assist in the ongoing prosecution of this war.  At a meeting in the audiovisual room two weeks ago, we were told that every US military adviser helping to train Saudi pilots to drop those bombs on the Yemeni population has come through Shannon.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State make a clear condemnation of Saudi Arabia for its war on the Yemeni population?  Will he make a clear call to the Saudi dictatorship to lift the blockade?  Will he condemn arms sales by members of the EU, Britain and the US to Saudi Arabia and the UAE?  Will he call for an arms embargo on these countries?  Will he use our seat the UN Security Council to take a clear stance for peace?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#C00100","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The situation in Yemen is one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, driven by seven years of conflict, economic collapse and the breakdown of public institutions and services which has left millions of people in need of humanitarian assistance.

Ireland also welcomes the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative to host talks on Yemen and strongly encourages all parties to engage meaningfully with these efforts.<\/p> <p>As a member of the Security Council, Ireland has engaged extensively in support of the UN's efforts.

He has also highlighted the need to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid to all people in need.<\/p> <p>Developments on the ground in recent months have been deeply concerning.

I appreciate his being here.  I know this is not his area of specialty as a Minister of State.<\/p> <p>The aviation industry and the hospitality sector have been decimated in the past two years.  I welcome the opportunity with this Commencement matter to raise the need for an aviation and hospitality tourism recovery task force strategy.  My Commencement matter is timely as the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation published data just this morning which show comparisons with 2019, three years ago.  Hotel occupancy in February of this year was 57% that of 2019.  The number of inbound tourists from North America was down 48%, or 44,000, from 2019.  Most worrying is that the number of tourists from Great Britain was down 40%, or 152,000, on the figure for 2019, with the number from the rest of the world down 52% and the number from continental Europe down 35%.<\/p> <p>I think everybody in the aviation, hospitality and tourism sectors recognises and would commend the Government on the supports given.  The summer of 2022 is now already set in respect of our aviation sector.  We have a lot of air capacity, with seats and routes to and from Ireland reintroduced.  The potential for tourism numbers to grow this summer is quite good.  I am told the increase will be 70% or thereabouts on the 2019 level.<\/p> <p>However, there are challenges.  As the Minister of State will know, we are an island nation depending primarily on our aviation sector for connectivity.  Inbound passenger numbers to our main airports are significantly down, by almost a third.  As I said, we are on the cusp of summer 2022, whereby everything is set in respect of seats and sails.<\/p> <p>My ask, including of the Government, is for a long-term vision and strategy for 2023 and beyond, whereby we continue to support the aviation sector and our tourism and hospitality industry.  It is important that airports and airlines work together collaboratively to regrow and re-establish our connectivity.  The fundamental question that I ask the Government is how we will grow our connectivity.  A recovery strategy for aviation, tourism and hospitality is needed.  It is critical that we work with all stakeholders to have a roadmap for the future in terms of rebuilding connectivity and looking at the challenges we face as we emerge from Covid.  Unfortunately, we have the horrific war in Ukraine, which we all condemn, and we stand with the Ukrainian people.  That is having an impact on us in terms of inflation, labour shortages and fuel prices.<\/p> <p>The airline industry and market have changed substantially.  I hope we will look at the aviation sector.  Stobart Air has gone.  Aer Lingus is operating fewer routes on short-haul flights, which has a profound impact on airports such as Cork, for example.  The strong supports given by the Government must be sustained to support our aviation and tourism travel industry.  Some 23 cent in every euro of tourism spend is kept in the country.  A defined aviation and tourism recovery strategy for 2023 and beyond is needed as we emerge from the biggest crisis we have had, namely Covid, and, unfortunately, now a war, which, again, we all condemn.<\/p> <p>I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.  I appreciate that this is not his area and I thank him for being here this morning.

On behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, I welcome the opportunity to discuss this topic with Members of the House.<\/p> <p>It is well acknowledged that Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on the aviation industry, not just in Ireland but globally.  In 2020, the number of passengers handled in our main airports fell by a staggering 78% on 2019 levels.  In 2021, passenger figures across the State were down 76% on 2019.  In the interest of public health, certain travel restrictions and public health measures were introduced by the Government.  Arrivals into Ireland were subject to a range of health-related requirements which had the effect of restricting passenger traffic.  Possibly the most extreme requirement was mandatory hotel quarantine, which for certain travellers was introduced in March of 2021 and ran until September 2021.  Legislation permitting its reintroduction was introduced in December 2021, as were additional entry requirements due to the emergence of the Omicron variant.  The Government was always clear that such measures would remain in place only as long as absolutely necessary.  As of 6 March this year, there are no Covid-related requirements for entering the State.<\/p> <p>During the pandemic, two aviation recovery plans were drafted, one by the aviation recovery task force appointed by the Minister and another by the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, a standing body that brings together key aviation stakeholders in the State.  While the constantly evolving epidemiological situation made implementing some recommendations challenging, most of the recommendations of the aviation recovery task force were implemented in some way.<\/p> <p>The forum plan, published in April 2021, contained recommendations that the forum believed best provided for the restart and recovery of the aviation sector in Ireland.  The recommendations spanned policy areas across government and required engagement across several Departments, which was undertaken by the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.  The Minister of State also engaged with forum stakeholders on the steps necessary to ensure operational readiness when international travel resumed at scale.  This plan helped pave the way for the Government's decision to reopen non-essential international travel on 19 July last year.<\/p> <p>Throughout the pandemic, the aviation sector availed of the considerable suite of economy-wide support measures, particularly the wage subsidy scheme.  It is estimated that these horizontal supports totalled more than &euro;360 million by the end of 2021.  Additionally, over &euro;160 million in aviation-specific supports was allocated to Irish airports during 2021, including &euro;116 million under a Covid supplementary support scheme.  This European Commission-approved state aid put our State airports in funds to allow them greater flexibility to roll out route and other incentives.  Without this support, these airports would not have been in a position to incentivise the recovery to the same extent.  It is expected that this funding will support the restoration of international connectivity, evidence of which we are beginning to witness.<\/p> <p>Summer 2022, as the Senator remarked, is expected to mark the turning point for aviation.  A considerable number of new routes have been announced from Dublin and transatlantic services from Shannon recommenced earlier this month.

Tourism is our largest indigenous employer, responsible for over 265,000 jobs.  As I said, 23 cent in every euro of spend directly related to tourism returns to the Exchequer.

Ireland's traffic levels are reported as slightly higher than this average.  Air traffic remains lower than EUROCONTROL's previously estimated recovery forecast, largely due to the emergence of the Omicron variant last year.  This would serve to highlight the fragility of the recovery.  We remain mindful of the possibility that a variant of concern might again frustrate the restoration of aviation.<\/p> <p>Also of concern is the impact of rising fuel costs on air travel.

It has been ongoing for some time and I have raised it in the House on a number of occasions.  A group in my area called SOS Dublin Bay, made up primarily of sea swimmers, is concerned about the quality of water in Dublin Bay and has raised this issue with me on a number of occasions.  The group has written to the offices of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and has had meetings.  We are coming up on the anniversary of a meeting on 23 June last year on this issue.<\/p> <p>The group's concern relates to this country's compliance with the EU bathing water directive and its Irish counterpart transposed into Irish legislation, the 2008 bathing water quality regulations.  It is concerned that we are not doing enough to comply with the directive or, on a very simple level, to provide peace of mind to people who are swimming in the waters around Ireland and in the rivers and lakes within Ireland.  SOS Dublin Bay and I are specifically concerned with the quality of bathing water in Dublin Bay.<\/p> <p>The European directive dates back to the 1970s.  The original one was in 1976 and it was updated in 2006.  It has made considerable progress throughout the European Union in terms of achieving much higher bathing water quality in rivers, lakes and coastal areas.  That is to be commended.  We have also made progress in that regard in Ireland but not enough.  The reality is that sea, river and lake swimming has become a much bigger exercise now than it was even a few years ago.  During the pandemic and the restrictions, many people availed of an amenity on their doorstep and used it in a very healthy way by swimming in the sea, lakes or rivers.  That is also to be commended.  It is a very good thing that people swim in the sea.  It does one good, as well as everything else.  However, people should be entitled to enjoy it with peace of mind.<\/p> <p>The directive that exists since 2006 requires samplings to be conducted at least four times per season and no more than one month apart.  It puts the sample results, in the context of particular bacteria, into four categories; poor, sufficient, good and excellent.  I am happy to say that recent tests in Dublin Bay have all been excellent and that is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>The difficulty is in a number of areas.  The sample results are not always excellent.  It takes time for the result of the sampling to get into the public domain.  People may find themselves swimming in water that is poor or insufficient for a long time - days - before they realise it is of poor quality.  Difficulty also arises in respect of the regulations passed here in Ireland.  Regulation 2 defines the bathing season in any year as the period of 1 June to 15 September in that year.  That definition is incredibly restrictive and means we are only required to carry out monitoring under the directive during that short period.  That should be changed, especially in light of the fact that people are now using seawater, river water and lake water all year round to swim.  People are swimming not just between 1 June and 15 September but today, yesterday, tomorrow, Christmas Day and all through the winter.<\/p> <p>People are swimming at the Forty Foot, Seapoint, Hawk Cliff, Blackrock, Sandycove and all the other coastal, river and lake points throughout the country.  That is happening but we have prohibited local authorities from expanding the definition of the bathing season to include the whole year.  Their obligations are restricted to that much shorter period.  We are not in compliance with the directive in that regard and are at risk of facing a complaint to the European Commission regarding our failure to comply with the rules under the directive.<\/p> <p>I know this issue has been raised with the Minister and there is a commitment to change it but it has not happened.  We are coming up on a year since a meeting that took place between SOS Dublin Bay and the Minister and nothing has happened during that time.  It is not a difficult drafting change to make.  It would be easy for the Minister to do with the stroke of a pen.  When will it happen?  Can the Minister of State satisfy me that we are in full compliance with the bathing water directive?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#E00400","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue, which I will answer on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I was pleased to see continued improvements in the quality of our bathing waters, especially those that meet or exceed the minimum water quality requirements, in the Bathing Water Quality in Ireland 2020 report published by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  The EPA reports that 96% of bathing waters met or exceeded the minimum required standard, up from 95% in 2019.  I look forward to seeing further improvement in the EPA's 2021 bathing quality report, which is due to be published in May of this year.

To protect bathers' health and ensure the public have access to bathing water amenities, it is important that the network of bathing waters is strengthened and enhanced and we continue to see new beaches identified each year.<\/p> <p>The European Commission reviews the implementation of the bathing water directive by member states, with the last review undertaken in 2018.  This review found that Ireland is fundamentally in line with the provisions of the directive.

The report concluded that Ireland offers several good practices to demonstrate how the directive can be effectively implemented in practice.<\/p> <p>The bathing season under the bathing water regulations is from 1 June to 15 September each year.  Recently, some swimming groups have expressed an interest in having a longer bathing season in some areas.  In response, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has met with stakeholders and has asked the national bathing water expert group, chaired by officials in his Department, to consider the matter and make recommendations on how best to protect bathers' health outside of the current bathing water season and what additional measures may be necessary.<\/p> <p>The expert group has developed a questionnaire for the public and one for local authorities to determine who is bathing during the winter months, where this bathing is occurring and the expectations of winter bathers.

Many more Irish heroes also played a role in the Greek cause, such as Sir Hudson Lowe from Galway, Edward Blaqui&egrave;re, a romantic Dublin seaman of Huguenot descent, and Charles James Napier from Celbridge, County Kildare.<\/p><p>There are long and profound connections between Ireland and Greece.

There is no doubt that there are a great many challenges while our Defence Forces are faced with missions at home and overseas.

That is something we have to be extremely vigilant about.  We have seen ten-year-old children sent to relatives with notes on their hands.  They are travelling alone by train.  I have a particular fear for young girls travelling alone.  In the train stations in Poland, people can volunteer to take refugees to anywhere in Europe.  One finds people standing there with signs offering free trips to Germany, France or wherever.  The Poles are doing a fantastic job but that does not mean there will not be an oddball in the pile every now and then.  We need to be extremely vigilant in that area with regard to young people coming into this country.  If there are young men or young women arriving with people who do not appear to be their relatives, we need to be very careful.  I compliment the Irish people but I advise caution with regard to the rush to provide accommodation and so on.  It is a long-term commitment.

The Government will continue to assess this situation, as it always has done.  In the medium term, the Government is working hard to deliver schemes that support home energy efficiency.  I know it is a bit of a clich&eacute; to say that the cheapest energy is the energy we do not use but many of my fellow public representatives seem to be ignoring this.  The national retrofit scheme, for example, provides for 80% grant aid towards some very simple measures to insulate homes while grants of up to 100% are available to those in receipt of fuel allowances.  This is one simple step and something we all could and should do.  Any public representative who is not championing these schemes is not serving his or her constituents.  Perhaps it is easier to say that it will not work than to actually try it.  In the long term, this Government knows there is a great need to ramp up the generation of renewable energy.  This week, we gave the green light for some major offshore wind energy projects.  With applications expected by the end of the year, the first turbines could be producing electricity in 2026. <\/p> <p>Necessity is the mother of invention and this is a time for invention and for looking forward to innovation rather than backwards to business as usual.  There are many more proactive ways to deal with this issue.  If people are not sure where to start, I ask them to please give my office a call.  It is past time for some of our public representatives to get their heads out of the peat and to start thinking about the generation that will come after us because that generation is well aware of the solutions to this crisis.  I was recently contacted by a student from Oaklands Community College in Edenderry who had done a project on how the use of turf for home heating is perceived.  His call to action was for the Government to raise awareness of the need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.  Turf plays a role in that.  For the students in his school, this is a real crisis.  They will be the ones to deal with the consequences.  We must not unpick good environmental policy for short-term gain.  Our generation owes it to the next generation to maintain forward momentum on climate action.  One crisis cannot be used to add to another.  I call on my fellow public representatives to pull forward together and think outside the bog.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#J00300","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom &aacute;bhar iontach t&aacute;bhachtach a ard&uacute; ar maidin.  As Senator O'Loughlin has referred to, last night, the British House of Commons voted to effectively introduce a hard border for some people travelling from the South into the North of Ireland.  The Deputy Leader will know that this is an issue I have been raising concerns about in the Seanad for a period of weeks, if not months.  I have been highlighting the very real dangers of this particular legislation.  From a political perspective, I find the intent behind the Nationality and Borders Bill quite repugnant but, nevertheless, I choose to focus on this issue because it has direct implications for citizens here.<\/p> <p>I will refer to some of the concerns.  In the first instance, there is a concern that pertains to people from the Leas-Chathaoirleach's own county of Cavan.  I refer to people who have come there to live and work or even just to visit and who want to move just a short bit up the road, whether for tourism, work, study or shopping or to see a doctor.  The outworking of this legislation is that such people will have to apply for an electronic travel authorisation.  I am fully aware of the Deputy Leader's investment in this issue.  When we committed to the withdrawal agreement, we did not say that there would be no hard border for some people but that there would be for others.  We were very clear in our intent and understanding.  <\/p> <p>One of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement is the all-Ireland bodies.  Tourism Ireland is one of these bodies.  It works internationally to promote Ireland as one unit as a tourism destination.  With the outworking of this legislation, we will see non-Irish and non-British EU citizens coming to this jurisdiction and wishing to visit the North to see the iconic Giant's Causeway, to visit Derry or to see Titanic Belfast having to apply for an electronic waiver.  How does that sit within the context of an all-Ireland body that arises from the Good Friday Agreement?<\/p> <p>Last week, we saw another invitation extended to the US President, Joe Biden, who is an Irish-American very proud of his Irish heritage.  If he leads a delegation here including Congressman Richard Neal and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, all of whom have been steadfast in ensuring that there would be no diminution of rights and no threat to the Good Friday Agreement, will they have to apply for an electronic travel authorisation if they want to go up the road?  This is quite stark.  It may not impact on us but the intent behind this move is quite devastating for the people it will impact upon.  We need to hear more from the Irish Government than that it raised the matter with the British Government and was ignored.  We have to do much better than that.  We have to call on all of our diplomatic wherewithal and might.  I am not really sure what we can do at this stage because the legislation is going through Westminster and has passed, but we need to do something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#J00400","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I will first join with my colleague in congratulating Cross and Passion College in Kilcullen on becoming the first attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, friendly school in Ireland.

It is a very significant day for it and one we should all acknowledge.<\/p><p>I want to raise an item I have raised before.  The housing aid and housing adaption grants, along with the mobility grants, offered by local authorities can be life changing and can ensure many of our older population can continue to live in their homes in comfort.  However, I am increasingly getting worrying calls from applicants that they simply cannot afford to proceed with these grants given the rising building costs and the limits on possible payments on these grants through the application process.  When I raised this previously, I was informed that a review of the process was under way and the amount and criteria of these grants would be reviewed.  Unfortunately, I have not seen or heard of any update on them in the interim.  I now have a growing list of people who simply cannot afford to proceed with their grant offer, and in some cases, the only avenue open to families to consider is long-term care for their loved one.  The review of these grants cannot happen quickly enough.  There is a standstill on so many of them.  I would appreciate if the Deputy Leader could contact the Minister to seek an update on them and find out where that review is at this time.<\/p><p>I also raise the issue of mask wearing, which was raised by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO.  It called for the reintroduction of mandatory mask wearing following almost 24,000 new cases confirmed yesterday evening, following on from almost 64,000 confirmed cases over the bank holiday weekend.  Last night and this morning I received calls that up to eight ambulances were parked outside my local hospital, Naas General Hospital, in Kildare.  The accident and emergency department was full, with many of those inside actually on chairs.  It can only be imagined the pressure the staff are under in that hospital, having to deal with such high numbers.  I am sure these scenes are being replicated in other hospitals.  I listened to the T&aacute;naiste reply to my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, when he raised the call by the INMO yesterday in the Lower House.  He said cases are rising but he did not have the medical advice to make such a call on mask wearing.  I sincerely think consideration needs to be given to strong advice at least on the wearing of masks in public settings and crowded places.  I believe we owe it to those who continue to work on our front line to offer them as much protection as we can over the coming weeks, as we are told by the T&aacute;naiste and others that cases will continue to rise over that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#J00500","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I join others in asking for a debate on the crisis facing the agricultural sector.  It would be appropriate if we had the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine before us in the House.  I very much welcome the decision of the Government yesterday to set aside up to &euro;12 million to assist farmers generally in meeting the challenges faced with the crisis in the grain supply.  The encouragement of the Government in that regard is helpful, and I am sure that &euro;12 million will bear fruit.<\/p> <p>Notwithstanding that, considering the critical importance of our agricultural sector in terms of food security and the uninterrupted supply of food, it is absolutely important that we address all of the aspects of farming.  There is an impact on the dairy sector.  The inability to import grain from Ukraine and Russia in the back end of this year will impact on the liquid milk market.  Farmers may not be able to milk year round.  The cost of diesel, fertiliser and inputs generally will have a very significant impact on the beef sector and the ability to grow grass at an affordable price.  To be sure, milk and beef prices are holding their own and have improved in the marketplace.  However, any increases that have been made in recent weeks and months are completely wiped out now by the increase in the cost of inputs.<\/p> <p>If we are to have a strategic approach here, and I know that is the focus of the Minister, we need to have an open and frank debate here.  There is no point addressing this crisis at the back end of the year in September, when we discover we do not have enough grass and grain to feed our cattle through the winter to produce beef and milk and we do not have the supplies to meet our own demands and the demands of elsewhere in Europe.  Now is the time before the growing season starts.  We can plan ahead.  It is not just about money, although money is a very important part of it.  It is about having a strategy to address the crisis we see emerging.  That is why it would be very important to have a debate in this House at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#K00200","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I recognise the Irish Air Corps and congratulate it on its centenary.

They have a history they can be very much proud of and, in the context of the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, a future they can look forward to.  To a large extent, the Air Corps has been underutilised.  We look at, as a particular example, the lack of capacity we have as a nation in terms of radar detection of overflights of Ireland, surveillance flights and the broader extension of surveillance of our maritime exclusive economic zone.  This is the future the Air Corps can look forward to.  While it consolidates its past, it can look into a future where it will be of huge service to the Irish people and a tremendously important component of the Defence Forces.  Unfortunately, I missed the flyover because I was in the Chamber, but it is entirely appropriate they should fly over Dublin to mark that centenary.

It is distressing to hear stories of children being abducted from Ukraine and taken to Russia without any explanation of where they have gone or where they are now.  This is another major problem and new frontier that has been crossed in this war we all hoped and thought would never happen on European soil again.  For those children entering the European Union and especially for those children entering Ireland, we must do everything we can to ensure they are safe in every possible respect.  There can be no question of trafficking on this island or in the European Union and we must do everything we can to ensure that does not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#K00300","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat f&eacute;in, a Sheanad&oacute;ir.

I live in a beautiful village called Castleconnell in Limerick, which had a population of 2,100 in 2016 and it is probably heading for around 2,500 now.  Under the current plan for the village, between now and 2028, we are going to get five additional public houses &ndash; not pubs, but houses.  That is what the population can look forward to.  It is absolutely shocking, it shows a complete lack of planning, and it is an example of the reality on the ground people are facing, namely, lengthy waiting lists going back years and people having no prospect of getting a home.  In addition, another issue is the fact the threshold for qualifying for public housing is so low.  In Limerick, it is between &euro;32,000 and &euro;34,000.  If you earn more than that, you do not even qualify to get a house.<\/p><p>I have met so many times in my village people paying &euro;1,400 a month rent for substandard three-bedroom houses, giving them no prospect whatsoever to save for a house and no prospect of having any kind of security in terms of where they live.

It is an appalling prospect for young working families trying to make progress and hoping for a better future.  It speaks of years, let us face it, of failure in terms of housing policy.  The prospect right now for the 2,500 people of Castleconnell of just having five new social houses is an absolute disgrace.  It needs urgent action.  It speaks more widely of the failures of Government housing policy.

They are all extremely welcome.  In my area of north County Clare there are almost 1,000 refugees and in Lisdoonvarna alone there are over 500 refugees.  It was heartening to see some normality, with 66 pupils having started in the secondary school in Lisdoonvarna and 27 young people having started in primary school.  We need to urgently ensure the necessary resources are made available.<\/p> <p>I believe there are now 60 doctors from Ukraine in Ireland.  I know there are five doctors and one orthodontist in Lisdoonvarna alone.  There is a critical shortage of doctors and orthodontists in this country.  I ask the Deputy Leader to contact the Medical Council.  I contacted it yesterday and I still have not received a response as to what it is doing to recognise the qualifications of Ukrainian doctors to enable them to practise in this country.  This is urgent as it would alleviate the challenges posed by waiting lists and overcrowded accident and emergency departments and tackle the queues of people waiting to attend GPs.  They would also be in a position to attend to the medical needs of refugees who have fled Ukraine because these medical professionals speak their language.<\/p> <p>I want liaison officers to be appointed in each Department.  To take as an example, the Department of Transport, I have received a number of inquiries from people from the Ukraine about their driver licences.  They want to know whether their driver licences will be recognised in this country.  There is also a major problem with insurance.  Will members of the Ukrainian community who have cars here or wish to buy cars be in a position to insure them or will the insurance companies return to type and rip people off?  There is a war in Ukraine and I expect the insurance companies to act with integrity, decency, dignity and respect.  Will they do that or will they rip people off?  These questions needs to be answered urgently.  I appeal to members of the media who are following this debate to ask the insurance companies if they are going to rip off Ukrainian refugees who are insuring their vehicles?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#M00700","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for so lucidly putting his questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#M00800","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Next Friday will be a special day for the Irish Cancer Society.

She spoke about Cross and Passion College in Kilcullen, which has become the first ADHD-friendly secondary school.  I congratulate the school and wish it well and I hope many other schools will follow suit.  It is fantastic to see our schools are catching up in this area.  I wish the teachers, students and school community in Kilcullen well. <\/p> <p>The Senator also spoke about the Permanent Defence Force and the ongoing recruitment and retention crisis it has faced for many years.  She spoke about the need to review the entry age for cadets and explore the possibility for direct graduate entry.  Both of the Senator's suggestions are sensible, logical and long overdue.  If the PDF wants those changes, it should be facilitated as there is a significant staff retention crisis in the organisation.  The Senator asked for a debate on the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  We will request that debate at the earliest opportunity.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin also spoke about farming issues in south Kildare and noted that &euro;12 million has been allocated to support tillage.  That funding is very welcome.  A debate has been requested with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine through the Seanad Office.

That issue was also raised by Senators &Oacute; Donnghaile and Currie.  I concur with all of the remarks made by the Senators in that regard.  It is a very serious issue.  This change undermines the Good Friday Agreement and the clear understanding on this island, and across both islands, that there should be a seamless Border and no hard Border.

He also asked to expedite the review of housing aid, adaption and mobility grants because of the rising cost of construction.  Everyone in every part of the country will deal with that issue.  I suggest that the Senator put down a Commencement matter on that issue because it is quite specific.  He also spoke about the pressure on our hospitals because of rising Covid cases and called for a health debate which has been requested with the Minister for Health.  We will get it as quickly as we can.<\/p> <p>Senator Dooley spoke on the ongoing crisis in agriculture.  That debate has been requested.  He pointed to the cost of inputs to agriculture, including feed, grain and fertilisers.  That is putting serious pressure on farmers and the farming sector and will impact on the cost of food.  We will get that debate as quickly as we can.<\/p> <p>Senator Ward concurred with the remarks of Senator Craughwell on the Air Corps and said a number of Oireachtas Members were on the plinth for the flyover by the Air Corps.  He wished Brigadier General Rory O'Connor and his team the best of luck.  He also raised the issue of trafficking.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke on the housing crisis.  He referred to Castleconnell.  I do not have full details of that area in County Limerick.  We have a Government programme of housing, a commitment of &euro;4 billion in spending, which the State has never seen the likes of, and a pledge to deliver 33,000 homes annually.  The good news is that new figures are out today for the last 12 months showing commencement notices are at the highest they have been for a rolling 12-month period since records began.  While the issue is not solved and the housing crisis persists, we are starting to turn the ship in the right direction and we are seeing more homes being built.  That is on the back of a pandemic where construction was shut down for periods of time.  That is positive news in the housing space to give people hope that homes are being built and beginning to come on stream. <\/p> <p>Senator Ahearne spoke about the passing of David Hill.  We had a minute's silence for David yesterday.  Senator Ahearne was present on the day and I have no doubt that for those Members present for the game with the Scottish Parliament, it was a traumatic experience.  I extend our sympathies to David's family, friends and work colleagues on his tragic passing.<\/p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke on the need for a debate on agriculture, which I have dealt with, and raised the issue of the waiting list for children for disability services in her area of the mid-west, where there are over 1,000 children waiting.  It is an ongoing issue that needs to be addressed.  It is a saddening situation for those children and families.  I thank the Senator for raising it.<\/p> <p>Senator Carrigy spoke about the Ukrainian refugees who have arrived in Longford.  I have no doubt the Reynolds family are doing a fantastic job in the Longford Arms Hotel in welcoming the refugees.  The issue of the numbers coming into the country was raised yesterday as well.  We spoke about it this morning at the EU affairs committee.  The numbers will increase and will create significant pressure but it is great to see hotels like the Longford Arms Hotel coming on stream giving that facility and accommodation.  Many hotels, bed and breakfasts, guest houses and people are opening their doors to take people in where they can, which is to be commended.  The Senator also mentioned the huge amount of funding every part of the country has seen for capital building projects for schools and paid tribute to the boards of management.  We pay tribute to the Minister for Education and the team at the Department across the board for working with the schools which have put in good applications for funding.  It is welcome and makes a big difference for many years afterwards to a school and its students to get money for capital works.  It is good to see.  He also spoke about the expansion of the DEIS programme, which is welcome.  It had not been expanded since 2017.  A host of new schools are involved in the programme.  The Senator rightly pointed to the significant benefits of being in the programme to addressing imbalance.  Not every student is coming through in the same space so addressing imbalance and having equal opportunities for children coming through is important.<\/p> <p>Senator Lombard spoke on a road traffic issue involving section 38 and local authorities.  He raised concerns about the operation of democracy in areas where the public and local elected members are in conflict with the local authority.  That is an issue to be worked out at a local level.  The views of residents of the area should be taken on board and given priority.  If they are living with the traffic changes, their views are paramount.  <\/p> <p>Senator Currie spoke eloquently on the Good Friday Agreement, the Border issue I have addressed and the non-Irish possibly having to get a visa waiver, which we would not agree with in this House.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway spoke on the Ukrainian crisis.  He raised the same issue yesterday.  He paid tribute to the people in Clare.  A significant number of people have landed in Clare and I have no doubt they are receiving a huge welcome and assistance.  He rightly pointed to the practicalities of living in the country, such as getting driver's licences and insurance and living and working in the area.  We have not had the time to plan in advance for these issues so we are resolving them as we go.  We ask that any organisation, company or business dealing with these practical issues for Ukrainian refugees does so with compassion and a desire to help and make it as easy as possible.<\/p> <p>Senator Dolan spoke about the importance of volunteering and stated it can be done in many forms.  It does not always have to involve money.  One's time is one's most important and precious asset.  People giving their time can be exactly what an organisation needs.  The Senator rightly pointed to the Irish Cancer Society's big day on Friday, 25 March, when the country will go yellow and we will all wear our daffodil pins and do what we can to support that organisation, which in turn supports so many people and families dealing with a cancer diagnosis.  It does fantastic work.  I will finish on that positive note.  I wish the Irish Cancer Society well for Friday.  It has had a couple of difficult years so it is a big day for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#N00300","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648031400,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648031400,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an Seanad ar fionra&iacute; ar 12.38 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 12.48 p.m.\r\n\r\nSitting suspended at 12.38 p.m. and resumed at 12.48 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: Second Stage","time":1648031400,"counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#O00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648031400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to bring the Bill before the Seanad.  The Bill will facilitate the transfer of specialist community-based disability services from the Minister for Health to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Broader disability equality policy is already the responsibility of the Minister following the transfer from the Minister for Justice in late 2020.  Following this transfer, responsibility for disability equality policy and specialist community-based disability services will be centralised in a single Department for the first time.  The HSE will retain responsibility for delivering the services.  The location of disability equality policy and specialist community-based disability services in a single Department will facilitate strategic policy development, including implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which Ireland ratified in 2018, as well as the significant reforms envisioned under the transforming lives programme.<\/p> <p>Under the convention, and following the transfer of the equality function, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will be the national focal point and the co-ordination mechanism for implementation of the UNCRPD.  The centralisation of the equality, health and social care dimensions of support for people with disabilities will facilitate the transition from a medical model of support towards a holistic, rights-based approach that supports people with disabilities to live autonomously.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Reflecting this change in philosophy in disability policy and service delivery will be crucial for meeting Ireland's obligations under the UNCRPD.  The transfer of these key responsibilities provides an opportunity to look anew and critically review how specialist community-based disability services are being delivered.  It will allow us to examine how the service offering can be improved to facilitate greater flexibility, choice and control from the service user's perspective.  After the transfer of policy responsibilities takes place, the governance arrangements for the transfer are that the HSE will retain service delivery responsibility and provide a framework for close co-operation between the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This will ensure that people with disabilities will continue to have access to integrated and mainstream health and personal social services.  It will also ensure that specialist community-based disability services benefit from, and are in line with, ongoing reform efforts including under Sl&aacute;intecare.  As the HSE will continue to deliver the services, the transfer therefore requires it to report to two Ministers for different elements of its functions.  The Bill seeks to put in place a legislative basis to enable this.  I shall briefly summarise the main elements and key features of this legislation.<\/p><p>The Bill is comprised of five Parts over 65 sections.  I will highlight a few of the more substantive provisions.  Of course further specific detail on each section can be found in the explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Bill.  In Part 1, sections 1 to 3 include standard provisions relating to the Title and the definition of Acts referred to in the Bill, and insert a definition of the \"specialist community-based disability services functions\" into the Health Act 2004.<\/p><p>Part 2 provides for amendments to the Health Act 2004 to ensure both Ministers have the requisite authority and accountability in respect of the HSE, in their respective areas of responsibility.  Section 7 amends the 2004 Act to provide for the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to have the power to issue general and specific written directions to the executive in respect of specialist community-based disability services.  Section 8 amends the 2004 Act to provide for the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to have powers in the setting of priorities for the executive's service plan in respect of its specialist community-based disability functions.<\/p><p>Section 12 amends the 2004 Act to provide for the accountability of the board to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in the performance of its specialist community-based disability functions.  Section 16 amends the 2004 Act to provide for consultation with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of the appointment of the CEO of the executive.  Section 17 amends the 2004 Act to provide for the CEO of the HSE to assist and provide the Accounting Officer of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth with information in respect of the specialist community-based disability functions.<\/p><p>Section 21 amends the 2004 Act regarding the obligations on the executive to prepare and submit a corporate plan to both Ministers.  Section 22 requires the laying of the corporate plan before the Oireachtas within 21 days of the plan being approved by both Ministers.  Sections 23 and 24 amend the 2004 Act to provide for consultation between both Ministers in respect of the determination of maximum net non-capital expenditure that may be incurred by the executive for a financial year.  Section 25 amends the 2004 Act regarding the obligation on the executive to prepare and submit a service plan to both Ministers for approval.<\/p><p>Section 29 amends the 2004 Act to provide the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth with the power to determine the capital funding in respect of specialist community-based disability services and for consultation between the Ministers regarding the determination of capital funding for the executive in a financial year.  Section 33 amends the 2004 Act and provides the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth with the power to specify the information to be included in the executive's annual report in respect of specialist community-based disability services functions.<\/p><p>Part 3 provides for the revision of sectoral plans under the Disability Act 2005.  The transfer of functions requires the sectoral plan that is currently under the responsibility of the Minister for Health to be divided between him and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to reflect the transfer of responsibilities between the two Ministers.  Sections 49 to 51, inclusive, amend the Disability Act 2005 to provide for this.<\/p><p>Part 4 provides for the expansion of the powers of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of investigations by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, under the Health Act 2007.  Section 52 amends section 2 of the Health Act 2007 by the insertion of the definition of \"specialist community-based disability functions\".  Section 53 amends section 9 of the Health Act 2007 to allow the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to require HIQA to undertake an investigation in the context of specialist community-based disability services.  Sections 54 to 58, inclusive, amend relevant sections of the Health Act 2007 to extend the power to make regulations to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of those areas which are transferring.<\/p><p>In Part 5, section 59 provides for definitions that appear in Part 5, including \"health and personal social services\", \"specialist community-based disability services\" and \"specialist community-based disability services functions\".  Section 60 provides for administrative co-operation between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to allow them to enter into arrangements which will facilitate administrative efficiency and co-operation, the avoidance of duplication of activities by the executive and the sharing of information relevant to the employment of persons.  Section 61 provides for a review process to include an evaluation of the delivery of specialist community-based disability services to be carried out no later than three years after the commencement of this section.  Sections 62 and 63 are quite technical sections relating to functions being deemed to have been valid in certain circumstances if, at the time of the performance or purported performance of the function, the relevant Minister believed that the function was vested in him or her by virtue of the amendments to the principal Act effected by this Bill.  Section 64 provides for the determination of disputes in connection with the amendments in this Bill and the performance of functions in this Bill.<\/p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to allow the transfer of specialist community-based disability services to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to take place.  I believe this will be a positive step for the reasons I outlined earlier.  I have focused on some key amendments today.  There will, of course, be an opportunity to discuss all the amendments on Committee Stage.  I look forward to any contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#O00300","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I am certainly not going to delay the progress of the Bill on Second Stage.

I congratulate her on the work she has done in respect of surrogacy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have seen considerable focus on it, unfortunately, over recent months.  However, what Senator Seery Kearney has been doing in this area has been going on long before there was an issue in Ukraine.  This is her area now as it moves from health to disability.  Senator Seery Kearney is a champion and straight talker, like the Minister of State, and gets things done.  We are here to get things done.  That is the reason we are elected to this House.  Sometimes, it can be frustratingly slow.<\/p><p>That is the point I will make about this Bill.  We are almost halfway through this Oireachtas term and this legislation is only coming before us now.  Why does a technical Bill take so long?  Why in the name of God could this not have been done within six months of going into government?  We all knew that disability was moving to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Minister of State knew it, but unfortunately, for the past two years, she has had to work to manage two Departments.  She knew disability would go to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and that she had to work with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  At the same time, her senior, essentially, was the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.  It was a no man's land to some extent.  In that scenario, all of the providers, support staff and civil servants down the line know they will move to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth but do not know when it will happen.  That type of bubble creates uncertainty and a certain lethargy because people will move Department.  It tends to slow things down and even grind them to a halt.<\/p><p>In doing her job, the Minister of State is pushing up a hill because this Bill has not been passed.  However, when we do pass it, and we will do so, the Minister of State will start motoring in a straight line and achieve much more.  The frustrations she has experienced over recent years will, it is hoped, evaporate.<\/p><p>Why in the name of God can we, as an Oireachtas, not be a little bit more efficient in the way we do our business?  What is the reason?  I do not expect the Minister of State to have the answer to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#P00300","speaker":"1644","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I would love to answer it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#Q00200","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I know the Minister of State would.  What is the reason?  Are we that inefficient?  We expect the public service to be efficient, get out there, do a job and deliver, and yet the Oireachtas takes two years to pass a largely technical Bill.  Nonetheless, the Bill is welcome.<\/p> <p>Significant progress has been made on the more important issue of delivery of services for people with disabilities.  We have seen the bringing together of services and the engagement the Minister of State has had with the NGO sector.  We have seen incremental wins; not the type of wins we would like, but certainly incremental wins.  I consider disability a whole-of-government issue where the Departments of Education, Social Protection and others need to work together.  Memorandums of understanding are needed.  We saw it in action when the lady from Achill Island who was on disability allowance, got the opportunity to do a PhD and was faced with the prospect of losing her allowance.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, intervened to make sure that did not happen.  Similarly, the Minister, Deputy Harris, made an intervention for Mr. Tom Clonan's son to ensure he got the supports he needed.<\/p> <p>These are positive examples of Departments working together and of a whole-of-government response.  The Minister of State has led many such examples, which I do not have the time to go into, but I have worked closely with her on a number of issues she has driven forward significantly.  While I wish these services well under the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, I hope we will continue to see the forging together of a whole-of-government response so that, when there are difficulties, Departments step up to the plate and work together to resolve them.<\/p> <p>I have no issue with what is happening in this legislation because I know it is technical.  It happened when the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was created and when other Departments were created subsequently.  However, going forward, the Houses of the Oireachtas have questions to answer as to why this has taken so long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#Q00300","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  It is always a great joy to see her, work with her and admire the great job she is doing.  She is exceptional in her role.<\/p> <p>While I very much respect the vast experience of my colleague Senator Conway, I understand why this has taken time.  When we go through the sheer breadth of authorities that needed to move into the other Department, and while I am delighted to be able to call on HIQA and to make demands of the HSE in terms of accountability and requesting support, I can understand how it is so in depth.<\/p> <p>The natural place for disabilities is in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Minister of State very graciously came before the joint committee when she was only a short while in the job and had no obligation to do so.  From day one, she has had a great relationship with the committee.  The joint committee and the Joint Committee on Disability Matters have received reports about the cost and experiences of disability that show the intersectionality in terms of the social, demographic and geographical challenges that arise.  We also see intersectionality within marginalised groups and gender and the challenge of that.  Having equality, integration and disability under the same roof, so to speak, makes absolute sense to make sure there is progress.<\/p> <p>We had a children's committee meeting that involved the HSE and the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon.  It was a very robust and fruitful three hours.  Everybody was clearly very passionate about and committed to making sure people with disabilities live their best lives.  What also came across very clearly was the challenges within that.  While the HSE was criticised for naming the issues without necessarily having a clear plan of action, I also heard about intentions and the considerable amount of work ongoing in that regard.  The Minister of State has prompted an honesty in the debate in meetings she has facilitated recently that I have also heard.  It is very important we have this coming together of understanding that children have a right to services and to access them in a timely manner.<\/p> <p>In my constituency in Dublin South-Central, in particular, there is a massive gap in service provision which comes down to the issue of vacancies.  Children have had diagnoses of being on the autism spectrum and having a disorder such as a developmental co-ordination disorder.  There have been numerous dual diagnoses, and dual does not even capture the extent of it.  They may have been born in 2013 and still not have received services.<\/p> <p>There is a need for something to happen urgently.  My concern in the moving over is to ensure the Minister of State has the budget.  We have the passion and the Minister of State has the leadership.  She recently broke down her budget, and while it seemed vast, a figure of in excess of &euro;1 billion was suggested yesterday as the shortfall in funding in terms of the personnel and roll-out of services we would need.  I call on the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to fight hard and I will support him to fight hard to ensure the Department has an adequate budget to ensure that, when accountability is called for, there is no impediment to ensuring a roll-out, especially as we ratify the optional protocol and do all of that within the context of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.<\/p> <p>I want to end by thanking the Minister of State very sincerely.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This week we will visit WALK and I am really looking forward to it.

We will meet them there.  The passage of those families, which will be the beginning of a lot more to come, was eased by the work and intervention of the Minister of State and my own intervention.  We worked very well.  We had late-night calls last Friday night.  There is something of a spontaneous response and it is led by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  A powerful amount of work is being done and is planned to be done.

Sometimes I have to read my notes off my phone.  I hate doing it and I hope the Minister of State does not think me ignorant.  It is me and the relationship I have with the printer in my office.  Sometimes it is not good.<\/p> <p>As several of my colleagues pointed out in the debate in the D&aacute;il, this is a very important Bill.  Colleagues in the Seanad have acknowledged this also.  It transfers responsibility for specialist community-based disability services from the Minister for Health to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Bill is quite substantive.  Once it has been fully implemented, it will bring an additional layer of accountability for the development and provision of disability services.  Many challenges in this area need to be addressed urgently, including tackling waiting lists and reducing wait times.  We must improve access to speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, counselling and the wide-ranging supports many children and adults need to help them to live full and independent lives.<\/p> <p>Although responsibility for mental health remains with the Department of Health, there is an onus on the Minister with responsibility for children and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability not to lose sight of the toll on children's mental health caused by inexcusable waiting lists for disability services and the difficulties that being differently abled in this world can bring.  At the end of last year, 4,000 children were still waiting for an assessment of need and more still were waiting for further diagnostic assessment.  Professionals in the system are concerned that due to understaffing, assessments are not being carried out as thoroughly as they should be.  Parents are also concerned their children are not receiving the range of therapies they need.  Very often parents have to battle with the system to get the services their children need.  It is all about capacity.  The professionals are doing their best and parents are also doing their best.<\/p> <p>We all must become advocates of what is best for the children.  The Minister of State should become an advocate for a whole-of-government approach to deliver a new social model of disability inclusion.  I hope this is something the Minister of State will agree with.  A new social model needs to take into account that disability is not solely a health matter.  This is acknowledged in the intent of the Bill.  There is a need to move away from the medical model of disability and embrace a rights-based model.  Disability needs to be viewed as being caused by the way society is organised rather than by a person's impairment or difference.  We need to look at ways of removing barriers that restrict life choices for disabled people so that when these barriers are removed, disabled people can be independent and equal in society with choice and control over their own lives.<\/p> <p>The ratification of the UNCRPD is a step in the right direction.  The Government needs to complete this process by ratifying the optional protocol of the convention.  This legal foundation will make it easier to develop the social model and protect the human rights of those people who are disabled.  The task before us is formidable but nonetheless doable.  The scale of the task is reflected in the findings of the disability capacity review of specialist community-based services.  It identified the need for a major budget increase to handle the demographic changes to provide access to housing and independent living supports to phase out the old system whereby 1,800 disabled people are living in large residential settings and 1,300 disabled people under the age of 65 are living in nursing homes.<\/p> <p>There is a data deficit when it comes to disability also.  Data from various Departments need to be married to ensure the most comprehensive person-centred responses can be delivered.  Without baseline data it would be very difficult to track success or otherwise in disability services.  The State is rich in policy and relevant legislation but it is constantly weak on implementation.  Implementation is crucial to the success of a new social model dealing with the disabled and their much-needed services.<\/p> <p>I support the legislation, as did colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  I look forward to its progress through the Seanad and to engaging with the Minister of State, officials and other relevant Departments on its roll-out and implementation.  I followed the debate from the office before I came to the Chamber.  This has to be centred on people with disabilities.  They have to feel tangibly the real outcomes of what can be a very beneficial move and step forward.  I wish the legislation well and I sincerely hope it can begin the process of effective delivery for the people it hopes to help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#R00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House.  I thank her for her work, commitment and engagement.  While my contribution will be critical it will not be critical of the Minister of State and I want to make this quite clear at the beginning.  This is very important legislation.  The Minister of State to her credit deserves our support for bringing it forward and implementing it.  The challenges we face in the provision of services for people with disabilities is gargantuan.  I say this as somebody who has years of experience and who is very committed to and works closely with a number of organisations in the provision of services and specialist community-based delivery of services.<\/p> <p>The conundrum we all face is contained in the legislation and in the remarks of the Minister of State.  The transfer to specialist community-based disability services is something we all support.  The problem is that the multi-sectoral plan is not working to its full potential despite the best efforts of the Minister of State.  In the most recent budget we had the highest ever provision for these services.  I do not believe there is a coherent funding strategy once it leaves the Minister of State.  There is far too much fragmentation in the provision of adult and child services, such as with regard to respite care and developing housing needs.  In the provision of services there needs to be better and more strategic investment by the HSE.<\/p> <p>The interdepartmental approach is not working.  While the functional movement is technical, this is about the provision of services for people who need them.  We very much welcome the young boys and girls in the Gallery.  Every one of those children has the potential to reach their full capacity.  This is part of our difficulty.  Under section 29 the Minister has the power to determine capital funding.  We all think this is great.  Then we go back to the memorandum of explanation and we see the power to spend money is being retained by the HSE following the transfer.<\/p> <p>I have known the Minister of State since she has come to the Oireachtas.  I have great time for her.  Yesterday, we announced new special education schools in Dublin and Cork.  Senator Seery Kearney, to be fair, championed them in her area as I did in my area.  Take, for example, a child living in Waterfall in Cork city who is to go to a new school place that has been announced in Rochestown.  It is brilliant that a new school has been announced but how is the child to get to the school?  Where is the respite care?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Where are the supports built around that?  Therein lies our problem.  We announce places and funding, but we do not put in place the roadmap to help children and their families to get to that point.  In fairness to the Minister of State, and I am not being patronising, every time she speaks at a conference or event on disability, she makes a comment about being comprehensive in this regard.  I do not have confidence, however, in the people in the HSE to deliver on this aim.  I am being critical from experience.<\/p><p>We have a deficit of school places and of respite care.  The issue of education and respite transport is a circle, with the most important part, the child or young adult, in the middle.  Planning is needed in the community.  I wonder if we have the capacity in the community to deliver in respect of the whole issue of skill sets, respite care and respite beds.  I say that because one of the hardest, most difficult and most harrowing parts of our job is to meet parents who are crying out for respite care because they are at their wits' end and cannot continue to give the care to their loved ones that they are providing.<\/p><p>While this legislation is deemed technical, it is not.  I hope the Minister of State will take my comments in the spirit they are intended.  I love these objectives given in the explanatory memo regarding ministerial powers in respect of \"the issuing of directions to the HSE\", [the] \"Accountability of the HSE board\" and the \"Corporate plan, service plan capital plan\".  In many cases, however, the corporate plan and the capital plan appear nearly a year later and that means organisations are working retrospectively.<\/p><p>I will work with the Minister of State.  I admire her tenacity because everything she has done and said thus far has been very progressive, but the problem lies with the whole issue of the delivery by the HSE on the ground.  Let us look at the Cope Foundation in Cork, for example.  It is launching a major recruitment campaign to hire staff because it cannot get any.  I wish the Minister of State well because this is important legislation.  We need to get it delivered and we must get it done in a manner that is coherent on behalf of the people who need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#R00300","speaker":"1637","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh mo chomhghleaca&iacute; &oacute; Ghaillimh, an tAire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Rabbitte.  As we all know, this Bill essentially transfers responsibility for disability issues from the Department of Justice to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  My first observation is to express concern about the accumulation over time of responsibilities by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  What began as the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2011 has now transformed into the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, as of the formation of this Government.  I am sure I am not the only person who is concerned that the Department is slowly being turned over time into a silo for various insoluble problems hived off from other Departments that might be secretly glad to see the back of them.<\/p><p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs was originally established to provide a laser-like focus on the major problems which existed in that area.  If people had been told in 2011 that it would eventually have responsibility for dealing with direct provision and for preparing for the arrival of refugees from war in eastern Europe, I think their eyebrows would have gone out on stalks.  Yet that is the position we have today.  Since January, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has issued statements on issues as diverse as climate change, the gender pay gap, homelessness, Storm Eunice and an OECD report on what are described as gender norms.<\/p><p>I say this not to criticise the Minister personally, but it seems that because the Department covers the briefs of equality, youth and integration and concepts whose definitions are often in the eye of the beholder, it increasingly has a roaming brief covering everything and anything on which it wishes to intervene.  I am not sure that makes for good government or good use of taxpayers' funds.  I say this and raise the issue following on from Senator Buttimer's laser-like focus on real issues of human welfare just now.  That laser-like focus which the Department originally had seems to me to be in danger of being lost in favour of an increasingly scattergun approach.<\/p><p>The handling of the disability brief is of even greater concern.  Again, I am making no criticisms of the Minister of State or of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The explanatory memo for this Bill states that it was a key commitment of the current Government that the co-ordination of disability-related issues would be &quot;handled by a senior Minister for the first time&quot;.  On its own, that sounds very laudable, but I think we should be wary of such commitments.  Over the last 25 years, calls for an issue to be handled by a dedicated Minister or Minister of State have been seen to be a tried and tested way for successive governments to be seen to be doing something rather than bringing about any fundamental change in how an issue gets dealt with.<\/p><p>Responsibility for disability has been passed around from Billy to Jack over the last 15 years.  It has gone from the Department of Health to the Department of Justice and now on to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, in what could be described as a game of political pass the parcel.  I somehow doubt that the music has stopped at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I certainly fear that disability issues will get passed on elsewhere in the years to come, if it becomes politically expedient to do that.  Therefore, I hope that the changes being made today will bring about appreciable improvements in how policy is made and that they are not simply being undertaken so that the Government is being seen to be doing something.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State is aware, this Bill amends the Health Acts of 2004 and 2007, which outline the internal workings of the HSE's governance.  I will raise an issue in this context that I have raised before and that the Minister of State addressed when I raised it before.  It is an issue that I think could perhaps be solved by amending this legislation.  Under sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE provides funding to groups and organisations to assist them to provide certain services.  In May last year, I raised a case where the HSE continued to funnel money to a particular organisation despite it being in flagrant breach of basic company law requirements not having filed audited accounts for three years.  The group is not providing any essential services and yet the HSE paid out more than &euro;750,000 over those three years, despite being fully aware that the organisation in question had not produced audited accounts.  I think the Minister of State will remember this topic because I think she took my Commencement matter on this issue.  The organisation in question, Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, eventually had its funding frozen last summer.  As recently as last week, it was the subject of a report in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>, where it admitted that payments to former directors had not been properly accounted for.  As I said before, I do not raise this issue because of the particular organisation or issue involved; I raise it because what we are talking about here, and what we all should be concerned about, is good governance.  The HSE has apparently issued TENI with an ultimatum that it will seek a refund of moneys paid unless the organisation's accounting issues are resolved this month.

It is relevant because this Bill amends the Health Act.  That is a cheap shot and a weak Government reproach, instead of dealing with the substance of what I am bringing up, which is important.  This might enlighten the Senator.  Under the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012, any political party which does not produce audited accounts for a given year will get no funding from the State for the following year.  Why should the same not apply to lobby groups funded by the HSE?  The Senator should understand that as a politician.  It is simply a case of sauce for the goose being sauce for the gander.  The legislative bar on funding political parties that fail to file audited accounts should extend to all bodies in receipt of State funding, with appropriate discretion for leeway caused by delays of a few months which occur in the normal course of events.  Bringing this about would require simple amendments to sections 38 and 39 of the 2004 Act, which this Bill also amends.  This is the relevant point in respect of Senator Davitt's query.   I wonder if the Minister of State could express a view on this?  Does she agree that no group or organisation should be in receipt of significant State funding without being in full compliance with basic company law requirements?

I also thank him for the work done in assisting us to get to this Stage.<\/p><p>Senator Conway asked why this has taken so long and there are two answers.  I have the official answer from my good colleague with me, Barry, and my answer; I will give my answer.  There is no doubt this is a complex process and there are 65 amendments in this.  There is no doubt it is a technical Bill.  When the Taoiseach gave me the call back in June 2020, it was the only job he asked me to do.  He asked me to remove disability issues from the Department of Health and bring them to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  His final and parting line was that he expected me to do it right.  Expecting to do it right means we had to bring the money, and that is what I ensured I did.  On the very first day I could have turned to Barry and the acting Secretary General and said I needed to go but I chose not to until I had the money sorted as well as the transfer of functions.  To be fair to Barry and the team back in the Department of Health, I have annoyed enough people in the place so that they are opening the door to let me out quite willingly.  Barry was put on duty very quickly and we have it nearly over the line and done.<\/p><p>The important lesson I take from the time it has taken is that I understand how this works.  I could have gone and not understood the multidisciplinary piece between specialised disability services and primary services, how they must operate and how an integrated piece might work.  I could have gone without knowing anything about aids and appliances within the disability conversation.  I could have gone without understanding the relevance or role of primary medical certificates within the Department of Health.  Everybody thinks primary medical certificates sit with my good self but they do not sit near me at all.  They all sit under the senior Minister and Minister for Finance.  At the same time, primary medical certificates are associated with disability.<\/p><p>I got a really good understanding as to how the HSE operates and I built a really good relationship with people.  We have reformed our 91 network teams.  This means I have a really good basis for when the functions transfer.  The most wonderful aspect is that both Ministers - Deputies Stephen Donnelly and Roderic O'Gorman - allowed me to operate from both Departments, having function in one and none in the other.  I was allowed to shape and sculpt the process so that when we move, it will be seamless.  This technical legislation will be the final piece required, warts and all.<\/p><p>It is important to say the primary legislation put in place is to ensure governance and oversight powers transfer to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and to define the scope of what is to transfer.  That took time and to be very fair, the Department did a good job on it.  At the same time, I was not going without having the money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#S00500","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>The Minister of State was right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#T00200","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I was.  That was the most important point.<\/p> <p>There is much to be learned from a smooth transfer and having a good working relationship with Ministers in both Departments.  There is much to be learned about how both Departments had to work in a collaborative way and a relationship developed.  Perhaps in the past we would have always worked in silos but at all my meetings Department of Health officials must appear and officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth must appear.  They are watching me all the time for fear I land the other Department in trouble.<\/p> <p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for its support of the Bill.  I agree that it is all about services and removing barriers.  I certainly will not deny that and it must be about the removal of barriers.  It is about moving from the medical model to the social model.<\/p> <p>Senator Mary Seery Kearney is on both the sectoral committees and understands very clearly the complexities involved in this process.  We acknowledge the Bill is technical and complex but it is the undercurrent of work that must be understood.  It goes across so many sections and it feeds so far into the community.  It is a varied area but, at the same time, the budget is divided very clearly.  Perhaps in the past we had a particular focus of delivery but the members of both committees, along with me as Minister of State, are trying to move the dial and change the cultural approach so we can look at a social rather than completely medical model.  We are also trying to be very open-minded in the transfer, and this is about equality and rights to housing, work, education and inclusion.  There is a right to the optimal protocol in the overall game.  That is what we are looking to achieve.<\/p> <p>In the context of this Bill much good work has gone on in both committees.  Only earlier this morning I spoke about the standard operating procedure and the children's committee yesterday had a very robust discussion of that.  I thank the Senator for that.  We got many answers and now there is a conversation on all sides.  Disability is no longer tokenistic and just about being well-intentioned.  Disability is about action and anybody who enters into its arena is expected to do something, including me, elected Members in the Oireachtas, the paid members of the HSE and the Departments.  It is at the front and centre of the Department.<\/p> <p>When we move to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, it will be the largest budget there.  It is no longer the Cinderella of a Department but front and centre.  It is where we want disability issues to be.  When we achieve our goals within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, we will set our sights on other Departments to get disability matters very clearly front and centre within transport and employment.  The Senators might let the T&aacute;naiste know I am coming for the Department dealing with enterprise and entrepreneurship.  This must go right across society.  People have rights to inclusion.  If we understand the spirit of such action, we must back it up by action and funding.<\/p> <p>The Senator spoke about disability capacity funding.  I have only just left my office and have been going down through the area with a fine toothcomb.  There is no denying we need more money.  If we are serious about it we must change the dial on what we know and our priorities.  Personal assistance is huge if we are to support independent living and access to the workspace.  That has been a key message coming through all committees.  I thank the Senator for her work.  Vacancies are also a major issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Buttimer is what I would like to be when I sit on the benches.  He challenges the system all the time, which I welcome.  I know I have his full support in this.  He is right.  When we speak about putting systems in place, we cannot leave out one part or it all falls down.  I have had robust conversations in the Department of Health about how the Bill will move.  Some would have liked me to leave the delivery of services for therapeutic services within the Department of Health, for example.  That could not be done, however, as there must be a clear pathway.<\/p> <p>Senator Buttimer is also right that I should follow the money.  The HSE knows I follow the money and it has seen me do it for the past two years.  We are in a space where it will be extracted and there will be separate accounts and reporting to two Ministers.  It will become very clear and transparent as to where the money is spent, and we can then look to performance-related delivery and measurable outcomes.  We must get down to key performance indicators and if we give X, we should know what we got for that.  That may be therapy delivery or respite beds but we must know.  How else can I ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for funding?  I am with the Senator and we need a multisectoral approach.<\/p> <p>Sometimes we outsource too much within the HSE rather than holding on and having confidence in the ability to do the job, deliver and see it done.  For all the critical issues I have seen in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 1 over the past number of months, the HSE has delivered the vast majority of healthcare needs very well.  That is leaving aside the Brandon report and everything else, which was a different assessment at the time.  The HSE cannot stand back.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Mullen for his contribution.  I wrote down the reference to laser-like focus.  He is right in his belief of what the Department should have in that laser-like focus.  I agree on that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I see a laser-like focus on equality and rights and on the likes of the minority groupings, the rights of persons with disabilities and the children's referendum.  That is why we needed to put a laser-like focus on it.  We all have health issues.  People with disabilities have health issues; I have health issues.  However, persons with disabilities also have the right of equality and the right to participate.  That is what that Department will do on it.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen used some very powerful language.  We absolutely do not have a scatter-gun approach.  Sometimes Opposition Members describe Government as being well-intentioned and moving the deck chairs.  That is not what this Government is about when it comes to disability.  I would like to think it is very focused on delivering and determined to deliver for persons with disabilities.  That is why we focused on introducing this legislation, doing the job I was asked to do, seeking the funding to deliver, and now following the accountability and the delivery of it.  That leads me back to the last comment the Senator made.  Yes, I believe in good governance.  I believe in governance for everybody and accountability for all.<\/p><p>The Senator asked about section 38 and section 39 bodies.  If the issue arises, the Bill gives the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth the authority to request information from the HSE on the activities of section 38 and section 39 bodies in respect of the area transferring.  These are the same powers as the Minister for Health currently holds.  If we need to amend the governance of the HSE and section 38 and section 39 bodies, we will do that.  The Bill is about transferring responsibility.  To try to introduce complex changes beyond that aspect of the legislation would certainly cause further delay.  I ask the Senator not to table the amendment.  I agree about proper governance and oversight.  As I have been instructed by my official, if that needs to happen, we will certainly be doing it.  I have said very clearly that I am following the money.  I want accountability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#T00300","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State accept the validity of my comparison in respect of political parties that get more funding if they do not have audited accounts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#U00200","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#U00300","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>It is a good principle, is it not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#U00400","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>It should be the principle for everything.

Like the Senators, I am gravely concerned by the ongoing situation.  I am sure they will all join me in condemning in the strongest possible terms the illegal actions of Russia, whose military strategy at this stage appears to be one designed to cause the maximum suffering for civilians.  I am sure they will also join me in extending our hand of welcome to the many Ukrainians who have already arrived, and to those who continue to arrive, in our country seeking safety and shelter.<\/p><p>Since the outset of this war, my Department and I have been focused on providing reception accommodation to Ukrainian refugees in need.  Since the outbreak of war and the first Ukrainians fleeing the war arriving in Ireland, the scale of response to this crisis has been unprecedented.  As of yesterday evening, 10,414 Ukrainians have come to Ireland.  We have established dedicated teams at our airports and ports to meet new arrivals from Ukraine comprising staff from several Departments including the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and my own Department.  Officials from these Departments are ensuring that every person arriving is met and given support as soon as possible.  We have specifically prepared reception areas, which include designated spaces for children and adults and quiet spaces.<\/p><p>Each Ukrainian refugee who arrives at Dublin Airport is provided with a permission letter confirming that he or she has been granted temporary protection under the EU directive, which allows for temporary protection for at least one year.  This means that Ukrainian nationals fleeing the conflict will be allowed to work and will be given access to health services, accommodation, education for children and other social supports.  Details of the new measure have been published on the Department of Justice's Irish immigration website at<i>www.irishimmigration.ie<\/i>and are available in Ukrainian and Russian at <i>gov.ie\/ukraine<\/i>.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection is registering those arriving at Dublin Airport for personal public service numbers, PPSNs, so that they can have quick access to income support.  The Department of Social Protection also has a presence at Rosslare Europort and in Cork and Limerick to register those arriving by ferry or through Cork and Shannon airports.  <\/p><p>The international protection accommodation service, IPAS, of my Department has temporarily taken responsibility for providing short-term accommodation to Ukrainian refugees.  A dedicated Ukraine unit is being established to manage the provision of accommodation and related services to Ukrainian refugees.  To date, 4,942 Ukrainian nationals have sought accommodation from IPAS.  My officials are continuously working to source further accommodation and supports for Ukrainian arrivals to Ireland through hotel accommodation and various other accommodation solutions.  IPAS has contracted over 2,500 hotel rooms, with additional capacity also being pursued through: hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfast accommodation providers; accommodation pledged by the general public; State-owned or private properties which may be suitable for short-term accommodation; religious properties; and local authority facilities.<\/p><p>We have to be very clear about the scale of the accommodation challenge that we, as a country, face.  In fairness, all of our EU neighbours are also facing this challenge.  While we have been able to accommodate Ukrainian refugees in hotels so far, there is limited capacity within our hospitality sector to provide sufficient accommodation.  Work is under way to expand our accommodation capacity, including through the repurposing of large buildings.  However, depending on the number of arrivals, it may be necessary to draw on temporary or emergency accommodation options if existing accommodation sources are not available or are insufficient for our needs.<\/p><p>My Department has worked with local authorities, which played a pivotal role in securing short-term accommodation over the St. Patrick's Day weekend when hotel availability was more limited.  We have engaged with the County and City Management Association about drawing on emergency accommodation in community centres, if necessary.  Dublin City Council provided some emergency accommodation last weekend and we have engaged with convention centres about installing emergency accommodation in those facilities and with the Defence Forces about options if existing capacity was insufficient.  I also know and appreciate that many people in Irish society wish to help directly.  As has been the case so many times in the past, it is part of our heritage to give.  The Irish people are doing this by opening their doors.<\/p><p>The Government has worked with the Irish Red Cross to put in place a national pledge as the mechanism for channelling the offers of accommodation which many members of the public wish to provide.  The website through which offers of accommodation can be pledged is available online at <i>registerofpledges.redcross.ie<\/i>.  There has been a remarkable response by the public, with over 20,000 pledges received so far.  The Irish Red Cross, the Defence Forces and estate agents and valuers are now beginning to evaluate these pledges and to inspect the properties with a view to making them available quickly to refugees.  They are focusing firstly on fully vacant properties, which constitute 20%, or 44,000, of all pledges.  The Irish Red Cross and my Department will then begin to match refugees to properties and to support refugees to move into their new homes.  The Government, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Red Cross and Tusla have been working together to develop a vetting process for donors of shared accommodation.  This is where a room or rooms have been offered to Ukrainian refugees in people's houses.<\/p><p>As children constitute a significant proportion of the Ukrainian refugees currently arriving in Ireland, child protection has to be a priority.  For this reason, anyone offering a room or rooms in a shared home will have to be vetted before Ukrainian refugees are matched with them.  Senators will appreciate the importance of ensuring the safety of people who may be vulnerable and who are traumatised by the terrible experiences which they have recently undergone.<\/p><p>I thank everyone who has pledged their support.  I also thank the Irish Red Cross volunteers and staff who work to facilitate this unprecedented demand.  The generosity of the Irish people and of the NGO community continues to be a beacon of hope for people who have lost so much.<\/p><p>One of the most important elements in dealing with a crisis is information.  Essential information regarding support and services are available online at <i>gov.ie<\/i>and on my Department's website.  The information is available in English, Ukrainian and Russian.  We are working to expand the range of information provided.  I recently met with both the Ukrainian and Polish ambassadors and I have committed to keeping the Ukrainian Embassy regularly updated as a crucial information hub for refugees and for the Ukrainian community in Ireland more broadly.  <\/p><p>In the wider context, my Department has been working closely with key stakeholders and with the European Commission, other EU agencies and member states.  This has helped us to be prepared for the sudden increase in people seeking international protection in the EU.  As part of our foreign policy focus and using our seat on the UN Security Council, we have been working to ensure that entity plays its role in ensuring that full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all areas of Ukraine is provided, although we are all aware that this is not currently being facilitated by the Russian military.  At the UN Security Council, Ireland has called for unrestricted safe passage for civilians out of areas of military operations and for the delivery of humanitarian supplies including medicine and food to be facilitated.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, the use of prohibited weapons, and indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks are absolutely unacceptable.  Russia has a clear obligation to comply fully with international law, in particular international humanitarian law.  Ireland has joined 38 other International Criminal Court, ICC, state parties in referring the situation in Ukraine to the ICC to investigate alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.  The UN Human Rights Council will undertake a commission of inquiry into violations of human rights in Ukraine.<\/p><p>As the House will know, we have made significant humanitarian aid available.  The Taoiseach initially committed &euro;10 million.  That was followed by a subsequent &euro;10 million.  We have also contributed &euro;11 million to the EU's peace facility package.  As the House will know, that Irish aid is non-lethal.  Nevertheless it is all vital aid Ukraine and the Ukrainian Government require.  I recognise the website of D&oacute;chas, which is the umbrella organisation for Irish NGOs.  That may provide a hub for people looking to donate to the ongoing humanitarian relief efforts taking place on the border and in Ukraine itself.  People who wish to support those NGOs may do so.<\/p><p>The scale of this humanitarian crisis response is unprecedented for this State, but it is a task we undertake knowing that, by so doing, we are saving lives.  As I said in my opening remarks, we are extending a welcome to Ukrainian refugees arriving in Ireland.  They are fleeing invasion.  We are offering them shelter and safety.  We will need help from all sectors of Irish society and from communities across Ireland if we are to respond effectively to the needs of a people who have been deeply wronged and subjected to terrible suffering.  We are scaling up our operation.  We have to be honest that this will not be perfect from day one and that we will have to work to develop all the various connections required, from travel to transport, education, early years care and access to the job market.  There will be hiccups as we develop this system, but we are absolutely committed to doing all we can to assist these people, who are so desperately in need through absolutely no fault of their own.  I know Senators of all parties and none will work with the Government and in their communities to assist in this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#W00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, Minister.

Unfortunately, I have been saying those words a lot recently because we have had so many Ukrainians come into our county.  Maybe we should all learn how to say those words for starters.  I thank the Minister deeply because from the get-go he has turned on a sixpence and created systems that were never before demanded at such a scale and in such a short time.  So far so good.  Unfortunately, it looks like we will have a lot more to do, but the response from the Minister, his Department and the ordinary people of Ireland has been mind-blowing.  It gives you faith in most people.  Obviously, there are some very evil people, like Putin, but it is to be hoped the good will outweigh the bad and, overall, we will be victorious.<\/p><p>In my county, Clare, we have seen mind-blowing generosity from everybody, particularly the Polish community.  They have been amazing.  They led the way for the rest of us, who did not know what to do or how we could help, so I give a big shout out to the Polish people.  Many of my Polish friends' family homes in Poland are now full of Ukrainians.  It has been amazing.  We must have hope and focus on the amount of positivity there is in most ordinary people in this world so we do not fall into the darkness surrounding the few evil people who can fill our minds with negative thoughts and a lack of hope.  I have had many phone calls and conversations with people who are finding the war overwhelming.  Overall, however, we must remember the average human being is good and means well.  We have seen that globally in the outpouring from ordinary people at every level of society as we try to do all we can to support these people in a time of crisis.  Unfortunately, the Ukrainians who have got as far as Ireland are some of the luckier ones, which is astounding to think.  Everything is relative.  Some are still back in their homes fearing the worst and fighting for their countries.  Mother's Day is approaching.  I think of the mothers of Ukraine who do not have their husbands, sons or fathers with them because they have had to stay at home to fight for their lives.<\/p><p>Our country is part of the EU.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been good at that level, but we have to be strong and do all we can to lead the EU.  It is said there are no more sanctions we can impose.  We have to beg our neighbours in Germany and France.  We have to ask them to listen and to look at this properly and see if there is more we can do.<\/p><p>As a people, we can do our best.  In some ways one of the most significant things we can do is look at our complete fossil fuel addiction and do more to wean ourselves off it.  That seems to be the grasp Putin has on the EU, which is why the EU has not been stronger.  I suppose Putin had hoped he would split us.  He is having some success in that at present, but we are now in wartime.  It is not a world war but it is a huge war the likes of which we have not seen since the 1930s.  When was the last time we had 3 million people coming into Europe in such a short time?  It is very important the Irish Cabinet looks at expediting every single thing we can do to move away from our fossil fuel addiction.  We have had the solutions to wean ourselves off fossil fuels and these have come from the Green Party, the green movement, environmental activism and environmental scientists for 30 or 40 years.  We have always had the solutions.  One of the main reasons I got involved in green politics was to try to get those solutions manifested.  We have seen good public transport, electrification of houses and really good retrofitting schemes, but we need to prioritise that now.  At present, people are stuck with their fossil fuel dependence.<\/p><p>We cannot all go out and buy electric cars in the morning but, at a personal level, we have to drive our cars less.  I know the Minister, Deputy Ryan, got shot down for saying driving above certain speeds results in increased use of fuel, but he was right.  We have to take things at a personal level.  The State, unfortunately, will not be able to bail everybody out.  The Government will not be able to cover the quadrupled cost of 10-10-20 fertiliser for farmers.  We will not be able to cover the cost increases in petrol and diesel, and they are not going down anytime soon, so we have some personal responsibility to look at our behaviour.  This is behavioural change we were working towards anyway because of the climate emergency, but now we have an extra emergency, thanks to Putin, a war emergency, and this is wartime.  Anybody who was alive during the Second World War will remember rationing, and we have to do that on a personal level.  Unfortunately, it has come to that.<\/p><p>It is important the Cabinet prioritises all this now.  We need to get our offshore wind going and to improve our public transport vastly, especially in rural areas.  Currently, we see a big discrepancy between the choices rural and urban people have.  I have a friend who has a Brompton, a lovely fold-up bike.  He can go out of his house, cycle a kilometre, hop on the train and arrive in Dublin.  That is lovely.  Many people do not have that choice.  A lot of our carbon emissions and fossil fuel consumption come from private car owners in rural areas, so there is a significant part to play.  We can turn some of this negativity into a positive if we expedite all the things we need to do on climate action.  It will give us cleaner air, save us money and make us less dependent on evil people like Putin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#X00300","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I wish the Minister and the Government well as they lead the national response to this terrible crisis.  There is a lot to give us hope when we see the generous response of the Irish people.  Many of the Government's measures taken so far will also have people's full support.  I will make a number of points.  Some may appear to be critical.  Some will be more in the vein of praising and urging more of certain things.  What I have to say is an attempt to contribute to the discussions we all need to have about which needs we can address and how quickly.  We are dealing with the most serious international emergency in any of our lifetimes.  Apart from needless death and destruction, it has caused huge international economic upheaval, the displacement of 3 million refugees so far, as we all know, and untold concern, anxiety and indeed grief among Irish people.  It is very hard to stay listening to the radio and other media these mornings, though we know we cannot turn our heads away.<\/p> <p>As for our response in the Seanad so far, in the four weeks since the invasion began we have had only one hour of debate on Ukraine or anything connected to the crisis, which is regrettable.  On 1 March we devoted 90 minutes to discussing the latest in a long line of Amnesty International reports criticising Israel before then turning to have a debate lasting, I think, just 60 minutes, or not much more than that, on Ukraine.  It struck me at the time that if the Ukrainian people had a lobby group funded by billionaires working on their behalf, maybe the Seanad would have debated their plight first.  In the four weeks since then, we have made Seanad time for statements on the credit union sector, the second such debate this year, a Bill on sea fisheries and an EU motion relating to so-called hate crime.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->All of these things are important in their own way but I wonder whether some of them could have been deferred.  Could we not have found more than one hour over eight full sitting days to debate this critical issue?  Most of us here defended the Seanad from its proposed abolition in 2013 but there is a danger sometimes that we show ourselves to be divorced from the concerns of people, which will lead to further and future calls for the Seanad's abolition if we are not careful, although obviously this pales into insignificance compared to the matter before us today.  <\/p><p>The Minister gave us the figures regarding the very generous offers to make space available in people's homes or to make homes available to people.  It is amazing to think that 80% of those offers involve sharing accommodation.  I think the figure is 16,000.  This is very much to be commended.  All of us are thinking about what we ought to do and what we can do and are having discussions with our families about how we would go about it.  Some consideration should be given to making even small payments or stipends available to people who are willing to take refugees into their homes.  It is not something I would seek for myself but there are others who would need that and there are others who would be encouraged and facilitated in doing something that is already very generous.  The T&aacute;naiste ruled it out last Monday in a tone that suggested that it was out of the question.  I do not think Irish people expect to be paid for their generosity but as a gesture of thanks or indeed to help them make preparations, it would not be inappropriate for the State to make some kind of stipend available to people to help them defray initial costs such as new bedding, furnishings, the basic decoration of spare rooms, books and toys for children.  Ten thousand refugees are here at present.  If we gave &euro;1,000 to every host family for each refugee - means tested if you wish - it would cost a paltry &euro;10 million.  It was reported recently that it would cost up to &euro;330 million to accommodate 10,000 refugees in hotels for a full year so I wonder whether this area needs to be reconsidered.  I do not think we can justify spending huge amounts of money to put people up in hotels but then expect people to take refugees into their own homes thereby saving the State a fortune without offering them basic assistance.  I again stress that this is a good thing for people to do; they should do it anyway.  However, the State's response should be more reflective of the contribution people are making.  It is also about Government money and how we spend it.  <\/p><p>I am very glad to see Poland and its contribution being rightly praised at a time when Poland is often unfairly targeted at EU level.  We need to worry seriously about human trafficking.  This crisis presents a big opportunity for evil-doers to engage in the trafficking of people for prostitution and other nefarious purposes.  We need to really care for those people and get it right in terms of how we welcome, accommodate and integrate those coming to our country.  I would be grateful if the Minister could address that issue in whatever way is possible at this point in time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#X00400","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>It is so important that we are discussing this issue today.  It is really hard to believe that our Ukrainian friends are facing such atrocities and horrors and are the victims of Putin's Hitler-style murder and destruction.  I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on the work they and the Department are doing in respect of our response and thank him for the clear update in his speech.  I also congratulate the Government on its leadership.  The way this Government has acted alongside our European partners and the international community has been a matter of pride and we must remain resolute in our solidarity with and support for Ukraine.  We must stand against Putin and his war.  It is time for Europe and western democracies to stand tall in condemning war crimes and demand that Russia ceases all hostilities immediately and withdraws from Ukraine unconditionally.<\/p> <p>I welcome all Ukrainians who have landed in this country.  I know it is so tough for them.  I cannot even comprehend the pain and worry felt by them.  It is beyond anything I can imagine.  It highlights the importance of us providing that safe haven with a welcome, smile and friendship that are so integral to our humanitarian response.  <\/p> <p>We all know it is not going to be simple.  It will be very difficult and will be a challenge.  Certain things will not be perfect.  Services in this country will be put under pressure and I ask everyone in this House and outside to have an open mind, work together and be understanding as this country works to provide refuge for thousands of very welcome people.  I thank all the Irish people for their phenomenal response to and support for the Ukrainian people.  I am proud of this country and Government, which has committed to delivering that multifaceted humanitarian response outlined by the Minister.  I am fully behind us working alongside our European partners.  The people of Ukraine are going through something I never imagined we would ever see.  It highlights how vulnerable our world is, how vulnerable our democracy is and how vulnerable our populations are to manipulation by parties and organisations who are anti-State mules, who want to destroy and who obstruct continuously.  We must always stand against those who support dictators, make excuses for authoritarian regimes, do not abide by the rule of law, do not recognise democratically elected leaders and work to put them down.  To hell with them all.  This is a time for western democracies to stand against despots and authoritarian regimes and if we do not do this now, we will see a repeat of what is happening in Ukraine.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#Y00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>This debate is overdue.  I recognise the tremendous efforts of the Minister and the Department to deal with the crisis caused by what has happened in Ukraine.  We will leave that discussion for another day.  There is little doubt that these people have suffered great trauma.  Seventeen days ago, I travelled to Lviv in Ukraine to see at first hand the conditions refugees were facing in advance of crossing the border.  Things have improved and they are getting through more quickly, which is to be welcomed.  There is a real challenge and the Minister does not need me to explain it to him.  I have visited Poland and have seen at first hand how it is handling it.  I do not think we have seen anything like the scale of the demand just yet.  I hope and I have great faith in the Irish people that they will stick with it.  Everybody I have met wants to be part of the solution right now.  This will require holding the nerve as numbers increase.  We are at 10,000.  It is a long way to 100,000 and it is a phenomenal distance to 200,000 in terms of stretching not just accommodation but our services and resources.  This gives the Minister time as the key co-ordinator to work with State agencies and services to ramp up.<\/p> <p>Even in the early stages, they are under pressure, particularly in terms of health.  Senator Garvey will know the area I am talking about very well - Lisdoonvarna, Doolin and Kilshanny.  The principals of three schools there got together and, working with the Department, effectively managed a plan.  They are doing so blind because the Department is catching up but they are driving ahead.  They are looking at the employment of teachers and putting the infrastructure in place.  That is great.  <\/p> <p>The health service is under enormous pressure anyway.  We do not need to talk about Covid, etc., but there is a gap there.  We need to look to the community that has arrived.  I spoke to a number of people in the facilities over the weekend.  I visited most of them in Clare.  There are doctors, nurses, dentists and teachers.  The skill sets are there within the community.  I am not talking about employing them straight away.  I am just talking about building that community, enabling it and giving it the cover to assist its own.  These are high-functioning people who want to work.  They do not want to be here.  They would prefer to be at home and the bulk of them will go back in due course when things settle.  They just need that support structure around them.  It does not have to be overly burdensome.  We just need key co-ordinators in locations with large numbers of refugees.  I do not want to over-emphasise Clare, which has opened its arms.  Support is needed there.  <\/p> <p>The Minister spoke about a location in Limerick as a point of contact.  I think it should be at Shannon Airport because, quite frankly, people are coming through the airport.  It has been done at Rosslare, which is the right thing to do at the point of entry.  The journey from the airport to Limerick is a distance.  The point of contact should be located at the airport and I ask the Minister to give consideration to that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#Y00300","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for taking these statements.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to begin by remembering just how horrific it is that today in Ukraine, particularly in cities such as Mariupol, there are people who are hungry to the point of the risk of death.  There are people without water.  There are people trapped in buildings.  This is all due to the oppression and the absolutely horrific, incalculable infliction of suffering by Putin and his crew in their decisions to go into Ukraine.  At all times, it behoves us to make sure in our responses and as we discuss how we are responding to it that we never normalise it.  We should never allow it to drop from the very first item on the news because it is such a horrific assault on democracy and on a country.  <\/p><p>The people who are coming here, the vast majority being women and children, are going to find themselves in a place where they are waiting for bad news.  I cannot imagine how horrific that would be.  Anything that we do is well deserved and well warranted in our standing against Putin's oppression and our standing with people who are going forward and making the ultimate sacrifice while their wives, sisters, mothers and children escape.  A population has been weaponised in this flood of refugees, which is a deliberate tactic of war.  <\/p><p>Perhaps because of my unique involvement and insight in all of this, I have had the opportunity to speak to people in Ukraine and to try to assist them in moving with their families to Ireland.  Many do not want to leave Ukraine.  They believe this is short and if they can endure for the next couple of months some sort of normality will be returned.  It is difficult to cope with those conversations when one looks from the safety of Ireland and thinks that even if that is the case, the rebuilding of cities will take an exceptionally long time.  We are in this for a much longer haul.  I would exhort us as a nation to look at the cost of flights, as they are very expensive.  We should look at some intervention in that regard.  I know there is potentially a longer-term plan for if there is mass exodus, but what critical point has to arrive for us to intervene with airlines to assist people in leaving?  <\/p><p>I am very proud of the accommodation and humanitarian responses from the Irish people.  It is no less, in a way, than I would expect.  That has been exhibited over decades of absolute generosity in our own terms, always to exhort the generosity.  That is done very well.  <\/p><p>Given that we have such a large volume of women and children, obviously my mind goes to childcare, even for just the respite of women being able to meet and speak, not even work - but obviously they need to work at some point.  The counselling psychologist in me says that when they arrive and take a breath and see the Irish media and are exposed to the perspective from Ireland, I think only then will the trauma truly hit.  The fear of those families left behind will only hit then.  If we can mobilise community centres and communal spaces for women and children to gather and speak, there will be a therapeutic value to that in and of itself.  There is value in being able to discuss that shared experience, even if we do not initially have or are working on having counselling services available.  Certainly, creating that space where people can come together is important.<\/p><p>I am mindful of all that the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and the Department of Social Protection have done.  The Minister&rsquo;s Department has been exceptional and the Minister has shown exceptional leadership.  I thank him for that.  Does the Minister have enough people for all he is doing?  If I were to call on anything from my own Government colleagues it would be to support and ensure the Minister is further resourced because it is certainly well channelled. <\/p><p>Lastly, I wish to congratulate the Red Cross.  Liam O&rsquo;Dwyer has done an exceptional job there.  The Red Cross has been wonderful, as well as the auctioneers and estate agents who are assisting around the country.  The level of voluntary support is just exceptional and every day reveals more and more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#Y00400","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I am in the schedule next to speak.

I want to start off by saying how proud I am, and I know so many others are, of the enormous humanitarian response by the Irish people.  We saw a vote taken in Westminster yesterday that effectively makes it illegal for Ukrainians to arrive in the UK without proper paperwork, with a risk of up to four years in prison.  The contrast with Ireland&rsquo;s response could not be more stark.  It is a reflection of what our State and people are capable of when we put our minds to it.<\/p> <p>While people in Ireland and our communities have very much opened their arms to refugees fleeing this deadly and horrendous war, the experience on the ground &ndash; certainly my experience on the ground &ndash; is that there is a very patchy system of joined-up thinking between those who are looking at how we house, how we educate and how we provide financial and health support to those coming here.  I accept everything the Minister said in his speech about the work that is being done by his Department.  Certainly, my own experience jars with some of that.  <\/p> <p>I have a number of questions.  Firstly, what are the help and resources that we are putting into our schools now for Ukrainians who are coming into our education system?  I know one school that is taking in 30 boys over the coming days, which is a large number in the context of the overall numbers in that school.  Two miles up the road there is another school that has 17 teachers out today because of Covid &ndash; and of course Covid has not gone away.  There are very real questions about what psychological, language and other educational supports are going into schools at the moment.  I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, talking on the radio at 1 p.m. and she said that the numbers are only running into the hundreds with regard to children at the moment.  However, in the same interview it was mentioned that a third of those coming into the country are minors.  Therefore, there is a real issue of coming to terms with the number of school-going kids who are coming into the country, whether they are getting into the education system and how we are looking after them.  Senator Seery Kearney and others said that the trauma they are coming from and that they will only come to terms with now that they are in safety will be enormous.<\/p> <p>The second issue is around the co-ordination between the Department of Social Protection, the Minister&rsquo;s Department and Tusla.  Again, I fully accept the Minister set out very detailed work that is going on on the ground.  However, I know of a situation last Saturday night where there were 60 people in the convent in Buttevant and there was the very real issue of nobody from IPAS or the Department of Social Protection there to help out.  <\/p> <p>There is a real issue now about those coming in through places other than Dublin and Rosslare.  I am very glad and heartened to hear that a system is being put in place in Rosslare, because I understand as of Monday morning there was chaos there when the Stena ship arrived into the harbour.  Credit goes to Stena for offering those free sailings from Cherbourg.<\/p> <p>The third issue is housing.  As the Minister said, the challenge is enormous.  If Ireland eventually receives the 2% of the estimated 10 million Ukrainian refugees, that increase in population is almost the size of Cork city and its suburbs.  It is hard to get our heads around that.  We absolutely need to make sure that all refugees in this country, those in direct provision and Ukrainians coming in, are housed in dignified and decent conditions.  We know refugees will say that they only want to come for a short period of time, but history tells us differently.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to think about the short term but we also need to think about the longer term with regard to housing.<\/p><p>The response by communities and people throughout this country has been magnificent but this urgent response also requires quick decisions on planning, procurement and the provision of material and services.  We know where inflation is at currently and the direction it will go in the coming months.  It is important to state, and I feel strange doing so, that this crisis must not provide an opportunity to those who would seek to profiteer from the misery of others and the necessary haste of the Government in having to make decisions.  I am not making an argument not to spend, far from it.  When we are buying up vacant student accommodation rooms and hotel rooms and other emergency spending that has to take place in this State, the hands of the State must not be tied and we must ensure people are not unnecessarily profiteering from this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#Z00300","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I welcome all the Ukrainian people who have arrived on our island.  I also commend the generosity of the Irish people to date.  Where does one even begin?  What we are watching is totally inhumane, grotesque and deeply unnecessary.  It is difficult to watch and sometimes we switch off from the news.  What a privileged position that is to be in to be able to do that.  It is certainly not a privilege enjoyed by Ukrainian people either at home under siege or abroad watching on.  They have shown incredible courage, bravery and heroism.  Obviously, they have our unwavering solidarity.<\/p> <p>As a non-aligned nation and a member of the UN Security Council, Ireland has an important role to play in providing leadership in terms of the humanitarian effort that is required.  We should be leading the drive at the UN for the opening of humanitarian corridors to provide relief and assistance to civilians.  I welcome that the Minister indicated in his contribution that we have called for unrestricted safe passage for civilians out of areas of military operations.  I acknowledge that part of his speech.  Hopefully that will bear fruit.  It is the least any person can expect; the right to international protection.  <\/p> <p>The priority for everyone must be to end the invasion and secure full Russian withdrawal form Ukraine.  The economic sanctions have been welcome but they need to be strengthened at the meeting of the European Council.  Now is not the time for incremental strengthening.  We need maximum sanctions.  The Irish Government should press for that.  <\/p> <p>The Government indicated some time ago that rather than expelling the Russian ambassador from Dublin we would do something else in terms of a diplomatic response.  I am not sure what steps have been taken in that regard.  We are all aware of Putin&rsquo;s diplomatic footprint across Europe.  That needs to be challenged, certainly in Ireland where security experts have questioned the size and scale of its operation here.<\/p> <p>In terms of the plan, the humanitarian crisis we are watching demands action from all of us but we need to see the detail of where people will be accommodated and how this will all work in practice.  It would be remiss of me not to mention that countries in Africa, as we read in the news, are at risk of famine due to their reliance on goods coming from Russia and Ukraine.  <\/p> <p>In the context of this debate, I am concerned when I hear the Minister, Deputy Coveney, talk about the EU&rsquo;s strategic compass, saying that Ireland would play a significant role in the EU rapid reaction force.  Neutrality is central to our foreign policy.  Our blue helmet work has allowed Ireland to make a major contribution to peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts around the world.  Irish people are proud of that tradition.  At all times there must be someone in the room who is not militarily aligned.  <\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  Is there a single Department responsible for the national response?  Is that his Department?  Numerous Departments are involved in it.  The Minister might address that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#AA00200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome to the Chamber and I wish him and his Department well in his work on this ongoing crisis.  I would like to show my solidarity with the Ukrainian people, those who are fleeing war and those who are still in their own country.  I am proud that Ireland is standing in solidarity and supporting the Ukrainian people at this awful time.  I warmly welcome the Ukrainian people who have arrived in Ireland and those still making their way here.  They have suffered an immense loss and I hope they find Ireland to be somewhere they can feel a sense of safety and belonging.<\/p> <p>The invasion of Ukraine and the resulting refugee crisis is a human tragedy on an almost overwhelming scale.  So many people have been driven from their homes by the Russian military assault.  Again, the response from the European community, including Ireland, has been heartening.  This crisis has had a deep resonance with the Irish people and they are eager to help in whatever ways they can.  It is truly inspiring. <\/p> <p>While I am inspired by the support shown for those displaced by the invasion of Ukraine, I worry that a hierarchy of victims is being created.  For Palestinians, Yemenis and people of other oppressed and occupied nations, seeing the western world rush to condemn Russian imperialism and embrace displaced Ukrainians has been bittersweet.  On one hand, no one is better able to understand and empathise with the anger, fear and desperation that Ukrainians feel than these peoples who are also being killed and dispossessed by larger aggressor nations.  On the other hand, seeing the suffering of other people capture attention and sympathy around the world when one&rsquo;s own plight is ignored is extremely painful.  We must remember that all human suffering deserves our attention and our outrage.  I am referring to invasions, occupations and bombing campaigns targeting civilians.  These war crimes are just as vile no matter who they target.  We need to extend this degree of empathy to all victims of oppression and war. <\/p> <p>I hope this moment generates a moral reckoning with how we have treated people coming to Ireland who are fleeing violence and conflict.  So many people have been subject to the awful conditions and endless waiting of direct provision.  Many have had their applications for protection turned down on flimsy pretences necessitating drawn-out, emotionally taxing legal battles.  Asylum seekers have had to fight for their right to work and their right to cook for their children, as the Minister well knows and I know he works hard on this area.  I hope this is the beginning of a new chapter in Ireland&rsquo;s response to the migrant crisis, one that demonstrates compassion and humanity that we can be proud of as a nation.<\/p> <p>The temporary protection directive activated across the EU is a timely and effective response to this unfolding disaster.  It will allow the Ukrainians coming to Ireland regularised status and access to public services.  Its application to all residents of Ukraine at the time of the invasion and its emphasis on keeping families together demonstrates admirable compassion and foresight.  This is a very humane vision and it should be replicated in Ireland&rsquo;s approach to refugees fleeing violence and persecution elsewhere.  The best way to do this is via the International Protection (Family Reunification) (Amendment) Bill introduced by my colleagues in the Civil Engagement Group and former Senator Collette Kelleher.  This Bill, which is on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, would allow refugees and those in receipt of subsidiary protection to apply for permission for close family members to enter and reside in the State.  If passed, the Bill would help alleviate the sense of isolation, worry and guilt experienced by many refugees as they try to build a new life for themselves in Ireland, far away from their families.<\/p> <p>Accommodating so many refugees from Ukraine and elsewhere will be a challenge.  My concern is that the Irish State has been unwilling to use its financial and administrative capacity to make much of a dent in homelessness figures or the number of asylum seekers languishing in direct provision.  Faced with the arrival of tens of thousands of refugees the Government plans to use hotel rooms and spare rooms in private residences as an initial response.  This is not a permanent solution.  We know all too well how damaging it is to confine people, especially children, in hotel rooms and other forms of temporary accommodation.  Plans for more suitable long-term accommodation are urgently needed.<\/p> <p>The State needs to rediscover its capacity for ambitious intervention in social affairs.  Almost 100 years ago, while under massive financial strain this State built social housing that still stands today.  The miraculous roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccines is an example of what a disciplined, well-resourced State project can achieve in modern times.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The State needs to marshal its resources to renovate the over 90,000 vacant homes around the country.

He is, on a personal level, deeply invested in addressing the questions of direct provision.  This is not an either-or matter.  He has shown that he is deeply committed to resolving this problem and that there is a compassionate response to an appalling human tragedy.  I am extremely proud of the approach that the Taoiseach and the Government have taken at European level of being to the fore in ensuring that the toughest possible sanctions are levied against a war criminal, a thug and somebody who does not respect international law.  In addition, the strongest possible supports that can be made available are being made available to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that the following issue is slightly outside the remit of the Minister.  In terms of humanitarian support, there are a number questions on education and training provision that we need to address.  Our education and training systems - our universities, colleges and schools - are looking to respond in the best way they possibly can but the situation will present enormous challenges.  A lot of English language supports will need to be made available to children, young people and adults.  Support systems will need to be put in place for the children who come to this country in order to bring them into our education system while remembering that many of them will have experienced trauma.  Let us consider that these young children will have spent time in school with their friends before being removed from that normality and brought thousands of kilometres across Europe only to enter a very different school environment where the language and curriculum is different.  School places and additional supports will need to be made available.<\/p> <p>There are also challenges in higher education and research and I hope that they are in the process of being addressed.  This matter includes Ukrainian students who are in higher education or training programmes.  Will we be able to recognise their qualifications when they come to Ireland?  Will they be allowed to finish their courses here?  Will the necessary supports be put in place for them?<\/p> <p>We need to clarify the situation for Ukrainian students who are already here.  The decision to effectively recognise students from the Ukraine as EU citizens is correct.  However, there are Ukrainian students here who have already paid non-EEA fees and that anomaly needs to be addressed. Also, a small but not insignificant number of Irish students were studying in Ukraine or Russia but they have now come home.  We must find ways for them to finish their education and training.  I hope that we can address some of these matters in the supports that we provide.<\/p> <p>We need to address the issue of Russian and Belarusian citizens who are based here.  I mean we must ensure that ordinary Russian and Belarusian people are not blamed for the activities of their autocratic leaders.  Most of us who have spoken to anyone from Russia or Belarus who are based here in Ireland will know that they abhor what is going on in their home countries.  It will be important in the discourse that we have that we do not in any way be seen to discriminate against those people who have made Ireland their home.  We have often spoken in this House about Belarus.  Quite frankly, Lukashenko needs to be removed and it is ordinary citizens who are leading that fight.  For ordinary Russians and Belarusians, we need to ensure that, as part of this campaign, that support is put in place.<\/p> <p>Finally, I wish to raise an issue that I know my Wexford colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has also raised.  I refer to the fact that significant additional pressures are now being placed on Rosslare Europort.  I know that the Government has made moves to address some of them but Rosslare Europort is important.  Local resources are doing their best in terms of the garda&iacute;, customs, immigration and everyone else.  The place will need significant supports if the numbers that are anticipated arrive through the port.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#BB00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I wish to give half of my time to Senator Maria Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#BB00300","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I can give the Senator five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#BB00400","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Can Senator Byrne comment straight after I finish talking?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#BB00500","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#BB00600","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Is that okay with Senator Byrne?

For good or bad he is now the lead Minister who is dealing with the Government's response and I think the matter is in very capable hands.<\/p> <p>Over the last number of days I have engaged extensively with people from Ukraine who have sought refuge in this country and I have a number of questions.  The Minister is in charge of what I would describe as a whole-of-government response.  He may not have answers to all of my questions which, even though they may not relate to his Department, will certainly be channelled through his Department.<\/p> <p>My first question is on the yellow letter that Ukrainians receive that grants them permission to remain here for one year.  There is confusion because some people believe that the duration is three years.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether the period is one or three years or one year with the potential to extend for another two years.  I seek that clarification because it is clear that the war will be protracted.<\/p> <p>Second, many Ukrainians are being accommodated in hotels.  They want to know whether they will remain in a hotel or go to family homes and other accommodation.  Can they remain in hotels if they so wish?  If people come from a war-torn country and are staying in a hotel then they want to know whether that is where they will remain for six months or whether there will be alternative accommodation.  A number of Ukrainians have raised this issue with me.  I was very fortunate to have a Ukrainian translator and on Monday night I met dozens of Ukrainian refugees when I got a flavour of the issues that affect them.<\/p> <p>Third, some of the refugees drove to Rosslare Europort and Dublin Port to get here.  They have cars while other refugees have cars in the Ukraine.  Will the Ukrainian driver licence be applicable here?<\/p> <p>Fourth, some Ukrainian refugees are qualified to drive trucks in Ukraine and they have also driven trucks in Europe.  Is the Government engaging with the Road Safety Authority to clarify whether their truck licences will be respected and accredited here?<\/p> <p>Another issue is insurance.  Has anyone in government engaged with the private insurance industry?  I ask because a number of the refugees have heard about the rip-off insurance costs in this country.  Given the fact that they are coming from the Ukraine to Ireland they do not have any no claims bonus driving history in this country.  Will the insurance companies step up to the plate and provide reasonable insurance to them so as to allow them to drive the cars that they have brought with them from Ukraine or if they buy a car here?<\/p> <p>Another issue is the cost of public transport in rural Ireland and I have raised this issue here for years.  One must pay an awful lot more to travel by train from Ennis to Galway than from Maynooth to Dublin.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Most of the Ukrainians living in places like Ballyvaughan and Lisdoonvarna in County Clare - up to 99% of them - do not have cars and are reliant on public transport to get into the capital town to do shopping and other things.  The buses were overrun during the St. Patrick's Day weekend.  Some bus operators are running free services for Ukrainians while others are charging them.  Is there a policy such that people who come from Ukraine will get a bus ticket for three months free of charge?  I acknowledge this issue is not a matter for the Minister's Department but, as the leading Department overall, I expect him to be able to answer the question.  Transport is a major issue.<\/p><p>On education, including higher education, I have engaged with young people in Ukraine who are doing the equivalent of the leaving certificate and who want to go to college in September.  How will that work for the young people who come here?  Has the Minister been engaging with the Department of Education to come up with protocols in this regard?  I spoke to a student in Ukraine who has spent five years studying medicine there.  Will that person be able to transfer to study medicine in Ireland?  Again, as the Minister's Department is the lead Government agency on these issues, I hope he can answer that question.<\/p><p>I spoke to a woman who has been fostering in Ukraine for years and has looked after many dozens of children.  She fled the country with eight children, a couple of whom are her own and the remainder of whom are foster children.  She has been trying unsuccessfully to contact the authorities she was told to contact when she got to Ireland.  I gave her reassurance that nobody would interfere with her looking after the children.  I presume I was correct in doing so.  This is another issue that needs clarity.  We must have daily briefings that give answers to some of the questions I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#BB00900","speaker":"1644","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in the mammoth task he is co-ordinating on behalf of the Government and the State.  There is no doubt the people of Ukraine continue to suffer under the tyrannical and dictatorial actions of Putin.  The scenes keep going from bad to worse every day.  We see them on our telephones and television screens and in the newspapers.  It is shocking that almost 150 children have been killed and 57 schools and 12 hospitals have been bombed.  The list goes on.<\/p> <p>Last week, I spent a number of days at the Council of Europe, along with the Leas-Chathaoirleach, engaging with nine female parliamentarians from Ukraine.  Seeing the pain and terror in their faces and listening to their experiences was incredible.  One of the parliamentarians brought her two young daughters with her because there was nobody at home to mind them as their father, grandfather, uncles etc. were off fighting.  As hard as it was to listen to these women, it was harder to say goodbye when they left on Wednesday to travel back overland to Ukraine.  We did not know whether we would get a chance to see and speak to them again.  They have been involved in setting up a group, Parliamentarians for Ukraine, which is spearheaded by a former Prime Minister of Lithuania.  I joined the group's first call yesterday morning and I recommend that Members of the Seanad and D&aacute;il sign up to it.  It is important that we, as parliamentarians, look at what we can do even outside of the whole humanitarian element.  As legislators, we need to put policies in place.<\/p> <p>The outpouring of support from the Irish people continues.  The humanity our people have shown is nothing short of phenomenal.  Like Senator Conway, I have been liaising with Ukrainians and volunteers throughout my area of south Kildare.  We really have managed to unite people in this effort.  The crisis has brought communities together in a meaningful way but more needs to be done on the co-ordination of the community response.  I have emailed the Minister with some suggestions in that regard.  Throughout the country, we are seeing men and women, young and old, coming together and going to extraordinary lengths to support the Ukrainians.  My friend, Angie Goff, who is in Dublin, has, together with Ireland for Ukraine, found homes for more than 100 families in private households.  That effort began two days after the war started and she has done phenomenal work.  We hope the people who have been housed can be absorbed into the Irish Red Cross effort.  Ms Goff has had conversations with its secretary general, Liam O'Dywer, but there needs to be clarity around these issues.<\/p> <p>In my housing estate in Newbridge, young children have been going door to door selling blue and yellow cupcakes to raise money for the Irish Red Cross.  My neighbours, Freddie and Breda Reid, have already taken in a family of seven and I have registered to take people into my home.  Local hospitality businesses have given their premises for volunteers to meet.  Pharmacies have sourced badly needed medical supplies to send to Ukraine.  Local schools have contributed.  I mention Ardscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide in Athy in particular because Stephen Prior, who is doing a transition year placement with me, goes to school there.  He is the buddy of a Ukrainian boy of the same age.  The school has set up a system to absorb the Ukrainians into the community.  Mary Lenihan and Peter Hussey have started organising language classes and social activities for those who are coming.  Tomorrow, a convoy of people, including my sister-in-law, Siobh&aacute;n, will set off for the Polish border to deliver necessary medical equipment and walkie-talkies before taking refugees home with them.  I am in awe of the response of my community.  I always have been a proud lilywhite but never more so than I am right now.  The response by the public has been phenomenal, as has that of the State.<\/p> <p>Colleagues and I have previously raised the actions of Ryanair in increasing the prices of flights.  It is necessary again to call that company out in this regard.<\/p> <p>I want to ask about the situation of the people with disabilities who come here.  Will there be a cental co-ordinating agency to assist them?  There are agencies that want to give that support.  We need to have people stationed at the border of Ukraine to help people before they leave for Ireland.  It is very important we have a presence there.<\/p> <p>As I have outlined, there are some gaps in provision that need to be addressed, but I thank the Minister and his officials for the work they have done to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#CC00200","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the Seanad for this all-important discussion.  Like many colleagues, I have been engaging with Ukrainians in my area of Limerick over the past while.  Only last week, I met with a company called TRANSLIT, the CEO of which, Alex Chernenko, is from Ukraine.  The company is offering free translation services and I assisted it in registering that offer of support.  It has been working with many of the people who are coming here.  The Polish consulate in Limerick has been very much to the fore, with many of its staff providing help to colleagues and neighbours in the region.<\/p> <p>Many of the issues that have been raised with me already have been spoken about by colleagues.  Senator Dooley suggested there be a reception centre at Shannon Airport.  The Minister said there is one in Limerick but I agree there should also be one at Shannon Airport.  It is the first point of entry and welcome in the region.  There are such centres at the ports and in Dublin Airport and I hope he will consider something similar for Shannon.<\/p> <p>Some 5,000 people from Ukraine have arrived in the country, many of them children.  I do not want to see a direct provision situation being provided for them because we are trying to eradicate that system.  We know further large numbers of Ukrainians will be arriving here and they are all very welcome to our country.  We need to look at long-term supports and accommodation for them.  The Minister referred to the Green Glens Arena.  I do not want to see that turned into a type of direct provision accommodation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maria Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I spoke to representatives of many schools and colleges.  Mary Immaculate College in Limerick is taking in many Ukrainian refugees.  It has reached out and that is just one institution that is taking in refugees.  I also understand that more than 1,000 college beds have been pledged as well.  This is most welcome.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to the Irish people and the level of support that has forthcoming.  More than 20,000 beds have been pledged to date and the number is rising.  Only today, people contacted me to ask where they could register their support to provide accommodation.  There is also the humanitarian support.  People have been very generous and not only with financial support.  Many truckloads of donations have also gone out via the local authorities.  Limerick City and County Council has not been found wanting in this regard.  Several truckloads of donations have gone out as a result of the people of Limerick and the mid-west contributing to the fund.  The Redemptorist Fathers have people on the ground who have been living in Ukraine and they have collected a large amount of financial donations from the public.  People have been very generous and that money has gone directly to Ukraine and it is being used to support people by paying for flights for those who cannot afford them.  Equally, it is being used for the provision of food and water and those kinds of things.  It is great to see so many Irish links with the people of Ukraine.  I look forward to receiving regular updates from the Minister.  I compliment him and the Ministers for Justice and Social Protection for the fast turnaround of supports.  The Minister is key to this fast turnaround.  People have been provided with PPS numbers and payments and they have been registered quickly as they arrive in the country.

This debate is on a serious matter.  Our humanitarian response is crucial with regard to what Ireland can give families, particularly mothers and children arriving on our doorstep.  I very much welcome the one-stop shop established to provide access to the different Departments in each of the airports.  This is crucial to show that Ireland means what it says and to welcome these refugees and provide them with safe passage and care and welfare when they arrive.<\/p> <p>I am a spokesperson on education.  In that context, how are we looking at supporting children in school?  We see the number of refugees coming through and more than one-third are aged under 18.  How will we support them at primary and post-primary school levels?   Many towns and villages have outstretched arms and are offering places.  Schools have been done up, including just outside Ballygar in Galway and in Roscommon town, to welcome and support refugees.  My key questions are on education at primary and post-primary school levels.<\/p> <p>Many groups are doing collections and gathering donations.  My understanding in recent days is that what is most important at present is financial aid and giving donations in that way to organisations such as the Irish Red Cross, as opposed to the provision of collections of items to be brought over to countries such as Poland.  The Minister mentioned that vacant properties constitute 20% of all pledges and that he will be matching refugees to properties.  Regarding the timelines for the process, how long will it take? <\/p> <p>The Minister probably referred to this aspect in his speech at the start as well, but what measures have been put in place to support families that take in refugees, be that in terms of counselling or understanding the long-term impacts?

We just have to turn on the radio or the television to feel the shock and devastation, brutality and horror of what is happening.  The words that come back to me all the time are the unnecessary loss of life and devastation.  This causes trauma at the time but it will live with these people for the rest of their lives.  Intergenerationally, this experience will utterly change their lives forever.  I also acknowledge the helplessness of the Ukrainian community in Ireland and how its members have felt watching this unfold.  My heart goes out to them.<\/p> <p>We are seeing the best of people in their generosity.  These are not my words but I agree with them.  We are seeing the best and worst of humanity in this.  We must be wary of people who will seek to prey on vulnerable people through trafficking.  I emphasise the need for resources in this area to look after the welfare of people.  This will expose our own vulnerabilities in our health system and mental health services, housing, English as a foreign language teachers and specific supports in schools.  The Minister and I are representatives who come from Dublin West.  We are familiar with areas such as Tyrrelstown, where 80% of children going to school do not have English as a first language.  This is an opportunity for us to focus on the vulnerabilities that already exist and to ensure we are overproviding in those areas to cope.<\/p> <p>I was proud of what the Taoiseach said about the security checks on UK television last week and that our priority is a humanitarian response.  I am also proud of what Mair&eacute;ad McGuinness said today as European Commissioner concerning the common travel area, which is in the news today for all the wrong reasons.  We have an open door policy.  It is backed up by Government policy and supports.  I wish the UK was following the same path, but it is not.  Plenty of people in the North and the UK, however, want to open their arms as we are doing to support people.  The homes for Ukraine scheme just does not match at present and it has more questions than answers.  Any concern about people using the common travel area to take advantage is utterly wrong and does not reflect the supports here versus what the UK is offering.<\/p> <p>The one-stop shop is fantastic, and then there are pathways to Jobs Ireland and Intreo.  Further supports, including community supports, will be needed thereafter to meet people's needs, to avail of their existing skills that they might want to use, for example to help to care for other people, and to help them to develop new skills.  They might want to learn English, for example.  Technology exists to help in this context.  I know from my exposure to the world of remote working that there are companies that do this type of thing.  They can use maps to match people and I recommend that we look into it, because it could be a service for all.

The generosity expressed in this room is reciprocated all over the country.  I know it is appreciated.  I know that from Ukrainians who just turned up at my Department in the early days of the crisis because that is where they were directed to.  I had a chance to meet and have a brief conversation with them and I also met Ukrainians in my constituency of Dublin West today.  There is a real sense of gratitude and acknowledgement of how the Irish people are seeking to support them in their time of absolute crisis.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne made a very important point in terms of Russians and Belarussians who are living in Ireland.  We have small but vibrant communities of Russians and Belarusians in this country.  In a local school in Clonsilla, I met a young man whose parents were Ukrainian who was asking what the Government was doing at that time, but his teachers also made the point that there are Russian kids in that school as well and they are trying to manage the dialogue in the schoolyard and everywhere else.  It is important to state that every day we see images from Moscow and St. Petersburg of Russian citizens being hauled away in vans.  They have been so brave to go out, knowing what their government is like and what awaits them once they get into the van to be taken to the prison.  There are incredibly brave Russians and Belarussians out there as well and we must remember that in our dialogue.<\/p><p>There has been a lot of discussion on how the Government action is being co-ordinated and I wish to provide as much clarity on that as I can.  Our response to the crisis in Ukraine, but in particular the humanitarian element here, is an all-of-government response.  It is being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.  My Department is responsible for the emergency accommodation needs and the integration supports, but every Department must play and is playing a role.  My Department does not have expertise in education, health or transport supports.<\/p><p>I will try to respond to the questions.  Senator Conway gave me a long list of questions, as have others - rightly so.  I understand that people have questions.  We have created a Ukraine unit now in the Department.  It is primarily focused on the immediate accommodation response.<\/p><p>Senator Sherlock said the response has been patchy in places.  There is always a risk of getting defensive in times like this.  I am sure it has been imperfect.  To be honest, it is going to continue to be imperfect in the short term and probably in the medium term as well.<\/p><p>Senator Garvey made the point that we are creating a system that has never been demanded at such a scale and needed so quickly.  That is what we are doing: we are creating an entirely new system.  A temporary protection directive is something we have never had to deal with before.  We are experiencing numbers we have never had to deal with before.  It is going to be imperfect, but the advocacy of Deputies, Senators and councillors will remind my Department and other Departments where we are not providing the best service and that will enable us to improve.  I hope everybody can work in that way and that where the system is not perfect, we do not turn it into a political football, we highlight it and we seek to address it as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>I wish to address a couple of issues.  Senators Mullen and Currie spoke about trafficking and the like.  What I can speak to there is that so far 22 unaccompanied minors have arrived in this country.  Any unaccompanied minor who arrives in this country falls within the responsibility of Tusla, and it took care of each of the 22 minors.  Of those, 12 were subsequently reunited with family members in Ireland and the remaining ten are now in the care of Tusla.  Tusla has a presence at Dublin Airport.  I will come back to that, but it is important to say the vast majority, 85%, of those arriving in the country are coming through Dublin Airport.  Rosslare Europort and Shannon Airport have seen the next highest numbers, but they are dramatically smaller volumes.  That could change, but that is the situation at the moment.  That is why the hub was put in Dublin Airport rather than elsewhere.  We are establishing one in Rosslare currently.  I accept the argument in terms of Shannon versus Limerick, but there is also a significant number of people living in Limerick city at the moment and in the surrounding areas and easy access is the main concern.  Up to this point, only 450 people out of 10,000 have come in through Shannon Airport.  Of course, that could change, and we can change the arrangement if the need arises.  We must remember that we are only 28 days into this situation.  We had to deploy staff where they were most effective.  We are growing the Ukraine unit and we will continue to grow it as much as possible.  All support for that is appreciated.<\/p><p>The Ukrainian Government has written to us about adoption and to ensure that the crisis is not used to allow adoptions to be rushed through.  That is a <i>pro forma<\/i>approach, but we will respond to it on an official basis.<\/p><p>In terms of education, my Department will facilitate access to the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme and the national childcare scheme through the sponsorship model.  We will provide additional funding, as is necessary.  We will provide childcare providers with Ukrainian language resources for those who want to sign up, but also supports for early years professionals in terms of basic Ukrainian they can use with young children.  We are also providing play facilities in some of the larger reception facilities that may be needed.  We are also looking to link parents in with parent and toddler groups around the country to provide early engagement and a bit of relaxation for parents.  That is something that is important.<\/p><p>The Department of Education is looking at capacity around the country right now.  There are areas of high demand for places.  There are also parts of the country where there is not demand, and we will be seeking in the medium term to link housing provision with that, but it will not always match perfectly.  There is ongoing work to do in that regard.  An example was given of 30 in a school.  I can understand how that is a big challenge for one school.  The Department of Education is providing information to schools in terms of how they facilitate the registration of Ukrainian students at primary and post-primary level.  The Department of Education is also looking to make it easier for Ukrainian teachers to get registered here through the Teaching Council and to simplify that process.  I know a number of professional and regulatory bodies are doing that, in recognition that many Ukrainians do want to work and that is certainly the message that I received.<\/p><p>In terms of higher education, the education and training boards are providing free English language classes and that is a welcome step.  They are also looking at trying to link people in where there are existing skills gaps.  They are also looking at tweaking the Erasmus programme in terms of perhaps allowing Ukrainian third level students to constitute time spent here as an Erasmus year.  That is something that is being done at a European level.  Students may also qualify for European funding as well.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, made some points in that regard.<\/p><p>I am following up on the driver's licence issue raised by Senator Conway.  It was raised earlier today, and I have been in contact with colleagues in the Department of Transport.  We are following up on that and I hope we will have clarity on it soon.<\/p><p>The yellow letter, as it is called, is the letter from the Department of Justice that indicates someone is a beneficiary of the temporary protection directive.  That is for one year initially.  The European Commission may decide to extend the temporary protection directive for up to three years, but the initial grant of temporary protection is for one year and that is what applies.<\/p><p>In terms of the community response, I have spoken to some Deputies and Senators, and I am aware there are concerns that a set of supports is not in place in some areas where Ukrainians have arrived.  It is the case that supports are not everywhere right now.  We are working to address that and to activate local authorities.  In particular, we are looking at the model that was used during Covid based on community fora, which worked well in terms of local authorities bringing together the HSE, Tusla and the local development companies, LDCs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I refer to all these existing networks that are linked in to what is happening on the ground in a particular community.

Senator O'Loughlin made reference to that and highlighted the issue of that wider community engagement.<\/p><p>Ukraine is facing a crisis of unimaginable proportions.  The European Union is stepping up in terms of making generous provision for Ukrainian refugees when they come to member states and Ireland welcomes that.  Ireland will do everything that it can to continue that generosity - a generosity that is at EU level but is also a manifestation of the innate generosity we have always shown when it comes to international crises.<\/p><p>Due to the scale of this situation and because of the speed at which the very large demand is coming to us, our response is being developed.  We do not have the full plan today.  We will not have a full plan for a number of weeks but we are developing it.  We are acting to meet the most urgent needs that people have right now in terms of accommodation, safety and shelter.  That is what we are meeting immediately.  We are giving people the provisions in terms of linking in to social welfare so that they have some element of income to support themselves and we will continue to link in to all the other social supports that all of us here take for granted.<\/p><p>We are 28 days in.  There is much more work to do but my Department and all of government will work with all Senators and Deputies of all parties and none to make sure we can do the very best job for Ukrainians in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#EE00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>What of the refugees getting insurance to drive the cars they have driven over in?

I also thank the Leader for facilitating this debate, given the changes over the past two weeks.  It is very much appreciated.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, to the House.  I put on record once again my thanks to him for his leadership and commitment on this public health issue in bringing forward long overdue legislation in this area, which we look forward to debating in the coming weeks.  However, tonight I have tabled our Bill, the Gambling (Prohibition of Advertising) Bill 2021.  I sincerely hope that the Minister of State can support it and its quickest possible passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>The Labour Party Bill is attempting to break the continuing attempts of gambling companies to normalise sport and gambling.  These companies have quite successfully associated the need to gamble, not just in mainstream sports, but in practically every sporting event that takes place.  However, this is not just confined to sporting events, as we all know.  We would like to see people being able to go back to enjoying sport without having a tsunami of gambling advertisements coming at them through visual and print media before, during and after these events.<\/p><p>Gambling companies portray gambling as a great social outlet that people are simply missing out on if they are not having a bet on the sporting occasion that they are watching.  You are not being part of the gang if you are not having a bet.  The reality, of course, as many who have developed an addiction will say, is betting on their phone alone, without the knowledge of their loved ones or those friends the gambling companies portray in their advertisements.  At the moment, there is no watershed on gambling advertising in Ireland.  During the pandemic, we have heard so many stories of parents having to explain to children as young as six and seven, who they were homeschooling at the time, what gambling was all about.  No child as young as this should be exposed to such advertising.  It is simply not good enough.  <\/p><p>One of the most frightening findings of a recent Health Research Board, HRB, report, was that 20% of young men aged 15 to 24 who have gambled in the past year are either problem gamblers or are at risk of developing an addiction.  The report&rsquo;s authors state that they may have underestimated this group.  The same report identified 12,000 people in the country with a severe addiction and more than 130,000 who are at some of risk of developing a problem.  Other reports suggest that 40,000 people in this country have an addiction.  That, of course, is one of the problems, as I am sure the Minister of State is aware.  The lack of comprehensive reporting on this problem is an issue that needs to be addressed.  We have for too long relied on comparing research and reports from the UK and from the rest of the world in trying to estimate the problem here and where we might offer our supports.  <\/p><p>Whatever the true figure, this is a growing problem and I think we can all agree on that.  It is wrong to not have restrictions on when gambling advertisements can take place, as well as the number of them.  We hope that that can be addressed through this legislation.  <\/p><p>One of these reports from 2019 noted that Irish people could be spending as much as &euro;9.8 billion per year, marking us out as the seventh biggest spenders on gambling <i>per capita<\/i>, with almost &euro;380 for every man, woman and child in this country.  We in the Labour Party carried out our own survey on gambling in which 80% of respondents reported seeing an increase in the number of gambling advertisements they saw.  More worrying was the almost 65% who said they were more inclined to gamble after seeing these advertisements.  This is a figure that will please the gambling companies but that will set off serious alarm bells here and for our health system.  <\/p><p>From the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland to gambling addiction support advocates such as Ois&iacute;n McConville, Niall McNamee and Davy Glennon, to gambling addiction supporting organisations, such as Extern Problem Gambling and, Cuan Mhuire, among many other fine support groups, there has been one consistent recent message: we must get rid of the number of gambling advertisements in this country, which is without a doubt adding to this public health problem.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Wall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Indeed, our own President Michael D. Higgins hit out recently at what he described as &quot;'dangerous'&quot; gambling advertisements, which he said were causing &quot;so much damage to families and ... individuals&quot;.  The President went on to say that his &quot;heart had been 'broken' regularly during the pandemic as he saw advertisement after advertisement for gambling apps during sports programmes accompanied by ... [what he described as] 'totally minimal, tokenistic invitations to be responsible.'&quot; He was quoted as saying it was &quot;not good enough.&quot;  That is the problem - minimal and tokenistic invitations to be responsible.  This was our President getting it right once again.<br\/><br\/>Some of the gambling companies have come together to set up their own code of practice.  I, for one, welcome any attempt to address this problem.  Despite these efforts, some of the bigger gambling companies have not signed up to their own self-regulated code of practice.  Indeed, it led to some of the gambling companies at the recent Joint Committee on Justice pre-legislative scrutiny meeting calling for and supporting a gambling regulator, which I hope the Minister of State's legislation will provide for in the next year.<br\/><br\/>Our legislation can bring forward regulation and put in place a summer of sport and enjoyment rather than a summer of misery for a growing number of our population.  Over the past two years since we started to look at this possible legislation, I have been contacted by many people.  They wanted to share their heartbreaking stories of losing family homes, relationships and families.  Many described how they had lost their jobs, and, most unfortunately, there were stories of lives ending because of an addiction that people could simply no longer live with.  It is also important to relay the real-life experience of living with gambling addiction and how it affects the person, their families and communities.  I know many in this House will have experienced such stories in their clinics and when meeting their constituents.  I would like to outline two such cases.<br\/><br\/>The first is a young man who came to me recently for help with housing.  He had recently split from his partner and was now living apart from her and his three children.  It was only after a number of meetings that this man felt secure enough to tell me his full story.  He was working to gamble and using every opportunity to use the gambling app on his phone without the knowledge of his partner.  It was only when the bills mounted up that she became aware of the problem.  He has now handed over control of his bank account to a family member.  He is so insecure in his inability to stop his habit, he has begun to see an addiction counsellor.  He wants to build his life again.<br\/><br\/>The second example is an update on a young lady I spoke about in the House last year.  This young lady started gambling following a visit to her local pub.  She described wanting to join in the fun and she placed her first bet.  She described how when her next pay day arrived, she thought the smart choice would be to take out her wages and double them so that she could pay back the money she owed.  This did not happen, however.  The following years of her life would become a vicious cycle of self-destructive behaviour that would eventually lead to hospitalisation.  She stated that she felt like dying and wanted the doctors to tell her what terrible physical disease was causing these issues rather than truly admitting to herself that her suffering was a result of her addiction.  This young woman became a mother of two young children and although she at times felt her children would be better off without her, she eventually made a decision to seek help.  She continued to deal with the stigma and shame that our society puts on those suffering with gambling addiction, especially, as she said herself, the stigma of a woman and mother with this addiction.  Thankfully, one year on, this young woman stated that she had a great year.  She has set up her own business helping those with gambling addiction and will shortly take part in an international conference on gambling research.  She has asked me to contribute the following to this debate, however, and I do so now on her behalf:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe responsible gambling measures poured out by the gambling industry are nothing more than a tick-box exercise.  These ads fail to inform customers of the highly addictive nature of the products they sell.  They place all the blame on the individual and there is no mention of that fact that those who suffer from gambling addiction are three times more likely to take their own lives than any other addiction.  People are not being educated about the products being sold to them and lives are being lost while the gambling industry thrives.  This is unacceptable and needs to change now. <\/blockquote><p>The Labour Party is not against gambling.  Many people in this country can control what they spend when they gamble.  However, we feel the evidence is building that there are a number of citizens who cannot control their gambling addiction or are at risk of developing a further addiction.  This is why we have put forward this Bill and join a growing conversation seeking help and legislation for many.  Frankly, we can all accept that it has taken way too long to get to this stage.  We now need to enact this Bill.  We must stop the bombardment of gambling advertisements.  As I said previously, it is way beyond time that we are all allowed to enjoy sport once again without this forced normalisation of sport and gambling.<br\/><br\/>We look forward to the legislation the Minister of State will bring forward.  We thank him once again for his work and dedication on it.  We will actively take part in its assessment and passage through the Oireachtas.  We feel the Government must act now, however.  This Bill gives Government the mechanism to give us all the opportunity to take a breath and give us all back the ability to once again enjoy that match, race or game without feeling the need to dip into our pockets for money that many simply do not have.  The time for talking has long passed.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply and to assisting those who have reached out to me and other Labour Party colleagues.  I am hopeful the legislation we have brought forward can help and change their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#JJ00500","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Wall so much for his passion on the subject.

I echo the thanks my colleague, Senator Wall, has given in that the Government has allowed time for us to debate this Bill today.  I grew up in a household where there was, if I may call it this, a healthy scepticism of the two main political parties at the time.  While there would be a discussion about the issues of the day, there was certainly never any talk about specific legislation.<\/p><p>I grew up being very aware of one Act for which there was enormous respect in my house, however, which was the Family Home Protection Act 1976.  It was introduced well before I was born to ensure the family home could not be sold or given away over the head on any one spouse in particular, which was usually the woman.  I grew up hearing the story of a man, and this was before 1976, who was a problem gambler who went out one night, played a game of poker and lost the family home in that game.  He had to go home to his wife that night and tell her he had lost the house.  The following day, she took her own life.<\/p><p>Whether it is playing the lotto, placing an annual bet on the English or Irish grand national, entering the local GAA draw or going to the races, gambling in itself is not an egregious act.  I grew up with all that.  What is egregious, however, is that day in, day out in this country, gambling companies spend millions of euro trying to induce more and more people into gambling.  I think of one advertisement in particular.  What is most outrageous about it all is that there is a blatant attempt to communicate a message that everyone is doing it and this is a normal daily activity whether someone is <i>en route<\/i>to a wedding, out with friends or going about his or her work.  The psychology behind these advertisements is that if you are not part of the club or not doing it, then, in some ways, you are not normal.<\/p><p>Ireland has a gambling problem.  In 2019, we had the seventh highest gambling spend <i>per capita<\/i>in the world.  The<b><\/b>College of Psychiatrists of Ireland talks about the pervasiveness of gambling addiction and has labelled it a &quot;hidden epidemic&quot; in this country.<\/p><p>I am so proud of my colleague, Senator Wall, in all the work he has done in this area.  I know the Government has highlighted its plans in this area and we will not be found wanting in supporting those.  There is an urgency in bringing forward this legislation, however, and moving on with the gambling regulator.  Our Bill to ban gambling advertising is only one small but hugely significant step in addressing this hidden epidemic in this country.  The ban would strip commercial gambling of its glamour.  It would take the constant reminder of gambling away from our screens and allow us to enjoy those matches or races without the constant interference flashing across our television screens.  For the thousands of problem gamblers trying to deal with their addiction, it is one less image in their faces as they try to deal with their problem.  As Senator Wall said, our Bill is not a ban on gambling itself but it does send a message that the manipulation of gambling through advertising must end.  He referred to research that showed 63% of people were more likely to place a bet after seeing an advertisement.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That cycle needs to be broken and that is why it is vital ads are banned across all media platforms, in print and online.  In needing to ban gambling advertising, we are recognising that Ireland has a major problem and many young people, particularly young men, have that problem.  In 2019, the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs showed that Irish 16-year-olds were 1.3 times more likely to bet on sports and animal betting and 1.8 times more likely to use slot machines than other young adults on average across Europe.  That 61% of all 16-year-olds in this country are betting on sports and racing tells a story in itself.<\/p><p>We are all aware that it is not as simple as banning gambling ads.  There is so much more that has to be done but we have to make a start.  Too many lives are lost, too many livelihoods are forgone and too many families are crushed by this gambling problem.  I hope the Minister of State will support this Bill and its speedy progress into law as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#KK00300","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for those details.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#LL00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber again.  Fianna F&aacute;il will not be opposing this Bill, the purpose of which is to ban the advertising of gambling, except where such advertising is in connection with the promotion of a gambling event for charitable status or purposes, subject to limited expectations.  The Bill also specifically distinguishes between advertising on television and radio and all other forms of advertising.<\/p> <p>Last October the Government approved the draft of the gambling regulation Bill and the publication of the corresponding general scheme.  The scheme has been referred for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Government&rsquo;s Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation with careful consideration of policy and drafting to avoid unintended consequences and legal uncertainty.  The Private Members&rsquo; Bill, as currently drafted, could not be supported on Committee Stage.  It is expected the Government&rsquo;s gambling regulation Bill will be in a position to be published and progressed through the Oireachtas in 2022.  Senator Wall and members of all parties and none would agree the legislative framework is fragmented and outdated, lacks a coherent licensing and regulatory approach and is in need of significant reform.  The programme for Government gives a clear commitment to establish a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being, covering gambling online and in person and the powers to regulate advertising, gambling websites and apps, which has been outlined by Members.<\/p> <p>All Members of this House will recognise the significant work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, since he took office.  The issue needs to be addressed comprehensively and the gambling regulation Bill, which will introduce a gambling regulatory authority, will do this.  The scheme takes into account the recommendations of an expert report, including the interdepartmental working group report published in March 2019, analysis of the regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions, and the nature of gambling in the State.  It also recognises the ever-increasing impact of technology on gambling and addresses the proliferation of gambling-related advertising.  The authority will have among its key objectives ensuring gambling is conducted in a fair and open way for companies to make decisions in certainty, requiring safeguards to address problem gambling, including on gambling advertising, and preventing gambling from being a source of or support to crime.  We will be better served by acting on all of the challenges in this area as a whole, including advertising, rather than doing so on a stand-alone basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#LL00300","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I know how committed he is to this topic.  When he was a member of the Opposition he spoke on this a lot and I know he has put in a lot of work on it since becoming a Minister of State.<\/p> <p>This is an important debate and any addiction is difficult and tough.  Addictions often have far-reaching consequences for individuals and their families and friends.  Families are often torn apart, trust is broken and finances are affected.  Recovery is hard for any addict but regret is harder still.  We must do what we can to ensure people do not go down this road.  Drugs and alcohol have a physical manifestation and, as such, others become aware of the issue and can help, intervene, encourage and support.  However, gambling is different and it is a silent addiction.  It is a serious problem that can silently destroy lives.  I mention Richie Power, the Kilkenny hurling wizard who had the game at his feet.  Little did any spectator know the complete turmoil he was experiencing.  He spoke about a gambling addiction being a bit like carbon monoxide poisoning in that one cannot see, smell or taste it but there it is, gnawing away in the background, leaving lives in ruins, with no way back in many cases.  When we think about an addict who is losing money, sometimes loved ones do not know about the problem until the bank manager comes calling or a person loses his or her job, sees the mortgage has not been paid, sees the credit card is maxed out or sees that money is owed to moneylenders.  In many cases people have been stealing from employees.  It is said that one in five gambling addicts does so and then the Garda comes to the door.<\/p> <p>Some of the statistics are stark and frightening.  Ireland, as has been mentioned already, has the seventh biggest gambling spend in the world while 75% of Irish people know a person who they know to be a gambler.  This took on a particular significance during Covid.  At one point I checked the visits to a particular site and they had increased by 66%.  When it comes to young boys and girls, 7.6% of teenage boys and 2.8% of teenage girls developed a gambling problem during Covid, which is shocking.  We all know the stories about people waiting for that big win and trying to get something that would change their lives.  As the Minister of State knows, Fianna F&aacute;il has a long-standing commitment to implement regulations for socially responsible gambling, which is very important.<\/p> <p>While I support the principle of this Bill and congratulate my Labour Party colleagues on bringing it forward, I look forward to when we have the Government&rsquo;s gambling regulation Bill published and seeing its progress through the Oireachtas.

We are just after the Cheltenham Festival and we saw all the pictures in the newspaper and the great results for Irish trainers who won the Cheltenham Gold Cup etc.  However, we have to think that some houses and families are probably not happy because significant amounts of money were lost and possibly property, as was mentioned by Senator Wall.  We have to take that into consideration.<\/p> <p>I have a newsagent and a post office at home, as Members know, and I recall that when it comes to the Cheltenham Festival, the Galway Races and maybe the Grand National in Aintree, the newspapers come in and are lined up, and they all detail the free bets inside on the front page headline.  I liken that to what drug dealers do.  They give a free sample of a drug to try to get people hooked on it so they will stick with it for life and the dealers will make money.  I like an occasional flutter and I would be a frequent visitor to Galway and Punchestown, where I will be going as part of a Longford GAA race day.  When I was doing research on the Bill, it brought me back to the first time I went to the Galway Races with my late father and my brother back around 1980.  I still remember the name of the horse, Pampered, which rode in at 7\/1 and my brother and I won &pound;35 on it.  We held on to that money for years to come without spending it.

Men are five times more likely than women to be at-risk or problem gamblers.  It is more common in males aged 25 to 34.  One in ten meet the criteria of at-risk or problem gambling.  Problem gambling is associated with living in a deprived area and being unemployed.  There is a marked correlation between problem gambling and substance abuse, whether it be drugs, alcohol or smoking.  Some 13% of people with an alcohol use disorder are at-risk or problem gamblers compared with 2% of low-risk drinkers.  They are quite startling figures.<\/p><p>Fine Gael will not oppose the Bill.  In 2018, the Government set up an interdepartmental working group under Deputy David Stanton to look at regulating gambling.  As part of our 2020 general election manifesto we said we would introduce an independent gambling regulator to ensure abuses are eradicated and public safety is protected.  Along with our colleagues in the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il, we in government have committed to establishing a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being, covering gambling online and in person, and with the powers to regulate gambling advertising, gambling websites and apps.  That is very important in the current age in which we live.  We have to look seriously at the situation where, through online gambling, a person could actually lose his or her house or entire savings just by using his or her phone.  That is very important.<\/p><p>The Government has approved the gambling Bill for priority drafting and publication.  The legislation will set out a framework and a legislative basis for the establishment of a new independent statutory body, the gambling regulatory authority of Ireland, to implement a robust regulatory and licensing regime for the gambling sector.  Indeed, drafting on this Bill is under way.  It will give the authority the necessary enforcement powers for licensing and enable it to take appropriate and focused action where providers fail to comply with provisions of this Bill and with the authority's licensing terms and conditions.<\/p><p>The key objectives of this authority are to ensure gambling is conducted in fair and open way for companies to make decisions in certainty; require safeguards to address problem gambling, including in relation to gambling advertising; and prevent gambling from being a source of or a support to crime.  That is another very important point.  I know from my home county that significant funds have been earned illegally by a certain number of criminal families from the sale of drugs etc, and they are using the gambling industry to launder this money.  That is fact.  That is happening in my own county town.  I am delighted that addressing this forms part of the Bill.<\/p><p>Once again I compliment Senator Wall and the Labour Party on bringing forward this Bill.  It is apt this is dealt with.  The Minister of State has been proactive on this and I look forward to seeing legislation being implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#LL00600","speaker":"1639","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I said here on a number of occasions that in good times and bad, even in a town which is struggling economically, you can always expect to see a thriving betting shop on the main street.  I observed something late last year that caused me to modify that view.  On a busy street in a provincial town that I sometimes pass through, I spotted that where there had been two betting shops which were once thriving for many years, they seemed to have closed at some point over the past 18 months.  Apparently one of them, an independent betting shop, closed before Covid-19.  The other, which was part of one of the smaller betting chains, closed last summer.  The second shop was right next door to a very busy pub which even had a dedicated screen with odds and race times.  There was clearly a large crossover trade and yet that betting shop had closed.<\/p><p>None of us would ever celebrate the closure of a business or the loss of jobs, but perhaps in this situation a part of you might be inclined to cheer quietly about the closing of a betting shop, at least until you thought about the fallout for ordinary people.  It is not likely, however, that such closures are a result of a reduction in gambling.  The footfall in these shops was simply reduced by the increase in online gambling driven by relentless and all-pervasive advertising.  That gambling advertising hit stratospheric levels during the first lockdown two years ago and has grown steadily from there.<\/p><p>I had occasion to listen to the radio for an extended period of hours last week and noticed that every single ad break on Newstalk over that period included a Paddy Power ad for the Cheltenham Festival featuring the actor, Colm Meaney, who I am informed has never set foot on a racecourse.  That is beside the point but that is the story.  That type of situation brings saturation advertising to a whole new level.  Indeed, I wonder if there is a law of diminishing returns for gambling companies out of this.  Certainly, I noticed in one place where I was having lunch they had the racing on and the owner was hitting mute every time that particular ad came on the television.  It seems that even racing fans were sick of hearing it.<\/p><p>This issue has long passed the point where the Oireachtas ought to intervene sternly.  I support Senator Wall's Bill and commend him on bringing it forward.  As I have said before, it is limited, perhaps even flawed in some respects, and it does not go nearly far enough in other respects.  The Bill includes a carve-out protecting the sponsorship of sporting events and once-off charitable events by betting concerns.  I find this difficult to agree with.  Tobacco advertising is banned across the board as a result of developments at an EU level.  If we were to turn back the clock, would we allow tobacco sponsorship of events or charitable events?  I very much doubt it.  The Bill proposes a blanket ban on all broadcast and non-broadcast advertising except for printed material distributed at a racecourse or a dog track.  While I support this general aim, I think the approach is too blunt.  For example, as it stands, the Bill appears to ban gambling advertising both inside and outside betting shops.  As much as we dislike gambling, it is a lawful enterprise, so it does not make sense to impose that particular ban.<\/p><p>The Bill would also ban publications such as the <i>Racing Post<\/i>from carrying gambling ads.  Again, I think that much is excessive.  However, on the other side of the coin there are a range of practices the Bill does not address.  For example, gambling advertising regularly offers inducements such as free bets, refunds, discounts and so on to attract and entrap new customers.  These should be banned.<\/p><p>We also need to address the advertising of the national lottery.  I have spoken about this before.  It has become all-pervasive.  Virtually every ad break on RT&Eacute; now has an ad for the lotto.  This needs to be regulated and restricted because the lotto is a form of gambling.  Many addicts have spoken of their addiction to it.<\/p><p>I do not think I am the only person who has noticed a subtle change in tone in lotto advertising in recent years.  Until recently, it used to be about winners buying themselves yachts, private jets, solid gold houses and the like, but in the past two years lotto advertisements have focused more on winners spending money on their neighbours and the wider community.  We have all seen <i>ad nauseam<\/i>the ad featuring the guy who buys a water slide for his block of flats and the recent one about a woman who has installed hidden swimming pools and water slides in her rural village.  They are amusing in their own way, but you would want to be living under a rock not to have seen them at least once a day for the past year or so.<\/p><p>The important thing here is the reason for this change of emphasis, which is that the lottery does its own market research and it has shown that ordinary Irish people do not like the idea of people winning huge amounts of money just for their own selfish selves, so to speak.  As a result, there has been this subtle change of advertising strategy to suggest that playing the lotto is not actually a selfish enterprise.  It is almost an altruistic thing, that if you win, think of all the happiness you could lavish or endow upon others.  Somehow winning the lotto will allow you to benefit the community that you live in.  Of course this is, in the vast majority of cases, just rubbish.  What is seen here is a manipulation of people's good instincts but in the service of selling a product.  No matter how much good the national lottery does and no matter what way you look at it, that is predatory advertising and should be dramatically curtailed to at least the watershed.  The lotto is supposedly restricted to those over the age of 16, so why is advertising for it not confined to after the watershed, as things stand?<\/p><p>Those are just some thoughts.  I want to acknowledge the value in what Senator Wall is doing and my comments are meant to be constructive.  It is clearly difficult to get things to happen in this area.  We have allowed too much time to elapse.  The Government seems to speak out of both sides of its mouth on this issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I wish this legislation well.

It is good to see him here again to discuss gambling.  It shows the commitment that he has.  I would also like to congratulate Senator Wall and the Labour Party.  It has been a passion of the Senator's for a long time to end the scourge of gambling addiction, and this Bill goes some way towards doing that.<\/p><p>It is important to put on the record what the Minister of State has done as well.  The Bill would actually enhance it and brings it to the fore, which is very important.  I welcome the announcement a few weeks ago from the Minister of State that applications have opened for the role of chief executive of the new gambling regulatory authority.  Advertising by both commercial and non-commercial entities will be within the remit of the chief executive and a team of up to 100 people.  This would fulfil the programme for Government commitment that Senator Carrigy mentioned of the three parties in the Government to regulate this largely unregulated sector of society.  <\/p><p>Globally, Ireland has one of the highest levels of online gambling <i>per capita<\/i>and one of the highest levels of gambling losses <i>per capita<\/i>as well.  It is difficult enough to walk down a high street and avoid a gambling shop, as it were, but it is impossible to avoid it online.  I note with some horror some of the celebrities who now seem to be throwing themselves into the middle of this, such as Peter Crouch and, more recently, Colm Meany.  It sticks in one&rsquo;s memory because these people are known.  It makes gambling look very attractive and exciting.  It is unfortunate that celebrities would choose to do that.<\/p><p>It also means that more regulation is required because obviously people are not stepping up to the mark and making these decisions for the best interest of young people, in particular, which is the area where we are seeing the increase.  We saw through Covid that we had an increase in young boys, in particular, gambling online.  It is one of the notable trends in gambling that we have these kinds of blurred lines between gambling and fun.  There is an increase, which I have spoken about before, of the prevalence of loot boxes in video games.  They have muddied the distinction because they are mystery boxes which can sometimes be purchased with real money and the value of their contents involves chance or luck, which is ultimately gambling.  There was a report that showed that 40% of children open these loot boxes.  That is 40% of people choosing to gamble in the middle of something that is a game and meant to be fun.  They do not identify it with that, but it starts them on the path.  That is very dangerous.  Will the gambling regulator work with the online safety regulator?  That is a key part of this issue. <\/p><p>I note that people have some concerns around sporting events, because there is a reliance by sporting organisations in many instances on gambling revenue.  However, we have to get away from that.  It is very unfortunate that there is a carve-out in this Bill for greyhound racing.  I do not see why that is so.  That is very questionable because things such as greyhound racing could not survive without the money that it gets from advertising.  All of the money that goes into it is probably coming from some form of advertising.  It would actually be a good by-product of a Bill like this if that is stopped because I do not think the industry would survive and is not the kind of industry that we as a Government and as a country should be supporting.<\/p><p>Like Senators Carrigy and Crowe, we will not be objecting to the Bill.  As I said, we welcome it.  However, I would add some of those caveats.  I would agree very much with some of the comments by Senator Mullen around lotteries.  I am reminded of the last time we had a Private Members' Bill on betting on lottery wins proposed by one of the Fine Gael Senators, namely, Senator Ward.  We actually had people from the national lottery ringing us as Senators before that Bill came into the Chamber.  Some of us were phoned several times by the national lottery.  Again, who is paying for that?  Who is paying for them to ring us and basically try to lobby us to support the national lottery?  They were asking me if I was surprised at how much was going into local communities.  I actually was surprised &ndash; I thought it was an awful lot more before they told me.  It was a missed opportunity to try to lobby somebody.  However, they would not have been successful in any case.  <\/p><p>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#NN00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.

I apologise to the Minister of State and my colleagues, in particular to my Labour Party colleagues, as I was at committee and held up for the earlier part of this debate.  I am looking forward to the rest of it and, indeed, seeing this legislation progress.<\/p> <p>Many people enjoy gambling and they do so responsibly.  However, for some people and their families, gambling can become a serious problem.  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises the need for measures to be taken to help and protect those who are at risk.  The gambling industry recognises this itself.  It set up a gambling awareness trust which distributes funding to various treatments, services and research initiatives.  <\/p> <p>In 2019, Sinn F&eacute;in launched a comprehensive all-Ireland gambling policy.  It was an overview policy document that explored the issue of problem gambling with respect to gambling in general, including online gambling, advertising, children and young people, casinos and fixed-odds betting terminals.  In this State, almost two thirds of people take part in some form of gambling, which is a lot of people.  Many who gamble do not become addicted.  However, the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland has called for the Government to consider gambling a major public health concern.  This comment is not surprising given the personal consequences problem gambling can create.  These include financial difficulties, depression, anxiety, relationship breakdown, suicide, substance abuse, reputational damage, workplace issues and, in some instances, criminal activity.  The gambling sector is badly in need of new effective and thorough regulation to protect the most vulnerable.  New legislation is required which takes account of and accommodates a faster response to future technological advances to ensure coverage of gaming, gambling and betting, whether land-based or online.<\/p> <p>The Bill before the Seanad now correctly identifies a source of pressure on those at-risk gamblers, and that is advertising &ndash; especially online advertising.  Sinn F&eacute;in already supports a ban on broadcast advertising pre-watershed, that is, between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.  A similar bar should be extended across online platforms.  No online advertising should target under-18s or families with children.  I have no difficulty supporting this Bill to the next Stage so we can further explore the issues that arise from gambling for those adversely affected by it.<\/p> <p>The Sinn F&eacute;in document I referenced also suggested a number of ideas to help minimise problem gambling, such as the setting up of an independent gambling regulator, the functions of which would include administering a problem gambling fund to be financed by a mandatory levy or licence fee on the industry.  The regulator should introduce, oversee and enforce rules on advertising on the industry, including requirements around the nature, prominence and duration of warnings in all advertisements.  The regulator should also explore the introduction of deposit limits and daily time limits for those at risk.  The document also suggested a requirement for age verification before being permitted to gamble online.  When signing up for an online account, a standard warning should also be required.  In addition, credit card usage in all forms of online and land-based betting should be banned.<\/p> <p>Today&rsquo;s debate is focused on the negative implications of gambling, and that is understandable.  However, we need to also recognise the contribution the industry makes in terms of the number of people employed in it and the financial benefits it brings to the economy.  The changes that are needed, if implemented, will make a difference to those most at-risk gamblers, and can benefit the sector, if done correctly, responsibly and ethically.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I will conclude by commending my colleagues in the Labour Party on bringing this Private Members' Bill before us.  As I said, while we have some differences or some divergence of opinion around various tactical matters in the Bill, we can all agree with the sentiment behind it.  There is a real, live problem in our communities.  I am sure we are all aware of people, especially during the lockdown period, who were at home and almost hyper-exposed to some of these advertisements and the targeted nature of them.  I do not know if that was just because we were spending more time at home or if there was some kind of marketing or policy decision to lift the number of advertisers because people were confined to their homes and therefore able to take part in gambling online from home in particular.  I supported this Bill on Second Stage.  I hope it progresses well and that, collectively, across the House, we can work to ensure it is the best legislation it can be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#NN00300","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome to the Chamber.  I commend my Labour Party colleagues, Senators Wall, Sherlock, Hoey and Moynihan on this legislation, especially Senator Wall.  It is great and a very timely initiative.  Advertising is everywhere and it permeates almost all aspects of our culture.  Sporting events are sponsored, the television coverage of those events is interspersed with advertisements and our commentary about the events is uploaded to social media, which is displayed alongside yet more advertising.  We are spending increasing amounts of our time on digital platforms that are funded exclusively by advertising.  Our attention is a valuable commodity and bookmakers with deep pockets are lining up to purchase it.  The prevalence of gambling advertising in sport means that the people who love to participate in and watch sport are persistently programmed to associate the two activities.<\/p> <p>In this environment, the Labour Party's Bill is a welcome development.  While gambling might seem harmless to the average spectator who makes the occasional bet, for many it is a black hole of compulsion that destroys their finances, their relationships and their mental health.  Gambling has the highest rate of suicide of all the addictions.  The rise of online betting means that gambling is more accessible than ever before.  One does not have to trek to the local bookies.  Placing bets only takes a few taps on a smartphone now.  This means that gambling advertising can have a more immediate and profound impact.  When people gamble online their losses feel less tangible.  It is easier to part with money when it does not come directly from your hand or wallet.<\/p> <p>Studies have shown that problem online gamblers struggle to accurately account for just how much they have lost.  The seamlessness of digital transactions works hand in hand with the distorted thinking of addiction to obscure the damage being done to problem gamblers.  Recent figures show that Ireland ranks fourth among European countries on money spent on gambling per head.  We know that while problem gamblers make up a small percentage of overall gamblers they contribute significantly to the industry's income; it is unknown just how much.  Certain jurisdictions, such as the US state of Minnesota, have legislation mandating government agencies to produce data on this topic.  Its approach could be worth replicating here.  In 2020, a report from the House of Lords Select Committee on the Social and Economic Impact of the Gambling Industry found that 60% of the industry's profits came from problem or at-risk gamblers.  It is an astounding figure.  We know from a recent Health Research Board publication that problem gamblers are more likely to be young men, more likely to be from socially disadvantaged backgrounds and more likely to experience substance misuse and mental health issues.<\/p> <p>Gambling can form part of a matrix of dependencies that trap people in desperate situations where they feel powerless to escape.  A 2021 report from the Gambling Awareness Trust highlighted that Ireland is well behind the curve in terms of legislation regulating gambling and the advertising of gambling.  This is concerning because gambling as a sector is constantly innovating.  Data-driven design has been employed by online bookmakers who collect as much data as possible about their users and use this to make their products as addictive and, therefore, as lucrative as possible.  Legislation needs to reflect that online gambling is a fundamentally more dangerous product than conventional gambling and requires more vigorous regulation that is informed by the experiences of recovered gambling addicts and the many clinicians and academics working in this area.<\/p> <p>The data about the impact of the pandemic on gambling relayed in the Gambling Awareness Trust report is mixed.  While lockdowns and other restrictions saw many betting shops closed for long periods, it did not impact on the revenue of the industry's big players.  This is because the pandemic drove more gamblers online.  Working from home, the limitations on people's social lives and inter-familial strains all contributed to some online gamblers spending more time and money on these platforms.  What is most worrying is that young people are more likely to have increased their gambling during the pandemic, with 17.7% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 13% of 25- to 29-year-olds reporting having done so.  We know that many young people's sense of risk is duller than that of adults, which makes them more likely to engage in risky behaviour and renders them particularly vulnerable to advertising for gambling.<\/p> <p>While this may lie outside the parameters of the Bill being discussed, I will highlight an issue that is conspicuously absent from policy debates around gambling advertising and addiction.  The rise of retail investing apps has given anyone with a smartphone and a bank account access to the stock market.  There is much hype about the democratisation of finance but I worry that it is just the more acceptable face of online gambling.  Anyone with a Revolut account can make incredibly risky investments in highly volatile speculative assets, such as cryptocurrencies.  This new model of investing has been promoted through a barrage of slick advertising sometimes featuring A-list Hollywood stars.  This advertising is inescapable online, especially for users in demographics targeted by these companies, such as young people and particularly young men.  The moment-to-moment volatility of these investments and their constant accessibility recreates all the most habit-forming, destructive aspects of online gambling.  However, the association these companies have with technological advancement and finance gives the practice a sense of prestige that is usually not afforded to conventional gambling.  This can entice novice investors with limited financial literacy who do not fully understand the risks they are taking.  The convergence of the spheres of online gambling and investment deserves closer scrutiny.<\/p> <p>I again thank Senator Wall and all his Labour Party colleagues for bringing forward this very important legislation.  I am delighted to hear that the Government is supporting it.  I believe that action on this issue is long overdue.  Technological development is proceeding at a rapid pace in this area and legislators and regulators must endeavour to keep up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#OO00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Wall.  It is one of those occasions where nobody is at odds with each other in the Chamber.  We are all speaking with a passion about this particular problem and have done so consistently over a long period.  The speakers in this room have been consistent in that.<\/p> <p>I will take the time to pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne.  He is the first Minister or Minister of State who is prepared to take this on, grapple with it and not be afraid of those who would try to be a bully, such as big industry.  He has the backbone.  It is a minefield, but he has stepped on.  It is problematic.  I know that in the general scheme of Senator Wall's Bill he has looked at the issue of advertising and sponsorship and how to deal with it.  We will be able to tease that out during the debate with the Minister of State as well.<\/p> <p>When we look at the advertising surrounding the Cheltenham festival, we see that the companies concerned are some of the most creative.  These guys are making billions when it comes to advertising.  It is a little like Guinness when it used to sponsor the hurling championship.  The advertisements are some of the most entertaining things.  They are so good because they have got high-profile people, such as the one last week featuring Colm Meaney saying, \"It's coming home, lads\" and the Irish invasion of Cheltenham.  It is a great ad, it is nuanced and it is like a call to a patriotic act of being Irish.  What is it actually doing?  It is asking people to wage their money with Paddy Power.<\/p> <p>We then have the whole area of brand ambassadors.  What in God's name is that?  Very high-profile Irish sportspeople are prepared to lend their names to it.  We do not need legislation to deal with that.  We need to call out the people who are prepared, as high-profile Irish sportspeople, to put their names to these companies for moolah.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Shane Cassells:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That does not need legislation.  It needs them to be called out.  I have done that across a number of sports, not only horse racing but GAA as well, because the reach of the companies has gone beyond.  We talked about advertisements.  Senator Carrigy rightly spoke of the coupons that used be on the front of the newspaper.  My God, they have gone so far beyond that it is unreal.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to the leaders in Irish sport who are standing up, in particular in the FAI, and to the campaign led, first of all, by the chairman of Drogheda United, Mr. Conor Hoey.  I refer to the Big Step campaign, which aims to rebuff and to ban sponsorship in the League of Ireland because that is what it takes.  We can pass all the legislation we want.  Leaders in society will always achieve more.<\/p><p>In 2020, people in Ireland lost &euro;1.4 billion gambling and the losses were the fourth most in the EU.<\/p><p>It is the online sphere that we really need to look at in this debate.  As I said, we have moved away from the newspapers.  The drug lords would be jealous of the fact that this is an industry which can keep people hooked through algorithms.  When you pick up your phone, your timeline becomes flooded with advertisements because they have created a case file on you.  This issue was exposed by Paul Merson, the high-profile former Arsenal soccer player, in a documentary he made with the BBC last year.  Mr. Merson, who lost every single penny he made from his football days, subjected his brain to neurological tests which showed that people who are addicts are susceptible to that targeted advertising.  We see now that in sport, the boards placed behind players and managers after games carry the advertising logos of these companies.  That torments people more, but we can take a stand.  We always say that it is a wider European or global issue and that competitions transcend international boundaries, but we can take a stand.  A prime example of that could be seen in France last week at the conclusion of the six nations rugby championship or, as it is officially called, the \"Guinness Six Nations\".  The pinnacle of that championship, the big game, was France versus England in Paris.  During the games that were played elsewhere earlier that day, \"Guinness\" was plastered across the pitch, on the ball and on the hoardings, but not in Paris because the French have a law banning this form of alcohol advertising.  The word \"Guinness\" could not appear and it had to be replaced with the word \"Greatness\".  \"Guinness\" appeared nowhere in Paris.  This shows that it can be done.<\/p><p>I am not coming in here and being a hypocrite.  I gambled every single day last week on Cheltenham and I am the worst punter in the world.  The horses that I back are cursed.  One of the horses I backed was winning coming up the straight, collapsed and had to be put down.  My friend turned to me and said, \"Cassells, you are responsible for that.\"  However, I had put aside an amount of money to have the craic with my friends last week.  I knew that when that money was gone, those were my losses allocated for the week.

Senator Wall has a passion for this issue.  He is sincere about it and has worked hard on it.  He has done the House much service in doing that.  Senator Wall has certainly done his party and the country some good in that respect.  It is important and I say &quot;well done&quot; to him.<\/p><p>I salute genuinely the real commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, on this matter.  The Minister of State is consistently committed to and consistently courageous on it.  When I meet the Minister of State on the corridor, I am impressed that he identifies me as one of the people who have consistently spoken on this issue over the past couple of years and - without asking - he briefs me on where the legislation is at and what is happening.  I appreciate that.  It is a sign of the Minister of State's genuine passion for the subject.  We are fortunate in that regard.<\/p><p>I personally support the legislation wholeheartedly.  In my opinion, we should be banning all such advertising.  I would support Senator Wall's view on that.<\/p><p>I will make a few general points.  We all know people in our communities with a gambling addiction problem.  Everybody knows them and public representatives know more of them than most.  There are common features across such cases, including family breakdown, financial ruin, depression, job loss, psychiatric illness, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, bipolar, and often suicide or attempted suicide.  This is a bleak picture but it is a real picture.  We know these people in our communities.  While these are stark examples, we know well that in every one of our communities there are a number of people who are less affected, but very seriously affected.<\/p><p>Obviously, there has been a big increase during Covid.  Smartphones are a real issue now.  That is why Senator Mullen mentioned bookie shops closing.  They are closing because all of this activity has moved to the iPhones.  We have highly addictive gambling products that are designed by mathematical geniuses to make them attractive and seductive.  We have free bets, which should be eliminated too because they are wrong.  They are there to entice people in.  This is how young people develop their addiction.  This has all obviously arisen during Covid.<\/p><p>It is interesting that Ireland has the third highest <i>per capita<\/i>spend on gambling in the world.  That is a stark statistic.  As I have said, the products are addictive.  We need a limit on spending.  That is what should be done in the future.  It should not be possible to gamble on ordinary credit cards; it should be possible on debit cards only.  The token bets should be done away with.  I believe the Minister of State has the courage for it and has been doing it.  We should go at it fully because we will become as unpopular for doing it half-right as for fully right.  We might as well go at it right.<\/p><p>On these products, Professor Colin O&rsquo;Gara, clinical professor of psychiatry at UCD, says that 5% of people are affected.  Professor O'Gara says that up to 250,000 people suffer financial and relationship difficulties, etc., because of gambling.  As I have said, the general statistic - one cited by Senator Wall - is that approximately 40,000 people in the country are in the problem gambling zone.  That is a very serious situation.<\/p><p>It is important to state, as my colleague Senator Carrigy did earlier, that my party will be supporting the legislation.  My party will not be standing against such objectively correct legislation.<\/p><p>I support the idea of a fund from the industry.  The industry should subvent the treatment.  This money should not be provided to the industry's own charity but to an objective source.  It would go to the State to assist with the gambling addiction.  The HSE now needs to recognise gambling addiction as a problem and deal with it as a specific illness or condition.<\/p><p>We must take on the advertising in a big way.  I refer to pop-up advertisements, etc.  The number of advertisements during the recent European Championship soccer games was beyond reason and they were constant last week, as all the Senators said, through Cheltenham.  We need to deal with this.<\/p><p>This is a real problem.  Obviously, there are so many facets.  The advertising is a big one and has to be taken on, and that is the substance of this Bill.  There is no escaping that reality.  We will find State support.  We are finding State support for everything these days.  Let us find State support for the sports that will lose money over it.  That is one facet of it.<\/p><p>The second thing that we should be fit to do is to deal with spending limits and with the type of credit cards being used, etc.  Parallel with that would be the support fund from the industry.  I believe the health system should specifically address the difficulties of people who engage in problem gambling.  We also need to develop educational products around this.  There has to be education about gambling in the schools and right through.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a very complex and broad question and none of us, certainly not the Minister of State or Senator Wall, are naive enough to think we would eliminate problem gambling through this Bill.  However, it would save a lot of people, families and individuals and a lot of hardship and suffering could be avoided.  We will not wipe out the problem.  It would be naive to think that.  We will not do that but we will alleviate pain, suffering and hardship, not only for the people with the gambling problems themselves but for the people with whom they come in contact, their families, communities and society.  I will leave it at that.  This is too important an issue to interrupt a proper response from the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#PP00500","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I thank the Labour Party and, in particular, Senators Wall, Sherlock, Moynihan, Hoey, and former Senator, now Deputy, Bacik for bringing forward this Bill.  The Government fully understands the concerns Members have about problem gambling and in particular the impact that gambling and its advertising may have on children.  Senator Wall&rsquo;s passion for this issue has been clear since his election to the Seanad and has been matched with reasoned proposals from the very beginning.  This Bill is an important contribution and keeps that focus on the issue of problem gambling.  We have not had full and substantive reform of our gambling legislation since the 1950s.  That said, I acknowledge the very important work done by Deputy David Stanton, both in the legislation he brought forward himself and in the foundational work he did on the legislation I have brought forward.<\/p> <p>The personal stories we have heard today from all Senators bring home the impact problem gambling has had on our society and the very real consequences and devastation to families.  That includes financial devastation, devastation to people&rsquo;s relationships and often very serious consequences for individuals who find themselves in difficult situations.  Recently, there have been increasingly blurred lines with gambling advertising made to look like gaming and fun activities.  That sense of allurement and pulling people in has been referred to several times.<\/p> <p>With regard to the gaming industry, Senator Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly referred to loot boxes and similar activities that condition young people towards gambling.  We have to be aware that society is changing rapidly.  We all remember the hullabaloo 12 years ago about a physical casino being set up in Tipperary and how that might impact and promote gambling.  Now every 12-year-old is going around with a casino in their back pocket.  That is the reality of it.  There are issues around augmented reality, artificial intelligence, algorithms, the blurred lines to which I referred and the mass advertising that is happening.  Senators Wall and Cassels also rightly pointed out the greater role of gambling meshing in with sport and how it is almost impossible to participate in and enjoy sport without gambling being front and centre.<\/p> <p>A long time has passed since we had extensive gambling reform - way too long.  The reform being brought forward now by the Government is critical and is very much informed by the work of Senator Wall.  It will protect vulnerable people and set out the dangers and risks around gambling, which are becoming ever more pervasive.  We also know of the good work that has been done by Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly for a long time in keeping gambling on the agenda.  He referred to the work done by Professor O&rsquo;Gara on this matter. <\/p> <p>I again thank the Labour Party and its Senators.  The Government is fully supportive of the important public policy objectives motivating this Bill.  For this reason, and as the Government is progressing its own comprehensive legislation on gambling regulation that will address many of these issues, It has decided not to oppose Second Stage of this Bill and will support it.  As Members will be aware, the Government has committed in the programme for Government to comprehensively reforming the licensing and regulation of gambling activities.  The debate on reforming gambling has been going on for a long time.  It is time to bring that debate to a conclusion over the coming months and pass legislation that will address this core issue.  As public representatives, we are all too aware of the great difficulties that many people, their families and communities have suffered as a result of gambling addiction and problem gambling in general.  It is an issue that must be addressed for the well-being of our society and, with the support of the Oireachtas, the Government intends to put in place a comprehensive framework that will safeguard and address problem gambling, including advertising, at its core.  I am very aware of the proliferation of gambling advertising and this Bill is widely welcomed.<\/p> <p>Last October, the Government published the general scheme of the gambling regulation Bill.  As I said then, the publication of the Bill marked an important milestone towards the effective regulation of gambling in Ireland under a new, independent statutory body, the gambling regulatory authority of Ireland.  One of the key objectives of the authority will be to set safeguards to address problem gambling, including in respect of gambling advertising.  In addition, the authority will provide a clear and comprehensive legislative framework which will make it easier to hold companies to account, as well as measures to prevent gambling being a source of support to crime.  While I certainly appreciate the aims of this Private Member's Bill, it only address one important element of the many objectives addressed in the Government's Bill.  Further consideration of unforeseen implications and consequence of today's Bill is required and I look forward ti further engagement with Senator Wall on that.  That is the rationale for the Government's support of this Bill on Second Stage.  The Government legislation is a comprehensive piece of reform to bring about gambling regulation and coherent licensing and will address gambling advertising, along with appropriate safeguards for customers.  I again thank Senator Wall and acknowledge his positive contributions in that respect.<\/p> <p>Senators will be aware of the complexity of the modern offerings of the gambling industry and the speed with which innovations are introduced.  It is important that we take as comprehensive an approach as possible to this area and that we future-proof any measures so they are adaptable to changing circumstances.  By providing a coherent licensing and regulation environment, including a powerful independent regulator, the Government legislation will allow for agile responses to any new issues of concern or new areas requiring regulation.  The State needs a powerful and responsive authority that can keep pace with a fast-moving industry.  In January, the Government approved the gambling regulation Bill for priority drafting and publication and the drafting of the Bill in the Office of the Attorney General, in co-operation with my Department's officials is progressing.  Furthermore, the Joint Committee on Justice has commenced its pre-legislative scrutiny process on the Government's gambling regulation Bill.  The committee has held two pre-legislative scrutiny sessions, which I followed with interest.  Witnesses invited to address the committee included support groups working with those who have suffered from gambling addiction.  Among a range of issues, they expressed their concerns around advertising, particularly advertising that may be seen by under 18s.  I look forward to receiving the report of the committee, which will inform the further development of the Bill.<\/p> <p>I have also listened with interest to the contributions made today and I, along with my officials, will consider them in the context of our ongoing work on the Bill.  The Government's work has been informed by the report of the interdepartmental working group on the future of licensing and regulation of gambling, approved by the Government on 20 March 2019.  The Bill has also drawn on analysis of the regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions and the nature of gambling within this State.  Following extensive consideration and consultation, the Government has proposed the establishment of a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being.  In its regulation of the industry, the new gambling regulatory authority will have a focus on the impacts of harmful and problem gambling.  The Government's Bill will empower the independent gambling regulator to develop regulations, codes of conduct and codes of practice on various issues relating to gambling including advertising.<\/p> <p>The impact of gambling advertising has been a key element of consideration in the development of the Bill.  A key focus of the gambling regulatory authority will be appropriate standards for advertising and customer protection by gambling operators.  The authority will examine advertising in the context of the full range of activities of the gambling operators and it will be essential for operators to comply if they are to maintain their licence.  The authority will have the power to impose fines where codes of conducts and regulations are not being complied with, and to remove a licence or block the various sites if they are in breach of the regulations and guidelines.  It is the Government's intention that the authority be empowered sufficiently to perform its role with efficiency and fairness, and that it will be sufficiently resourced to allow it to ground its decisions in a thorough understanding of the industry.  We are all aware that the technology in the gambling sector is constantly developing.  To effectively protect customers and communities, the authority must be able to respond with agility to any new developments.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Under the current arrangements, responsibility for monitoring gambling advertising is shared by a variety of authorities including the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  While these ensure that advertisements must meet the basic requirements of being truthful and not mislead any potential customers, it is clear that there are other matters at play that require further regulation in the area of gambling advertising.<\/p><p>As recognised by the interdepartmental working group on the future of licensing and regulation of gambling, there are various issues involved in developing an effective approach to advertising on gambling products.  My Department is examining these issues and working with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure there are no unforeseen consequence in the new legislation, including with due regard to the latest developments in the UK and elsewhere.  In developing the new legislation, my objective is to provide enhanced consumer protection for players and to limit harmful effects on young people and those susceptible to addiction.  We must ensure that gambling will be safe, fair and crime-free.  The legislation will be comprehensive.  The gambling regulatory authority will be suitably empowered and oversight of the regulation of gambling advertising will be an important facet of his or her work.<\/p><p>The Bill also provides for the establishment of a social impact fund for the purposes of financing research and information, education and awareness raising measures and appropriately supporting problem-gambling treatment activities by relevant health professionals.  I believe that the research funded under this arrangement will greatly assist the authority in the development of an effective approach in the area of advertising.<\/p><p>A recruitment process for a CEO-designate of the gambling regulator is currently under way and there is a clear path towards the regulator being operational by 2023.  I appreciate the opportunity today for further discussion today with Seanad Members on this important area.  The Government's Bill will seek to address the widespread concern over the lack of robust regulation of gambling advertising and the negative consequences that this is having on our society.  I agree with Senator Wall that this is not about ending gambling or about stopping people from having fun.  It is about protecting vulnerable people in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#QQ00200","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

As Senator Cassells said, a number of Senators have spoken passionately over the past two years about gambling.  Indeed, I have joined Senators Cassells, Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly and Mullen on a number of podcasts on this important topic.  Concern about this issue is cross-party and that message is loud and clear here tonight.  As has been said, we have been waiting since the 1950s for legislation like that which is being proposed by the Government and like the Bill before us tonight.  It is good to hear united voices across the Chamber tonight, as has been the case for the past two years.<\/p> <p>I thank my colleague, Senator Sherlock, who has been very supportive of this legislation since we first introduced it.  As she said earlier, it was 1976 when important legislation in this area was introduced.  She spoke about day-in, day-out gambling and that is what this Bill is all about.  It is about those people who, unfortunately, cannot control their gambling addiction.  That is why we are here tonight and that is why all Senators, as well as the Minister of State, have spoken in favour of bringing in new legislation.  Senator Crowe is completely right that legislation governing this area is thoroughly outdated, having been introduced in the 1950s.  The last commitment we got was in 2013.  Any time one talks to those involved in helping those with gambling addiction, they refer to 2013.  Now, in 2022, with the Minister of State's proposed legislation alongside this Bill, we are finally seeing a commitment from the Oireachtas to bring forward long-overdue legislation.  <\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin quoted Mr. Richie Power.  I was not aware of his case until I read about it recently and I am sure that is the case for others in this House.  Mr. Power is a decorated Kilkenny hurler and a person I have looked up to for so long.  His message is very important.  Those who are signing up to promote gambling companies should talk to the Richie Powers and the Ois&iacute;n McConvilles of this world to find out what it is really like to have an addiction.  I have spoken to them and they are so generous in giving their time to people who have a gambling addiction.  They explain what it is like to go home with no money in one's pocket and to have to lie to one's loved ones about where the money has gone.  Every one of those people who sign up, especially the sports stars, should talk to the Ois&iacute;n McConvilles, the Richie Powers, and the Davy Glennons of this world, to whom I have spoken.  I am sure the Minister of State has spoken to them too.<\/p> <p>I agree with Senator Carrigy that we all gamble.  I come from County Kildare, the home of Punchestown and have an interest in gambling.  Hopefully I will see Senator Carrigy at the Longford day but both he and I can control our gambling.  As others have said, we are in a position to control our gambling but tonight we are representing those 40,000 people who cannot control it.  We are trying to introduce legislation to protect them and to ensure that their number does not grow to 50,000 or 60,000.  The latest research suggests that up to 130,000 people could develop an addiction and that is something that nobody in this House or in our public health system wants to see.  <\/p> <p>Senator Mullen questioned some aspects of the legislation and I accept that it is not perfect.  The Minister of State said the same and we accept that.  However, what we are doing here is trying to address a problem that exists.  Hopefully when we get this Bill to Committee Stage, Senator Mullen and others will be able to table amendments to it to improve it.  <\/p> <p>The national lottery is a problem in the context of advertising but there is a separate regulator for the lottery.  That is something that needs to be looked at.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly said that the lottery has been reaching out to Members and indeed, I got a phone call yesterday.  Representatives of the national lottery want to talk to us again about what they are doing.  I am happy to talk to them but when I do so, I will be representing those people who need help.  It is very important that public representatives continue to talk to those people because it is important to hear their side of the story as well.<\/p> <p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly spoke about gambling addiction and welcomed the fact that the role of chief executive of the new gambling regulatory authority was advertised recently.  We all welcome that development and hope the authority will be up and running as soon as possible.  <\/p> <p>I also thank Senators &Oacute; Donnghaile and Black for their contributions.  Senator Black has always been very supportive of this legislation.  She mentioned other issues that I am sure the Minister of State will tackle in his forthcoming legislation.  I could not agree more with Senator Cassells, who displays such passion every time he speaks about this subject.  We do need to call out those sports stars who are signing up for money.  They need to sit down with the Ois&iacute;n McConvilles of this world because they would think twice about doing it then.  Senator Joe O'Reilly has always been very supportive on the subject of gambling addiction.  One of the questions I get asked regularly in the context of this debate is what happens to the sports clubs when the money is taken away from them.  Senator Joe O'Reilly mentioned State support and we need to look at that.  As Senator Cassells said, we must also acknowledge what Drogheda United and other clubs in the League of Ireland have done in walking away from gambling sponsorship.  They have shown great leadership and that must be acknowledged.  <\/p> <p>I acknowledge the work that the Minister of State has done in this area.  We have spoken regularly about what we can do for those 40,000 people in Ireland with a gambling addiction.  I look forward to continuing to work with him.  I thank the Government for not opposing this legislation tonight.  The Labour Party is not giving up today.  We will continue to represent those people who come to our clinics and who contact us by email and through social media.  I have been inundated with correspondence on this.  I spoke about a lady earlier and how it was great to see that she has been able to turn her life around.  We must also have a conversation about the fact that there is help out there for people.  People should pick up the phone and seek help.  There are some great organisations out there.  Many could do with more funding but that is a conversation for another day.  I thank everybody for their contributions to this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022032300002#RR00300","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1648031400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Wall.
