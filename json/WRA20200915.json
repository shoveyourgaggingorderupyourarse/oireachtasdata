I am fully aware that the improved situation in these counties has been due to the willingness of everyone to adhere to the public health guidance and the measures that were implemented. I would like to publicly thank all the people of Kildare, Laois and Offaly for their efforts over the past number of weeks in reducing the spread of Covid-19 across their counties. I would also like to acknowledge the work of my colleague Deputy Lawless during this time. <\/p>  <p>  We now know, through the work of those in the affected counties, and what happened to the virus, that localised measures do work. As part of our deliberations on the development of the Roadmap for Resilience and Recovery which will be published later today, the learnings from the introduction of the measures in Kildare, Laois and Offaly were considered. <\/p>  <p>  The decision to apply additional, enhanced public health measures to Kildare was based upon the available epidemiological evidence that was emerging at that stage. <\/p>  <p>  As with many outbreak control measures, the full effect of the public health measures applied can take up to two incubation periods (28 days) of the virus to see full effect. It is worth recalling that we are still within this timeframe. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputy that the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and the Department have examined the currently available epidemiological information in order to learn about the effects of the measures within Kildare and the surrounding areas. <\/p>  <p>  In August, the cases per 100,000 population in Kildare, Laois and Offaly increased quickly and sharply. In Kildare, the increase in this incidence rate was initially driven by workplace outbreak related cases. Seven days later, a second peak emerged, driven primarily by household outbreak cases in the first instance as well as further workplace outbreak cases and isolated cases. The volumes of cases seen in Kildare during these peaks were as high as those observed at the height of the national epidemic in April of this year.  <\/p>  <p>  Since this time, the incidence rates in Kildare have dropped considerably, although it does remain one of the highest in the country currently. The average number of cases identified each day has also decreased significantly. <\/p>  <p>  As with the rest of the country, the epidemiological situation will continue to be monitored closely by the Department, the HSE, the HPSC and the NPHET. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500049#WRA02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Funding","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500049#WRA02100"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[23669\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500049#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures he is proposing to address the lack of adequate resourcing of University Hospital Kerry within the South\/Southwest hospital group; if his officials will examine the reason the hospital is resourced poorly relative to similar grade hospitals elsewhere in Ireland; if he will address the imbalance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the work done by Deputy Griffin in advocating for the people of Kerry.

Circumstances such as, for example, the socio-economic status of the population, population density, age profile, rates of underlying conditions, date of first reported cases, varying data collection methodologies and reporting arrangements, testing strategies etc are often not directly comparable or are very challenging to analyse in a manner that can be directly comparable.

NPHET is also giving ongoing consideration to the development and implementation of appropriate surveillance strategies for healthcare workers in other settings. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that while testing is an important component of our response to Covid-19, it is only one element of our response and it doesn't replace the range of protective measures that are necessary to prevent the transmission of this disease. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500050#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500050#WRB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[22357\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500050#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to deal with the waiting lists for speech and language therapy in County Wexford.","asker":"1621","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government,  Our Shared Future,  recognises the need to improve services for both children and adults with disabilities through better implementation and by working together across Government in a better way. <\/p><p>The  Government commits to prioritising early diagnosis and access to services for children and ensuring that the most effective interventions are provided for each child, to guarantee the best outcomes.<\/p><p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500050#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500050#WRB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[23650\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500050#WRB04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the treatment pathway devised for mesh implant survivors;

While some services were suspended or delivered on a reduced basis, it is important to recognise that many vital services have continued throughout the pandemic, ensuring that priority care needs were addressed and the most vulnerable protected even at the height of this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Resuming health and social care services and building the health sector capacity and capability for the pressures of Winter 2020 and into 2021 is a priority for the Government.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that services were restored in a prioritised manner with investments targeted at rebuilding services guided by Sl&aacute;intecare - shifting service provision from Hospital to community-based care, the HSE published in June 2020, a Strategic Framework for Delivery of Service Continuity in a COVID Environment. This ensures a safer environment for patients and service users.<\/p>  <p>  Over the summer period we have seen a gradual resumption of many of those services that were curtailed, although unfortunately there are still areas where the level of service falls below that which was being delivered up to mid-March. The immediate priority for the HSE is the finalisation of a Winter Plan that would incorporate the enhancement of services to cope with Winter pressures into early 2021 to ensure the capacity and capability of health system is prepared for this challenging period.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, a more strategic approach to Service resumption is being undertaken, with the development of a longer-term plan to include augmented levels of service to regain a level of provision across community and acute hospitals that had capacity adversely impacted by COVID 19.\u00a0 This would include establishing key community services envisioned in Sl&aacute;intecare and the 2018 Capacity Review, while building toward the appropriate level of capacity in our acute hospital services.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Winter and Service Planning process,\u00a0 a range of initiatives have also been developed, and as these are rolled out in the coming weeks and months, we will see further service resumption and increased capacity across the community (primary care, mental health, older persons and disability services) and Acute Hospital system.<\/p>  <p>  This will include implementing new initiatives, new ways of working and eHealth solutions to keep people safe and keep people out of the acute hospital system e.g. ePharmacy, ePrescribing and virtual clinics.<\/p>  <p>  For Mental Health Services, this year has been exceptional with the outbreak of Covid-19. The pandemic has been a source of significant stress, anxiety, worry and fear for many people throughout the world. This arises from the disease itself, as well as from impacts such as increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has continued to provide all community services, in so far as possible, while following Covid-19 guidelines to ensure the protection of patients and staff. To note, acute inpatient and community residential facilities have remained open and patients have been provided with services throughout the pandemic, although numbers have been reduced in some settings.<\/p>  <p>  The advent of Covid-19 has led to a rapid acceleration in the delivery of online mental health services, with the Department of Health launching numerous initiatives to promote mental health and wellbeing. Among these was the launch of the national Crisis Text-Line in June. An additional &euro;2.2m has been provided for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign, through enhanced online supports, and to support the HSE psychosocial strategy. This will enable the Irish healthcare system to implement integrated telehealth solutions and to augment existing online interventions funded to date. An example of this is the free counselling sessions offered by HSE NGO partner MyMind and Turn2me created online peer support groups for frontline workers. <\/p>  <p>  Tele-psychiatry pilot projects have been tested to enable planning for the delivery of this service nationally to support those\u00a0with complex mental health needs. This service will alignment and augment existing mental health services. <\/p>  <p>  To plan for the ongoing and increasing need for mental health services nationally and the demand for more holistic person-centred responses across the whole community, the refreshed national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision &ndash; A Mental Health Policy for Everyone, was published in June 2020. Service users and their families, carers and supporters will have timely access to evidence-informed mental health services. Tailored measures will be put in place to ensure that individuals with complex mental health difficulties can avail of services across the state without discrimination. This builds on the intent of A Vision for Change and Sl&aacute;intecare and is expected to be implemented as part of a ten year plan.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding access to services for persons with special needs, adult day services as well as children&rsquo;s disability services were stepped down in March 2020 in line with government recommendations to minimise the spread of COVID 19.<\/p>  <p>  Adult day services have since been reopening over the last month and this will continue throughout September, and information on reopening dates for all 966 services has been available on the HSE&rsquo;s website since August 4th.<\/p>  <p>  When day services resume, capacity in day service locations will be reduced, however, the HSE and service providers will keep this measure under review and as public health guidance evolves, capacity to provide supports will adapt accordingly.

However, it is necessary to reduce footfall in order to protect women, babies, staff and our maternity service as a whole. <\/p>  <p>  Maternity hospitals have performed well during the pandemic and have continued to keep women, babies and staff safe.

This resulted in construction related work on the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital stopping on 31 March this year due to Covid-19 Restrictions.  On 18<sup>th<\/sup>May the restrictions in respect of the construction sector were eased.  From this date, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) engaged with the main contractor to ensure the earliest possible reopening of the sites.  I am informed that the main contractor of the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital project returned to site on the 13<sup>th<\/sup>of July.  There will be delays associated with Covid-19,  however it is too early to fully assess the impact of the pandemic on the new children&rsquo;s hospital project and the Paediatric Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght. The NPHDB continues to engage with the contractor and is monitoring progress on site in the interests of completing the project as quickly and economically as possible. <\/p><p>On that note I want to say that I am acutely aware of how urgently the new Children&rsquo;s Hospital is needed and I want to see it delivered as quickly as possible on behalf of children, young people and their families. <\/p><p>Under the contract, the new children&rsquo;s hospital is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to open in 2023 after a period of commissioning.  As of March 2020, when the site closed due to Covid-19, I am advised that the NPHDB was of the view that the Main Contractor was behind schedule on the construction works.<\/p><p>The NPHDB is continuing to engage with the Main Contractor to obtain an updated programme of works that is in line with its contractual commitments. Any delivery outside of the timelines agreed under the contract could potentially be a matter for dispute resolution and so I wish to be careful in respect of what I say here, but I will reiterate that it is a priority for me and this Government that the hospital be completed as quickly as possible. <\/p><p><b><\/b>The &euro; 1.73 billion figure raised by the Deputy is the total overall project cost advised to the previous Government in December 2018.That figure comprises &euro;1.43 billion which is the overall cost to complete the capital project, and also includes a broader programme of activity associated with the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites under development. This includes for example investment in ICT, an Electronic Health Record system and the Children's Hospital Integration Programme - the merging of three paediatric hospitals. <\/p><p>The PwC report makes clear that the Guaranteed Maximum Price established through the two-stage tender process does not provide a contractual ceiling on cost and significant residual risks remain of further cost.  The residual risks, for which there cannot be cost certainty, include items such as construction inflation, claims and certain uncontrollable risks, such as potential costs relating to BREXIT.  I am advised that the main contractor has submitted a significant number of claims which it alleges are outside of the agreed scope.The NPHDB has a robust process in place for the assessment of claims by the Contractor in accordance with the Construction Contract.

Scoliosis activity accounts for 20% of overall orthopaedic activity across CHI. <\/p>  <p>  This funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTE in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services including scoliosis services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively. The majority of posts were allocated to each hospital in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 investment in paediatric orthopaedics included funding to support transition of adolescents with scoliosis from CHI at Crumlin to the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH). CHI and MMUH have developed and agreed the clinical pathways for the transition of adolescents with scoliosis to MMUH. The transition of patients over the age of 16 who were awaiting a first-time outpatient\/spinal review appointment at Crumlin commenced in December 2018. Each month, appropriate patients are identified for this pathway via clinical validation. <\/p>  <p>  CHI have advised my Department that the introduction of government restrictions for COVID-19 based on public health advice required CHI at Crumlin and Temple Street to defer all non-emergency spinal operations.

The Health Service Executive is leading on the implementation framework in respect of the recommendations of the National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015.<\/p>  <p>  The focus of the Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy is on achieving best outcomes for people, by providing safe, high quality, person-centred care at the lowest appropriate level of complexity. This must be integrated across the care pathway and provided as close to home as possible or in specialist centres, where necessary. The framework will guide the reconfiguration and development of neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level, through a 10-step Framework. It proposes the formation of Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Networks (MCRNs), with the set-up of one demonstration MCRN suggested as the first step. The ultimate goal of this approach is to put in place a national framework of acute, inpatient and specialist community services.<\/p>  <p>  The Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Network (MCRN) model acknowledges that different service users need different input and different levels of expertise and specialisation at different stages in their rehabilitation journey.<\/p>  <p>  The critical point of this model is that, although service users may need to access different services as they progress, the transition between services should be facilitated by appropriate communication and sharing of information between services so that they progress in a seamless continuum of care through the different stages:<\/p>  <p>  - Acute hospital;<\/p>  <p>  - Complex specialist rehabilitation services;<\/p>  <p>  - Post-acute specialist inpatient rehabilitation services;<\/p>  <p>  - Community based specialist rehabilitation services;<\/p>  <p>  - Primary care; and<\/p>  <p>  - Voluntary organisations.<\/p>  <p>  This National Implementation Framework is evidence-based and informed by population needs. It addresses the continuum of care for those in need of neurological rehabilitation services. It describes the requirement for a whole system approach and provides the blueprint for how we should deliver care and services for those who suffer from neurological conditions who require individualised, goal focused rehabilitation.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation framework covers an initial period from 2019 into 2021.

and the patient voice is central to our understanding of these, and similar, issues. With regards to the specific details, I will first deal with mesh implants and then consider sodium valproate. <\/p>  <p>  Over the past two decades, Uro-Gynaecological Mesh has been widely used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence and Pelvic Organ Prolapse in women.\u00a0 Mesh devices are certified as compliant with relevant EU legislation, and as such, European regulatory competent authorities consider that the benefits outweigh the risks for these devices.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that in response to concerns raised in Ireland regarding complications associated with the use of mesh devices in late 2017, the then Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the matter. The report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In July 2018, in advance of publication of the full report, the CMO requested the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This pause was instigated pending implementation of initial recommendations regarding (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The CMO report was published in November 2018. Four of the 19 recommendations relate to data gathering to support the development of information resources to permit long-term research and audit of practice, ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications, and ensuring timely, appropriate arrangements for the management of women with complications.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019.\u00a0 The National Women and Infants Health Programme is leading on this work. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) receives adverse incidents reported in Ireland with respect to mesh products. \u00a0It is working with the National Women and Infants Health Programme on a national reporting guidance document, for adverse incident reporting associated with uro-gynaecological mesh. This new guidance is expected to be finalised and published in the coming weeks. \u00a0It requests that Healthcare Professionals including consultants, GPs and national mesh administrators report adverse events associated with vaginal mesh implants to the HPRA.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA is also involved other related areas of work. It is leading work in Europe to create a device specific vigilance guidance with respect to mesh products to standardise reporting with respect to these products. It is conducting a market surveillance review into transvaginal mesh products used for stress urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse, in addition to supporting a European taskforce relating to mesh products. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing policy response, my department officials are examining options to establish a process for an independent, compassionate engagement for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard; and will make proposals to me in this regard.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the medicine, sodium valproate, I am aware of historical and current issues surrounding the use of sodium valproate by women during pregnancy. I am also aware of the significant work carried out by the HSE and the HPRA over the last two years to implement European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommendations from 2018 and to provide support to families who may have concerns about previous exposure to sodium valproate and the possible impact on their children.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0As I understand it, the HSE has improved the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome (FVS), including the establishment of a dedicated genetics clinic in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin. This means that families now have access to a clear diagnostic pathway if they feel their child may be affected by FVS. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the UK report referred to by the Deputy, any relevant learnings from that review will be taken into account as my Department continues to work with the HSE, the HPRA, and other stakeholders to support successful implementation of the current regulatory framework and risk mitigation measures for valproate and implementation of the recommendations of the CMO&rsquo;s report on the use of use of Uro-Gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500051#WRC06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Assisted Human Reproduction","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500051#WRC06800"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[23278\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500051#WRC06900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of publicly funded fertility care as promised in the programme for Government;

The Review identified an immediate requirement for 1,290 beds to address overcrowding and to ensure hospitals operated at 85% occupancy in line with other OECD countries. The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country.

Research indicates that the requirement to pay a charge results in lower uptake rates among those in the at-risk groups who do not hold Medical or GP Visit cards.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the potential for the winter flu season in 2020\/2021 to coincide with a resurgence of COVID, and the importance of minimising hospital attendance, the Government is expanding the provision of vaccination without charge to all of those in the at-risk groups, including healthcare workers, and to all children aged from 2 to 12 years.<\/p>  <p>  It is proposed to administer the vaccines via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years.  Given the importance of significantly increasing the level of uptake of the vaccine for the coming winter, resources will be provided to GPs and pharmacists not only to deliver the vaccination to the expanded groups, but to actively seek relevant patients and deliver vaccinations in a programmatic way, such as through dedicated flu vaccination clinics.<\/p>  <p>  The expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access to vaccination without charges.

My primary concern, as always in these situations, is for the workers and families who have been impacted by this decision. Many of these workers have been with the company for many years. The Government will make every State support available to those affected in order to help them transition and find new employment opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  The IDA have worked hard to sustain and support the firm&rsquo;s presence here and have had close and regular contact with management, both at a local and corporate level. The IDA also provided support to employee representatives as they put together a plan for efficiency savings that could be made in the Ballinasloe plant. <\/p>  <p>  Now that the decision has been taken to close the facility, The IDA is working closely with the company to market the plant to potential investors. This process is still ongoing. Both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland will use the employee skills audit in their efforts to attract new investment to Ballinasloe. The IDA Regional team has also connected the local Intreo office and the Education and Training Board with employees of Aptar. <\/p>  <p>  The West Regional Enterprise Plan Steering Committee met on 31 July and 8 September and considered the range of economic challenges and the impact of jobs losses in the region, including at Aptar. The committee was updated by the IDA and other regional agency representatives, and finalised options for additional measures that can be taken in to mitigate the COVID-19 and wider economic challenges in the region.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and its Agencies have also been working hard, over a sustained period, to support job creation in the regions. This has included setting ambitious targets to ensure that employment and investment are distributed as evenly as possible across the country. Last year, there were over 21,000 people employed in IDA-supported firms in Galway. This is almost double the number employed in 2010 (11,235). While the period ahead may prove more challenging, an important objective will remain securing new foreign direct investment for the County. <\/p>  <p>  Wider enterprise efforts are also underway to generate new growth in Galway and the surrounding area. For example, regional stakeholders &ndash; including Enterprise Ireland, the LEOs and the Higher and Further Education Institutes &ndash; are working together on implementation of the Regional Enterprise Plan for the West. This is aimed at strengthening the environment for job creation in the region and Ballinasloe will also benefit from this. <\/p>  <p>  Another important initiative in this context is the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, through which over &euro;16.7m in funding for the West &ndash; over three competitive calls &ndash; has been approved for collaborative regional enterprise projects.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. According to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s latest projections published earlier this year, our 2020 emissions could be 2 to 4% below 2005 levels, and we will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Covid-19 will undoubtedly impact our 2020 emissions, and this is not reflected in these projections. Pre-Covid estimates of the additional costs of this compliance requirement were in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of credits required. The Department is currently in discussion with the NTMA in relation to purchasing additional carbon credits from the market to make up the expected shortfall.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009\/28\/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. Latest projections by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland show that between 12.5% and 13.2% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements are expected to be met from renewable sources by 2020. This is a very significant\u00a0increase since 2005, when renewable energy was\u00a0at just\u00a03.1%.

Wicklow was worked intermittently for approximately 250 years to extract copper and other metals, which were processed on site. The mine closed in 1982 but mineral extraction has left a number of health and safety issues as well as an environmental legacy.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A feasibility study undertaken by the Department in 2008 developed integrated rehabilitation and management plans for the site that address human and ecological concerns, safety and physical hazards, heritage, future uses and long-term site monitoring and management.\u00a0 The overall estimated cost for the works included in the 2008 study was over &euro;50m with works envisaged to take place on a phased basis.<\/p>  <p>  Since the publication of the feasibility study, my Department has prioritised recommendations that addressed the most critical safety, human health and environmental concerns at the site. To date, in excess of &euro;5 million has been expended on remediation and monitoring costs at the site. Works undertaken include: the capping of open shafts; addressing the stability of the Dublin Rosslare railway line which passes through the site; regrading and capping the mine waste area at Tigroney West and constructing surface drains to divert the surface flow around or across the capped area into the river and vegetating the capped surface.\u00a0 A number of actions were also undertaken to preserve mining heritage features on the site, notably the complete rehabilitation of a pair of historic ore bins. <\/p>  <p>  As well as the health and safety work, environmental monitoring of the site is undertaken to ensure no significant change in conditions occurs without detection. An annual inspection of an underground tunnel, the 850 Adit, raised safety concerns about a section of the tunnel which passes under a local residential road.\u00a0 This necessitated emergency repairs to the Adit between January and June 2020 to ensure its stability and expenditure associated with this highly specialised work will be in excess of &euro;900,000. <\/p>  <p>  The project is managed by a Project Board which comprises staff from my Department including Technical, Legal and Administrative staff. In relation to the long term plans for the site, work is now underway to begin a re-evaluation of the 2008 feasibility study and the approach to managing and restoring the site.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. According to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s latest projections published earlier this year, our 2020 emissions could be 2 to 4% below 2005 levels, and we will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Covid-19 will undoubtedly impact our 2020 emissions, and this is not reflected in these projections. Pre-Covid estimates of the additional costs of this compliance requirement were in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of credits required. The Department is currently in discussion with the NTMA in relation to purchasing additional carbon credits from the market to make up the expected shortfall.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009\/28\/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. Latest projections by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland show that between 12.5% and 13.2% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements are expected to be met from renewable sources   by 2020. This is a very significant increase since 2005, when renewable energy was at just 3.1%. Nevertheless it is accepted that Ireland will not meet the 16% target.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is exploring the potential mechanisms and cost of addressing our renewable energy targets within the framework of the Directive. Any requirement for statistical transfer purchases will be undertaken against a background of discussions with the EU Commission and relevant Member States.  The public data on trades in statistical allowances in 2017 between Luxembourg, Lithuania and Estonia suggest potential costs for Ireland  in the order of &euro;110m, while the more recent agreement between the Netherlands and Denmark (June 2020) would suggest a significantly lower figure. However the cost of purchasing statistical transfers will depend on a number of factors, particularly the availability of supply and market costs at the time of the agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out our commitment to further increase our ambition, and halve our national carbon emissions over the course of the coming decade.

Work is also underway to move the commuter rail fleet to low-emitting alternatives. There are plans to electrify key heavily-used elements of the rail network by creating a full metropolitan area DART network for the Greater Dublin Area, which is the part of the national rail network that carries over 75% of total rail passengers each year.

The methodology for determining the PSO levy charge is also set out in S.I. 217 of 2002.The PSO levy has been in place since 2001, and is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.

The Programme for Government confirms that a reliable supply of safe, secure and clean energy is essential in order to deliver a phase-out of fossil fuels and that the Government is committed to the rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector and will take the necessary action to deliver at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030.  <\/p><p>The latest CRU decision paper for 2020\/21 gives details of schemes supported for the 2019\/2020 and 2020\/2021 periods (see Table 6.2).

The EVTI Scheme was established to encourage private and commercial car or van users who regularly use tolled roads to consider switching to an electric alternative. It was estimated that there were approximately 400,000 heavy toll users in Ireland and so a reduced tolling incentive would act as a meaningful inducement for a large number of vehicle owners.<\/p>  <p>  Following recommendations from Phase 2 of the LEV Taskforce, which focused on alternative fuels other than electricity, my Department received funding in Budget 2020 to expand the Scheme to include toll reductions for electric motorbikes, hydrogen fuelled passenger cars and small public service vehicles, and heavy duty vehicles (trucks, buses and coaches) fuelled by compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), hydrogen or electricity.  In line with Government policy, conventional hybrid vehicles are not included in this Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Under the LEVTI Scheme, which is administered by Transport Infrastructure Ireland on behalf of my Department, full battery electric, hydrogen, CNG and LNG vehicles qualify for a 50% toll reduction and plug-in hybrid vehicles qualify for a 25% toll reduction, up to a maximum annual threshold of &euro;500 for private vehicles and &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles including SPSVs. Greater off-peak reductions apply to the M50 toll and the Dublin Port Tunnel.<\/p>  <p>  As of the end of July 2020, almost 12,000 vehicles have registered under the LEVTI Scheme. The uptake rate is considered high in light of the fact that many of the toll roads in Ireland are located in the South and East of the country while alternatively fuelled vehicle ownership has a wider geographic distribution. To date, registered vehicles have completed almost 1 million transactions under the Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of funding, &euro;1.5 million was allocated to this Scheme in 2020. Due to the significant decline in road traffic this year because of COVID-19, fewer discounted journeys have been made by registered users and it is therefore unlikely that the entire budgeted allocation will be spent. It is my intention to continue the expanded LEVTI Scheme into 2021, and the level of funding allocated will be determined in the context of the annual budgetary process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500058#WRK02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500058#WRK03000"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[23783\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500058#WRK03100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the assistance that can be provided in the case of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1568","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":533,"content":"<p>In response to the Covid-19 restrictions introduced by the Government on 27 March 2020, regulations were brought in to extend the period of validity for all driving licences that expired between 1 March and 30 June for four months.<\/p>  <p>  A further extension was granted due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic restrictions and the disruption it has caused to licensing services delivered by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).

In practical terms, motorists who use my Departments online service at www.motortax.ie  to pay motor tax receive their tax reminder notice through electronic means, rather than a posted notice, thereby completing the overall transaction electronically. Customers who wish to remain with the paper based system can still do so, and continue to tax through the post or by personal appearance at motor tax offices. <\/p>  <p>  Departments in line with eGovernment objectives are required to identify opportunities which will optimise online service availability for customers and at the same time deliver efficiencies to the Exchequer. Traditionally approx 4.5m motortax reminder notices were issued by post, at significant cost to the State. By fully integrating this process with those vehicles that are taxed online,  all such notices now issue by email.  <\/p>  <p>  Moreover,  the mandatory introduction of the EU Payments Services Directive 2 (PSD2) will require Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to be used for all electronic transactions. The Directive will have implications for how service providers handle online transactions. The requirement ensures that electronic payments are performed with multi-factor authentication, to increase the security of electronic payments. This requires all online service providers to capture additional transaction information (including e-mail address) and send to the cardholder&rsquo;s bank. The cardholder&rsquo;s banks will use this data to verify the cardholder. The aim of the Directive is to reduce online fraud and increase cardholder confidence in using online services. The use of the email entered on the site, in conjunction with other transaction data, will help in making the transaction processes as seamless as possible, and remove or reduce any extra layer of friction at the payment stage.<\/p>  <p>  On a broader level, the COVID-19 crisis has also highlighted the need for digital government services and the demand on existing services.

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  <\/p>  <p>  The extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the post 2008 recession meant that grant funding for road improvement schemes had to be curtailed because expenditure on maintenance\/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. <\/p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason the primary focus for capital investment at present is the maintenance and renewal of the network and implementation of the 12 regional and local road projects identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in the NDP.  <\/p>  <p>  Some limited provision is being made in the capital budget for the appraisal of a pipeline of upgrade projects. This is intended to cover the appraisal of projects for future development, if possible.   <\/p>  <p>  All proposed projects must now comply with the revised Public Spending Code published in December 2019. An important change to the Public Spending Code is the introduction of a requirement for a Strategic Assessment Report (SAR) for all projects with an estimated expenditure of &euro;10 million or more.  The SAR is now a key deliverable at the first decision stage in the project appraisal process.  <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Strategic Assessment Report is to examine the rationale for a proposed project and to ensure the strategic alignment of projects with Government policy, including the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan.

Revenue has advised me that it is currently conducting a programme of compliance checks on all employers who availed of the scheme in order to confirm that they met the eligibility criteria and, crucially, that their employees received the correct amount of subsidy due to them.  As part of this programme, in order to ensure that employees were fairly treated and that TWSS funds were passed on to employees as intended, Revenue is seeking a sample of payslips from each employer. Under the TWSS legislation, employers were legally obliged to include the amount of subsidy paid on each employee&rsquo;s payslips. <\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that where an employer has been paid a temporary wage subsidy in respect of an employee and it transpires that the employer has not passed on the wage subsidy to the employee, or that the employer was not entitled to receive the wage subsidy in respect of the employee, the relevant law requires that the employer must refund the wage subsidy amount to Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  The TWSS has now been replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) since 1 September as legislated for under the recently enacted Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  The specific nature and terms of the EWSS arrangement are separate and distinct from the TWSS: the EWSS is an economy-wide enterprise support that gives a flat rate subsidy to qualifying employers.  The scheme is not an income support for employees, but is a stand-alone measure to preserve the link between employee and employer and support firm viability through an unprecedented enterprise environment and it is based on clear, objective criteria that may be determined by the Revenue Commissioners.  <\/p>  <p>  The EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.  For every qualifying employee paid between &euro;203 and &euro;1,462 gross wages per week, the level of subsidy paid to the employer is &euro;203.  For every qualifying employee paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;202.99 gross per week, the subsidy is &euro;151.50.  No subsidy is payable in respect of employees paid less than &euro;151.50 gross or more than &euro;1,462 gross per week.<\/p>  <p>  The question of an individual employee&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee are matters that are outside the remit of the EWSS.  The scheme has no role in relation to the employer\/employee relationship in so far as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned, subject, of course, to the employer paying the minimum amount of gross wages to an employee, as outlined above, in order to qualify for subsidy.   <\/p>  <p>  Anything beyond that would be expressly outside of the remit of the Revenue Commissioners, but there are a sufficient number of bodies that deal with employment disputes in Ireland and where there is a high amount of expertise including the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Although these bodies fall under the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, it is understood that there are already checks and balances in place to ensure fairness to employees and employers.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of employer eligibility, the EWSS legislation requires that immediately at the end of each month, from August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the EWSS must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances.  Following such review, if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer will meet the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, namely, at least a 30 per cent reduction in business turnover or customer orders in the period from 1 July to 31 December 2020 by reference to the corresponding 2019 period, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the administration of the EWSS will be placed under the care and management of Revenue, as was done with its predecessor, the TWSS. While Revenue&rsquo;s focus on the EWSS in its early stages will no doubt be concentrated on getting the scheme up and running and ensuring that all employers who are eligible for subsidy payments receive the payments in a timely manner, I have no doubt but that Revenue will, in due course, undertake an appropriate employer compliance campaign relating to employer eligibility under the EWSS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500059#WRL04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration Tax","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500059#WRL04800"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[23957\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500059#WRL04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of vehicles that have been registered through the VRT system in each month during 2020; the total revenue received in VRT payments in each month in 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the number of vehicles registered through the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) system in each month during 2020 is provided in the table below, along with the VRT payments received. <\/p><p>These figures are provisional and may be subject to some revisions.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Month<\/th>       <th>New<\/th>       <th>Used<\/th>       <th>Total<\/th>       <th>VRT receipts (Payments   received &euro;m)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>January<\/td>       <td>38,199<\/td>       <td>9,277<\/td>       <td>47,476<\/td>       <td>&euro;163.6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>February<\/td>       <td>17,089<\/td>       <td>8,444<\/td>       <td>25,533<\/td>       <td>&euro;99.8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>March<\/td>       <td>8,468<\/td>       <td>6,495<\/td>       <td>14,963<\/td>       <td>&euro;62.9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>April<\/td>       <td>878<\/td>       <td>254<\/td>       <td>1,132<\/td>       <td>&euro;25.4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>May<\/td>       <td>2,628<\/td>       <td>965<\/td>       <td>3,593<\/td>       <td>&euro;7.4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>June<\/td>       <td>1,899<\/td>       <td>5,075<\/td>       <td>6,974<\/td>       <td>&euro;15.9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>July<\/td>       <td>26,847<\/td>       <td>11,554<\/td>       <td>38,401<\/td>       <td>&euro;108.4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>August<\/td>       <td>6,229<\/td>       <td>10,231<\/td>       <td>16,460<\/td>       <td>&euro;68.0<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500059#WRL05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":607,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500059#WRL05100"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[24145\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500059#WRL05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of employers on the employment wage subsidy scheme by county.","asker":"1514","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":609,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[23723\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500059#WRL05300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons presently in receipt of EWSS; if the Government is prepared to re-examine the conditions for eligibility to EWSS in view of the many critical comments regarding the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":610,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 265 together.<\/p><p>Revenue published detailed statistical updates on the TWSS on a weekly basis for the duration of the scheme in order to provide as timely and transparent data on the utilisation and impact of the TWSS as possible.

It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.This adaptation from the TWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable. <\/p><p>As of 10 September, over 32,200 employers have registered for the Scheme which is a healthy level of applications and already nearly half of all those who availed of the TWSS over the duration of that scheme.  As employers continue to register for the EWSS and file payroll with Revenue for the relevant employees, the numbers of employees that will be supported by the scheme will be made available and the implications of the movement from TWSS to EWSS will be assessed.  Revenue has confirmed that it has started to include information on the EWSS in their statistics, also located at the above link.  The EWSS detail in the statistics, including the numbers of employees being supported, will be expanded in the coming weeks as the scheme progresses.  <\/p><p>In the meantime, I can confirm that it is expected that the EWSS will support around 350,000 jobs into the beginning of 2021.

A further &euro;2.25 billion has been allocated to the EWSS until the end of March 2021 and the Deputies&rsquo; attention is also drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan, such as the Re-Start Grants and Credit Guarantee scheme. <\/p><p>I can confirm to the Deputy that the operation of the EWSS and its effectiveness will be kept under close review over the coming months.

It will remain in place until March 2021, thereby allowing employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the recently enacted Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020, payment of the EWSS will be made following receipt of the regular monthly payroll return to Revenue which is due on the 14th of the month following payment of the emoluments.  The transfer of the subsidy will, in general, be made within two working days after receipt of the monthly payroll submission.  Depending on the pay-date used by the employer, this may be as short a turnaround as 16 days, although it could be up to 6 weeks after the pay date in some cases. <\/p>  <p>  The up-to-date position is that having regard to the timeline for employers to make claims to Revenue for support under EWSS, which aligns with the normal operation of the PAYE system, it is likely to be closer to the end of this month or early next month before we are in a position to get a fuller picture of the operation of the payment system and to evaluate its efficacy. <\/p>  <p>  The main purpose behind the adaption from the TWSS is to reduce the administrative burden of the scheme for employers by regularising the procedure for the processing of payments, and thereby reduce errors and the need for reconciliations which have had to take place under the TWSS.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that the turnaround time for payments under the TWSS in some cases was shorter, but this is one of a number of changes in the nature and operation of the EWSS, many of which are more flexible than the TWSS &ndash; for example, the types of worker who qualify has been broadened to include seasonal workers and new hires.  <\/p>  <p>  Many of the strictest public health restrictions on the economy have been eased and it is expected that businesses are able to shoulder more of the economic burden of their businesses, so it is appropriate that the level of State subsidy be moderated.

As such, I have considerable sympathy for such policyholders.  However, neither I, nor the Central Bank can direct or require that insurers cover claims, including those resulting from infectious diseases such as COVID-19, nor can we adjudicate on the validity of such claims.<\/p>  <p>  That being said, this is an issue that Minister of State Fleming and I continue to follow closely.  Whether a business can make a claim in relation to COVID-19 related loss of earnings will depend on the specifics of their policy. In cases where there is infectious disease cover, there may be other considerations which will influence the decision of an insurer to not pay a claim. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, it is important therefore for businesses to engage directly with their insurer or broker on these matters, and where they believe an insurer has incorrectly rejected their claim, they should either consider referring the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSPO) for adjudication or where their claim is in excess of the FSPO &euro;3 million limit they may wish to consider legal action. I understand that this is already happening in a number of cases.<\/p>  <p>  Both my Department and I have had considerable engagement with the insurance industry on the issue of business interruption claims over the past number of months. From the outset I have made it very clear that as a general rule insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.  They should engage with those impacted businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour those elements of the policies covered, in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. Furthermore, I have made it clear that the Government direction to close a business in the context of COVID 19 should be considered as such where a claim may be appropriate.  I have also indicated to the insurance industry that adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, is doing the industry significant reputational damage and is not treating customers fairly. Most recently when Minister Fleming and I met with Insurance Ireland to discuss the Programme for Government&rsquo;s ambitious insurance reform agenda, I continued to stress the need for an appropriate response from insurers.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Business Interruption Insurance Supervisory Framework sets out it&rsquo;s expectations of insurance firms in handling COVID-19 related business interruption insurance claims. Where customers have an entitlement to claim under a business interruption insurance policy, the Bank expects that claims will be processed and paid promptly and fully. Significantly, where cover and related issues are disputed, the Bank expects firms to pay the reasonable costs of customer plaintiffs in agreed test case litigation.  I welcome this move and I am aware that a number of test cases are due to be heard in the courts next month.  The Central Bank is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to monitor the business interruption issue and will engage appropriately with the Central Bank on the matter. This issue is recognised in the Programme for Government&rsquo;s extensive cross-Departmental insurance reform agenda, which amongst other things seeks to address consumer and business concerns on the cost and availability of insurance by building on the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[23386\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he plans to impose further increases in diesel levies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":626,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":627,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":628,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[23398\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the decision will be reviewed to cease the temporary wage subsidy scheme to public houses that remain closed in view of the fact that these employers are not in a position to top up the employment wage subsidy scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[23744\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost to revenue of returning the new EWSS to the payment levels and thresholds that previously existed under the TWSS; if he will provide a comparison between returning to the previous TWSS rates and the current EWSS rates in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":630,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 280 together.<\/p><p>Between March and August 2020, over 65,000 employers received a subsidy under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) with payments worth over &euro;2.8 billion paid out to a total of 663,100 workers.

It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll. This adaptation from the TWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable. The EWSS is an economy wide scheme and it cannot be tailored to meet individual sectors&rsquo; needs. For businesses experiencing financial difficulties, there are a number of options open to them apart from the EWSS, including State backed loans and grants. Measures include the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.<\/p><p>It is expected that the EWSS will support around 350,000 jobs into the beginning of 2021.  On this basis, it is estimated that the EWSS will cost &euro;2.25 billion (&euro;1.35 billion in 2020 inclusive of seasonal workers and &euro;0.9 billion in 2021).  The scheme is demand led and a significant surge in claims may require a policy review and re-evaluation of the terms of the scheme.  These cost predictions are therefore subject to review and for every additional 50,000 qualifying employments, the cost increases by &euro;0.25 billion.  <\/p><p>The tentative costs per month between EWSS and TWSS are set out in the table below but it is emphasised that the cost of the EWSS is a projection and subject to review.  Further, in both cases, the costs are on the basis of the schemes as implemented in their totality and individual elements of the scheme (such as the rates and qualifying criteria) have not been disaggregated.

Consequently, neither I in my role as Minister for Finance nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive).<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, it is important to remind the Deputy that current government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. To achieve this aim there is a focus on:<\/p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,  <\/p>  <p>  - implementation of flood relief management plans by the OPW to deliver flood relief schemes, and   <\/p>  <p>  - maintaining channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in affected areas.<\/p>  <p>  The above approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and industry representatives Insurance Ireland. This provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes, which should in-turn provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed. In this regard, the Insurance Ireland\/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that while there has been an overall increase in the provision of flood insurance between 2015 and 2019, many householders are still experiencing difficulties.

Over the last year my Department launched a public consultation on Climate Change and Insurance and subsequently met with interested parties.

Given the material impact of being a qualifying company on the tax charge of the company, the tax note generally explicitly states that the company&rsquo;s current tax is calculated in accordance with section 110 TCA 1997.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Lending","counter":646,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM03000"},{"type":"question","counter":647,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[23609\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration has been given to entering further negotiations with the lending banks regarding a possible extension of mortgage breaks for those who continue to suffer significant drops in salary as a direct result of Covid-19.","asker":"1626","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":648,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, on 18 March the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) announced a co-ordinated approach by banks and other lenders to help their businesses and personal customers who were economically impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.  These measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements, and included a loan payment break of up to three months which was subsequently extended for up to a six month period.<\/p>  <p>  The financial circumstances of many of the borrowers which availed of a Covid-19 payment break have now normalised and they are in a position to return to making payments.  In that regard, the BPFI has indicated that the broad options available to borrowers coming off a payment break will be to return to payments over the existing term of the loan, or to extend the term of the loan so as to make the monthly repayments more affordable for the borrower.  It is important that lenders and borrowers coming off a payment break will engage so as to select the most appropriate new repayment arrangement in their individual case.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, at the end of a payment beak there will be some borrowers who will continue to experience financial difficulty.  In these circumstances, it will be particularly important that engagement should take place as early as possible.  I would, therefore, encourage any borrower who feels he or she may have difficulty in resuming payments after a Covid-19 payment break to contact their lender and if possible to do so before the payment break end date.  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections and lenders have specific obligations, under the Central Bank consumer protection framework, to support and work with borrowers in arrears or in pre-arrears. In particular, lenders are obliged to engage and work with co-operating borrowers to identify an appropriate and sustainable solution having regard to the particular circumstances of a case and that lenders should use the full suite of restructuring solutions available to them.  <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, and the industry to seek to ensure that banks continue to work with and pro-actively assist their customers who will still be experiencing difficulty at the end of a Covid-19 payment break and to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection framework will be fully available to mortgage borrowers that will still need support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value Added Tax","counter":649,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM03300"},{"type":"question","counter":650,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[23633\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of VAT collected from residential electricity customers in each of the years 2015 to 2019; the VAT that was collected from all electricity customers in the same years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[23634\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of VAT collected from residential gas customers in each of the years 2015 to 2019; the VAT that was collected from all gas customers in the same years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":652,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 263 together.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that traders are not required to separately identify the VAT yield generated from the supply of specific services on their VAT returns and as such it is not possible to separately report the VAT collected from the sale of electricity or the sale of gas. <\/p><p>However, using information from a combination of Personal Consumption Expenditure reports as compiled by the Central Statistics Office and Ireland&rsquo;s VAT Own Resources, an estimate of the VAT on residential electricity and residential gas for the available years of 2015 to 2018 is provided below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>Estimated VAT yield - Electricity<\/th>       <th>Estimated VAT yield - Gas<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2015<\/td>       <td>&euro;243m<\/td>       <td>&euro;68m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016<\/td>       <td>&euro;228m<\/td>       <td>&euro;66m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>&euro;193m<\/td>       <td>&euro;60m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>&euro;206m<\/td>       <td>&euro;65m<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Yield","counter":653,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM03800"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[23635\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500060#WRM03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount collected in carbon tax on residential gas customers in each of the years 2015 to 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":655,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that a breakdown of the Carbon Tax receipts by residential gas customers is not available as this information is not specified in tax returns.

The legislation to give effect to this increase has been outlined in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020 and was signed into law on 1 August 2020. <\/p><p>In summary, the legislation provides that where applicants<\/p><p>(I) enter into a contract for the purchase of a new house or apartment, or<\/p><p>(ii) make the first draw down of the mortgage in the case of a self-build property, <\/p><p>during the period from 23 July 2020 to 31 December 2020, they will be eligible for increased relief under the HTB scheme to the lesser of:<\/p><p>- &euro;30,000 (increased from &euro;20,000),<\/p><p>- 10 per cent (increased from 5 per cent) of either the purchase price of the new home or, in the case of self builds, the completion value of the property, or,<\/p><p>- the amount of Income Tax and DIRT paid in the four years prior to making the application.<\/p><p>All other conditions of the original HTB scheme remains the same. <\/p><p>The purpose of HTB is two-fold, firstly to assist first-time buyers with the deposit they need to buy or build a new home and secondly to stimulate the growth in supply of new homes. In assisting young people to take their first steps into home-ownership, the scheme supports a fundamental social policy objective.  <\/p><p>I assume the Deputy is referring to the advice that I received from my officials in preparing the enhanced HTB measure for the Stimulus package.

This is because the circumstances of potential beneficiaries are unknown. However, I would draw the Deputy's attention to a key feature of the scheme which is designed to minimise any deadweight effect, i.e. the minimum loan to value of 70% in order for purchases to be eligible for HTB - that requirement has not changed.  In addition, as the as the Deputy may be aware, in 2018 I commissioned an independent Cost benefit Analysis (CBA) of the Help to Buy incentive. The report of the CBA was published on the day of Budget 2019.

Specifically, the pricing and availability of non-life insurance has been subject to considerable volatility. Accordingly, reform of this sector has been, and remains a key priority of Government as is recognised in a considerable number of Programme for Government commitments.  <\/p>  <p>  However, the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. Consequently, neither I in my role as Minister for Finance nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive).<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance if a consumer has a complaint with the service of their insurance provider, it is advisable that that they pursue this through the firm's internal complaint resolution process.  The Consumer Protection Code requires that if, after 40 days, the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the consumer may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  This provides an independent arbitration of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p>  <p>  In order to be helpful to the Deputy, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland on this matter who responded that they do not track data on pricing of classes of vehicles (such as electric vehicles) as pricing is a matter for each individual company to assess relative to their particular commercial strategy, risk appetite and claims experience.  They indicated many of the major underwriters have specific products designed for electric vehicles, with bespoke features such as battery breakdown assistance. Insurance Ireland also noted that there are a number of specialist intermediaries entering into the electric vehicle market.  They indicated that the specific issue outlined in the question is not one which has been raised by consumers to them through their Insurance Information Service.  This Service is for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, and can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu.   <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I believe the issue raised in the question demonstrates why it is important for consumers, including businesses, to shop around on their insurance policies.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), on its website, recommends that consumers get quotes from a number of insurance companies, including their current one. I believe that this advice applies to businesses as well as individuals. The CCPC website also includes a motor insurance shopping around checklist and other tips on cutting motor insurance costs which may prove useful to consumers and businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500061#WRN04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Efficiency","counter":711,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500061#WRN04100"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[24032\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500061#WRN04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is considering incentives for households in view of the success of the home renovation incentive for persons to upgrade the energy efficiency of their homes in budget 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":713,"content":"<p>The Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) was introduced by Section 477B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in 2014 and was terminated in accordance with its statutory sunset clause on 31 December 2018. <\/p>  <p>  With only four weeks to go, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on what may or may not be contained in the annual Budget. <\/p>  <p>  However, it is the case that the re-introduction of such an incentive, even for a modified purpose, could be very costly.

The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 also contains a related commitment.  <\/p>  <p>  Equality budgeting should not be regarded as something separate from the budget process; the intention is to embed equality perspectives across the whole-of-year budgetary process. <\/p>  <p>  The pilot programme of equality budgeting was introduced for the 2018 budgetary cycle, anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework. Following the achievements of the pilot programme, Equality Budgeting was expanded in 2019 to further develop the gender budgeting elements and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. <\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for proofing expenditure programmes, the selection of indicators, and making progress towards achieving the high-level goals articulated remains a matter for the individual line Departments in the first instance. The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to facilitate and advance this initiative and provide support for Departments to clarify and to fulfil their equality-related objectives. <\/p>  <p>  To further guide the rollout of equality budgeting, an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group was established, holding its first meeting in September 2018. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy and progress the initiative.<\/p>  <p>  All public bodies in Ireland have responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and plans. This is a legal obligation, referred to as the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty, and it originates in Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) are members of the Expert Advisory group and the Public Sector Duty is reflected in all Equality Budgeting policies as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  In 2019 my Department, in liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality, commissioned the OECD to undertake a Policy Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. This was published in tandem with Budget 2020. The report reviews Ireland&rsquo;s equality budgeting programme and provides recommendations on its further development, in light of international experience. <\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the OECD recommendations has already commenced. This work is being informed also by the views of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group, and work is well underway on the various recommendations in the OECD report. <\/p>  <p>  One example is recommendation 9, which calls for the development of an equality data strategy to further bolster the impact of equality budgeting. Monitoring and reporting from a given dimension of equality is only possible if the necessary disaggregated data is available. With this in mind, the CSO have conducted a data audit to evaluate the quality of existing administrative datasets from an equality perspective. This audit has been guided by a sub-group of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group, and a report will be published in the coming weeks. Having a comprehensive understanding of the data landscape is a necessary prerequisite to implementing the remaining recommendations of the OECD report. <\/p>  <p>  In the Programme for Government, the Government has also set out its commitment to develop a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded, holistic view of how Irish society is faring; use these well-being indicators, as well as economic indicators, to highlight inequalities and ensure that policies are driven by a desire to do better by people; and ensure that the well-being framework will be utilised in a systematic way across government policymaking (at local and national levels) in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting progress (as an important complement to existing economic measurement tools).<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of wellbeing budgeting will also bring a framework, which will inform equality budgeting development to areas of most need, and link departmental action to national and international equality goals, in line with OECD recommendation 1.  <\/p>  <p>  At present, officials in my Department are developing the programme of work that will support the Government in meeting this commitment with regard to well-being.  This work programme will be progressed on a cross-Governmental basis in liaison with the Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Finance and other government departments as well as key stakeholders and experts in this area. <\/p>  <p>  Once developed, the Government will promote the use of a well-being framework in a systematic way across the spectrum of public policy-making in Ireland, including in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting on progress. This will be an important complement to existing economic measurement tools that are in place to support well-being and outcomes-based approaches to policy making.<\/p>  <p>  One such existing tool is the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH Model, which will continue to be utilised to help Government understand the impact of proposed reforms on households. Moreover, initiatives such as the Spending Review process, which is a key platform for evidence-informed policy making across the Civil Service, will continue to produce evidence relevant to the wellbeing and outcomes of people, households, businesses and sectors of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Taken as a whole, a broad range of initiatives are under way to advance the objectives of equality budgeting, deliver on the OECD recommendations step-by-step, and in particular to promote transparency and accountability in reporting across the budget cycle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500061#WRN04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Earca&iacute;ocht san Earn&aacute;il Phoibl&iacute;","counter":720,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500061#WRN05000"},{"type":"question","counter":721,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[23822\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500061#WRN05100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"an mb&iacute;onn aon dualgas ar Ranna rialtais daoine a earc&uacute; &oacute;n bpain&eacute;al d&rsquo;Oifigigh Feidhmi&uacute;chain le Gaeilge, seachas leas a bhaint as an ngn&aacute;thphain&eacute;al d&rsquo;Oifigigh Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in; agus c&eacute;n iarrachta&iacute; at&aacute; &aacute; nd&eacute;anamh aige chun cinnti&uacute; go dtiocfaidh m&eacute;ad&uacute; ar l&iacute;on na st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;seach a bhfuil cumas sa Ghaeilge acu.","asker":"1485","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":722,"content":"<p>Mar is eol don Teachta D&aacute;la is earcaitheoir neamhspl&eacute;ach &eacute; an tSeirbh&iacute;s um Cheapach&aacute;in Phoibl&iacute; (SCP) d&rsquo;iarrth&oacute;ir&iacute; nua at&aacute; tagtha isteach san St&aacute;sSeirbh&iacute;s.<\/p><p>Go tr&eacute;imhsi&uacute;il SCP na hiarrath&oacute;ir&iacute; le B&eacute;arla agus le l&iacute;ofacht sa Ghaeilge ar phain&eacute;il na St&aacute;tseibh&iacute;se. <\/p><p>Tuigim &oacute; SCP go bhfuil 25 duine s&aacute;nnaithe agus earcaithe acu sa bhliain 2019 &oacute; bpain&eacute;il tiomaithe na St&aacute;tsheirbh&iacute;se at&aacute; l&iacute;ofa sa Ghaeilge agus sa Bh&eacute;arla do na Roinne\/Oifig&iacute; &eacute;agsula.<\/p><p>T&aacute; an cin&eacute;al sonrach don phost seo ina raibh na daoine s&aacute;nnaithe faoi churam an Ceannasa&iacute; Achmhainn&iacute; Daonna i ngach su&iacute;omh do na Roinne agus oifig&iacute;. <\/p><p>Sa ch&aacute;is an pain&eacute;il Oifigeach Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in fogra&iacute;odh an com&oacute;rtas Oifigeach Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in i Mh&iacute; na Nollag 2019 do lucht labhartha na Gaeilge.

A period of appointment may be renewed for a further period, to a maximum of eight years in total.  If exceptionally it is decided that a Board member should serve a further additional Board term, or that a renewal of appointment would bring the total period of service to above eight years, this requires Ministerial approval.

The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector and allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and productions to go ahead in the near future while also complying with public health protection measures.

Ireland signed up to the Agreement in 2003.   The agreement includes a commitment that &ldquo;Parties shall endeavour to phase out the use of lead shot for hunting in wetlands as soon as possible in accordance with self-imposed and published timetables.\"  This is because there is slow accumulation of lead from shot in wetlands where hunting occurs.  The lead is generally harmful in the environment and can also be consumed by wildfowl. <\/p>  <p>  Since the Agreement was signed, the European Commission published a draft Regulation for consideration by Member States on the use of lead shot in and around wetlands following a report on the matter by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).  It is understood that interested parties in Member States including hunting interests in Ireland made submissions on the matter during a Commission consultation process.<\/p>  <p>  My Department held consultations with interested parties including hunting and farming interests on this matter. While Department supports the underlying thrust of the Regulations and is committed to phasing out lead shot in and around wetlands following consultation with hunting and farming interests, it did make a case for a longer lead in time to deal with transitional challenges and in that regard submitted documentation to the REACH Committee of the European Union, the forum where the Regulation is under discussion.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue was most recently discussed at the REACH meeting held on 3 September.  Notwithstanding Ireland&rsquo;s reservations on the draft Regulation in relation to the lead-in time and as we are committed to phasing out lead shot in and around wetlands, Ireland indicated at the meeting that we would support the draft Regulation which does envisage a transitional phase.  A vote was taken at the meeting on the draft Regulation and it was passed by the necessary majority by Member States with Ireland voting to support the measure.  The draft Regulation will now be sent to the Council and European Parliament for scrutiny for a period of 3 months. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will maintain consultation with relevant interests including hunting and farming organisations in the coming period in relation to implementation of the draft Regulation should it become law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500063#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":831,"content":"<p>Question No. 326 answered with Question No. 323.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hare Coursing","counter":832,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500063#WRP01800"},{"type":"question","counter":833,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[23559\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500063#WRP01900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if licences for the capture of hares for the 2020-21 hare coursing season have been issued; if not, when licences will be issued; his plans to place specific conditions on those licences in view of the incidents of RDH2 found in the population; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":834,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[23500\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500063#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the process in terms of the renewal of the national coursing licence; if there is a consultation process and timeframe; and his views on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":835,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 346 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am at present considering a license application from the Irish Coursing Club on behalf of its associated clubs to capture hares for the forthcoming 2020\/2011 coursing season.

While its effects on the Irish hare population are largely unknown, the impact on rabbits in other countries have been widely published with significant local and regional declines seen in some areas. There have been anecdotal reports of rabbit population declines in Ireland as well, but we do not have the data to support these and rabbits are known to be vulnerable to a number of different diseases, including myxomatosis. <\/p>  <p>  While the rabbit is not a protected species it is an important part of wild ecosystems and a vital source of food for several protected species such as stoats, buzzards and eagles. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish hare is one of our native mammals and is protected under both national and EU legislation. If RHD2 was to become widespread in this species, the impacts on its conservation status could be catastrophic. <\/p>  <p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department, with the assistance of the Veterinary Laboratory Service in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) are collaborating on a national survey to assess the level of spread of this disease around the country. The survey will examine 500-1,000 rabbits taken from hunting bags at different locations in every county of Ireland.  The rabbits sampled will be those ordinarily taken by licensed hunters in the course of their normal leisure shooting, pest control or crop protection. These rabbits will in turn be tested to see if they are either carrying the disease or if they have been exposed to this disease. Due to the nature of this project, the NPWS &amp;amp; DAFM have sought the assistance of the National Association of Regional Game Councils (NARGC) in gathering samples from every county. <\/p>  <p>  The survey will provide data on the prevalence and distribution of the disease in Ireland, but will also help us to learn more about the potential for rabbits to recover and develop immunity from the disease. The results of this survey will also allow us to better understand the risk of spread of RHD2 into hares. <\/p>  <p>  The aim is for all samples to be collected and submitted to local Regional Veterinary Laboratories before the end of October. Lab analysis will follow and is expected to take several months. The survey results will be published as soon as they are available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500063#WRP02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":839,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500063#WRP02500"},{"type":"question","counter":840,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[23796\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500063#WRP02600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the position regarding a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":841,"content":"<p>Both species of seal in Irish waters - the Harbour or Common Seal and the more numerous Grey Seal - are protected under the EU Habitats Directive and Ireland is obliged to maintain their numbers at a favourable conservation level.

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. <\/p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave. There are no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion or to provide for further financial assistance outside of the scheme.<\/p><p>In regard to extending the scheme to other counties, as matters currently stand, the position is that the scheme is based on the information that was available to the Board at the time of its adoption in February 2014 and having regard to the detail set out in the Report of the Pyrite Panel (July 2012).  <\/p><p>The Panel undertook a desktop study, in conjunction with a stakeholder consultation, to establish certain facts in relation to the potential exposure of pyrite in dwellings.  The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity.<\/p><p>Seventy four estates were identified to the Pyrite Panel, as possibly having pyrite.  At that time all of these estates were located in the five local authority areas of Dublin City, Fingal, Kildare, Meath and Offaly, although the scheme was subsequently amended in February 2015 in the light of relevant information that emerged in the local authority areas of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin with regard to pyritic heave in a small number of housing developments in each of the two local authority areas.<\/p><p>Any proposal to amend the scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for the Pyrite Resolution Board and any such proposal would require detailed consideration of the evidence. The recommendations of the Pyrite Panel, which informed the establishment of the pyrite remediation scheme, were premised on a number of pertinent factors.  Similar factors would need to be examined by the Pyrite Resolution Board in advance of extending the scheme to other areas, given the scheme is ultimately one of last resort.<\/p><p>As a minimum, in order to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of amending the scheme, I understand that the Board would require a report addressing the following information: -<\/p><p>- the extent and severity of damage to dwellings in the local authority area caused by pyritic heave in the subfloor hardcore;<\/p><p>- verification, if available, that the damage has been caused by pyrite;<\/p><p>- the background to the occurrence of the damage;<\/p><p>- details of any structural warranty policies for the dwellings;<\/p><p>- the history of the estate&rsquo;s construction, numbers, type of dwellings etc;<\/p><p>- the source of the hardcore supplied to dwellings in the estate; and<\/p><p>- any supporting geological assessments.<\/p><p>In addition to the above, the Board may also make such further enquiries as it considers necessary in order to assist it in considering the matter.  In this regard, it would be advisable for the residents to confirm the nature of the pyrite problems in the area, i.e. do the problems stem from reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material which is giving rise to pyritic heave and consequential significant pyritic damage.  <\/p><p>In regard to home ownership and the eligibility criterion, the Act also sets out the broad parameters which the Board must have regard to when establishing the eligibility criteria for the pyrite remediation scheme. <\/p><p>Section 15(3) of the Act, which prevents applications being made under the scheme by a person who purchases a dwelling on or after 12 December 2013 (the publication date of the Bill), applies where that person knew or ought to have known that the dwelling was constructed using hardcore containing reactive pyrite. <\/p><p>I understand that Section 15(3) does not represent a blanket exclusion preventing applications being made under the scheme by a person who purchases a dwelling on or after 12 December 2013. It is, however, a matter for the Board to determine, based on facts and evidence in each individual case, whether an applicant is or is not entitled to apply for inclusion into the Pyrite Remediation Scheme.<\/p><p>It is important to note that, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Board is independent in the performance of its functions, and as Minister, I have no role in the operational matters relating to the implementation of the scheme.

They are actively reviewing and assessing all available information to ascertain if they can commence an investigation under Part 7A of the Act.  It is not possible for me to comment further at this time on the specifics of this case or the actions that are or may be taken on foot of the alleged illegal eviction. To do so could prejudice the  dispute process and role of the RTB.  The RTB must ensure it is independent and impartial to ensure that the integrity of its functions (including the resolution of disputes and imposition of sanctions) is upheld at all times.<\/p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to ensuring that we have the strongest protections possible, balancing the need for fairness, and with this in mind I have directed the RTB, under Section 151(2) of the Residential Tenancies Acts, to fully investigate this incident and to make a report to me, with relevant recommendations, as soon as possible.  This cannot be done until such times as the case has concluded, at which point the RTB will submit their findings to me for consideration.<\/p>  <p>  On receipt of its report I will swiftly consider it and move to implement any relevant recommendations that will further protect tenants. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500063#WRP05087","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":869,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[23433\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500063#WRP05200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of persons evicted since the blanket ban on evictions was lifted in August 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":870,"content":"<p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Acts  2004-2020, to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.   <\/p>  <p>  The Clerk of the D&aacute;il requested that arrangements be put in place to facilitate the provision of information by State Bodies to members of the Oireachtas.

It is the aim of my Department that every child has access to equitable education and that each learner feels safe and happy in the school environment, at every stage. <\/p>  <p>  At primary level, the current curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community. The Primary Curriculum is currently complemented by Guidelines on Traveller Education in Primary Schools (DES, 2002) and Intercultural Education in the Primary School (NCCA, 2005). These guidelines promote an intercultural approach in the classroom and provide practical examples of how intercultural themes, including Traveller culture, can be accommodated through the various curriculum areas. They aim to contribute to the development of a shared ability and sense of responsibility to protect for each other the right to be different and to live free from discrimination.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum Assessment, (NCCA), is currently in the process of redesigning and redeveloping the primary curriculum and through an ongoing public consultation is providing an opportunity to all stakeholders to consider how it may be restructured. Inclusive education and diversity is one of eight overarching principles of the draft PC framework and provides for equity of opportunity and participation in children&rsquo;s learning. Inclusive education celebrates diversity and responds to the uniqueness of every child. <\/p>  <p>  While the Department prescribes curricula and syllabuses for implementation in primary schools, it does not endorse any textbooks for use in schools. Neither does the Department have any involvement in the publication of such textbooks, beyond informing publishers in a timely fashion about the introduction of any new syllabus.<\/p>  <p>  At post primary level, schools have the autonomy to determine which textbooks and\/or resources to use in order to best aid the delivery of the curriculum, however there some prescribed texts for English at both junior and senior cycle. A diverse range of authors, including poets and playwrights, is included in the prescribed lists of texts. The texts referred to are not compulsory, but are options on a wider list of prescribed texts. Which text is used in a school remains at the discretion of that school.<\/p>  <p>  A variety of factors influence the selection of prescribed texts, including the aspiration to achieve social and cultural diversity and inclusivity, the age appropriateness of texts, the merit of the text on grounds of excellence, as well as practical factors, such as availability and cost. As prescribed lists are developed from year to year, additional factors come to the fore and influence the choices made. Contemporary issues and world events also impact on prescription. It is the intention that prescribed texts for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate English are diverse and inclusive, and meet the needs of teachers and students. Current and previous text lists offer many opportunities to explore issues relating to racism and inclusion\/exclusion of particular groups in society. Achieving a balanced list remains a challenging and worthwhile endeavour and work continues to create a broadly balanced, diverse and inclusive list every year.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this Department&rsquo;s ongoing curricular reform, issues in relation to inclusivity\/diversity etc. will be considered as part of the ongoing reviews in relation to the curriculum at both primary and post-primary level. <\/p>  <p>  The NCCA is also in the process of conduction a review of senior cycle. The NCCA commenced the review in late 2016. As part of the first phase of the review the NCCA conducted international research on senior cycle in a number of other jurisdictions. The report of this research was published in February 2018.\u00a0 From September 2018, the NCCA engaged with a cohort of schools as well as hosted a series of national seminars. This was followed by a wider public consultation. This phase of consultation was informed by two important NCCA documents, an Interim report of review of Senior Cycle Education and accompanying Senior Cycle Review Consultation Document. The Interim Report on the review brings together the discussions held during the review in schools, at the national seminars and the national and international research on senior cycle, while the Senior Cycle Consultation document outlines the emerging areas for further consideration in senior cycle. Elements of the review are examining how senior cycle can be inclusive to students from all backgrounds. The NCCA are now considering the findings to date and are working to produce an advisory report.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has also been progressing work on the\u00a0issue of the place of Traveller history and culture in the curriculum, from early years to senior cycle, in order to identify current opportunities for children and young people to encounter and learn about aspects of Traveller culture and history. As part of this process the Council has engaged directly with Traveller repreesentative bodies.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Department will continue to address the areas such as cultural awareness through a suite of supports including the recently revised Stay Safe Programme and the provision of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level and in initial teacher education. It will ensure that such programmes enable teachers to deal with teaching and learning needs of all students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500066#WRS05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1043,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[23441\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500066#WRS05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress made on the programme for Government commitment to develop inclusive and age-appropriate RSE and SPHE curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships and making appropriate legislative changes if necessary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1044,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Access to RSE is an important right for students. Schools have a responsibility to provide for this vital aspect of education to young people. Importantly, a school&rsquo;s RSE programme should be planned in consultation with parents. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The entire focus of RSE is on preparing young people for adult life, on emphasising the importance of respect for themselves and each other, developing healthy relationships, understanding the importance of consent and helping young people to develop and mature in a positive light. This will be done in a manner that is appropriate to the ages of children.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2018, a review of RSE in schools was announced by the then Minister for Education and Skills Mr. Richard Bruton TD. The Minister asked the NCCA to undertake a review, not just of the content of the curriculum but of how it is taught in schools. The NCCA advises the Department and Minister in relation to the curriculum to be taught in schools. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA conducted a thorough and transparent review, and published its report, &ldquo;Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary Schools&rdquo;\u00a0in December 2019.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA report makes a number of recommendations. This includes primarily the development of a single integrated curriculum for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) in schools. Work on updating or developing new specifications for SPHE\/RSE will commence in the NCCA in 2021, beginning with a focus on Junior Cycle. This work will include engagement with all the key education stakeholders as well as a further process of public consultation before any new curriculum specifications are finalised.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. These groups were unable to commence their work over recent months due to the COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings. However, meetings\u00a0of\u00a0these groups will convene from October and this will allow them to review significant work that has been progressed. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA is currently developing interim guidance for SPHE and RSE across primary and post-primary levels. These support materials will be made available in the form of an online toolkit. They will provide guidance on how the current curriculum can be approached in a more holistic way. The materials involved will be brought to the development groups from October. It is anticipated that some guidance materials will be published before the end of 2020 and that they will be supplemented incrementally during 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has worked collaboratively with the teacher professional development support services and other relevant groups in completing an audit of current teaching and learning resources relevant to SPHE\/RSE and compiled a comprehensive resource list which will be published as part of the online toolkit for SPHE\/RSE. This will provide a single, online access point for up-to-date resources.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Further recommendations in the report in relation to Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) regarding SPHE and RSE are being considered by the Department with a view to putting enhanced supports in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500066#WRS05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":1045,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500066#WRS05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1046,"qnumday":402,"qnumall":"[23460\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500066#WRS06000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when an allowance for a person (details supplied) will be issued; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1047,"content":"<p>According to my Department's records\u00a0Mr. Foley's first date on the Department's\u00a0payroll was as an unqualified teacher on 21 October 2010.\u00a0 His first date of qualified service following his registration with the Teaching Council as a post primary teacher\u00a0was on 5 September 2012.<\/p>  <p>  Following a review of qualification allowances as part of budget 2012 the result of which were notified to schools in Circular letter 0008\/2013 and which is available on\u00a0the Department's website \u00a0it was decided that where a teacher was in receipt of qualified rate of pay on or before 4 December 2011 they would be eligible to apply for an additional\u00a0qualification allowance in respect of qualifications that they held on that date or\u00a0in respect of a qualification that they were actively\u00a0undertaking on 5 December 2011 provided they remained registered on that course until its completion.<\/p>  <p>  As my Department records indicate that his first date of qualified pay was on the 5 September 2012 the derogation to the general rule\u00a0would not have applied to Mr. Foley.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the review no allowances can be paid in respect of a masters where the course of study commence after 5 December 2011.

In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500067#WRT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Supply Panels","counter":1061,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500067#WRT01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1062,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[23530\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500067#WRT01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to establish a supply teacher panel for the north west of Connemara, County Galway; her further plans for teacher absences for the area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1063,"content":"<p>The Roadmap for the Full Return to School provides for comprehensive supports across a range of areas to allow for the safe reopening of schools.<\/p><p>Among the supports provided is the extension of the Substitute Teacher Supply Panel.

The arrangements include the following provisions: <\/p><p>-  2019\/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030\/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.  <\/p><p>-  A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  <\/p><p>-  The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030\/2014, remains unchanged.<\/p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

The purpose of the investigation is to allow students to experience the practical application of the core geographical skills that are central to all units of the syllabus including physical, regional, human and economic geography.  Students are required to identify aims, objectives and hypotheses for their investigation, select and use methods of collection and gathering appropriate to the chosen investigation topic, analyse and interpret results, draw valid conclusions and prepare a report.<\/p>  <p>  The topic for the investigation must be chosen from an annual list of prescribed topics issued from the State Examinations Commission.  The list of prescribed topics is prepared to ensure that the range of topics relate to as many of the units of the syllabus as possible including physical, regional, human and economic geography.  This broad scope also ensures that the geographical investigation is accessible to as broad a range of learners and learning environments.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the list of topics provides scope and flexibility for a broad range of approaches to the investigation which may include the undertaking of a field study or an investigation which may involve desk based research.  The 2021 investigation topics include a study of changing land-use, impact of migration, a local environmental issue, geology in a local area, impact of economic activity and impact of erosion on the landscape.  The collection and gathering of information for each of these topics may involve gathering data through outside the school vis-&agrave;-vis an field study, survey, questionnaire etc.  Alternatively, data may be collected using primary and secondary data available from journals, databases, government departments, published reports etc.<\/p>  <p>  Some students may have the collection and gathering of data completed at this stage and in such cases they should complete their analysis and write up their report.  In cases where the collection and gathering of data has not being undertaken,  the flexibility of approach provided by the range of prescribed topics should be considered when choosing a topic for the geographical investigation in order that the investigation can be completed in line with public health requirements and guidelines.  Any activity undertaken as part of the investigation should be done in compliance with these requirements.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department has also published a series of guidance documents as part of the reopening of our schools. These are available on www.gov.ie\/backtoschool. <\/p>  <p>  This includes guidance regarding practical subjects in post-primary schools. While this guidance does not specifically name Geography, the guidance provided in provided in relation to Science is applicable. The guidelines outline areas that may be considered when schools are making decisions about implementing the curriculum, while acknowledging that teachers are best placed to consider how to safely manage equipment within current public health guidelines as they may account for their own local context. <\/p>  <p>  For example, the guidance advises that where the sharing of equipment between students cannot be avoided, each piece of shared equipment should be cleaned\/wiped between each use and that group sizes should be kept as small as resources allow. <\/p>  <p>  The additional funding for the reopening of schools has been provided specifically for the safe reopening of schools. This includes funding for substitute teachers, aides for school restructuring, minor works, PPE and additional cleaning.

Details on the application process to access this grant is available on www.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The July Stimulus package contained significant funding of some &euro;200 million in supports towards education, upskilling and work placements for people who are unemployed, to help them avail of employment opportunities as the economy gradually reopens.\u00a0\u00a0Details of these employment support service measures to assist people back to work are available on www.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Any person who is experiencing financial hardship may access assistance under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme including Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments.\u00a0 Information on the supports available under\u00a0this scheme is available at\u00a0www.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The Employer Wage Subsidy Scheme is operated by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and\u00a0 further information on this scheme is available at www.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I hope that this clarifies the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500070#WRW03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Low Pay Commission","counter":1258,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500070#WRW03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1259,"qnumday":473,"qnumall":"[23939\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500070#WRW03500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans for the design implementation and the evaluation of the universal basic income pilot committed to as part of the request to the Low Pay Commission to examine universal basic income committed to under the Programme for Government.","asker":"1492","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1260,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government states that the Low Pay Commission is to examine Universal Basic Income, informed by a review of previous international pilots, and resulting in a universal basic income pilot in the lifetime of the Government. <\/p><p>This matter will be progressed in line with the Programme for Government commitment and a referral to the Low Pay Commission will be made in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500070#WRW03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance","counter":1261,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500070#WRW03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1262,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[24081\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500070#WRW03800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason the disability allowance assessment criteria for those living with myalgic encephalomyelitis is not representative of the WHO classified neurological disorder myalgic encephalomyelitis (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1606","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1263,"content":"<p>Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy) (ME) is a complex debilitating disorder which is characterised by severe fatigue accompanied by a range of other symptoms.

This will enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department has sought and received funding, through the Estimates process, over the last three years to assist the DSS in delivering on its mandate. Further funding will be necessary through the Estimates process in 2020 and 2021. In the interim, and subject to the funding allocation, my Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan which anticipates commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including, for example, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Department of Health amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group has been meeting regularly to ensure a coordinated approach to the implementation of this project.<\/p>  <p>  As this is a function that is due to transfer, it will of course be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration, to bring this matter forward. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500076#WRCC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Licence Applications","counter":1582,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500076#WRCC03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1583,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[23782\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500076#WRCC03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the requirements for not-for-profit organisations to obtain a public dancing licence; the minimum and maximum length of time such a licence may last; and if they have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.","asker":"1514","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1584,"content":"<p>The statutory provisions concerning the licensing of premises for the purposes of public dancing are set out in the Public Dance Halls Act 1935 as well as sections 2 to 10 and 21 of the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act 1997, in so far as they relate to public dancing licenses.

Further, the allocation of Garda resources is made in light of identified operational demand. This includes deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions. As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter. <\/p><p>I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use.  I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.<\/p><p>To date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.  However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the new Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, prioritises the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland through the four year implementation plan A Policing Service for the Future.  In its report, published in September 2018, the Commission outlined a vision and roadmap for strengthening An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the broader national framework for policing, security and community safety.  The report followed extensive consultations with communities and a wide range of stakeholders over fifteen months. <\/p><p>A key commitment in A Policing Service for the Future is the rollout of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s new Operating Model.  The Garda Operating Model reorganises resources around the delivery of frontline policing, placing an increased emphasis on engaging with communities and supporting victims of crime.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in each Division, there will be a dedicated Superintendent leading a community engagement team. I am confident that this reorganisation will further strengthen community policing and engagement, and provide a more localised, responsive policing service for each Division nationwide.<\/p><p>In a broader sense, the Deputy might also wish to note that implementation of A Policing Service for the Future will see the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 repealed and replaced by a Policing and Community Safety Act.

In that context, my Department is currently in the process of finalising the most appropriate model to achieve this. All existing structures and approaches to community safety have been considered as part of this work and in line with the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing that community policing and community engagement should be at the heart of new structures and policing arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500076#WRCC05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":1597,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500076#WRCC05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1598,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[23806\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500076#WRCC05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to amend the law on assisted dying or assisted suicide or physician-assisted suicide; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1599,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the issue raised involves a range of health, medical and ethical considerations, which are matters where the Department of Health would have a substantive policy role. <\/p>  <p>  The legal position in relation to assisted suicide is that it is an offence, under Section 2(2) of the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993, to assist another person in taking his or her life. The offence was created in order to safeguard individuals who are nearing the end of their lives and who might be vulnerable or at risk of abuse.

The Community Safety Forum last met on 19th October 2019 and under pre-COVID circumstances a meeting would usually have been scheduled for early 2020, however this was unable to take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I am further informed that a Community Policing Forum was held within Community Engagement, Donnybrook, in Irishtown on 4th September 2020, within a safe environment and in adherence to COVID-19 advises. Within Community Engagement, Kevin Street, Community Policing Fora took place via online platforms on two occasions during the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the north inner city, I understand that a Community Policing Forum (CPF) operated in the north inner city between 1999 and 2019, and that the Forum was funded through the Local Drug and Alcohol Task Force, but that that funding ceased in May 2019. A core element of the CPF operating model was that the community should have a role in identifying relevant issues and that an inter-agency approach should be adopted in resolving such issues. <\/p>  <p>  The recent Covid-19 crisis has shown how proactive and collaborative community engagement by community services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can improve the condition of peoples&rsquo; lives.  For example, since the onset of the Covid-19 restrictions, Garda&iacute; attached to Store Street Garda Station have increased engagement with the more vulnerable members of society in the North East Inner City area of Dublin, through volunteer services, service providers and on an individual basis.  <\/p>  <p>  Building on the experience of the CPF, and as part of the implementation of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, my Department is devising a policy on a whole-of-Government approach to community safety which aims to help foster local communities that are safer for families, residents and businesses and that feel more secure. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the policy, plans are being advanced to develop a North Inner City Community Safety Pilot which would encompass the North Inner City Electoral Area. The pilot will establish a Community Safety Partnership, which will serve to prioritise issues identified by the community as safety concerns and develop proper strategic partnership approaches to a range of local issues, integrating service providers in order to holistically address community concerns. <\/p>  <p>  Agencies and service providers across a range of areas will work with community representatives and Garda&iacute; on community solutions to complex safety problems. Community representation will be reinforced and a partnership approach will be fostered and supported.

The objective is for community representatives to be centrally involved in a partnership approach to community safety.

Since 2016, the HSE in its National Service Plans has committed to the continued implementation of a multi annual public health plan for the therapeutic treatment of hepatitis C. The NHCTP goal is to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026. In order to achieve this, the Programme is allocated funding of &euro;25m each year.<\/p><p>The programme continues to progress the extension of hepatitis C treatment away from the traditional based healthcare within a number of HSE Addiction Treatment Centres with the latest centres opened in the Thompson Centre, Grangegorman and the Tolco Clinic, Cabra in North Dublin.  Outcomes from these programmes are extremely positive with each patient engaging fully with their treatment and for those who have completed their treatment they have each received a sustained virological response i.e. a cure.<\/p><p>In tandem the programme is progressing the pilot of extending treatment availability within the community with treatment being provided by General Practitioners and corresponding oral substitution dispensing community pharmacists. Once proof of principle has been determined this project will be stepped up nationally.<\/p><p>In 2014 studies indicated that Ireland had a prevalence of 20,000-30,000.  It should be noted that this is an estimate of the prevalence and the true prevalence rate in Ireland is unknown. There is no general screening of the population to determine prevalence rates. To date a national sero-prevalence study has not been undertaken. However, the NHCTP has observed a marked decline in numbers of newly diagnosed infections in recent years and a significant increase in the numbers of patients successfully completing treatment.<\/p><p>It is estimated that at least 50-60% of the potential number of people in Ireland with Hepatitis C are not aware of their diagnosis and so therefore in order for the programme to achieve its aim of making hepatitis C a rare disease by 2026, focus needs to turn to identifying the population and case finding. Globally the availability of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAA) has shifted the focus towards elimination of HCV. The WHO has stated that national testing policies in addition to increased screening are essential so that the goal of elimination can be reached. In this regard, the National Hepatitis C Treatment Programme is commencing a communications campaign &lsquo;<b><i>Find the missing Millions&rsquo;<\/i><\/b>to promote the work of the NHCTP and to find the people who do not realise they are infected with Hepatitis C and offer them the treatment. The NHCTP is committed to treating as many people that are infected with Hepatitis C that are found, and as soon as they are identified.<\/p><p>The NCHTP is committed to evolving the changing needs in hepatitis C care for patients. A programme of work to refresh the National Hepatitis C Treatment Programme Strategy and Planning Document 2020-2026 is nearing completion. This will set a clear direction for the further expansion of the programme. <\/p><p>The NHCTP is also supported by a Programme Advisory Group who provide advice, support and strategic direction to the HSE of the successful development and implementation of the programme and a Clinical Advisory Group whose role is to provide clinical advice. <\/p><p>Since 2015 The NHCTP has provided treatment to over 5,500 people in Ireland using DAA Medication with cure rates in excess of 95%. The goal of making Hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland is a reality since the availability of transformative therapeutic drug regimens to successfully treat and cure people with Hepatitis C. <\/p><p>To ensure we reach our goal of Hepatitis C becoming a rare disease in Ireland by 2026 the programme will:<\/p><p>- Continue treatment using DAA&rsquo;s which have a significantly higher rate of patients achieving Sustained Virological Response or cure. <\/p><p>- Increase numbers of patients being treated to achieve &amp;gt; 60% reduction in liver related deaths &amp;amp; 90% reductions in total and new infections &ndash; actively &lsquo;<i>Seek and Treat&rsquo; <\/i>harder to reach client groups in collaboration with Addiction services<\/p><p>- Expand screening programmes to identify all infected patients<\/p><p>- Expand treatment criteria to treat all infected patients &ndash; i.e. treatment as prevention and treatment to elimination. <\/p><p>- Promote the awareness of Hepatitis C and the need to get tested and treated<\/p><p>- Progression of the Community G.P\/Pharmacy Dispensing Pilot<\/p><p>- Conduct an epidemiology study to determine the prevalence of Hepatitis C in Ireland to inform the efforts of the programme<\/p><p>With the outbreak of COVID-19 Hepatitis C clinics were significantly impacted. However, clinics are returning to normal and the NHCTP is confident that the programme is on target to eliminate Hepatitis C in Ireland by 2026.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500080#WRGG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":1814,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500080#WRGG03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1815,"qnumday":674,"qnumall":"[23408\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500080#WRGG03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he expects the vacant roles within the diabetes services in the mid-west University Hospital Limerick, UHL, group to be filled to elevate the backlog in appointments and care for diabetes suffers in the region;

The Government&rsquo;s commitment to continued enhancement of mental health services is shown in ongoing increases in the mental health budget. Since 2012, &euro;315 million has been added, bringing the mental health budget today to &euro;1.026 billion, an increase of 44%.<\/p>  <p>  Much has been achieved in mental health in recent years, but it is recognised that much remains to be done. Ireland is fortunate to have fundamentally robust legislation, policies and services that have been built up over time and which, overall, compare favourably internationally. More importantly, there are identified and widely agreed pathways to undertake further improvements in all these areas, including improved residential and community-based care for children and adults and psychiatry of later life. <\/p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision promotes equitable access to quality, safe mental health care for all citizens. Service users and their families, carers and supporters will have timely access to evidence-informed mental health services. Tailored measures will be put in place to ensure that individuals with complex mental health difficulties can avail of services across the State without discrimination. This builds on the intent of A Vision for Change and Sl&aacute;intecare and is expected to be implemented as part of a ten-year plan.<\/p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision recognises and plans for the increasing need for mental health services and demand for more holistic person-centred responses. The ten-year plan addresses population needs through a focus on the requirements of individuals. It promises early intervention, with a focus on prevention and positive mental health promotion. This focus advocates a mental health system that works in partnership with service users and their families to deliver a range of integrated services and supports.<\/p>  <p>  Establishment of the National Monitoring and Implementation Committee (NIMC), to oversee Sharing the Vision, is well advanced. The NIMC will drive reconfiguration, monitor progress against outcomes and deliver on commitments in the new policy.<\/p>  <p>  This year has been exceptional. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant stress, anxiety, worry and fear for many people throughout the world, from the disease itself and from impacts such as increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has continued to provide all community services, as far as possible, while following Covid-19 guidelines to ensure protection for patients and staff. Acute inpatient and community residential facilities have remained open and patients have been provided with services throughout the pandemic, although with reduced numbers in some settings.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has rapidly accelerated online delivery of mental health services. The Department of Health, with the HSE, has launched a number of initiatives to promote mental health and well-being, including the national Crisis Text-Line in June. An additional &euro;2.2m has been provided for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign, through enhanced online supports, and to support the HSE psycho-social strategy. This will enable implementation of integrated tele-health solutions and improve existing online interventions. Examples are the free counselling sessions offered by HSE partners MyMind and online peer support groups for front line workers from Turn2me.<\/p>  <p>  A key priority for Minister Butler and the Department is to update the 2001 Mental Health Act. The Act sets out the care and treatment of people (including children) with mental illness, including involuntary detention procedures and patient safeguards. The updating process is in line with expert advice, international best practice and human rights. The Department is finalising draft heads of a bill to amend the Act and hopes to finalise a draft bill by the end of 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Another priority is the new forensic mental health facility at Portrane. This significant and modern facility is expected to open early next year. The new 170-bed hospital complex will replace the Central Mental Hospital Dundrum (103 beds) as a modernised National Forensic Mental Health Service. It will include a 120-bed central mental hospital, a 10-bed forensic child and adolescent unit and a 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit.<\/p>  <p>  Funding will be sought in this year&rsquo;s Estimates campaign to implement the short-term objectives of Sharing the Vision. This will, of course, be influenced by the availability of resources. However, the current budget of over &euro;1 billion enables the HSE to maintain and develop its wide range of mental health and suicide prevention services. These span all specialties and ages, from mental health promotion and early intervention to acute inpatient care and clinical programmes such as self-harm and eating disorders. Improving access and reducing waiting lists, where possible, are key Government objectives, despite acknowledged recruitment difficulties and the greatly changed Covid-19 operational environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500083#WRKK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Tests","counter":1980,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500083#WRKK01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1981,"qnumday":731,"qnumall":"[23719\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500083#WRKK02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the criteria that is used to determine if a minor and-or child requires a test for Covid-19; if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1982,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the deputy for bringing this to my attention, which my officials have passed on to the HSE.<\/p><p>In terms of assessment and testing pathways for children and minors, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has in recent days issued clear instructions to all GP providers and published these on its website.

The HSE has worked intensively since the start of the pandemic to put this in place and I would again like to acknowledge the huge work undertaken in this regard across the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Capacity has been in place since early summer to test 15,000 people a day\/100,000 people per week. The testing and contact tracing operational and resource model has been designed to flex up and down as needed.\u00a0 In recent weeks we have needed to flex it up significantly as demand has increased. We are testing more people than ever before, with almost 70,000 tests completed in the week ending 7th September. The HSE has deployed additional resources to meet this level of demand, including the opening of additional community testing centres and mobile pop-up testing units, significantly increased contact tracing teams and increased laboratory testing.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We had seen improvements in turnaround times over the week ending 7th September. 85% of GP referrals received an appointment the same day or the next day - the median being 0.9 days. The median time from swab to lab result was 29 hours.\u00a0In total, the median end-to-end turnaround time for negative tests in the community setting ranged from 2.0-2.1 days while median end-to-end turnaround time from referral to communication of a positive result was 2.3-2.8 days. I do acknowledge that\u00a0the system has come under strain in recent weeks, with a very significant increase in demand experience last week which resulted in some delays. There was a record of 13,000 referrals to community testing on Monday alone, and demand remained high for the week. As outlined above, additional capacity has been brought on stream quickly to meet this demand.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is critical that parents continue to contact their GP if their child has any of the symptoms of COVID-19. The impact that the requirement to restrict movements has while waiting for a test and a test result is understood. But it is essential to prevent any further transmission of the virus, protecting other children and teachers in school and the community more generally.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the HSE is now finalising a future service model for testing and tracing. This service model will aim to deliver a patient-centred, accessible, consistent and flexible service.\u00a0 This plan includes the recruitment of a permanent workforce which has already commenced, and a range of other service improvements which will be rolled out over the coming weeks to ensure that people can access a test quickly and get their result quickly.

The Government&rsquo;s commitment to continued enhancement of mental health services is shown in ongoing increases in the mental health budget. Since 2012, &euro;315 million has been added, bringing the mental health budget today to &euro;1.026 billion, an increase of 44%.<\/p>  <p>  Much has been achieved in mental health in recent years, but it is recognised that much remains to be done. Ireland is fortunate to have fundamentally robust legislation, policies and services that have been built up over time and which, overall, compare favourably internationally. More importantly, there are identified and widely agreed pathways to undertake further improvements in all these areas, including improved residential and community-based care for children and adults and psychiatry of later life.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision promotes equitable access to quality, safe mental health care for all citizens. Service users and their families, carers and supporters will have timely access to evidence-informed mental health services. Tailored measures will be put in place to ensure that individuals with complex mental health difficulties can avail of services across the State without discrimination. This builds on the intent of A Vision for Change and Sl&aacute;intecare and is expected to be implemented as part of a ten-year plan.<\/p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision recognises and plans for the increasing need for mental health services and demand for more holistic person-centred responses. The ten-year plan addresses population needs through a focus on the requirements of individuals. It promises early intervention, with a focus on prevention and positive mental health promotion. This focus advocates a mental health system that works in partnership with service users and their families to deliver a range of integrated services and supports.<\/p>  <p>  Establishment of the National Monitoring and Implementation Committee (NIMC), to oversee Sharing the Vision, is well advanced. The NIMC will drive reconfiguration, monitor progress against outcomes and deliver on commitments in the new policy.<\/p>  <p>  This year has been exceptional. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant stress, anxiety, worry and fear for many people throughout the world, from the disease itself and from impacts such as increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has continued to provide all community services, as far as possible, while following Covid-19 guidelines to ensure protection for patients and staff. Acute inpatient and community residential facilities have remained open and patients have been provided with services throughout the pandemic, although with reduced numbers in some settings.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has rapidly accelerated online delivery of mental health services. The Department of Health, with the HSE, has launched a number of initiatives to promote mental health and well-being, including the national Crisis Text-Line in June. An additional &euro;2.2m has been provided for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign, through enhanced online supports, and to support the HSE psycho-social strategy. This will enable implementation of integrated tele-health solutions and improve existing online interventions. Examples are the free counselling sessions offered by HSE partners MyMind and online peer support groups for front line workers from Turn2me. <\/p>  <p>  A key priority for Minister Butler and the Department is to update the 2001 Mental Health Act. The Act sets out the care and treatment of people (including children) with mental illness, including involuntary detention procedures and patient safeguards. The updating process is in line with expert advice, international best practice and human rights. The Department is finalising draft heads of a bill to amend the Act and hopes to finalise a draft bill by the end of 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Another priority is the new forensic mental health facility at Portrane. This significant and modern facility is expected to open early next year. The new 170-bed hospital complex will replace the Central Mental Hospital Dundrum (103 beds) as a modernised National Forensic Mental Health Service. It will include a 120-bed central mental hospital, a 10-bed forensic child and adolescent unit and a 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit.<\/p>  <p>  Funding will be sought in this year&rsquo;s Estimates campaign to implement the short-term objectives of Sharing the Vision. This will, of course, be influenced by the availability of resources. However, the current budget of over &euro;1 billion enables the HSE to maintain and develop its wide range of mental health and suicide prevention services. These span all specialties and ages, from mental health promotion and early intervention to acute inpatient care and clinical programmes such as self-harm and eating disorders. Improving access and reducing waiting lists, where possible, are key Government objectives, despite acknowledged recruitment difficulties and the greatly changed Covid-19 operational environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500084#WRLL02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2041,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500084#WRLL02500"},{"type":"question","counter":2042,"qnumday":753,"qnumall":"[23826\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500084#WRLL02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if NPHET will consider changing the 50% capacity on post-primary school buses in view of increasing evidence that students are being left on the side of the road; if he will consider a review of the capacity on private coaches for third-level students; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1548","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2043,"content":"<p>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) made recommendations to the Government in terms of the importance of ensuring social distancing on school transport. \u00a0However, the Minister for Health has no function in relation to the\u00a0capacity of school transport or private coaches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500084#WRLL02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2045,"qnumday":754,"qnumall":"[23830\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500084#WRLL02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to increase the number of persons permitted to attend weddings and civil ceremonies if the venues allow for full adherence to the Covid-19 guidelines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2046,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the situation regarding COVID- has been, and continues to be, an evolving one.

This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases. The scope of the plan is broad given that there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare. <\/p>  <p>  Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented and in December 2013 the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established as a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. A Clinical Advisory Group was established to oversee the programme, a Clinical Lead and Programme Manager were appointed, and a multidisciplinary National Working Group was established to provide support to the programme workstreams and the National Plan was firmly embedded in the Programme.   <\/p>  <p>  The opening of the National Rare Disease Office, (NRDO) in 2015 was a significant milestone for people living with a rare disease, their families and their healthcare professionals.  Prof Eileen Treacy is the Director of the National Rare Diseases Office, whose purpose it is to provide current and reliable information about genetic and rare diseases to patients, families and healthcare professionals.    <\/p>  <p>  On foot of the HSE Chief Clinical Officer&rsquo;s (CCO), review of all the national clinical programmes in April 2019, it was recommended that the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases be operationalised and incorporated into the National Rare Disease Office. From 01 September 2020, the NRDO will be the main contact point and driver for national HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. The work of the NRDO will be overseen and governed by HSE Acute Operations. This means that the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases will be wound down and any outstanding projects will be transferred to the NRDO. <\/p>  <p>  Building on the significant progress to date, themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period have been agreed with the Rare Disease Task Force, which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland, the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI). <\/p>  <p>  Meetings, to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the continuing work ongoing in relation to Rare Diseases will continue to take place at regular intervals with the Rare Disease Task Force, the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office. <\/p>  <p>  A number of key themes have now been identified for progression in the coming period, including: Patient Awareness; European Reference Networks; Research &amp;amp; Registries; Access to Services; Access to Medicines; Diagnosis; Education &amp;amp; Training and Legislation &amp;amp; Policy.

ME is sometimes known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).<\/p>  <p>  There is currently no known, specific, medical diagnostic test to determine or confirm a correct diagnosis of ME and no specific treatment which works for all sufferers is currently available. As a result clinical assessment and the design of care plans need to be tailored to the individual patient. There are assessments and tests which can be carried out in primary care settings by a General Practitioner. Specialised tests may be required when considering and ruling out other diagnoses. Relevant specialists are usually accessed through out patient clinics at secondary care level. The General Practitioner is regarded as best placed to refer patients, if appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Treatment for ME is tailored to address the varying symptoms presented by those affected by ME. In general, these treatments are delivered within the context of primary care, with referrals into secondary care for specialist interventions in the areas of Neurology, Rheumatology, Pain Specialists, Endocrinology, Immunology, Cardiology, etc. Different patients, depending on their primary symptoms, will require different Consultant input. The challenge in relation to ME is that it does not sit within one specialty, but crosses a number of specialties, with patients frequently attending different Consultants for management of their symptoms as and when they arise. Consultants are well used to coordinating the care of patients that require the input of their colleagues and other members of the multidisciplinary care team.<\/p>  <p>  Work is under way as part of the implementation of the Strategy for the Design of Integrated Outpatient Services 2016-2020, specifically as regards addressing how and where the patient is treated and the classification of referrals with corresponding clinically recommended time-frames. Consideration is also being given to condition specific referral forms. This work should see significant improvements with respect to access to appropriate services.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE provides a range of assisted living services including Personal Assistant and Home Support Services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives. <\/p>  <p>   PA and Home Support Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers. The majority of specialised disability provision (80%) is delivered through non-statutory sector service providers. <\/p>  <p>   Services are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff.  Individual&rsquo;s needs are evaluated against the criteria for prioritisation for the particular services and then decisions are made in relation to the allocation of resources.  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria, and the level of resources available.  As with every service there is not a limitless resource available for the provision of home support services and while the resources available are substantial they are finite.  In this context, services are discretionary and the number of hours granted is determined by other support services already provided to the person\/family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500086#WRNN02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":2144,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500086#WRNN02300"},{"type":"question","counter":2145,"qnumday":792,"qnumall":"[24001\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500086#WRNN02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason respite services have not resumed in a facility (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2146,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500086#WRNN02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Services","counter":2147,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500086#WRNN02600"},{"type":"question","counter":2148,"qnumday":793,"qnumall":"[24002\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500086#WRNN02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the financial supports available to islanders travelling to hospitals and overnight stays to access cancer treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2149,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) that there are two services administered by the Irish Cancer Society which offer financial supports towards travelling for cancer treatment.<\/p><p>The first of these services is the Travel2Care Scheme - a limited transportation assistance fund, funded by the NCCP.

In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI; previously the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group) was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. Scoliosis activity accounts for 20% of overall orthopaedic activity across CHI. <\/p>  <p>  This funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTE in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services including scoliosis services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively. The majority of posts were allocated to each hospital in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 investment in paediatric orthopaedics included funding to support transition of adolescents with scoliosis from CHI at Crumlin to the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH). CHI and MMUH have developed and agreed the clinical pathways for the transition of adolescents with scoliosis to MMUH. The transition of patients over the age of 16 who were awaiting a first-time outpatient\/spinal review appointment at Crumlin commenced in December 2018. Each month, appropriate patients are identified for this pathway via clinical validation. <\/p>  <p>  CHI have advised my Department that the introduction of government restrictions for COVID-19 based on public health advice required CHI at Crumlin and Temple Street to defer all non-emergency spinal operations.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organization, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-Covid care including more routine care and services have resumed in line with NPHET recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is seeking to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as telemedicine and the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that in order to continue to provide access for patients there has been considerable growth and investment in virtual outpatient consultations for many specialties across the system. While figures for August are not yet available, the HSE advise that a total of 73,198 virtual outpatient consultations took place in July. This represents 27% of the overall OPD activity for July (266,349).<\/p>  <p>  The number of patients awaiting an Inpatient or Day Case (IPDC) procedure decreased by 2,663 (-3%) at the end of August when compared to the end of July waiting list. While year to date the IPDC waiting list has grown by 17% (up 11,057 since end December 2019), the number of patients actively waiting has continued to fall since May. Part of the reason for the decrease in the numbers waiting is an increase in the number of patients being moved on to the TCI list (To Come In). The consistent increase in the number of patients on the TCI list since April is indicative of increased elective activity, and results in the removal of patients from the active IPDC waiting list. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is also currently working to secure access to private hospital facilities for urgent and time critical procedures.

In anticipation of the projected surge in Covid-19 cases and the expected impact on the health care system a major part of the response was to urgently ramp up capacity for acute hospital care facilities.\u00a0 A critical element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. Under the agreement, the HSE secured 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Following termination of the agreement the Government mandated the HSE to seek an agreement with the private hospitals on a new arrangement which would provide the HSE with access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases, and separately with ongoing agreed access, in collaboration with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), to private hospital services to address the HSE&rsquo;s priority needs in providing both essential care and addressing elective care for public patients experiencing delays.\u00a0The HSE is undertaking bilateral discussions with individual private hospitals to seek to agree new arrangements which would provide the HSE with access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work to ensure that capacity exists within the health service to meet the needs of patients during this unique and challenging time. Future planning remains a critical priority for me and my Department. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Winter and Service Planning process, the HSE is undertaking a strategic approach to service resumption. This includes the development of a longer-term plan to include augmented levels of service to regain a level of provision across community and acute hospitals where capacity was adversely impacted by COVID 19. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The immediate priority for the HSE is the finalisation of a Winter Plan which incorporates the enhancement of services to cope with Winter pressures into early 2021 to ensure the capacity and capability of the health system is prepared for this challenging period. The various initiatives proposed in the plan are designed to reduce attendances and admissions, and improve capacity and throughput in hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of Service Planning, a range of initiatives have been developed by the HSE, which will support service resumption and increased capacity across the Community and Acute hospital systems, which will be rolled out in the coming weeks and months. This includes establishing key community services envisioned in Sl&aacute;intecare and the 2018 Capacity Review, while building toward the appropriate level of capacity in our acute hospital services. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is also currently working to secure access to private hospital facilities for urgent and time critical procedures. A procurement process is currently in train to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostic capacity from private providers which is required to address capacity needs over the next two year.

In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and made considerable\u00a0improvements to\u00a0access for patients waiting for high volume procedures including cataracts. At the end of July 2017, the number of people waiting for a cataract procedure was 10,024. At the end of August 2020, there were 5,110 patients waiting for a cataract procedure. Of these, 1,219 are waiting over 9 months which represents a reduction of 72% when compared to July 2017, when there were 4,371 waiting over 9 months.<\/p>  <p>  A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to pause most elective scheduled care activity with effect from the end March 2020. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, and the National Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the\u00a0pausing of all non-urgent health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.\u00a0 Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on its website on 22 July.<\/p>  <p>  As the system continues to deliver COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-COVID 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.<\/p>  <p>  The NTPF has recommenced arranging treatment for patients in both private and public hospitals, for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists. A number of high-volume procedures, including cataract surgery, are being commissioned as part of the NTPF procurement process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500090#WRRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":2340,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500090#WRRR00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Sales","counter":2339,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500090#WRRR00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2340,"qnumday":867,"qnumall":"[23379\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500090#WRRR00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of applications made to the register of sellers and suppliers and the register of premises by county.","asker":"1468","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2341,"content":"<p>To date, 190 applications have been received for addition to the Registers of Sellers and Suppliers of Pet Animals and Premises connected with the sale and supply of pets.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A breakdown of the applications received by county is provided below.\u00a0 It should be noted that the registration requirement does not apply to persons or organisations to whom the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 applies, or a local authority or a facility run by or on behalf of a local authority. <table>    <tr>       <th>COUNTY<\/th>       <th>TOTAL<\/th>       <th>COUNTY <\/th>       <th>TOTAL<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>CARLOW<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>LONGFORD<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>CAVAN<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>LOUTH<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>CLARE<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>MAYO<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>CORK<\/td>       <td>29<\/td>       <td>MEATH<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DONEGAL<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>MONAGHAN<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DUBLIN<\/td>       <td>26<\/td>       <td>OFFALY<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>GALWAY<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>       <td>ROSCOMMON<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>KERRY<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>SLIGO<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>KILDARE<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>TIPPERARY<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>KILKENNY<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>WATERFORD<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>LAOIS<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>WESTMEATH<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>LEITRIM<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>WEXFORD<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>LIMERICK<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>WICKLOW<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500090#WRRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry","counter":2342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500090#WRRR01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2343,"qnumday":868,"qnumall":"[24344\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500090#WRRR01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the measures he will take to ensure that there is not a conflict between the requirements contained in recent letters being sent to farmers regarding TB and their requirements pursuant to the beef genomics scheme;

My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).\u00a0 These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.\u00a0 These findings meant that\u00a0in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes\u00a0to the licensing system were unavoidable. \u00a0All licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately\u00a0meant that\u00a0there have been delays in issuing licences. \u00a0It has taken substantial resources and effort\u00a0to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place.\u00a0A majority of\u00a0my Department's\u00a0licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee which gives confidence in these revised procedures. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources\u00a0required to deliver the plan.

To date, &euro;49.8 million has been paid to farmers from this fund.<\/p><p>European Agriculture Rural Development Fund (EAFRD)<\/p><p>&euro;2.19 billion was allocated to Ireland from the EAFRD for the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme.\u00a0 The funding is for the full period of the programme and under the &quot;N+3&quot; rule expenditure up to 2023 is eligible to be claimed\u00a0 against the 2014-2020 allocation. As of 31<sup>st<\/sup>December 2019, Ireland incurred expenditure that attracted EAFRD funding of &euro;1.65 billion. Our execution rate is one of the highest in Europe &ndash; the most recent being in excess of 80% as opposed to an EU average of 60%. In 2019, EAFRD funds claimed in Ireland amounted to &euro;338.6million vs an indicative allocation of &euro;312.7 million. While the Rural Development Programme Financial Plan sets out an indicative allocation of approximately &euro;313million for each of the 7 years 2014-2020, where expenditure in a year is less than the indicative allocation the amount available for subsequent years of the programme is increased accordingly. Thus, the extent of unspent EU funds\u00a0can only be\u00a0measured\u00a0at the end of the programming period, rather than on an annual basis.<\/p><p>Publication of CAP Beneficiaries<\/p><p>In accordance with Regulation (EU) 1306 of 2013, the Department is obliged to ensure the annual ex-post publication of all of the beneficiaries of CAP funding, which shall remain available for two years from the date of the initial publication.

The economic challenges are wide ranging and have impacted across all sectors.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government response will continue to be reviewed and will evolve in order to best meet current and future challenges as they arise.  <\/p>  <p>  While the fishing industry, unlike many other industries, has been permitted to operate throughout the pandemic, I am very conscious of the impact of the pandemic on global seafood markets and the consequential reduction in level of activity. Whilst fish prices have been negatively impacted throughout the Covid period these impacts have been varied depending on the species and market being targeted. For many species, markets have remained open and fishermen have been able to sell their products. In addition, the Covid crisis has occurred during a period when the fuel prices for fishermen have been greatly reduced and that has assisted the viability of fishing activity throughout the period.  <\/p>  <p>  To date, a  broad range of supports have been made  available to the fisheries sector through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme and more generally from Government. Fishing vessel owners whose trading income ceased due to the Covid-19 pandemic, or crew members who lost their job or were temporarily laid off, were eligible to avail of income supports under the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, while vessel owners with salaried crew members who instead maintain those crew members on the payroll were eligible for the Covid-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme.  Further details on current horizontal measures that are available to the fishing sector are available from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and from the Revenue Commissioners respectively. <\/p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, for the months of June, July and August, safety net supports were available through the EMFF Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme to fishermen who choose to tie-up their vessel for up to two months.  The Scheme supported the fixed costs of these vessels based on the official data on such costs obtained from the fleet through the Sentinel Vessel Programme and economic survey data provided by inshore fishermen through the grant aid process.  Supports of &euro;800 per month were available for vessels 10-12 metres, &euro;750 for vessels 8-10 metres and &euro;500 for vessels under 8 metres.  These supports complemented the income supports separately provided by Government. <\/p>  <p>  Supports of up to 80% of investment costs are available through the EMFF schemes administered by BIM for a wide variety of business activities and details of these schemes can be found on the BIM website.  <\/p>  <p>  Fishermen operate from a very wide variety of Harbours around the State and the majority of these are owned and managed by the relevant local authority.

Much of this research has been performed in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Britain with similar results emerging.  The Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Research Analysis (CVERA) in UCD has been responsible for much of the research in Ireland but similar studies on risk emanate from Northern Ireland and Britain also.  The results of these epidemiological analyses inform the Department's advice and initiatives on helping farmers to reduce risk to TB on their farms.  Examples of the issues which can put an animal or a herd at a higher risk of TB include:<\/p>  <p>  1. Animals that had previously tested inconclusive to a TB skin test, but had passed all tests thereafter are higher risk.  This is because the skin test will identify only 80% of infected animals, on average, because of the failure in some cases of the animals immune system to mount a strong enough reaction.  Because of this, previously inconclusive animals are restricted to the herd of disclosure for life and are removed if that herd experiences a TB breakdown. <\/p>  <p>  2. Animals which had been present during a TB breakdown previously are at a higher risk for TB.  The reason for this is similar to inconclusives higher risk.  The animals were exposed to TB during the original breakdown and, in some cases, these may have become infected but for immunological reasons some may not react to testing and therefore remain as false negatives, i.e. clear animals.  This phenomenon is called residual TB and is a significant reason why it can take up to 10 years for a herd to return to normal levels of risk after experiencing a TB breakdown.  It is advisable for animals that were previously present during a breakdown to be considered for culling when decisions are being made on farms on which animals to retain, if the herdowner wishes to reduce the risk of a TB breakdown.<\/p>  <p>  3. Animals which have had multiple movements are at higher risk for TB than animals which have not.  This is associated with the increased potential for exposure to sources of infection because of movement between different herds and lands.<\/p>  <p>  4. Significant variation in inherited susceptibility to TB has been identified and farmers can now choose to breed from bulls whose offspring are more resistant to TB.<\/p>  <p>  5. Many studies have reported increased prevalence of TB with age meaning older cows are higher risk for TB.  This is associated with increased chance to exposure to infection sources.  This factor should be considered when making culling decisions to increase herd resilience. <\/p>  <p>  The definition of a closed herd is one where none of the animals within the herd have been purchased from, or returned from, outside the herd.  Animal Health Ireland and Teagasc have published advice over many years on the benefits for animal disease in maintaining a closed herd.  This crucial biosecurity measure is beneficial across all cattle diseases &ndash; not just TB.  <\/p>  <p>  My officials provide this advice to farmers so that they can make choices appropriate to their own farming circumstances to reduce their risk of TB, should they so wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500091#WRSS03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":2422,"qnumday":896,"qnumall":"[23910\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500091#WRSS03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to review the practice of writing to farmers requesting the destruction of animals identifying as high risk of contracting tuberculosis.","asker":"1493","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2423,"content":"<p>The Bovine TB Forum is due to reconvene shortly and my Department will continue to engage in this round table effort to eradicate Bovine TB.

In the past 12 months, 20,993 cattle have been slaughtered as reactors under the TB eradication programme, as they are deemed to be infected with the TB disease agent. The test specificity is estimated at 99.98%, meaning the number of false positives to the skin test is estimated at 1 animal in 5,000 tested.  However, the skin test has an estimated sensitivity of 80% which means that approximately 1 in 5 animals infected with TB will not be identified by the test, on average.  This means that false negatives are much more problematic for the TB programme than false positives.  <\/p>  <p>  Visual inspection of reactor carcases at post-mortem finds that, on average, approximately 30% of such reactors have visible lesions of tuberculosis, meaning the infection has progressed to a stage where the disease process has caused such significant tissue damage that it can be seen with the naked eye.

This has continued in 2020 with further increases in herd incidence and reactor numbers observed. Herd incidence (on a 12-month rolling basis) has breached 4% for the first time since 2012 and reactor numbers have exceeded 20,000 &ndash; the highest number since 2009.

The Programme delivers a wide range of supports for aquaculture, fisheries and seafood processing through a suite of 19 schemes.  The Programme is co-funded by the Government of Ireland and the European Union. Through the EMFF Programme, I am continuing to support the fishing sector through a broad range of supports.  <\/p><p>The Annual EMFF allocation provided to Ireland is detailed in the Finance Plan incorporated in the EMFF Programme document and for convenience is reproduced below (Table 1).  These funds are paid to Ireland only following expenditure by Ireland and submission by Ireland to the Commission of recoupment claims.  Under the so-called n+3 rule, annual allocations to a Member State would be decommitted if the Member State does not submit sufficient claims to the Commission.  Expenditure on Ireland's Programme to date has been very strong, so unlike many Member States Ireland has lost no funds in this way.  <\/p><p>Separately, the EMFF Regulation provides for annual pre-payment by the Commission of certain amounts to Member States to assist them with cash flow in funding projects prior to recoupment from the Commission.  These pre-payments are part of the overall allocation to the Member State.  As part of the annual clearance of accounts process, if recoupment claims submitted by a Member State for the accounting year concerned are not sufficient to cover both these pre-payments and the annual allocation, then the Commission recovers the amount of pre-financing not covered, through offsets against claims due.  Such recoveries are financial balancing exercises and are not a loss to the Member State, and do not affect the overall allocation to the Member State.  To date, approximately &euro;6.5 million in pre-payments have been recovered by the Commission.  <\/p><p>Supports to the fishing sector are primarily provided through measures implemented under Union Priority 1 &ndash; Sustainable Development of Fisheries, which has a total allocation under the Programme of &euro;55.59 million.

This objective is also reflected in UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 published on 20th May 2020 provides a commitment that protected areas for at least 30% of seas in Europe will be established and that 10% of the area is strictly protected. <\/p>  <p>  Under the OSPAR Convention to Protect the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic, Ireland committed to establishing marine protected areas to protect biodiversity (i.e. OSPAR MPAs). Such OSPAR MPAs would not afford any legal protection to the relevant areas on their own. Ireland (like other OSPAR contracting Parties) established 19 of its Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) as OSPAR MPAs for marine habitats. It is important to note that MPAs cannot be equated with Marine Reserves, i.e. as &lsquo;no-take&rsquo; zones where the extraction of marine organisms, or habitat impact , is prohibited.  The 10% strict protection in the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 may involve a form of no take zones. In Ireland, the 1992 EC Habitats Directive (92\/43\/EC), as transposed by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 477 of 2011), as amended, is the legislative instrument providing protection to species and habitats listed in the EU Habitats Directive, including in the marine environment.  For habitats in the marine area, this protection regime is applicable within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).  Under this legislation, a series of habitats and species are identified for which Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) must be created and within which these habitats must be maintained at favourable conservation status.  Natura 2000 sites are selected with the aim of ensuring the long-term survival of species and habitats protected under the Birds and the Habitats Directive. The choice of sites is based on scientific criteria.<\/p>  <p>  At present there is a network of 80 Natura sites around the coast and 5 offshore sites.  These cover a significant area of near shore waters around the coast. In addition, the Minister introduced a ban on large fishing trawlers fishing inside Ireland&rsquo;s 6 mile zone from January 2020, which is subject to Judicial Review. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to &lsquo;developing comprehensive legislation for the identification, designation, and management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Irish territorial waters.&rsquo; This Programme further assures that Ireland&rsquo;s outstanding target of 10% will be &lsquo;achieved as soon as is practical&rsquo; and aims for &lsquo;30% of marine protected areas by 2030&rsquo;, which it states will be done &lsquo;on the basis of scientific expertise and in close consultation with all stakeholders, in particular the fishing industry, as well as environmental and community representatives.&rsquo; <\/p>  <p>  A formal consultation process on the future expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s network of MPAs was launched by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) on 18th August 2020. An independent expert Advisory Group on the expansion of MPAs was appointed by that Department  in December 2019 and is chaired by Professor Tasman Crowe of the UCD Earth Institute. Representatives from the Marine Institute (the State agency responsible for marine research) sit on this Advisory group. This Advisory group was created to gather the views of stakeholders and consultation with stakeholders forms part of the terms of reference of the group. The advisory group is using two consultative approaches: focus groups and an online questionnaire. <\/p>  <p>  The process of interactive consultation with all stakeholders and the public began with a series of online stakeholder focus groups hosted by the Advisory group. DHLGH has advised that there have been four moderated online meetings so far, and that all of the main fisheries organisations: the four main producer organisations (the Irish Fish Producers Organisation; the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation; the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation; and the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation) and the main inshore fisheries organisations (the National Inshore Fisherman&rsquo;s Forum; the National Inshore Fisherman&rsquo;s Association and the various Regional Inshore Fisheries Fora) have been invited to attend these meetings.<\/p>  <p>  In August 2020, the Advisory group circulated an online questionnaire to a wide range of stakeholders, providing respondents with an opportunity to share their views on MPAs; the future expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s MPA network; and the preferred approach to selecting, designating and managing MPAs in the short and longer term. The information gathered by the Advisory group, through both consultative approaches, will inform its expert considerations and its final report. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage plans to publish the final report of the expert Advisory group as part of an extensive public consultation commencing in late autumn 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500092#WRTT03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":2480,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500092#WRTT03300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Payments","counter":2479,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500092#WRTT03200"},{"type":"question","counter":2480,"qnumday":915,"qnumall":"[23358\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091500092#WRTT03300","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"when a grant application (details supplied) will be adjudicated on and paid out.","asker":"1602","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2481,"content":"<p>The Government is aware of the challenges facing community and voluntary organisations and is committed to working closely with the sector in managing through these, recognising that it will require a whole of Government approach.<\/p><p>The Community and Voluntary Sector Covid-19 Stability Fund was intended to be a targeted once-off cash injection for organisations and groups delivering critical front-line services to the most at need in our society and in danger of imminent closure due to lost fund-raised or traded income as a direct result of restrictions to counter the spread of COVID-19. <\/p><p>This fund is providing up to &euro;35million of funding through the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF) and the scheme criteria aligned with DAF objectives to support: <\/p><p>1.

My Department is providing additional vital supports to rural and community organisations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is supporting the following initiatives:<\/p><p>On 16 March 2020, my Department launched the COVID-19 Government Action Plan in partnership with other Departments, State agencies and our extensive network of community and voluntary organisations. These initiatives provide support for volunteering, funding to ALONE for their crisis telephone support line, and an email helpdesk facility to assist smaller community groups with their queries. <\/p><p>On 9 April last, an initial &euro;2.5 million COVID-19 Emergency Fund was introduced to provide immediate and urgently needed funding to community and voluntary groups that are participating in the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Call&rdquo; initiative which is being led by the Local Authorities. <\/p><p>On 11 May 2020, a &euro;40 million support package for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Charities and Social Enterprises was launched by Government and is administered by the Department. This funding is being made available through the Dormant Accounts Fund, which is specifically set aside to support initiatives which will benefit the most disadvantaged groups in society. <\/p><p><b>The package included:<\/b><\/p><p>A &euro;35 million COVID-19 Stability Fund which will provide a level of support to qualifying organisations who are most in need and have seen their trading and\/or fundraising income drop significantly during the crisis; and<\/p><p>A &euro;5 million Government commitment to a Philanthropy Fund, (Innovate Together) which will focus on supporting responses to the COVID-19 crisis that require innovative and adaptive solutions to existing and emerging challenges.<\/p><p>To date, funding of over &euro;25million has been allocated to more than 480 organisations under the COVID 19 stability Fund. This funding is supporting the delivery of critical services in every part of the country.<\/p><p>This funding is provided in addition to the more than &euro;45 million in funding, announced last November, for the Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2020. That funding was allocated for 43 separate measures to be delivered across nine Government Departments to benefit disadvantaged groups.<\/p><p>The funding package for these organisations is complementary to the range of other supports provided by the Government to support businesses, employers and employees on foot of the crisis.<\/p><p>As a result of COVID-19 my Department also developed a &euro;1.2m Support Fund to assist Community Service Programme, or CSP, supported organisations. <\/p><p>In June 2020, the Department launched the 2020 Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) with funding of &euro;2m. The CEP provides capital grants towards enhancing the facilities available to communities. The CEP is administered by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area.<\/p><p>In August, with funding from the July stimulus package, the Department launched a &euro;5m fund under the Community Enhancement Programme for community centres and community buildings. <\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s other investment programmes, such as the 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme, CL&Aacute;R programme, Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme and Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, which support large and small scale capital development in rural areas, continue to be rolled out and all place a particular emphasis on supporting a post-COVID recovery.<\/p><p>In respect of the Department&rsquo;s other programmes, funding commitments are being maintained, and though delays may be experienced in delivery for a period of time it is expected that all projects and initiatives will continue when safe to do so.<\/p><p>My Department also funds the COVID-19 Community Outreach (CCO) programme.
