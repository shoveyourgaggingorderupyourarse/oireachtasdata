Mr. Hoban drew attention to two matters.  One is that the title of &quot;Deputy Director General&quot; was used in our report, whereas &quot;Deputy Director&quot; is the correct term.  The drafting was based on a transcript where the term was used.  We will put that on the public record.<\/p><p>The second relates to a point in paragraph J.8 of our report where a reference is mistakenly made to the Attorney General rather than the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I propose to note the correction.  The error occurred in drafting.  It was a factual correction.  No conclusion was drawn in relation to that issue.  Is it agreed that we will note and publish that?  Agreed.  I am delighted to see people are reading our reports with a microscope.  We are impressed by that.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 2323 from Moyagh Murdock, chief executive officer, Road Safety Authority, dated 17 July 2019, responding to matters raised in correspondence from the Irish Road Haulage Association in respect of the authority's functions that impact on the licensed road haulage sector.  The authority has advised it <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">is liaising separately with the association on the particular issues<\/font>and has invited the association to furnish specific information and evidence to back up its assertions regarding enforcement activities by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In its conclusion, the Road Safety Authority acknowledged that its enforcement checks are constrained by limited resources, absence of fixed charges, deficits in powers and lack of access to information held by other agencies.  However, the authority rejects any assertion that there has been a misuse or misapplication of public funds and that assertions to the contrary should be sustained with evidence or withdrawn.<\/p><p>I propose that we suggest that the Irish Road Haulage Association accepts the Road Safety Authority,'s offer to liaise directly with them, with regard to these matters.  We will note and publish the response.<\/p><p>To paraphrase what the Irish Road Haulage Association was saying, in layperson's English, is that its members know the approximate number of trucks in the country, they know the approximate number of trucks that are from outside of the State and the number of drivers who are from outside of the State.  They believe that Irish domestic road hauliers, because they registered here and are resident here, are far easier to be picked up and checked.  They feel that the trucks coming in from outside of the State are not being checked to the same extent.  They gave the figures whereby 7% or 8% of the checks are in respect of lorries registered outside the State or where the drivers are non-resident in the State.  They pointed out the difficulties with enforcement.  They have succeeded in some litigation in getting enforcement against some of the hauliers.  Obviously, by definition, it is more difficult to get a judgment against a driver who is from another European country.  There are difficulties.  The Irish hauliers believe they get a harder time than the foreign trucks and the foreign truck drivers.  It is all there.<\/p><p>The one thing that was a little bit difficult, and people may comment, is what the Road Safety Authority then kind of says.  If the Irish Road Haulage Association supplies evidence to the Road Safety Authority such as the name of the truck, the date of the truck, where the truck left and where it was going to and who was driving it, the authority will investigate the matter.  The details nearly even include the driver's date of birth and where the lorry owner is incorporated.  It is an unreasonable request, I think, to ask the Irish Road Haulage Association to do that level of investigation.  There is a little bit of toing and froing between them.  I do not know how further we can take this matter.  We are going to publish it, send it to the Irish Road Haulage Association and suggest that they continue their meetings.  I think that is fair.  We have gone as far as we can.We have elucidated the issue quite a bit.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019091900002#C01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1568880000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Presumably, if they are coming from other European countries, there is an equal spotlight on their own industry or people from their own area.

It is something that the Irish Road Haulage Association can take up through its European associates.  There must be associations at an EU level for road haulage because I am sure there are issues that are not just specific to Ireland.  Perhaps that is a useful point.  From our point of view, we will note and publish the correspondence.  We have obtained a lot of information, which was not in the public arena but it is out there now.  I hope that it will be in some way helpful to the people who contacted us.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 2324 from John O'Sullivan, Commissioner, Valuation Office, dated 17 July 2019, responding to a request for details regarding the valuation appeals process.  We asked about the appeals on commercial rates for business owners, the revaluation programme, the details regarding the resourcing of the Valuation Office and details regarding the Valuation Tribunal.  We welcome the information on the basis of information.  It would take approximately two years to clear the current backlog of appeals.  <\/p> <p>  We also have related correspondence No. 2341 from the same Mr. O'Sullivan, dated 30 July 2019, responding to correspondence that we sent from the Irish Petrol Retailers Association.  Mr. O'Sullivan distinguished between the role of the Valuation Office and the Valuation Tribunal.  He stated that the association's comments, in relation to the independence of the Valuation Tribunal are unwarranted and misplaced, as far as they are concerned.  There is also information regarding a freedom of information request and the freedom of information appeals process that is available to the association.  We will note and publish that. <\/p> <p>  It has given, as I have said, a chart that shows the publication dates.  I also have seen the chart where it has completed revaluations.  The office seem to be saying, for several counties, that they have looked after local authorities and that the percentage of ratepayers experiencing a rate reduction in nearly all cases is well over 50%, and is anywhere between 50% and 70%.  The percentage of ratepayers experiencing rate increases is in the region of 30% to 40%.  For a small number, generally, there was no change.

The letter states that legislation to dissolve the board is currently going through the Oireachtas and is expected to be passed later this year.  The organisation is being wound down and that is why we did not receive the accounts.  I am sure Mr. McCarthy will, in due course, do a final audit on the body when it is eventually wound down.

It advises that the relevant Department is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  There is related correspondence from Maurice Buckley, Chairman, Office of Public Works, OPW, because it relates to Garda stations and the OPW was involved in the construction of the cases.  He advises that a due diligence review of cell windows provided by two approved suppliers was undertaken by an independent structural engineer, who concluded that both suppliers produce windows that are fit-for-purpose.  Mr. Buckley also provided an information note regarding the controls in place for ensuring tenders are delivered the specifications set out in the tender.

This relates to a request for clarification in regard to a situation where the main contractor puts in a claim for costs associated with additional work carried out and we wished to find out where the subcontractor stood while the matter was awaiting approval.  He has essentially said that there is no provision in the legislation in respect of that matter.  He stated that the construction contract does not get into commercial arrangements on those types of issues between the main contractor and various subcontractors.  It does not take into account all of the different commercial arrangements which parties may enter into but does set basic standards which are intended to regulate payments between them.  Nor does it involve itself in the complexities which arise on a project but rather provides a framework within which parties on all tiers of the supply chain can engage to ensure the cashflow of those executing the works.  <\/p> <p>  We asked about a specific point.  There can be delays when there is a dispute between a main contractor and it was a question of where stands the subcontractor in the meantime.  Essentially, he has said that they are at the mercy of what happens on a particular site.  He said there is a framework but was not specific.  We will note and publish that correspondence.  It answers the query we raised.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 2328 from Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, dated 19 July, providing the note requested by the committee regarding the difference between national debt and general Government debt.  I can state in one sense what that means, which is very good.  People become confused.  Mr. Moran stated that the general Government debt, which is a measure of total gross debt of the State compiled by EUROSTAT, does not have any netting of cash balances, whereas the national debt is the net debt incurred by the Exchequer after taking account of cash balances and other financial assets.  General Government debt is the gross figure and when we refer to the national debt we are referring to the net amount, net of any cash balances.  We know the NTMA has approximately &euro;30 billion in cash balances.

No. 2329 B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE, providing notes on matters requested by the committee on 27 June about the national incident management system and the number of category 1 incidents.  We sought this information to feed into and help draft our next periodic report on the State Claims Agency, in which medical negligence and other claims against the State will be a significant element.  Category 1 is major and extreme events, category 2 is moderate events, and category 3 is minor events.  The notes give a breakdown of the top five minor events, including slips, trips and falls, clinical procedures, self-injuries, behaviour on medication, and violence, harassment and aggression.

The previous information note was provided on 1 March.  The update includes further details of the findings of the High Court on the matter.  Related to this is No. 2362 C, dated 17 August, from an individual who has previously corresponded with the committee regarding the Department's previous information note.  He believed the previous information note provided by the Department was defamatory.  The committee decided on 18 April to advise the correspondent to raise the matter with the Department directly and that if the Department wished to change or withdraw the note to the committee, then the committee would duly consider that request.  As the Department has requested an update of its note, I propose that we remove the previously published note from the website and replace it with the updated note from the Department.  We will note both items and we will advise the correspondent accordingly.  We will replace the note on the committee's website with the new one.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2333 B is from Mr. William Beausang, head of higher and further education and training policy at the Department of Education and Skills, dated 24 July.

We have considered legal powers available to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the proposed legislation includes reconstituting the HEA as the Higher Education Commission with statutory responsibility for the regulation and oversight of the performance of higher education institutions.  We will note and publish this.  The Department has written to us because we have been involved in this area.  If we want to make a submission to that consultation process that the Minister of State is engaging in, I suggest we resend a copy of our periodic report with our earlier recommendations to be taken into consideration.

If it is a 20-year contract, how much is it going to cost over the 20 years?  That is more important than what is paid upfront or what was paid in the first three years.  The Deputy will be aware that PPPs have caused enormous difficulty for this committee because there is a deliberate policy of not adequately reviewing them.  Departments often wait for several years when it is too late to have any meaningful contribution.  Also, because PPPs involve private companies, this committee does not have access them, even though there is substantial State funding involved.  This committee has decided, and reaffirmed on a couple of occasions, that it will never note a Department's accounts for any year if there is a substantial amount of a PPP in the Vote because we cannot get behind what is in the PPP.

In addition, as a result of the PPP model, which I consider to be utterly faulty and adopted for the wrong reasons, the health service suffered.  We did not roll out the health centres and that is the most important point.  In Galway as well as nationally, there was a call for expressions of interest but not many companies came forward.  Those that did come forward backed out, so Galway did not get designated primary care centres.  In one sense, I am happy because I do not think they should be PPPs.  However, there is no primary care.  The one centre that did go ahead went ahead by way of a private model with an enormous rent.  The other area did not get a centre at all.  There were consequences all round in terms of money, value for money and for our health service.

The first point relates to a question on the number of people looking for step-down services at a particular date, which is replied to in No.1.  No. 2 refers to the budget for home care services, including the percentage increase in money terms and the amount of the increase that is dedicated to meeting commitments in respect of remuneration, that is, salary costs.  Details are provided on the home support budget for 2018 and 2019 for each of the regions.  I know that all members will be surprised to see that the budget increased because we know that services have not increased.  There is quite a bit in that on the Estimates.  There is also a note on St. Conlon's nursing home in Nenagh.<\/p> <p>  There is also a note on the breakdown of the 1,030 staff recruited by the HSE this year.  The note explains that the HSE does not include whole-time equivalents, WTEs, or pre-registration nursing and midwifery interns.  The correspondence gives a figure for the total health service WTE of 118,888.  I was quite clear on the day of our meeting that I wanted to know the total number of WTE staff involved in providing health services.  Many of the services are now being provided by agencies, as we all know, particularly home help services.  Essentially, agency staff are now doing work that used to be done by the HSE's own staff.  There is a clear move towards providing more services through agency staff and fewer through the HSE's own staff.  The HSE is not recruiting as many staff as before.  In terms of the total HSE budget, whether one refers to voluntary organisations, those that describe themselves as charities, those providing home help services, as well as agency doctors and nurses in hospital, I want to know the total WTE numbers engaged in delivering the health service in Ireland.  I include here all staff who are on the direct HSE payroll as well as those working in any of the HSE-funded organisations, including section 38 organisations and the agencies from which services are contracted.  I suspect that there are another 20,000 WTEs on top of the figure given.  If that is the case, we need to know.  We need to know how many people are involved in delivering the health service, but that information is not provided here.  We have been given a figure for the HSE's own staff.

If that money is sitting in a bank account, the HSE must draw it down as revenue in a particular way.  Is it costing the HSE money to draw down those funds?  Why not re-profile?  We might ask that question of the HSE as well.  If there is a history of one section 38 organisation having to constantly seek these type of funds then there is a need to do something more permanent.  Why would this be repeated each year and where would the HSE get the money?  If the HSE has these funds, why would it not reprofile them?<\/p> <p>  I also have concerns because of the terms governing charities.  One of the conditions is that such an organisation is not permitted to make a loss and the Charities Regulator would look closely at that.  Similar to underproviding for the ratio regarding provision for nurses, which may put their professional qualifications at risk, what the HSE is doing may well put some of these organisations at risk as well.  If the HSE is doing that and still relying on the services provided by these organisations then there is a double issue regarding how precarious they are.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019091900002#G01800","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1568880000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I forgot to put a bit into the question.  We also want to know how many of these cash disbursement acceleration payments were outstanding at the end of each of the years concerned.  Let us suppose that an organisation is going to get &euro;120 million to deliver a service over a year.  Let us say it is &euro;10 million a year.  It is also known that there is a problem and we want to know what happens towards the end of the year.  There is a necessity to be cash neutral during the course of the year and everything has to be balanced by the end of the year.  I do not know how that works but such organisations are required to be cash-neutral at the end of the year.  We will ask for confirmation of that.  The Deputy is correct in stating that some of the organisations might require re-profiling.  If cash advances have increased from &euro;17 million in 2016 to &euro;73 million in 2018 an issue is building up somewhere in the system.  Now is a good time to highlight it.  We will ask the HSE for further details because it seems to be an emerging problem.<\/p><p>The next topic concerns primary care centres being operated under a service level agreement with private companies to include any centres being leased from private consortia and a range of private companies involved.  I refer to the PPP that Deputy Munster mentioned earlier.  We asked for information on that.  There was also a query regarding the total value of claims received by the HSE in 2008.  There is a large chart on page 16 and the information from that will feed into our report on the State Claims Agency.  <\/p><p>The next matter was the cross-Border initiative, including the number and value of claims paid out in 2018.  That figure was &euro;12.3 million, which represented 6,728 claims.  I estimate that is an average of &euro;1,828 per claim.  We know that many cataract operations take place in Belfast, as well as hip, knee and similar types of operations.  There has, however, been a serious slowdown in reimbursement.  Some people were able to borrow &euro;5,000 to go and get the operation and some had to go to the credit union.  I am told by my constituents that credit unions are not now giving out those types of loans because of the delay in the HSE doing the recoupment.  That is making it more difficult for people who would have relied on the credit union to get a loan.  We will ask for a note to be provided on the payment record and how quickly payment is being made.  We all know from constituency level that there is a growing problem.  <\/p><p>The next topic concerns expenditure on legal services by the HSE.  We queried this as part of its financial statement.  It was &euro;17.5 million in 2008.  Some &euro;9 million was spent on solicitors working for the HSE, &euro;3.37 million on barristers, &euro;3 million was reimbursed for third party legal costs and the cost of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>services, in respect of associated legal services, was &euro;161,000.  That figure of &euro;17.5 million spent on legal services is a large one.  A new arrangement for the provision of legal services is being examined.  <\/p><p>This all follows from the HSE's financial statement.  We next asked for a breakdown of consultancy costs incurred by the HSE.  We also need further details on this issue.  I am on the bottom of page 8.  Regarding the national children's hospital, the HSE - not the National Paediatric Hospital Board - incurred consultancy costs of &euro;11.2 million regarding the Children's Hospital Group in 2018.  We want the figures for each of the previous years and the current spending to date.  We are asking for further information.  A breakdown is given of the &euro;11 million.  Some &euro;3.6 million was spent on an ICT digital hospital project, while clinical and operational support was &euro;3.5 million.  Design, operation, commission, transitioning and medical equipment cost &euro;1.8 million.  Corporate services workforce change management was &euro;1.6 million and project management and other costs were &euro;400,000.<\/p><p>There is &euro;11 million in consultancy services in respect of the Children's Hospital Group that has not come into anybody's figure for the cost of reconfiguring the children's hospital.  The costs are popping up all over the place.  The other consultancy costs can be seen down the line.  We will note and publish this.  Some people will want to read this documentation in detail, and members are free to raise any point arising.<\/p><p> The next item in the correspondence was the insurance bill for the HSE, including a breakdown of categories of cover.  The HSE spent &euro;6 million on its own insurance.  We told the HSE we thought it was covered by the State Claims Agency.  The HSE said it has other costs outside the State Claims Agency.  Obviously, it has some of its buildings insured.  The premium was &euro;3.4 million.  It spent &euro;6 million on insurance.  This is all laid out in the different categories of equipment and assets it has.  Then we asked about private contributions to nursing homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019091900002#G01900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568880000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I have a concern about the State Claims Agency.

The total contributions levied for collection in 2018 was &euro;61 million.  This is connected with the fair deal scheme, under which people have to make a contribution.  I think we understand that.  We raised the replacement of direct home help by agency staff here.  The HSE puts the number of healthcare support assistants at 6,000.  We have all seen at a local level that there was curtailment in some of the HSE's own staff weekend work over the summer period.  I encountered this in a number of counties.  They were being replaced by State agency staff.  We also had the situation during the summer, which I found frightening, whereby when the HSE's own healthcare support staff went on annual leave during the summer, families were left with zero cover during that period, whereas if the service had been provided by agency staff, who have 52-week contracts, while the agency worker went on his or her two weeks' holidays he or she would have been replaced by an alternative agency worker.  Therefore, in lots of homes in Ireland there were perhaps two different people providing the service: the HSE healthcare support providing the service at a certain time of the day and the agency staff perhaps doing something else at another time of the week.  When it came to the holiday period, the HSE's own staff were not replaced.  The families were told, \"Go fend for yourselves.\"  I have letters to confirm that.  That is not the HSE's wording but it is the reality.  However, the agency staff were covered because they had 52-week contracts.  That is where that question came from, and people can read the correspondence.  My worry is that now that the HSE has done this - to my knowledge, for the first time this summer - it will do it again at Christmas and at Easter.  It has got its foot in the door this time in not providing holiday cover for its own staff, which I thought was dreadful.

We asked him to give the committee a list of the property sites managed by the Department around the country and the number of Labour Court settlements involving former employees of Bord na gCon.  That is on page 8.  Members will note, for the meeting later, that there have been no Labour Court settlements during the period September 2017 to July 2019 but a number of issues were referred to the Workplace Relations Commission for adjudication.  This is about Bord na gCon.  One claim for unfair dismissal was settled in August 2018.  Under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 2005, and Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, a case was settled in 2019.  A claim for unfair dismissals minimum notice was settled in May 2019.  We will ask Bord na gCon about those.  It is coincidental we have the information of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, if members want to raise that with Bord na gCon this afternoon.<\/p> <p>  We had several recommendations from our interim report, which Mr. Gleeson deals with, but we have the Minister's report already.  We will come back to that.  We also sought information on the breakdown of Department staff on a county-by-county basis and the number of premises it has in the various counties because the Department has quite a big footprint around the country.  We note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  Next is No. 2337 from the EPA office, dated 15 July, providing further information requested by the committee in respect of water testing for bathing water and testing for illicit and-or legal drugs.  Members can read that.  We will note that.<\/p> <p>  No. 2338 from Mr. Derek Finnegan, parliamentary affairs, Department of Health, provides information requested by the committee on the appointment of members to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  I am near the last item, for now.  No. 2339 from Mr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General, Department of Children and Youth Affairs, provides information requested by the committee relating to subvention payments and over claims for the early years schemes for 2018 and 2019.  It states that there has been an increase in the compliance activity as well as strengthening of scheme rules.  We note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  We also received No. 2377 from the Department providing figures for the years 2017 and 2018.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  The last item we will take is from Mr. Paul O'Toole of the HEA providing information requested by the committee relating to employment contracts for tutors and part-time lecturers.<\/p> <p>  I propose to stop there on the correspondence at this point.  That was the batch we received up to the August weekend.  When we come back next week, we will have to deal with the correspondence received in recent weeks.  I want to have a few minutes on the work programme and the accounts received and have a sos before we start into Bord na gCon at 11 a.m.  I will move on.  The rest of the correspondence will be held over until the next occasion.  I am aware some Members were interested in the correspondence but that is as far as we have got.  Hopefully, we will get to the rest of it on the next occasion.<\/p> <p>  No. 4 on the agenda is statements and accounts received.  I will go through these as quickly as I can.  Understandably, there are 30 or 40 items.  We complain they do not send them in to us on time and when they lodge them, we should at least acknowledge it.  They are the National Pension Reserve Fund Commission, clear audit opinion; the Ireland Apple escrow fund account on which we had a detailed discussion with the Department of Finance before the summer break, clear audit; the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, clear audit opinion; the Road Safety Authority, clear audit opinion; the Food Safety Authority, clear audit opinion, but the issue of the standard for the health bodies about superannuation entitlements is referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General; the Private Security Authority, clear audit opinion; the Travellers Protection Fund investment account, which has &euro;1 million in it, clear audit opinion; Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge, clear audit opinion; and the National Oil Reserves Agency, clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  I will write to the National Oil Reserves Agency on an issue that is now relevant.  I had a look at the agency's accounts this morning.  The agency makes it clear that the State is required to have 90 days of oil supplies available to it under EU rules and if the agency does not have the reserves held in the State, it must have them in a bilateral contract with another country that is a member of the EU.  I checked the figures in the agency's annual report this morning.  I am aware that two thirds of our 90-day requirement - 60 days - is held in the State and one third is held outside of State, mainly in the UK, as we asked this question previously.  The agreement we have with the UK holding some of our oil reserves is contingent on the country we have the agreement with being a member of the EU.  I will write to the agency for clarification on where that stand in the event of the UK not being in the EU.  It is not good enough to state that we have a bilateral agreement because, from my brief reading of the agency's annual report this morning, that bilateral agreement is contingent on the country concerned being in the EU.  We want that clarified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019091900002#K01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1568880000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Do we have the capacity here in Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019091900002#K01100","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1568880000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Yes.

A section in the report refers to a chapter in a special report that the Comptroller and Auditor General published in 2015.  The previous Committee of Public Accounts dealt with this matter.  The chapter considered a number of matters, including whether there were proper business cases underpinning the model and the number of cards to be issued.  The procurement contract was based on a target of 3 million cards, which has not been reached.  What was most extraordinary from the report was the interaction between the Department and the commission.  The pushback from the Department was extraordinary.  I have never seen anything like it.  The DPC is an independent statutory body and the thought struck me that, if that is how the Department treats it, how does the Department treat everyone else?

As members are aware, Bord na gCon, which was established under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, has responsibility for the control, regulation and development of the greyhound industry in Ireland.  It operates racing activities through its subsidiary company network and licences greyhound racing at other privately owned tracks.  It also operates catering and beverage services at its tracks. I have included a graphic in the opening comments to illustrate the group structure as at the end of 2017.<\/p> <p>  The financial statements of Bord na gCon are prepared on a group basis, with separate financial statements for each of the subsidiaries.  In 2017, the board recognised a surplus of &euro;417,000 from the group's overall activities.  The comparable figure for 2016 was a surplus of &euro;2.35 million.  This was before recognition of a &euro;4 million exceptional gain in 2016 arising from a restructuring of Bord na gCon's pension scheme.<\/p> <p>  Turnover from racing activities for 2017 was &euro;22.7 million, down almost 20% from the &euro;28.3 million recorded in 2016.  The decrease reflected significant falls in track attendance receipts, in catering sales, and in tote betting.  Racing expenses also fell year on year by around 13%.  The net result was a loss on racing activities of &euro;545,000.  This was before payment of prizes and incentives totalling just over &euro;8 million, about the same level as in 2016. <\/p> <p>  Non-racing income was up by around &euro;1 million to &euro;17.8 million in 2017.  This included funding paid from the horse and greyhound fund of &euro;16 million, which was up &euro;1.2 million year on year.  Other funding comprised contributions to prize money of &euro;1.75 million from dog owners and sponsors, and around &euro;81,000 generated from media and other income.<\/p> <p>  The financial statements for 2017 show the board was carrying borrowings of almost &euro;22 million at the end of the year, with related bank charges over the assets of a number of the subsidiary companies.  As members are aware, the board entered into an agreement with the Department of Education and Skills during 2017 to sell its facilities at Harold's Cross at a contracted sale price of &euro;23 million.  The sale concluded in May 2018 and a substantial part of the sale proceeds were used to repay the board's bank loans.  I issued a clear audit opinion on the 2017 financial statements.<\/p> <p>  Bord na gCon's financial statements for 2018 were certified by me on 4 September 2019.  Audit certification of those financial statements took longer than planned because of the need to ensure that the results of the board's annual asset impairment review were accounted for appropriately.  Since the 2018 financial statements have not yet been presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019091900002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1568880000,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and will remark on the last matter.

The Comptroller and Auditor General has confirmed that the accounts have been audited and certified.  They have recently been presented to the Minister's office but they require approval by Government before they can be published and laid.  The witnesses have an advantage on us.  They have their audited accounts for 2018 but we have not seen them.  However, I do want to acknowledge that significant information about 2018 has been supplied and made available to us, either by the Department or Bord na gCon - we have received it anyway - to make sure that our discussion here today is more up to date than just purely historical.  I want to acknowledge the extra information that we have received in advance of this meeting, which we appreciate.<\/p> <p>  I invite Mr. Dollard to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019091900002#P00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568880000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I am thankful to have the opportunity to appear before the Chairman and other members on behalf of Bord nag Con, the Irish Greyhound Board.  I am the chief executive of the board.  I am accompanied by Mr. Philip Peake, deputy chief executive and director for events and hospitality services and HR; Mr. John Tuohey, interim chief financial officer; and Mr. Joe Lewins, director of tote, wagering and IT.<br\/><br\/>As set out in the invitation to attend, the accounts for examination before the committee are the financial statements for Bord na gCon for 2017.  However, for completeness of information, since the invitation was issued to attend the committee, the audit of the 2018 financial statements has been completed and they will be published shortly, following the placing of the accounts before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I will make a brief reference to the 2018 accounts before I conclude.  The year 2017 was a challenging one for the greyhound industry due to a 22-week disruption at our main flagship stadium, Shelbourne Park, during which 123 race meetings were lost.  The operating profit before interest, depreciation and taxation, EBITDA, for the year was &euro;1.67 million, as compared to &euro;3.2 million for 2016.<br\/><br\/>The disruption to racing impacted on performance across a number of areas, including the tote, food and beverages and attendance income.  Overall attendances for all stadiums reduced by 122,000 in the year.  A full racing schedule at Shelbourne Park recommenced on 27 June 2017, with recovery for the remainder of the year at a fragmented level.  Total food and beverage sales at stadiums operated by our events and hospitality services division were &euro;5.6 million in 2017.  This generated a gross profit of &euro;3.7 million.  Tote turnover for the year was &euro;15.9 million, with &euro;2.08 million being received in international co-mingling income.  The sale of media rights for race meetings generated &euro;800,000 in the year.  Total prize money for the year, notwithstanding the reduction in the number of race meetings, was &euro;8 million.  The board implemented a 25% increase in prize money race grants, with effect from 1 October 2017.<br\/><br\/>Progress was also made in reducing the deficit on the defined benefit pension scheme, with a total &euro;1.5 million deduction or reduction in liability being achieved in the year.  The sale of Harold&rsquo;s Cross stadium which was concluded in May 2018 has enabled the board to discharge its long-term debt and provide funding for necessary investment in stadiums and infrastructure.  Surplus funds of &euro;5.8 million have been earmarked for a range of areas in the Harold&rsquo;s Cross business plan for sale proceeds.  Works undertaken to date include track improvements and drainage works at Shelbourne Park; the rolling out of replacement hare drive and timing systems to all tracks; a new central racing management system; the upgrading of CCTV infrastructure at stadiums; fire safety improvement works at selected tracks; the upgrading of veterinary facilities at a number of stadiums; and a grants scheme for private tracks for welfare and health and safety improvements.<br\/><br\/>A report on the financial and economic significance of the greyhound industry by Jim Power Economics was completed in November 2017.  Thie report which was an update on a similar report prepared in 2011 estimated that 12,371 people derived economic benefit from the industry and that the overall industry had a national economic impact, estimated at &euro;302 million.  The report also highlights the considerable economic activity and employment in rural Ireland, while at the same time the industry enjoys a strong urban support base.<br\/><br\/>Much work was undertaken in the latter part of 2017 on the development of a strategic plan for the period 2018 to 2022.  The plan sets out a number of key pillars, including ensuring the highest standards of integrity and regulation in the sport and maintaining animal welfare at the centre of the industry.  The matters of regulation and animal welfare have been under discussion by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and further discussion with that committee is anticipated in the coming weeks. <br\/><br\/>One of the objectives of the strategic plan for Bord na gCon is to undertake an assessment of the overall industry footprint.  Indecon Economic Consultants has been appointed to undertake this work and its report is expected in the final quarter of 2019.  The greyhound industry and Bord na gCon continue to operate within a very challenging environment.  Our focus will be on continuing to implement our strategic plan towards achieving a rejuvenated greyhound industry and a sport that will continue to be celebrated as a unique part of Irish culture and heritage.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The Greyhound Racing Act 2019 was signed into law on 29 May last and provides Bord na gCon and the greyhound industry with an opportunity to look to the future on the foundations of a strengthened and robust modern legislative framework.  We look forward to the commencement of the legislation in due course.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned that the financial statements for 2018 had been finalised.  I draw attention to a re-valuation process and impairment analysis which form part of the 2018 financial statements.  This has resulted in a reduction in the figure for fixed assets from &euro;51.5 million to &euro;29.4 million.  This process was undertaken in accordance with Bord na gCon&rsquo;s accounting policies and has no impact on cash flow or the operational side of the business.  <br\/><br\/>Again, I am thankful to have the opportunity to come before the committee.  We will endeavour to respond to all questions asked.  However, if there is additional information required arising from the meeting, we will be pleased to provide it as promptly as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019091900002#Q00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Dollard"},{"type":"speech","time":1568880000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dollard.

As Mr. Dollard stated we are here to discuss the financial accounts and the financial position of Bord na gCon, in particular the viability of the financial future of Bord na gCon.<\/p> <p>  In the board members' report, the section on principal commercial activity sets out the main funding for Bord na gCon and how it is sourced from five different categories: admission fees; bar and restaurant sales; the tote; levy on the bookies; and Exchequer funding.  I find it strange that &euro;16.8 million from the Exchequer is mentioned last, given that it dwarfs most of the other sources of funding.  Bord na gCon gets Exchequer funding of &euro;16.8 million, which breaks down to &euro;323,000 per week, or &euro;46,000 a day.  The funding has increased by &euro;2 million since 2016, or an additional &euro;39,000 a week.  I know that the funding of the dogs sticks in the craw of many people, given the poor unfortunates in my constituency who have been told there is no money for home help for their loved ones, or who have been told by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath that there is no money for the respite centre in Athboy.   This set of accounts for the Irish Greyhound Board records an increase of &euro;2 million for greyhounds and the funding from the State is only referenced last in the annual report.<\/p> <p>  Let us look at the income and expenditure because it is quite evident that without the Exchequer funding of &euro;16.8 million, greyhound racing operations would not be viable.  To answer Deputy Farrell's question, they would be goosed.  It begs the larger question of such massive State subvention in the first place.<\/p> <p>  I will now concentrate on the income of IGB.  I was a sports journalist for 15 years.  For most sporting organisations, the people coming through the turnstiles are the segment that generate the largest part of the income and they are a good barometer of public sentiment for the organisation.  Let us look at the attendance figures, the ordinary Irish people coming through the 17 tracks in various parts of the country.  In 2016, some 636,914 people came through the turnstiles; in 2017, and I acknowledge there were difficulties that year, the figure dropped to 514,500 people; and last year, 2018, it dropped to 506,000, even though the number of race meetings actually held increased from the number held in 2017.  The number of people coming through the turnstiles has dropped by 130,000 in the past three years.  That is a substantial drop in attendance.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Dollard is the new chief executive and he is trying to reform the organisation.  I am sure he will admit that the drop in attendance is quite substantial.  Average attendance at the track would be 319 people per meeting in 2018.  There would be more people at a cricket match in Malahide and the Irish Cricket Union does not get the colour of &euro;16.8 million.  Contrast those 319 people with the 321 people in my constituency waiting on home help in County Meath.  It is galling.  The industry has some neck to be in receipt of &euro;16.8 million in State support with such low public support.  If the industry continues to haemorrhage public support, which is evident from the drop of 130,000 people attending the tracks in three years, does there need to be a reappraisal?<\/p> <p>  I have three questions.  First, does there need to be a reappraisal of the level of Government support, because quite simply the Exchequer cannot be expected to prop up a failing industry if income is falling on one side?  Second, has Bord na gCon approached the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with a request for increased State support, either by way of correspondence, formal or informal meetings with the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle?  Given the trends in income that we have seen will there be requests for further support as well?  Third, Mr. Dollard alluded to the fact that Shelbourne Park was performing strongly in the first half of the year before the RT&Eacute; expose but how have the other tracks performed in that same six months period?  In terms of the 20% drop on average, across attendance numbers, was the spike higher in some tracks than others? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019091900002#T01200","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568880000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  Chairman, I will take the issues in the order in which they were raised.<br\/><br\/>First, it is not just greyhound racing, it is a greyhound industry.  I have mentioned the Jim Power economic report, The Economic and Financial Significance of the Irish Greyhound Industry November 2017<i>.  <\/i>It is a significant industry and adds significant value to the economy.  Some 12,371 people derive economic benefit.  There is a constituency out there for whom this is their job and their life, it is what they depend on.  On the other side, income comes to the State through the betting levy, the tax and PRSI of those people who are involved in the industry.  There are two sides to the argument.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked whether the Government should reappraise its support.  I think that is a policy question for Government.  The greyhound racing industry is a legitimate industry and people are entitled to be part of it.  They are entitled to enjoy it.  On the question of whether there has been a request for increasing State support, Bord na gCon has made no request for increasing State support although as I referred to earlier, we are on a significant change and reform agenda and investment will be required.  I would think that any reduction in the current support would cause difficulty in terms of the overall programme for care and welfare in particular.<br\/><br\/>On the question of whether further support will be required down the line, that brings us back to the Indecon study.  The Indecon study will I hope offer a blueprint as to what is a financially sustainable industry footprint into the future.  When that report is available, all parties, including the board and Government, will have to consider its recommendations.<br\/><br\/>On the question of the attendance at other stadia, let us look at the 2018 data.  The Bord na gCon stadia showed an increase in attendance, but the major loss in attendance was in the private stadia.  I mentioned Shelbourne Park, which had a significant increase in attendance; Curraheen Park had a small increase; Mullingar Greyhound Stadium showed an increase; and, Youghal Greyhound Stadium had a minor increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019091900002#T01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Dollard"},{"type":"speech","time":1568880000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I never questioned the legitimacy of the industry.  I am fully aware of how the horse and greyhound racing fund is operated but not every tax raised in this country, be it motor taxation, goes directly back into the sector from which it was pulled.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Dollard take me through the viability of the individual tracks, because the last time Bord na gCon appeared before the committee, the major talking point was the sale of Harold's Cross stadium, which amazingly was sold to the Department of Education and Skills for &euro;23 million, the exact amount of the debt of Bord na gCon?  Given that such a sale is not something that can happen every year, the business model is crucial so that such a position is not revisited.  We have just discussed the issue of the drop in attendance figures.  Notwithstanding the small increase in attendance at the start of this year, there has been a drop in attendance of 130,000 people in three years, which cannot be overlooked.<\/p> <p>  The accounts show there have been substantial losses at nine tracks.<\/p><p>Leaving Shelbourne Park aside, there are substantial losses.  Let us forget about the private tracks.  First, are the tracks in Bord na gCon's ownership still viable?  Second, I refer to the other tracks that it supports financially.  In fairness, Mr. Dollard told <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and other media organisations in July that the question of whether 17 tracks in Ireland were too many for the sport had to be looked at.  First, are the ones in Bord na gCon's ownership still viable?  Second, is the support for the other tracks still a viable proposition?  Third, when Mr. Dollard was before the committee last year or whenever it was, there was a debt in excess of &euro;20 million that had been cleared through the sale of Harold's Cross stadium.  If we get to a point where that decline in both attendances and commercial revenues continues, how soon before accumulated debt will be a gaping reality for Bord na gCon once again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019091900002#T01400","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568880000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>On the business model, the model is changing.

I have not actually asked a question.  I would like to refer to the sale of Harold's Cross racetrack.  There were attendances of 1.3 million at the racetrack in 2006.  It had revenues of &euro;50 million in that year.  The sale of the racetrack was meant to be the saviour of the industry.  I will not take up much more time.  Mr. Pat Creed said at the time that the sale of the racetrack was \"a game-changer\".  We were told it would create \"a sustainable future\".  In fairness, the chairman, Mr. Meaney, said similar things.  He said there were \"no plans\" to sell off any tracks as a consequence, etc.  Now we know about Longford and Lifford, etc.  We have had poor marketing and high stadium running costs.  We are haemorrhaging money.  On that basis, how can the Irish Greyhound Board put forward a sustainable future for this industry?  The sale of Harold's Cross racetrack was meant to recalibrate this industry under the stewardship of the Irish Greyhound Board.  According to all of our analysis here, that is not happening.  I ask Mr. Dollard not to come back to me with references to the Indecon report.  We were told that the Indecon report is going to be a blueprint for the future.  The Indecon report, as commissioned, is not a blueprint for the future.  By the way, I would like to know how much it has cost.  The Indecon report relates to the future of stadiums.  If the report recommends the closure of stadiums, that will be an indictment of the board, given that the sale of Harold's Cross racetrack was supposed to be the saviour of the industry.  Where is the sustainability of this industry under Mr. Dollard's stewardship since the sale of Harold's Cross racetrack, based on what was predicted, on the figures that have been put forward and on where we are now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019091900002#W01100","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568880000,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I would like to respond to a number of points.  As I said earlier, we have not requested an increase in the horse and greyhound fund.  We are all conscious of the national budgetary parameters for 2020.  That does not in any way change our strategic plan and the foundations on which it was built.  Obviously, we have to operate on the basis of the funding that is available.  We certainly would not rule out an increase in future years if economic circumstances at national level are benign.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy referred to the private racetracks at Lifford and Longford.  The relevant authorities at both racetracks decided to cease operations.  This was neither requested nor required by the Irish Greyhound Board.  I understand it is intended that operations will resume in Longford early next week.  They will continue to be fully supported by the Irish Greyhound Board.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Kelly also mentioned the sustainable future of the industry.  The previous Deputy referred to an interview I gave to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  I think there has to be a rationalised industry.  I expect that the footprint will have to change.

It pointed out that taxpayers' money is being used to subsidise this industry and suggested that there is the potential for that money to be used to subsidise below-cost selling of greyhounds.  There were also issues around animal welfare and so on.  People were looking at this and asking where is the accountability.  When I try to get answers to questions I am told that we do not really have proper accountability because the proper systems are not in place.  Would Mr. Dollard agree with \"Prime Time Investigates\"?  The answer is either \"Yes\" or \"No\" because this is not something that is subjective.

What assurances can he give to the public that those changes are happening?<\/p> <p>  I accept that there is an increased level of competency on the board and I do see some changes which are for the better.

A lot of people I know are working or are active in the sport and I value that because they value it.  However, when it comes to taxpayers' money, we have to make sure that we are getting bang for our buck and that the changes that are necessary are being brought about.  I ask Mr. Dollard to respond quickly if he can.  What would he say to the public who watched the aforementioned television programme or who have been following the proceedings of this committee?

That is the most worrying part for most people, which is why I asked whether the Department had been aware of the steps that the board stated it had taken and put into the public domain.

I apologise for not being here earlier.  I was speaking in the D&aacute;il.  I will probably cover some ground that has been covered.  I have to put in my two and sixpence worth.  I want to ask a few questions.<\/p> <p>  I will start by asking about animal welfare.  We are all aware of the fallout from the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  Everyone was horrified by what he or she saw.  It was not good enough.  I am a farmer and a dog lover and was shocked by what I saw.  I did not think I would be, but I was.  We do not need to say any more than that.  We saw a dog being thrown into hot water.  I know that it was not here.  It was horrible to see dogs being shot in knackeries for a tenner.  All of that was uncovered.  There is a lot of skullduggery in the business.  I have to say it out straight that there is an onus on the board to bring this behaviour to an end.  If it is not checked, it will lose out further.  It is widely known that the board has already lost sponsorship as a result of the programme.  As an observer, I suggest the &euro;16.8 million in taxpayers' money that it receives every year will come into question if something is not done.  The witnesses are well aware of this.  What is the board doing to catch up on, or counteract, the fallout?  <\/p> <p>  I would like to refer to some figures I have seen.  Last year,the Irish Greyhound Board allocated just &euro;130,000 for animal welfare.  In addition, 3% of winners' prize money was set aside for this purpose.  That means that a total of &euro;364,000 was used for this purpose.  In the United Kingdom &pound;3 million from a fund of &pound;8 million goes towards animal welfare.  The Irish Greyhound Board benefits from a fund of &euro;16.8 million of taxpayers' money.  According to the figures I have seen, just &euro;364,000 was allocated for animal welfare last year.<\/p><p>It does not look good for the board when we compare like with like.  Is that the reason we are in this position?  The general view is that if the Irish Greyhound Board does not pull up its socks and get the game right, it will be in trouble.

Some of what was shown is outside the remit of the Irish Greyhound Board, such as knackeries, exports and so on.  I do not think the board, or anybody here, can be held responsible for the approach to welfare in other international jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what we are doing and the spend on welfare, which we covered earlier, the &euro;364,000 is just one element of our welfare programme.  It specifically relates to contributions to welfare and the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust.  It does not cover our spend of nearly &euro;400,000 on veterinary services at tracks.  It does not cover our control stewards or stipendiary stewards who are part of our inspection team.

A range of measures was outlined at the agriculture committee.  A further range of measures has been taken.  Traceability, which has been discussed, is key.  We have set up a care fund and 10% of all admissions and restaurant packages will go into the fund, as will 50% of sponsorships.  We have a confidential phone line and more money for fostering.  We have more money for retired greyhounds, particularly in Ireland.  Internationally, we are working with Greyhound Pets of America to progress rehoming.  I will not take up the committee's time but a wide range of measures is being taken, many of which were already in the pipeline.  The Greyhound Racing Act 2019 has been in place since May.

My figures could be wrong but prize money definitely decreased.  Having been brought up around greyhounds, I know that the name of the game is the prize money.  What keeps people in racing is the few bob they can make from wins.

Prize money of &euro;10 million was available ten years ago when times were good.  What is the position now?  We all know that prize money is what keeps the industry alive and ensures the ordinary punter who races bitches gets a few bob back.
