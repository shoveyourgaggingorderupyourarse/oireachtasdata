Last week, Bord G&aacute;is announced massive price hikes for gas and electricity that will add a further &euro;350 per year to the average gas bill and an &euro;340 to electricity bills.  This is the Government credit wiped out before it even arrives.  Meanwhile, nothing has been done to cut the cost of home heating oil, which has doubled in 12 months.  Workers and families have been hit by a barrage of energy hikes, with more than 30 in the past year.  They are already struggling to keep up and have been left absolutely stunned by the scale of the latest increases.<\/p>  <p>  Russia's criminal invasion of Ukraine has brought massive disruption and volatility to global energy markets.  Everything that can be done should be done and must be done to mitigate the impact and to cut bills for hard-pressed households.  The T&aacute;naiste's Fine Gael colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has stated that the Government has no plan to intervene with further measures before October's budget.  October is seven months away.  That is a very long time for households when every single euro counts and when the sky-high bills for rent, mortgages, groceries, childcare and insurance just keep coming.  It is endless.  Everything is going up and up, and nothing is coming down.  People are living under real stress and pressure.  Research from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul shows that many people are cutting back on essential heating and electricity use.  Families are forgoing other necessities, including food.  The head of the charity ALONE has said that many older people now choose between heating or eating.  Nobody should have to make a choice like that.<\/p>  <p>  We are aware that this is not the end and that there are more energy hikes coming down the tracks.  The real impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on energy costs will not be felt until the back end of the year.  We need to get ahead of this.  We need to get on top of this crisis.  People expect the Government to respond with a speed and urgency that matches the unprecedented difficulties they now face and to intervene with measures that will work in the context of getting energy bills down, keeping money in people's pockets and giving some breathing space.  People need us and they need the T&aacute;naiste to do this now.  I understand that the Government cannot do everything, but it can do more.  It must go further in order to cushion households from these hikes.  Expecting people to wait for seven more months is just a non-runner.<\/p> <p> N&iacute; f&eacute;idir le hoibrithe agus teaghlaigh coinne&aacute;il suas leis na harduithe fuinnimh seo.

We are seeing an unprecedented increase in the cost of energy, not just in Ireland but also around the world.  We see that in the increase in the cost of petrol, diesel, natural gas, electricity and home heating oil.  That is really squeezing people.  It is making bills very hard to pay and squeezing many households.  It is affecting businesses as well, and those on the lowest incomes in particular.  As the Deputy acknowledged, this increase is largely, if not entirely, being caused by factors beyond the control of those of us in this House or the Government.  It is being driven by supply chain difficulties and a supply and demand mismatch linked to the pandemic.  This has been exacerbated in the past few weeks because of Russia's war on Ukraine.  The Government will do whatever it can to help people ease the burden.  We cannot do everything, but we will do what we can.<\/p>  <p>  So far, we have committed &euro;1 billion to help people with the cost of fuel and energy.  That includes the increase in the fuel allowance back in October.  There was an additional increase of &euro;125 for anyone in receipt of the fuel allowance, which people would have received in the past week.  There was a reduction in excise on green diesel, diesel and petrol of 15 to 20 cent, which was done only last week.

Our response here has been much greater than the response in Northern Ireland, and by Sinn F&eacute;in in particular.  It is pertinent to make that point given the contrast between what Sinn F&eacute;in does in the North, where it has to make decisions, and what it calls for south of the Border, where it does not have to make decisions, make anything add up, or even know whether something is legal.  That contrast is apparent to anyone.<\/p>  <p>  Of course the Government will give consideration to further actions we can take to help people and businesses with their bills.  However, we need to be honest with people.  We have already set aside &euro;1 billion to reduce the cost of energy.  That is already happening.  We have to see what we can do beyond that that is affordable.  There are many other demands on the public purse, as people will know.  The budget is still in deficit so we have to bear that in mind as well.  We also have to consult with the European Commission and our European partners because the VAT directive does not allow us to do what the Deputy has called for, which would have to be agreed at European level.  As the Deputy will have learned a few weeks ago, what she has called for in the context of excise is also not possible because of the energy tax directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200004#B00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1647957900,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Yes, this is global.

I would like the T&aacute;naiste to clarify that that is not the case and that the Government is going to do more.  I have given the T&aacute;naiste two concrete proposals on VAT and the excise duty on home heating oil.  Both of these things can be done.  The proposal in respect of VAT would have to be done in conjunction with the European Commission, but the T&aacute;naiste should bear in mind that as far back as October 2021, and then again this month, the European Commission was very clear that it was providing toolkits to allow member states to intervene in precisely the way I am outlining.<\/p> <p> I asked the T&aacute;naiste to ensure the removal of VAT and of all excise on home heating oil.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, there is excise on home heating oil.  The homework has been done on that on this side of the floor.

The suffering of the Ukrainian people is increasing with every passing day as Putin&rsquo;s campaign of terror intensifies.  We also agree that the unprecedented exodus of refugees from Ukraine demands an unprecedented response by this State.  It is being reported that up to 200,000 refugees, and potentially even more, could ultimately seek safety in Ireland.  That is a number that would pose truly unprecedented challenges.  While we must do everything we can to ensure we can help as many people as possible, it is important that detailed and clear plans are put in place to enable us to do so.  I fully acknowledge that the situation is fast-moving and in flux but I hope the T&aacute;naiste is in a position to update the House on some of those preparatory plans and I have a number of questions in that regard.<\/p><p>Is a single Government Department and a single Minister going to lead on the national response?  Numerous Government Departments will clearly be involved so will there be a cross-departmental task force established to co-ordinate the overarching Government response?  Responses in local areas are terrific but they must be also co-ordinated to ensure refugees are receiving the necessary treatment services and entitlements and that these are similar, regardless of in what part of the country they are housed.  For example, the Community Call initiative linked local and national government with the community and voluntary sectors and it provided an effective network.  It worked extremely well during Covid.  Will that be revived to streamline local responses?<\/p><p>I commend the generosity of the tens of thousands of Irish people who have volunteered to house refugees but a huge amount of additional supply will be required.  Today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>has reported that a nationwide sweep of vacant houses is being undertaken, with estate agents being asked to identify units.  While I regret that such a proactive approach to identifying vacant housing was not taken previously, I welcome that the Government is finally acting in this regard.  It is reported that owners of hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation, community centres and properties of religious orders are also being approached.  Can the T&aacute;naiste advise the House how many rooms or properties the State is attempting to acquire?  It is also being reported that emergency planning powers will be used to provide emergency accommodation.  Can the T&aacute;naiste advise if locations for this emergency accommodation have been identified and the nature of the accommodation envisaged?  For example, will it be modular housing or some other type of emergency housing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200005#C00300","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1647958800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>As of this morning, more than 10,000 Ukrainians had arrived in Ireland and registered for international protection.  We expect that number will rise to 20,000 by the end of the month.  It is reasonable to assume that figure will probably hit approximately 40,000 by the end of next month, although nobody can know for sure.  What we are seeing is effectively a 1% increase in our population in the course of a few weeks.  That is going to have serious impacts on education, healthcare, housing, social protection, the public finances and even on things like greenhouse gas emissions.  Absolutely all calculations change when the population increases by 1% or 2% in the course of a few weeks.<\/p>  <p>  To put this in context, when homelessness was at its worst, we had about 10,000 people in emergency accommodation.  We have approximately 7,000 people in direct provision at present.  We now have 10,000 Ukrainians seeking international protection.  That figure will probably be 20,000 by the end of the month and 40,000 by the end of the following month.  This is the scale of the crisis we are dealing with.  I need to be honest with the House and the Irish people: it will not be possible to provide what we would like to provide, namely, self-catering, own-door accommodation for everyone in the space of a few weeks or even a few months.  This will be a very difficult crisis to deal with.  Every country in Europe will be in the same boat in having to provide as good accommodation as we possibly can given the circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The response is being led by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and involves a number of Departments including the Departments of Education, Social Protection, Justice, Foreign Affairs and Health.  There is a cross-Government group that involves almost every Department.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of hotels, so far we had managed to retain 2,260 rooms as of 19 March for 4,341 people.  County councils have in the region of 1,800 emergency beds that they can mobilise.  Large venues are being identified, including the Green Glens Arena in Millstreet, Citywest, and Gormanston.  The latter is owned by the Defence Forces and accommodation will be provided there, although, unfortunately, it will be very basic accommodation.  We have approximately 20,000 pledges from members of the public who are offering to provide accommodation.  That effort is being led by the Irish Red Cross.  Of these 20,000 pledges, for which we are very grateful to the public for its generosity in making those pledges, 4,000 are for independent own-door units or vacant properties.  They are being assessed and we hope to bring them into use as soon as possible.  That is the priority.  After that, we will move on to people who can offer a spare room, particularly those with access to public transport.<\/p>  <p>  That is the response we are dealing with at the moment.  It is an enormous crisis.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, was in Poland a few days ago and he will tell Deputies what he experienced.  Entire conference and exhibition centres there are being used to accommodate millions of refugees.  The scale of what we are going to have to deal with is unprecedented in our experience, but it will not be on the scale of what other European countries are experiencing.  We will just have to do our best in the coming weeks, be as generous as we can and provide as good a standard of accommodation as we can.

Cancer does not distinguish between location, age, status or circumstances.  Cancer makes its own rules.  Sadly, this year, almost 45,000 people will hear the news that they have cancer and their journey will begin.  Sadly, that journey will take them down the road of endless hospital and medical appointments.  It will also take them down roads with obstacles that only reveal themselves as their journey progresses.  Very soon, cancer patients will discover that their illness is not the only challenge they face.  They must also contend with the costs associated with their treatment, which can be as high as &euro;1,000 per month.  The everyday costs associated with a cancer diagnosis have been raised many times.  The financial struggles at a time when a person can be at his or her most vulnerable are a burden he or she should not have to carry.<\/p>  <p>  What is not generally known is that a cancer diagnosis can present a lifelong financial burden for patients long after they have recovered.  New research from the Irish Cancer Society has revealed that many people affected by cancer at any time during their lives face being refused financial products, which include both insurance and mortgage protection cover.  Even if the adult individual was diagnosed with cancer as a child or teenager, he or she can still face challenges when trying to access financial protection for the future.  People who have a cancer diagnosis in their past are three times more likely to have difficulties getting insurance than the general population.  They are twice as likely to have problems obtaining a mortgage.  It seems that their past diagnosis is being used as a stick to beat them financially.  Despite the fact that more and more people are now cancer survivors, they continue to be discriminated against.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Cancer Society is calling on the Government to implement the right to be forgotten into legislation in order that people do not have to declare a cancer diagnosis five years after recovery.  This has been implemented by many other European Union countries.  People who have been diagnosed with cancer in the past are simply asking that their future lives are not defined by cancer.  They have completed their cancer journey.  They have navigated the endless issues that cancer patients face and struggled with the loss of income due to an inability to work.  Many do not qualify for a medical card, which subjects them to hospital charges, the cost of travel and parking and many other associated bills.  Many have had the pressure and embarrassment of debt collectors arriving at their doors demanding payment for unpaid medical expenses.  Their journey with cancer itself may be over.  They have been blessed to have survived.  Penalising them further is both cruel and heartless.  They deserve the right to forget.  Will the T&aacute;naiste please enable a Government decision to grant them this right?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200007#E00400","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1647959400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I acknowledge Deputy Lowry for raising this important issue and for his ongoing advocacy for people who have cancer and those who have survived it.

The five-year net survival for all invasive cancers averaged 65% for diagnoses between 2014 and 2018.  This is a substantial increase from only 42% in the 1990s.  We are now in a situation in Ireland where a person is more likely to survive cancer than die from it, and there are more cancer survivors than people who have cancer.  That is an important step in the right direction.<\/p>  <p>  Treatment for our medical oncology, radiation oncology and surgical oncology services also continues to improve, with an estimated 200,000 people living with and beyond cancer in Ireland.<\/p> <p> On the issue the Deputy raised in regard to insurance, I want to acknowledge that this a real problem and it is being considered by the Government at the moment.  I also have to acknowledge that insurance is ultimately about the calculation of risk.  That is how premiums are calculated, but they must be calculated in a way that is fair.  I also want to acknowledge the sensitivity of the matter and to assure the Deputy that officials are now engaging with stakeholders and colleagues across Europe to better understand how they have dealt with this issue.  We are aware of the Irish Cancer Society&rsquo;s report, The Right to be Forgotten beyond cancer: Access to financial products and services, which was published in February.  The Government is also aware that a number of EU member states have implemented such a policy.  On foot of that, officials are now examining the approach taken in these jurisdictions.  It appears to be inconsistent across jurisdictions.  It is done differently, in different ways, so we now need consider what might work best in an Irish context.<\/p> <p> The issue is also being considered at an EU level.  The European Commission&rsquo;s Beating Cancer Plan includes an initiative to address fairer access for cancer survivors to financial services, including insurance, via a code of conduct and a reflection on long-term solutions.

While Ireland does not rely on Russia for gas or oil, the situation remains volatile and subject to upward pressures for as long as the conflict continues.<\/p> <p> All we have seen from the Government is it telling us we should use more and more electricity and, at the same time, it is doing less and less about producing it.  It shut Bord na M&oacute;na, it is telling people they cannot go to the bog to save their own turf and that it does not want them to cut timber, and it is pandering to the green agenda continuously.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have sold their souls to the Green Party.  They stand for absolutely nothing now and the people are no longer saying it is only the Green Party.  They are saying Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are only dancing to the Green Party tune.  An LNG plant would provide security during a transition period, and once the time comes to move to away from natural gas, the terminal could be repurposed.  Instead, the Government is going along with this agenda, as I outlined.<\/p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste stands in the Chamber and treats people with contempt, because he is saying nothing of any meaning to them.  He answered Deputy McDonald earlier and said nothing in response to a sound question.  I am going to ask him a straight question.  Is he going to come in here in the month of May, and are his backbenchers going to come in here in the month of May, and seriously tell the people the Government is going to impose further carbon taxes on them, which will further increase the cost of their oil, further increase the cost of their electricity and make it harder for them to make ends meet and to clothe their children, send them to school, heat their homes and travel to and from work?  Is the T&aacute;naiste just going to deny them the right to live, quite simply because he is following the green agenda, because he sold his soul to the Green Party to become T&aacute;naiste and to become Taoiseach?  It is a case of anything for power; power at all costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200008#F00500","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647960600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I believe the record will reflect I gave a substantive reply to Deputy McDonald, to Deputy Shortall and to Deputy Lowry-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200009#G00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647960600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1647960600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The fact the Deputy did not like or understand the reply is more of a reflection on him than it is on me, quite frankly.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the programme for Government, it is there in black and white.  Anyone can read it.  It is clear what the programme for Government states on LNG, and that programme for Government was approved after a democratic vote by the Oireachtas Members of my party, our councillors and our members, and everyone in Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  Everyone in the three parties was very aware of what they were signing up for when they personally voted for that programme for Government, which they did.<\/p>  <p>  There is currently a planning application lodged with respect to the proposed LNG terminal in Tarbert.  As I have said before in this House, the planning application is live and is with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If that terminal is granted planning permission and if the developers and promoters can build it, they can proceed and the Government will not block it.  However, we believe that the future, the future we stand for, when it comes to energy has to be about price stability and energy security.  We do not believe importing natural gas or fracked gas, or importing any fuel in fact, is going to provide us with energy security and price stability.  We are facing the problems we now face precisely because we have to import oil, coal and gas from Russia, the Middle East, Venezuela and other parts of the world.  It is not a good position to be in.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy seems to be advocating we should continue that forever.  We do not think that is right; things need to change.  We believe the future is in renewables, not in producing electricity from coal, oil, gas or turf but in producing offshore wind, which provides the electricity we need, coupled with interconnection, and turning offshore wind into hydrogen.  Hydrogen is the fuel of the future because it can replace natural gas, power trucks and be dispatchable, and can even be used in power plants instead of natural gas.  That is the vision we have, particularly for the Shannon Estuary and for sites such as Moneypoint, Foynes and Tarbert.  That is the solution, producing our own energy in that region along the Shannon Estuary, with renewable energy from wind backed up with batteries and interconnection, and turning it into hydrogen, which will turn us from being an energy importer to being an energy exporter.  That is the vision I have for Clare, Limerick and Kerry.  We should make energy something we produce and sell abroad, not something we invest in and just store.  That is why I stand for the future and the Deputy stands for the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200009#G00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1647960600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I am delighted the T&aacute;naiste gave the little dig that I stand for the past.

I am happy to stand in for the Taoiseach in making this statement.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council will meet in Brussels later this week, on 24 and 25 March.  That meeting will be followed by a meeting of the Euro Summit, which will also be held in Brussels.  This will be the third meeting of EU leaders within a month, and since Russia&rsquo;s brutal and illegal large-scale aggression and invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February.  Before turning to this week&rsquo;s European Council agenda, I will briefly update the House on these recent meetings, which were a special meeting of the European Council on 24 February and an informal meeting of the European Council in Versailles on 10 and 11 of March, as well as on the situation in Ukraine and Ireland&rsquo;s response to date.<\/p>  <p>  First, I will address the situation in Ukraine.  We are continuing to witness scenes of acute human suffering, significant civilian loss of life, large-scale destruction of the built environment, attacks on nuclear facilities, and repeated breaches of international law perpetrated by Russia in Ukraine.  More than 3.4 million people have left Ukraine since 24 February.  President Zelenskiy and members of his Government remain in the country, and continue to show formidable leadership in the most testing and difficult circumstances imaginable.  Last Wednesday, the Taoiseach spoke by phone with President Zelenskiy.  The President thanked Ireland for our continued humanitarian aid, shelter, global support and sanctions against Russia.  The Taoiseach assured him of our ongoing solidarity with his Government and people, including in the face of the enormous losses they have suffered. <\/p>  <p>  At least one Irish citizen has lost his life so far.  I refer to the tragic deaths of Pierre Zakrzewski and his colleague, Oleksandra Kuvshynova, who were killed while working as journalists.  In his call with the Taoiseach, President Zelenskiy also expressed his condolences on the loss of Pierre Zakrzewski.  I offer our deepest condolences to their families and loved ones, and to all who have been bereaved by this terrible war.  I strongly condemn the killing of journalists, without whom the world would not bear witness to Russia&rsquo;s actions and to the plight of the people of Ukraine since the outbreak of hostilities.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s primary objective is, and will remain, to see this war end.  Ireland stands ready to support any initiative that can deliver peace.  As we meet, war is continuing.  In response, Ireland and the EU are providing a range of urgent direct and indirect supports to Ukraine.  The EU has already agreed a package of &euro;500 million in military assistance for Ukraine.  Ireland constructively abstained on the lethal equipment packages, but will pay our full share and our funding will go to non-lethal elements.  As a specific contribution, we are also providing 10 tonnes of ready-to-eat meals and 200 units of body armour to the Ukrainian defence forces.  The EU is likely to consider an additional package of assistance in the period ahead.  Ireland will again contribute in line with our policy and commensurate with our responsibility.  Ireland is also providing &euro;20 million in humanitarian aid, as well as medical supplies.  We are continuously assessing the best means by which we can practically and politically support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has welcomed Ukraine's application for EU membership.  EU leaders have acted swiftly and have asked the European Commission to submit its opinion on Ukraine's application without delay.  EU leaders agreed in Versailles to take the steps available in the meantime to strengthen the bonds and deepen the partnership between the EU and Ukraine.  Ultimately, as well as bringing an end to this war as soon as possible, we must also pursue accountability for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law during the conflict.  In the immediate term, Ireland&rsquo;s focus remains on meeting the humanitarian needs of those caught in the midst of violence.<\/p>  <p>  The widespread and generous response of the Irish public to the situation in Ukraine has been heartening, in the midst of the darkness of the crisis itself.  I was glad that across the country and the world, Irish people found creative and powerful ways to show solidarity with Ukraine in the context of marking St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  It delivered a strong message that we regard democratic and humanitarian values as being at the core of who we are as a people at home and as a diverse diaspora abroad.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach attended an informal meeting of the members of the European Council in Versailles on 10 and 11 of March.  Leaders adopted the Versailles Declaration, committing to protect citizens, values, democracies and the European model in the face of Russia&rsquo;s aggression against Ukraine.  Leaders were united in demanding that Russia cease its military aggression and withdraw unconditionally from Ukrainian sovereign territory.  They agreed that those responsible for the indiscriminate targeting of civilians must be held accountable, and welcomed the decision of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to open an investigation.  They welcomed the move to secure Ukraine&rsquo;s nuclear facilities with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency.<\/p> <p>They reaffirmed their commitment to the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine and to continuing to provide ongoing co-ordinated political, financial, material and humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine.  They also considered how to improve the EU's defence capabilities, including against hybrid and cyber threats.  In their declaration, they also set out how the EU will reduce its energy dependencies and reinforce its economic base.  Leaders addressed the importance of reducing strategic dependencies in critical sectors, to make Europe better able to achieve both a green and digital transition.  EU leaders committed to phasing out dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports as soon as possible.  This will require an acceleration of efforts to decarbonise our economies, as well as taking steps to diversify sources of energy supplies and improve gas storage.  EU leaders will return to these issues at their meeting later this week.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, will elaborate further on this in his closing remarks.<\/p> <p> In the period since that meeting, the Taoiseach has also discussed the ongoing situation in Ukraine with a number of world leaders.  While in London on 13 March, the Taoiseach met with the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and emphasised the strength and unity of the EU response.  The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister welcomed the close collaboration between the EU, the UK and other partners to hold Russia to account, provide support to Ukraine and address the humanitarian needs of its people, noting that in an uncertain world, the EU and the UK are key partners underpinned by shared values.<\/p> <p> During his visit to Washington DC on 17 March, the Taoiseach and President Biden discussed the situation in Ukraine, noting that the appalling events there are a reminder that freedom and democracy can never be taken for granted.  Both agreed on the importance now of standing firm in support of the people of Ukraine, and agreed to work together bilaterally at the UN to defend shared democratic values wherever they are now under threat.  The Taoiseach also discussed the situation in Ukraine with Vice President Harris, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.  In each of these discussions, there was a shared determination to work together tirelessly to bring an end to this terrible war.<\/p> <p> I will now look ahead to the agenda for the European Council on Thursday and Friday of this week.  I will address the agenda items dealing with Ukraine, security and defence, Covid-19 and EU external relations.  In his wrap-up, the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, will address the agenda items on energy, economic issues, the euro summit and external relations.  Given the sharp rise in energy prices, including as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, the discussion of the issue by leaders is important and especially timely.  When they meet this week, EU leaders will discuss Ukraine from a range of perspectives, namely, humanitarian, migration, energy, nuclear security and safety and reconstruction.  They will also meet with US President Joe Biden, which will be a useful early opportunity to follow up on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s discussions with him in Washington last week.<\/p> <p> On security and defence, EU leaders plan to adopt the Strategic Compass, which is a strategy document that will provide enhanced political direction for the European Union&rsquo;s approach to security and defence policy for the next five to ten years.  Ireland has always engaged constructively in the development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy, guided by our traditional policy of military neutrality and our contribution to crisis management and peacekeeping.  That continues to be the case.  We have played an active role in shaping Strategic Compass, working to ensure that it reflects the core values that underpin our approach to Common Security and Defence Policy, including our commitment to the UN and the rules-based international order.  The text of Strategic Compass sets out the significant security and defence challenges faced by the EU, including existing and emerging threats, the increasingly contested multi-polar world and the strategic implications for the EU.  It provides a strategic perspective for the next decade and sets out the tools and initiatives required to: enable the European Union to act more quickly and decisively when facing crises; secure our interests and protect our citizens by strengthening the EU&rsquo;s capacity to anticipate and mitigate threats; stimulate investments and innovation to jointly develop the necessary capabilities and technologies; and deepen our co-operation with partners, including the UN, which is at the core of international peace and security, to achieve common goals.<\/p> <p> While work began on Strategic Compass some months back, the text also reflects the immediate security situation following Russia&rsquo;s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine.  We welcome in particular the strong focus on efforts to develop the EU&rsquo;s capacity to counter hybrid threats and cyberattacks.  As we know from our own experience in Ireland, such threats are faced by all 27 member states and are best tackled in close co-operation with one another.<\/p> <p> Different member states have different traditions and approaches in the area of security and defence.  For us, that is our traditional policy of military neutrality.  That position is fully understood and respected by our partners.  We remain clear that our active participation in the Common Security and Defence Policy does not prejudice the specific character of our security and defence policy or our obligations.  The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces has given the Government some timely recommendations to consider on Ireland&rsquo;s own security and defence capability, which are being given careful consideration at this time.<\/p> <p> Covid-19 has been a standing item on the agenda of the European Council and EU leaders will again take stock of the epidemiological situation across Europe.  Their focus will be on co-ordinating efforts in response to the pandemic as well as strengthening pandemic prevention, preparedness and responses.  While Omicron remains the dominant variant and is highly transmissible, thankfully it does not seem to cause the same degree of threat as previous variants.  Member states have taken the opportunity to ease restrictions and shorten the isolation and quarantine periods for close contacts.  Case numbers are again on the rise in a number of member states, including Ireland.  As a result, we must remain collectively vigilant against this deadly disease, which continues to circulate in our communities.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, will later address energy, economic issues, and external relations.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; s&eacute; l&eacute;irithe ag an Aontas Eorpach, agus againne in &Eacute;irinn, ar&iacute;s agus ar&iacute;s eile go dtaca&iacute;mid go daingean leis an &Uacute;cr&aacute;in agus lena saor&aacute;naigh.

This is a very important summit.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on two pressing matters that will, as the Minister set out, dominate discussions, namely, the invasion by Russia of Ukraine and energy costs.  I also extend our best wishes to the Taoiseach.  I very much hope he will make a speedy recovery from the virus and will soon return to work.<\/p>  <p>  I also extend our total and unwavering solidarity to the people of Ukraine, who bravely stand and fight for their country.  The actions of Russia are illegal and unjust and no country should be subjected to the kind of military aggression faced by Ukraine.  The priority must be to end this invasion and to secure a full Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory.  This war must stop.  To this end, we need economic sanctions to be strengthened again at this meeting of the European Council.  We hope our Government will press for a maximalist position and not for incremental advances.<\/p>  <p>  There also has to be a step up in the diplomatic response to this Russian aggression.  The Government has resisted any calls for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador from Dublin.  It indicated some time back that it would do something else by way of applying greater diplomatic pressure.  As we speak, I am unclear as to what those actions were or might be.<\/p> <p>We are clear, however, that Russia's diplomatic footprint must be challenged and addressed in Ireland and across the European Continent.  The unfolding humanitarian crisis, which we see on our television screens day after day and night after night, demands action from all of us.  Yesterday I visited The Address Connolly in my constituency, a hotel where more than 600 Ukrainian refugees are in residence.  It is quite something to see men, women in particular, and children of all ages, up to and including teenagers, taking refuge in the heart of our city.  They are in the warm embrace of the Dublin people but they are so dislocated from their families and lives.  It is utterly devastating.<\/p> <p> We have to play our part and I have no doubt that we will do so but we need a plan.  As I said earlier, we need to see the detail of how we will accommodate people and how all of this will work in practice.  We also need to see further action from Government to ensure that hard-pressed families, workers and consumers are protected from price hikes, which have already wreaked havoc on the budgets of households across the land.  I said to the T&aacute;naiste earlier, and I wish to reiterate, that we need to see a relaxation of EU VAT rules so that we can reduce energy bills.  On 13 October 2021 the European Commission launched its toolbox for action and support to tackle rising energy prices.  Among the measures outlined was an allowance to exempt temporarily or apply a reduced tax rate to vulnerable households on electricity, natural gas, coal and solid fuels under the energy taxation directive.  As the House will know, since the beginning of November Sinn F&eacute;in has called on Government to engage with the Commission on a special derogation to remove VAT on household energy bills, such as gas and electricity and there has to be action on home heating oil as well.  There was an exchange of views on whether or not there are excise duties on home heating oil or not but there are and they need to be removed without further delay.  The Council meeting, therefore, takes place at a time of huge challenges all around.  The greatest challenge for Europe and the Ukrainian people is the humanitarian challenge but we should not forget that citizens here are struggling badly and that we need action to address this.<\/p> <p> I mention the strategic compass and the future of European defence.  I would like to record that historically there has not been a robust defence of Ireland&rsquo;s neutral position.  There has been a creeping disregard for that position and that is a mistake.  The position of Ireland as a militarily neutral country with an independent foreign policy is a great strength.  It is the very thing that will allow us to make our contribution on the international stage and that has ensured that Irish peacekeeping troops are the most effective in the world and are universally well-received.  This is a country with a past of colonial oppression, conflict, partition and latterly, peacemaking and that is the platform from which we can assert our voice on the global stage.  Any diminution of or move away from that position of neutrality would be strongly resisted by Sinn F&eacute;in and by the Irish people.  What if the neutral countries like Ireland had our place set out in the basic law of the European Union and in the treaties?  That is what we should be looking for.  We should be looking to exert our full strength and to assert our full voice.  We should not resile from that position, particularly now, when we again learn the hard lesson that this world with hyper powers and nuclear weapons can be a very dangerous place and that in the end it is men, women in particular, and their children who suffer most and who flee for their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200018#Q00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647966600,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Today we are forced to watch on at the Russian attempt to grind the sovereign State of Ukraine into submission.  The unspeakable horrors being experienced by the Ukrainian people have shaken the global community to the core.  The ongoing tragedy for Ukraine is that, as the Russian strategy becomes clearer and its depravity more apparent, Mariupol will not be the only city that will come under this onslaught.  Its name now sits along with Guernica, Dresden and countless other sites of suffering in modern consciousness as a testimony to the consequences of the deliberate targeting of civilian populations in war.  There is good reason to believe that these crimes will form part of the International Criminal Court&rsquo;s investigation into Russia&rsquo;s criminal aggression against Ukraine.  The ending of this senseless war must be the foremost priority for Ireland, the EU and the international community.  While we continue to support the Ukrainian people in their resistance to the Russian invasion, every possible effort must be made to end the violence.  While negotiations to date have achieved nothing of note, at some stage Vladimir Putin must understand that he has to engage in a real dialogue with President Zelenskiy.<\/p>  <p>  I have some concerns regarding announcements over the last few days surrounding the EU strategic compass, following which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Deputy Coveney, indicated that Ireland may well play a significant role in the EU rapid reaction force.  While others have spoken of the need for a conversation to take place about Irish neutrality, I believe in the centrality of neutrality to Irish foreign policy, in its contribution to our sense of identity as a nation and in how it has allowed us, as a small country, to make a major impact in peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts across the world.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the Committee on European Union Affairs hosted the Ambassador of Moldova, among other ambassadors.  Moldova is a very poor country and its ambassador appealed for greater assistance from the international community and from the EU to deal with the large influx of Ukrainian refugees there.  I welcome the fact that Ireland has agreed to take in 500 refugees from Moldova but more needs to be done to lift the burden on Moldova, which is experiencing massive difficulties and challenges in trying to deal with the influx.  This war has the potential to spread internationally because many countries in Africa are at risk of famine due to their heavy reliance on wheat and other goods coming from Russia and Ukraine.  There are serious challenges for us in Ireland and across the EU but we also need to look at the rest of the world, including Africa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200019#R00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1647966600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I begin, as I have done in most of our debates on European Council statements, by decrying the shortage of time we have.  It is not in accordance with the commitments we made after the Lisbon Treaty.  All of the normal debates, issues and challenges faced at the European Council which we normally debate in this Chamber beforehand, have been eclipsed in the last four weeks following the illegal and unprovoked war of extermination launched by Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s Russia against the people of Ukraine.  The world, and especially Europe, has changed and nothing will be the same again.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the next phase of sanctions that are to be taken and I wish I had more time to deal with them in detail.  With the few minutes I have I want to address our short-term and immediate response to this humanitarian crisis which has resulted from the displacement of unknown quantities of human beings within Ukraine and across Europe.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland we may well be on the edge of Europe but it is expected that we will welcome up to 200,000 refugees here and we must prepare for that.  Most importantly, we must be ready today, tomorrow and the next day to receive and properly look after desperate and traumatised people arriving on our shores but I do not believe we are ready.<\/p> <p>In particular, I want to reference my home constituency and the port of Rosslare.  In a most welcome and generous act, Stena Line is offering free passage aboard its ferries to Ukrainian refugees who seek refuge in Ireland.  Yesterday, more than 180 people arrived in Rosslare availing of that facility.  Another Stena Line vessel is due to arrive from Cherbourg on Thursday, and an even larger vessel, the <i>Stena Estrid<\/i>, will arrive from Cherbourg on Saturday.  It is expected that many hundreds of people will be on board those vessels, hundreds of traumatised refugees seeking refuge in Ireland.  However, while there is an amazing amount of goodwill, from local volunteers trying to do everything they can to the local authorities desperately seeking accommodation and doing what they can, there is an absolute absence of co-ordination at the port.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to take action today in regard to co-ordinating a response.  We need to appoint a lead agency, as happened during the Covid crisis when the Army was in charge and marshalled the resources of Departments to good effect.  There is a variety of agencies and individuals desperately trying to do good but without that co-ordination.  The International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, needs a strong physical presence to meet those arriving who have no shelter.  Comprehensive Covid testing needs to happen because people are not being tested for Covid.  There are practical issues such as making payments.  It is taking hours to process people.  The Department of Social Protection is giving them cheques.  However, third-party cheques cannot be easily cashed by people who have no identification and do not speak English.  It is being facilitated now, because it was needed, by the local community bringing people to the local supermarket and providing them with a cashing facility.<br\/><br\/>Let us be practical about what we can do.  In short, there are so many issues, such as the situation with cars.  Dozens of cars are arriving but as soon as they drive off the ferries, they are not insured to drive on our roads.  What would happen in an accident?  We need to talk to the insurance companies this week in order to provide a solution to that.  We need to collectively recognise that our ports, in particular, are zones for war refugees, which is something we have never experienced in our lifetime.  The closest to this was at the start of the Troubles when there was mass migration across our Border.  I have many other suggestions to make from my experience.  We need to learn from these matters and act now.  That is my appeal.  I hope to be able to talk to Ministers directly to put resources in place to meet these matters that are happening this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200019#R00300","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647967200,"counter":156,"content":"<p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine will, no doubt, dominate the forthcoming meeting of the European Council.  We know it was the main issue considered at the special meeting of the Council held in Versailles on 10 and 11 March.  Russian actions are illegal, unprovoked and unjustified and constitute war crimes by any objective criteria.  There have been indiscriminate killings of civilians and attacks on buildings and critical infrastructure.  We are all horrified by the scenes we witness on our television screens every evening and by the enormous pain and suffering being visited on the Ukrainian people.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, with its unique history and tradition, must continue to press for an early cease fire and a negotiated settlement, however unrealistic this may seem at this time.  We must do this at the UN Security Council, at the Council of Europe, in the European Union and we should support the role of the International Criminal Court in this context.  Countries like Turkey, France, Germany and Israel are to be encouraged to continue their efforts to have a peace agreement put in place.<\/p>  <p>  It is entirely appropriate that the US President Joe Biden will attend the European Council meeting this week.  Democracy in the world is under serious threat.  Authoritarian regimes such as those in Russia and China challenge western liberal democracies.  The invasion of Ukraine ordered by Vladimir Putin has brought this conflict to a head in a stark way.  Recognising the threat to liberal democratic values in the world, President Biden hosted a democracy summit last December.  He has spoken about the battle between democracies and autocracies.  We know what side Ireland is on.  We are on the side of the West.  We advocate free trade as well as a rules-based international order and multilateral diplomacy.  I commend our Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, for the unambiguous stance he has taken in recent weeks on this global challenge.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has rightly imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia, but have we gone far enough?  I do not think so.  The EU imported an estimated &euro;12 billion worth of oil and gas from Russia since the start of the conflict.  It also imports large amounts of coal.  There are divisions within the EU on this matter.  Of course, there is a huge energy dependence on Russia in this regard and this certainly needs to be reduced, but the time has come to include energy supplies in EU sanctions and I welcome Ireland's stance on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of EU enlargement, we know that President Zelenskiy has asked for Ukraine's application for EU membership to be fast-tracked.  Ambassadors for Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova recently attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to make their case for membership.  North Macedonia and Albania are in the waiting room, as are Serbia and Turkey.  It is clear from the Versailles summit that some member states are resisting Ukraine's membership in the short term.  It seems that regional rivalries, unease in the western Balkans, and concerns about the scale and scope of EU budgets are issues of concern.  Ireland has and should continue to support enlargement as a general principle.  Enlargement is good for Ireland and it is good for the EU.  The process of accession has been too slow and cumbersome, and it is questionable whether the political will is there to encourage this.  I hope the European Commission will give a positive report to the summit this week on Ukraine's application.<\/p>  <p>  Increased fuel prices are affecting everyone in this country.  We are told that Ireland is seeking flexibility on the application of VAT on fuel.  We need to reduce VAT on fuel to below its current lower rate of 13.5%.  I also hope the European Commission will respond positively to this request at the forthcoming summit.<\/p>  <p>  It seems a bit academic or even indulgent to be engaging in a debate on Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality while innocent civilians are being killed in towns and cities across Ukraine.  However, a debate is inevitable given the dramatic events in Europe in recent weeks and the realisation that things have changed, and changed utterly.<\/p>  <p>  From a legal point of view, we need to first examine the EU treaties, specifically the Lisbon treaty, as well as the Constitution.  A protocol to the Lisbon treaty states that the treaty \"does not affect or prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality.\"  Article 29(4)(9) of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, which was added following the defeat of the first Lisbon treaty referendum, states that \"The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union where that common defence would include the State.\"  Article 42 of the Lisbon treaty makes provision for a mutual assistance clause.  They are the legalities but we need to begin with the fact that we are members of the universal collective security organisation known as the United Nations, as well as the European Union.  Therefore, any pure notion of neutrality is compromised from the start.  We are not part of a military alliance, specifically NATO.  Although we participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace, we should not contemplate NATO membership.<\/p>  <p>  It is also fair to say that we are not politically neutral, as our response to the Ukraine invasion clearly demonstrates.  We need to be fully involved in proposals for a new EU common security and defence policy following the Ukraine invasion.  As regards Ukraine, so far Ireland, in the EU, has collectively agreed to tough sanctions and has provided humanitarian assistance as well as non-lethal equipment through the European peace facility.<\/p> <p>We participate in EU Battlegroup and Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, missions and pay into the European defence fund.  We are also involved in the proposed rapid reaction force and we signed up to the strategic compass at a meeting of the foreign affairs ministers in Brussels this week.<\/p> <p> As a general principle, we should participate in specific missions that are compatible with our traditional peacekeeping role.  We should have the ability to opt in or out of missions and we should draw a distinction between EU and non-EU territories as necessary.  I also believe we need to be able to defend and arm our neutrality.  We have the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, and I look forward to the Minister presenting his proposals in this regard in the coming months.  A debate on Irish neutrality can and should take place in due course.  It is too early to say if a referendum is needed, having regard to the constitutional provisions which I referred earlier, but a referendum on the issue is certainly not needed now.<\/p> <p> Finally, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has demanded a huge humanitarian response to the consequent refugee crisis.  So far, almost 10,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Ireland and they are most welcome, but they require accommodation and other essential supports.  This is a challenge that requires a whole-of-government response and cross-departmental action.<\/p> <p> There is also a huge refugee crisis on Ukraine&rsquo;s borders.  I welcome the &euro;20 million provided so far by the Irish Government for humanitarian assistance in the region as well as the &euro;11 million provided through the EU mechanism for practical help in Ukraine.  Ambassadors from Poland, Romania, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine attended our meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs earlier this month.  They outlined for us in stark terms the refugee crisis they are facing in their countries.  We were in awe of their response and the support they are being given by the governments in those countries.  Certainly, the EU and Ireland should do everything possible to assist them in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200020#S00200","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647967800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s tradition of military neutrality is an honourable one.  Unfortunately, too many governments have missed the opportunity it provides.  Despite the huge respect our UN peacekeepers, the blue helmets, have attained across the world, and despite the role in conflict resolution those of us in Ireland have played in Sri Lanka, Colombia, the Middle East and the Basque Country, the opportunity has been repeatedly wasted.  We have had a half-hearted approach to military neutrality from the parties that sit across the Chamber for far too long.  They have actively undermined it in the approach to Shannon Airport, for example, for so many years.  They have not believed in it.  It was there in words but not in practice.<\/p>  <p>  It is an honourable tradition.  It comes from us being victims of empire for so long and rejecting any military alliances that give any support for that type of imperialism or empire-building approach.  It means that we have the opportunity to play a role in conflict resolution around the world and actively seek out that position internationally.  I do not believe we have ever done that, really.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps we could be playing a far more considerable role right now, for example.  We have a seat on the UN Security Council.  That seat was won, in my opinion and that of many others, because of our position of military neutrality.  Governments across the floor of this Chamber have wasted the opportunity for far too long, however.  There needs to be a passionate embracing of that policy and a backing up of the role of our UN peacekeepers and many superb diplomats and peacebuilders we have had over the years.<\/p>  <p>  We have had experience of conflict resolution in the last 20 years.  It is ongoing on this island but we have not utilised it enough.  Indeed, the people who were involved in that peace process are the people who went to Sri Lanka, Colombia, the Basque Country and the Middle East.  To a lesser extent, our own governments were formerly involved in it, even though we are militarily neutral.  We are not politically neutral, though.  We can condemn and stand up against wanton acts of brutality such as we have seen from the Russian Government in recent times.  We can support sanctions and support confronting this across the world.  We can do all that and maintain military neutrality.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the debate on military neutrality.  I welcome also challenging those who did not stand by it for far too long.  They talked about it but they never stood by it.  They never delivered the full potential of it internationally.  They left it to others who were involved in peacebuilding on this island to fulfil the role of conflict resolution and that is the reality.  They also did not build on the huge respect, and I will say it again, for our UN peacekeepers - our blue helmets, the thousands of Irish men and women who kept the peace around the world because we are militarily neutral.  The Government failed them by not building on it.  It failed those involved in the peace process in this country by not building on it, and now it appears it is going to fail again in this moment in which we could play a much more constructive role in peacebuilding and bringing this conflict to an end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200021#T00200","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1647967800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I just came from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in which we had a presentation from D&oacute;chas, the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, and others.  It was a really sobering and genuinely terrifying presentation.  I wanted to wait until I heard some of the testimonies from those witnesses on the ground in Ukraine and elsewhere before I came into the Chamber for statements on the European Council meeting.<\/p>  <p>  I will begin with the figure we heard several times today during different debates of the 10 million Ukrainians who will become refugees; 3.5 million of whom will move throughout European borders and elsewhere and 6.5 million of whom will be internally displaced.  The scale of that is of a magnitude we cannot even comprehend.  We then get into the detail of the first wave of refugees from Ukraine being people who had the means to go elsewhere, potentially because they had family, could travel and could support themselves as they did so.  That is the first wave of refugees we have seen.  It is the first wave of refugees who arrived here and elsewhere.  They were extraordinarily welcomed and we need to make sure we meet their needs in any way we can.<\/p>  <p>  I also heard today about the 6.5 million internally displaced refugees in Ukraine currently and the sociodemographic make-up of that particular group.  They are people who are predominantly older and less well-off.  They are the people who would not have access to different languages.  They do not have supports in other jurisdictions.  As they slowly make their way across the border in terror, fleeing bombardment as they do so, their needs will be greater and even more complex.  As they make their way to Poland, Romania, Moldova and elsewhere, the European Union needs to be able to meet them but countries also need to be able meet their needs as they take them in.  That will be a more complex group.  That is really important to say.<\/p>  <p>  There remains great uncertainty in terms of what happens next and how this will affect the flow of aid into Ukraine and other friendly neighbouring countries.  To date, neighbouring countries that received refugees have done so in the spirit of camaraderie, solidarity, humanity, co-operation and kinship.  However, they are working around the volunteer support shown by the public, local business, churches, schools and universities.  This all needs to be co-ordinated.  The European Union has a done a great job in welcoming people but now there needs to be a greater co-ordination in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  As I listened to testimonies from that group of people who are making their way towards borders, I was very conscious of the impact the war in Ukraine will have on global food shortages and those who will be most impacted by that.  Ukraine has become the breadbasket of the world, particularly in terms of Africa.  Ukraine and Russia account for 30% of global wheat exports, 20% of global maize exports and 76% of sunflower oil supplies.  Any disruption in production or supply could drive prices up, affecting millions already hard hit by high food inflation in their own countries.  The conflict has brought shipments from Ukraine to a halt and paused Russian grain deals, and created uncertainty around sanctions.  An estimated 13.5 million tonnes of wheat and 16 million tonnes of maize are frozen in two countries - 23% and 43% of their expected exports in 2021 and 2022.  The majority of that was going to places in Africa.<\/p>  <p>  At each previous pre-European Council statements debate, I raised the issue of vaccine inequity in terms of people in the developing world who have not been able to access vaccines to the same extent we have.<\/p> <p>Global food supply shortages were already going to be an issue.  Now, people who have not been able to access vaccines to the same extent that we have done will not be able to access food.  There is a horrific humanitarian catastrophe right on our doorstep.  This is the great global challenge of our time and we need to able to meet it.  <\/p> <p> To add even more doom to the scenario, in the Arctic yesterday the temperature was 30% above normal.  In the Antarctic, it was 40% above normal, because of climate change.  We have a humanitarian crisis on a scale that is incomprehensible.  This should be a great challenge of our time.  I cannot believe Members here are talking about a debate around our neutrality.  Our neutrality will not mean anything when climate change is suffocating not only us but the global world.  <\/p> <p> We talk about how Germany is investing once again in its military and in its arms shipments and supplies.  The European Union needs to be investing in its humanitarian budget to ensure that people in the global world are not starving.  While there needs to be an industrialisation, it cannot be an industrialisation of a military capacity.  It has to be an industrialisation based on humanitarian need, about how we get bread and wheat into people&rsquo;s mouths, as well as about how we remove ourselves from fossil fuel dependency. <\/p> <p> If, as we are constantly being told, and we are, in a wartime scenario, we require imagination.  It requires a vigour to change and to remove the old people of old.  Putin has his hands around our necks because we are depending on his oil and his gas.  The EU pays him to the tune of &euro;700 million per day.  We need to crush that.  Not only do we have a fear of him killing us quickly, he also has an impact on our global world through the impact that is having on the environment.  There is now a great chance to remove ourselves from these figures of old and to meet the greatest challenges of our time, which are climate change and hunger.  This all needs to happen in sequence.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200021#T00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647968400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>With the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, at the outset I would like to join others in this House and in the Seanad in marking the passing of David Hill on Saturday.  David tragically passed away on the rugby pitch while we were playing the annual Ireland versus Scotland parliamentary game.  It was an awful experience for all us who were present but, more pertinently, for David's friends, colleagues and his family, with whom I spent some time on Sunday.  I would like to pass on my own personal condolences to our colleagues in the Scottish Parliament.  I was lucky to play against him four or five times and to meet him many times.  I considered him a friend.  It was a tough loss.  Today is a tough day for many of us.<\/p>  <p> In respect of this debate, I would like to briefly address a couple of areas.  We have had most of the larger, wider philosophical discussions, such as about climate change and neutrality many times over.  I do not seek to repeat them.  Maybe there is a time when we will repeat them, but I have a few specific points and questions about the upcoming European Council meeting.  The Minister of State might be able to respond to them in due course.  <\/p>  <p>  I join with others in wishing the Taoiseach well for a fast and speedy recovery.  However, I am aware and cognisant that potentially, he will not be able to attend the meeting.  I am aware of the rulings of the European Council.  Can the Minister of State clarify which member state will be Ireland&rsquo;s voice at the European Council meeting when it takes place?  In due course, what will be in the memo to be sent forth from the Irish Government to that proxy about the position of the Irish Government regarding a couple of key issues that will need to be discussed at the European Council debate?  It will focus Russia's brutal war in Ukraine and the many facets that impact us here in the European Union.  Equally, it will focus on how we in the European Union react and respond to support the people of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be under no illusion.  The people of Ukraine are not just defending their country but at this stage, they are defending all of Europe from a violent and vicious aggressor who has invaded Europe in a manner and with means that are appalling.  As every day goes past and with every hour or two we spend watching this unfold on our television sets, online or in the print media, it is harrowing to see.  Munitions are being deployed on the civilian population and people are stating their belief that chemical weapons are now being used.  This is appalling.  It is war on scale that has not been seen on the European continent for some 70 years.  It is not good enough to simply condemn the matter.  It is not good enough to state our solidarity, to light up our buildings and to hang out our flags unless we continue, as much as is possible on a cross-party basis, to push the European Union to force a resolution in a form that is acceptable to the Ukrainian people. <\/p>  <p>  First, I come to yet another discussion on European sanctions, not just those on Russia, but also on their proxy in Belarus, in occupied Georgia, and in the supporting entities that are allowing them, particularly in occupied eastern Ukraine, to carry out this brutal and vicious war.  We have seen the European Union put unprecedented sanctions in place.  However, we have had to see four or five rounds of sanctions.  Yet, many of the measures that people were calling for from both sides of the House in terms of sanctions still have not been implemented.  Other member states, admittedly not Ireland, are blocking this and are being extremely duplicitous, for want of a better word, in their reaction to this.  It is absolutely galling.<\/p>  <p>  First there is the continuing need to end immediately the importation of Russian oil and gas into the European Union, to put the fullest extent of sanctions on the financial services sector and to target those oligarchs, their proxies and their shell companies located across the European Union.  We should continue use every European treaty possible to put pressure on non-European Union jurisdictions, such as Switzerland, that can make use of favourable terms and treaties with the Europeans to make these sanctions work.  This will turn off the supply chain, turn off the money tap and turn off the financial fuels of war the Russian Federation is using to mercilessly carpet-bomb the people of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of supports that are needed for the people of Ukraine, as well as those for the people of Ukraine who are putting up the resistance, we need talk about humanitarian aid and about military assistance.  We can all have a debate about that but I will not get into it today.  However, it is clear that while what has been allocated so far and the tranches that have been delivered have helped, they will not be enough.  We need a continuing European support.  I saw an interesting tweet by an MEP from Luxembourg today, from my own political family.  She said that today was the first day that she did not get a push notification from the media in Luxembourg about the war in Ukraine.  As we enter the 25th or 26th day of this Russian invasion of Ukraine, we cannot allow ourselves to lose focus and lose interest in ensuring that the sanctions and the response of the Irish Government, the Irish people and equally, of the European Union, cannot be allowed to wane.  This is because the intensity of the invasion is not waning.  The intensity of the fight and the pressures on the people of Ukraine are not waning.  There are 10 million Ukrainians who do not have a home any more and who are displaced.  These are numbers that we have not seen since the Second World War.  We cannot be allowed to get distracted, either by domestic political issues or by other international political issues. <\/p>  <p>  I was speaking to groups across the country over the past couple of days.  We are now seeing the impact of war starting to hit home for us on practical levels, such as in fuel prices, in food availability and in how we co-ordinate the humanitarian response to welcome Ukrainian refugees as guests into our country.  We cannot allow ourselves to be distracted from the certainty of purpose about why we are doing this, about how we doing this and what the response needs to be.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that this European Council meeting has to prepare not just a short-term response, but a medium- and long-term response.  I say this because this war will not end quickly.  The fallout from this war will not end quickly.  We will not saying that we can cater for refugees for the next couple of weeks or that this is the financial support to be provided for the next couple of weeks when this invasion could go on for weeks, months and God knows how much longer after that.  At the end of the day, if your house has been blown up, if your husband has been killed, if your son has been killed and if you have nowhere to go back to, you have to look to the European Union.  You have to look to the Irish Government, to the aid agencies and to the people of the countries of the European Union - particularly Ireland - for protection and for guidance through what will be a harrowing and traumatic period of time that none of us can comprehend to be quite frank with ourselves.<\/p>  <p>  We can talk about this in the abstract.  We can use that as a basis for a debate.  However, every single Member has had people who are originally from Ukraine or who are Ukrainian citizens living in our constituencies.  They have come to us and have looked for assistance in getting their family members out.  They have looked for assistance in pastoral support.  In the same way, families in our constituencies might be offering up a holiday home or their spare room.  This will not be a response for a couple of months.  Those families, both Irish families and Ukrainian families, will need a continuing response.  The response is not a normal one.  These people are fleeing the traumas of war.  Their lives have been crushed.  The sad news is that is only going to continue.  <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, my appeal is that this European Council does not take a short-term view.  They might now apply half the sanctions that many of us had been calling for three weeks ago, stop dilly-dallying and stop letting personal concerns get in the way.  Second, they should lay out a genuine two-year plan for how we deal with the fallout from this bloody, vicious war.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200022#U00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1647969000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>We have all made statements and some could argue they fall between being trite and overplaying the issue but this is one situation where we can say with hand on heart that the world has utterly changed.  We never thought we would be dealing with a case of 10 million displaced people, comprising 3.5 million who have left Ukraine and 6.5 million who have been internally displaced.  It is hard to believe that is modern-day Europe.  If someone had told us this a couple of weeks ago, I do not think we would have believed it but this is the world we are dealing with.  We are dealing with a particular type of Russian regime under Vladimir Putin.  Surrender threats have been directed at Mariupol and we have seen the action and the ordnance that has been used.  Many Members, including Deputy Brady, have spoken about how that city is to be added to the long list of places that have been hammered beyond recognition.  I refer, for example, to Grozny, Dresden, even Coventry in Britain and a large number of other areas.  We had never considered that we would see so many in Europe nowadays.  There are also places in Syria and Palestine that have suffered to the same degree, and I reiterate there has been a failure on the West's part to deal with these issues.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I get it.  First and foremost at this point, we are dealing with Russia.  We really need to get to the bottom of what is needed from the point of view of sanctions.  When the Ukrainian ambassador, Ms Larysa Gerasko, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, she spoke about the need to cut off the seaports and outlined how the Department of Foreign Affairs has been given a list of businesses that are still trading with Russia.  I accept that the world is complicated and interconnectivity in business and other matters is far more developed and intertwined than many of us had believed - Brexit gave us the first inclination in that regard - but we must do all we can.  It is not okay to allow a free flow of money to Russia and its proxies that allows for this war to be fought.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much talk about militarisation and my argument in that regard is that it does not serve a purpose for the EU to be further militarised.  Obviously, Ukraine wants to become part of the EU and we certainly do not want militarisation to become part of the negotiating gambit when we arrive, as I hope we will, at a time when straight and real negotiations take place to bring about a diplomatic end to this absolute horror, which will have a significant impact on those people who are suffering under the barrage of Russian ordnance but which will also have an impact throughout wider Europe.  Alongside the humanitarian response we need to get in place - I am not sure we have all our t's crossed and i's dotted, and we need to ensure we are hearing the concerns of local authorities - we need to ensure we have covered all the bases and that all the moneys that can be removed will be removed.  We must facilitate, insofar as possible, an end to this abject and absolute horror.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200023#V00100","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1647969000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Barry.<\/p>  <p>  The world is disgusted and revolted at what Vladimir Putin is doing, his bloody invasion and the imperialist logic behind it.  Rightly, people's hearts go out to the people of Ukraine and they want to show all the solidarity they can.  The best hope is that the resistance of the Ukrainian people, alongside the opposition of the Russian people to this bloody war, will bring it to an end and, with any luck, bring down the Putin regime.  Nevertheless, I just do understand why the response to this horror of the leaders of Europe, the United States and parties in this House, largely on the Government's side, seems to be to want to use this crisis to make an argument for spending more on weapons and putting ourselves closer to the NATO military alliance.  If that is the lesson one draws from this, our world is doomed.  This horror flows directly from the logic of the global arms industry and all the major powers building up terrifying military and nuclear arsenals and using them again and again.  Largely, the West has either ignored these horrors when they have happened elsewhere or, worse, actively colluded in them.  I refer, for example, to what Saudi Arabia has been doing in Yemen for the past five years, killing 330,000 people and bringing 14 million people, as we speak, to the brink of starvation.  Not only do we not sanction Saudi Arabia but we arm it, travel to the country on trade missions and say nothing about what it is doing.  We support Israel and allow it to bombard Gaza again and again, to steal its people&rsquo;s land and to demolish their homes, and then we expect that logic will not be pursued by other powers in the world.  Of course it will be.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, global arms expenditure has shot through the roof.  While we talk about housing, health, education and our ability to deal with humanitarian catastrophe, globally we are now spending $2 trillion a year on weapons and arms, and the countries that spend it are the United States, at 39% of it, China, India, Russia, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Germany and France.  They are all to blame for this madness.  If you build up nuclear and military arsenals, if you fight to control spheres of influence and if you back dictators or ignore their crimes, what do you expect is going to happen?  There are going to be wars, atrocities and brutal regimes such as Putin's.  The last thing we need to do, faced with this horror arriving on the doorstep of Europe, is to say we need more militarism.  We need to oppose militarism, full stop.  We need to oppose all dictatorships and that is what Irish military neutrality is about because it came from the Irish revolution.  It came from a revolution against an empire and against the First World War, to say we would not be part of this imperial madness but rather that we would stand against it and align ourselves with forces in the world that stand against war and empire.  That is what we should do today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200023#V00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1647969000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>The Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, has stated there is a good chance Ireland will be involved in the European rapid reaction force due to be operational by 2025.

While those discussions were heavy and solemn, it was not until I boarded that ferry and saw for myself the sad and exhausted faces of hundreds of Ukrainians, on the last leg of their harrowing and arduous journey, that I was struck most by the sheer horrible reality of what is unfolding before us.  I commend Stena Line, whose crew was extraordinarily attentive to the needs of those Ukrainians in their care on that journey.  Those I met on the ferry are the lucky ones, the ones who got away quickly or had the means to get away, and I hope they will find a new life in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>   Deputy Brian Leddin: At the weekend, I found myself on the ferry back from Sherbourg, France, to Rosslare.  I was returning from a series of meetings in Paris, where the challenges of the current crises, relating to energy, food security were discussed in depth, <\/p> <p>I thought I was alone when I watched on the large television in the lounge the scenes of destruction in Mariupol.  It was only when I went to leave I saw there was a woman sitting alone silently, tears streaming down her face.  I felt pain for her but I cannot imagine the pain she must have felt as she saw the wilful destruction of her country and the slaughter of her fellow Ukrainians before her very eyes.<br\/><br\/>Back in Ireland, I read yesterday the words of one of her countrywomen, Ms Nadezhda Sukhorukova, in Mariupol.  On her Facebook page, Ms Sukhorukova wrote:<\/p><blockquote>\tI'm sure I'm going to die soon.  That's a matter of days.  In this city, everyone is constantly waiting for death.  I just wish it wasn't so scary.  Three days ago, there was a direct hit into the fire department.  The rescuers have lost their lives.  One woman's hand, leg and head were torn off.  I dream of my body parts staying still, even after an air bomb blast.  I don't know why, but I think this is important. <\/blockquote> <p>This grim prospect is a real one for hundreds of thousands of people right at this very minute on the doorstep of Europe in a country that shares our values and wants to be one of us.  We have to hope that Ms Sukhorukova and her fellow citizens somehow survive but it seems there can be little hope of that as Putin's forces pulverise every square inch of Mariupol, where she and hundreds of thousands of others wait for their annihilation by Russian missiles or by the cold and starvation.  Ms Sukhorukova's words will be with us for as long we live, and should we, as legislators, as people with influence, not do what we can to bring an end to this suffering, we will bear the weight of these words.<br\/><br\/>Ten days ago, the Versailles declaration was signed by EU member states.  It stated, &quot;Russia's war of aggression constitutes a tectonic shift in European history.&quot;  Could it be more clear?  We in Ireland should understand this and understand that the positions we have taken in the past with respect to defence, security and neutrality simply have to be reviewed.  We may find that these positions no longer hold much water in the face of the tyranny we are seeing in Ukraine and the asymmetric warfare that has been unleashed.  Constructive abstention may be neither the strategic nor the morally correct position to hold.<br\/><br\/>Europe, as well as NATO and the global community, has faltered since the Versailles declaration.  We blinked.  Repeated appeals for a no-fly zone to be instituted over Ukraine and for increased sanctions have been rebuffed and Putin has pushed on.  At what point do we say, &quot;Enough is enough&quot;?  Do our values as a Union, our commitment to the rules-based order and to the protection of human life not extend to seeking to protect aspirant nations on our doorstep?  How is what we are seeing any different to what we saw in Poland in 1939 or in Yugoslavia in 1991?<br\/><br\/>Putin's end will come, hopefully sooner rather than later, but there is no possible end to the regime of Vladimir Putin that will do justice to the hundreds of thousands of victims of his terror.  Europe must ensure it does everything it possibly can to bring an end to their suffering.  It should stand up to the bully, the coward that is Vladimir Putin.<br\/><br\/>How prepared are we to do so?  Europe is providing funding to Ukraine's defence effort for lethal and non-lethal purposes and we have introduced unprecedented sanctions.  This is positive, but is it enough?  At the same time, we are funding Putin's war effort by purchasing his fossil fuels to the tune of &euro;1 billion per day.  The concept of the blood diamond is well understood.  This is blood oil and gas.<br\/><br\/>I have been saying in this House since I was elected two years ago that Ireland can provide clean energy, not only for its own needs but for Europe's needs also.  I have always said it in the context of our necessary decarbonisation process.  We have been and are going in the right direction for some time but, in my view, not as quickly as is possible or necessary.  We talk about the 5 GW of offshore wind that is in the pipeline but that is to meet our domestic demand.  The events of the past month, as much as the climate emergency, demand that we seek to exploit the at least 50 GW potential that is there, particularly off our south and west coasts.  We need to send a signal now, not next year, to the European Union and to the international renewables sector that we have this energy and we want to exploit it quickly.<br\/><br\/>From my meetings in Paris, I was not assured that our counterparts quite understand how Ireland can help Europe.  When the Taoiseach goes to the European Council, he should reiterate the Government's position that we see that liquefied natural gas, LNG, has no role for us here in Ireland.  There is no technical barrier to the development of a green hydrogen economy, with green hydrogen storage for generating power on those days and weeks that may occur, as the Germans call the <i>Dunkelflaute,<\/i>where demand is high but renewable generation is low.  It is a matter of policy, incentives and economics, all of which are within the gift of Europe and of Ireland to adjust so that we get the result that we need, that is, an energy system not dependent on fossil fuels and on autocrats such as Vladimir Putin.  We should spare no effort in pursuing this objective as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200023#V00400","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647969600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I want to be associated with all the words of solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  I want to use my limited time here today to talk about the challenges that are facing the food supply chains, not only in Ireland but across Europe.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome indications from the EU agriculture Commissioner that the Commission is set to deploy the &euro;500 million crisis reserve.  These funds must be delivered rapidly and to those farmers most in need.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in, for several weeks, has sought the deployment of this crisis funding as an important first step to deliver immediate supports to farmers who have been bearing the brunt of spiralling input costs but farmers, as well those in the broader agrifood supply chain who depend on them, urgently need clarity today as to what portion of the fund Ireland is set to receive and how it will be delivered to those who need the support most.  In recent weeks, farm organisations have called for &euro;90 million in funding for the Irish pig sector alone.  That gives some indication as to the scale of the intervention required across the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The response of the Government has lacked urgency.  There are actions that it could take that would go some way towards alleviating the current situation.  A substantial reduction on the excise on agri-diesel, including the carbon tax component, is required.  The promised review as to the status of farm contractors with regard to the carbon tax should also be completed urgently.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, should also engage with his EU counterparts to secure reductions in anti-dumping tariffs on products such as fertiliser and to ensure that the discussion on wider supports starts this week.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission has shown flexibility on the planting of fallow land in 2022.  This is welcome, as we seek to maximise our own grain yield, but serious questions remain as to the potential impact this may have considering that the planting season has already commenced.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset of the invasion of Ukraine, Sinn F&eacute;in called on the European Commission to respond with a package for farmers negatively impacted by the sanctions on Russia and it is disappointing that in the weeks since then, the response from both Dublin and Government has remained unpointed, without direction and lacking entirely in detail.  The Commission has made it clear that it believes that any additional response to these ongoing crises rests within state aid and the Government should be equally clear that the Common Agricultural Policy, that is undermined by a poor EU budget which it agreed, has left member states in a difficult position and potentially facing a food security emergency.  As such, the response must be now EU led and consist of funding mechanisms that deliver for farmers and consumers.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is uniquely placed in that we have &euro;1 billion to access through the Brexit adjustment reserve which should be made available to farmers impacted by the withdrawal of Britain from the EU.  To date, farmers have not received a single cent of funding from that stream.  Instead, &euro;100 million was allocated to meat factories.  Urgent funding support is now required for farming families across the pig, beef, seed potato and horticultural sectors, as well as others.  Funding and taxation mechanisms exist, both at home and in Brussels, that would significantly alleviate the burden being borne by our farmers and ensure that the peoples across Europe can have one assurance in the times head, that is, that we will have adequate food to feed ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200024#W00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1647969600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak today.  The upcoming European Council meeting is probably one of the most important in our lifetime.  Not in the recent past have we faced such terrible aggression and challenging circumstances as those we are currently facing.  Putin and his army are causing life-changing damage to Ukraine and its people.<\/p> <p>What we are witnessing right now is beyond what words can adequately describe.  The killing and maiming of innocent men, women and children is beyond cruel.  It is a terrible indictment on all of us that this is happening and looks like continuing for the foreseeable future.<\/p> <p> If Putin gets his way in Ukraine, where is next on his list?  I have argued that diplomacy must be the answer and it is for this reason that Europe must be united, which it has been so far, in order to bring a peaceful solution to this crisis.  Unfortunately, every single one of us must suffer in the short term in order to stop this.  What I mean by this is that Russia continues to supply gas to Europe valued at &euro;250 million per day.  By us paying these vast sums to Putin, we are in effect helping to fund his terrible war effort.  The short term pain we must suffer now is that this valuable source of income for Putin must be stopped immediately.  We will all suffer because of this but we need to bring the reliance we have on Russian gas to an end.  If Putin did not have this source of funding, we can be sure that his war efforts could not be funded in the same way.  I know that the subject of Russian gas is on the agenda for the upcoming Council meeting and I urge the Minister to make the strongest possible case for severe restrictions on Russian gas and how Putin supplies it to Europe.  The bottom line is that if we can limit his supply of money, then we can limit his ability to wage war on innocent Ukrainians.<\/p> <p> I note also that President Biden will address the meeting.  It is important that the United States and Europe stand united in their approach to this crisis.  Obviously, the last thing anyone wants is for the crisis to involve more countries and develop into something bigger than it already is, but at the same time we cannot allow Putin and his threats to stop us from taking the necessary steps to end this aggression.<\/p> <p> One of the main reasons Putin was able to wage this aggression was the fact that he and his cronies have so much money tied up all around the world and have continued access to it.  In recent weeks, I raised the possibility that Russian money was being laundered through the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC, in Dublin.  Can the Minister give us an update on this?  Can he confirm that the Government has taken the necessary steps to ensure that the IFSC is not and cannot be used by the Russians to launder dirty money, which as we all know is now being used to fund the terrible actions in Ukraine?<\/p> <p> I also take this opportunity to acknowledge publicly and thank the people of Louth for their efforts so far to help our Ukrainian friends at this desperate time.  The amount of supplies, including foods, medicines and clothes, among others, that was donated by the people of Louth in recent weeks has been fantastic.  My understanding is that at least 12 lorryloads of supplies have been donated from Dundalk alone.  At times of great need, the people of our community always step up to the mark, as can be seen on this occasion as well.<\/p> <p> The next challenge we face is how to house adequately the many thousands of Ukrainians who are arriving in Ireland.  Despite us being in the middle of our own housing crisis, we are stepping up to the challenge.  Many people in Louth, and in particular Dundalk, have registered their homes to house Ukrainian families.  Scores of Ukrainians have come to my constituency office in recent weeks.  They were collected at Dublin Airport by members of their family and taken to Louth, in particular my home town of Dundalk.  One family of four has taken in eight.  Another family of four has taken in ten.  We are talking about households with ten, 12 and 14 people living in them.  I have contacted local authorities' numerous times.  I contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Everyone is passing the buck from one to the other.  All I hear from the Government is talk of the community.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, spoke this morning on national radio.  He mentioned that hundreds of millions will be spent.  Where are the hundreds of millions?  In fairness, all we are doing at the moment is putting severe pressure on local authorities.  In Louth, for example, there are approximately 6,000 people on the council waiting list.  The last thing we need is conflict between Ukrainians coming to this country and people who think they have a God-given right to get a house, which they probably all think.  There is no point in the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, having millions four or five months down the road.  Now is the time to look after these people who are coming here.  The last thing we want to do is put a wedge between the people on the council waiting list, who are waiting for their right to have their own house and the people of Ukraine, who are having a terrible time and suffering and being maimed.  Women are leaving their husbands and children behind them and coming to a strange country where they cannot even speak the language.  We need action, not talk.<\/p> <p> I wish the Minister the very best of luck at the European Council meeting later this week.  The task that faces Europe now is a massive one, but one that must be accomplished.  The killing of innocent men, women and children must be stopped.  Putin must be stopped at all costs.  If he succeeds in Ukraine where is he going to go next?  The only way to stop this monster is to cut the supply of funding to him.  We need to act as one and recognise that all these people are suffering.  We want to help them and we want to stop Putin.  Never before in our lifetime have we faced such a crisis and I hope we do not face anything like it in the future.  Whatever action or sanctions are needed now to stop this aggression must be taken.  We stand with our Ukrainian friends.  We will do everything in our power to ensure that we have a peaceful end to this conflict.  Irish people have always stood up and done their best, but I can see a barrier coming between people.  Some 10,000 people have come in recent weeks and there is talk of as many as 200,000 coming.  We in Ireland are opening our arms to them.  Instead of making promises and trying to put the responsibility back on communities, it is time for the Government to stand up and to spend the money it has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200024#W00300","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647970200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Like many Irish people, I have looked at the devastation in Mariupol and - let us call it for what it is - the war crimes that are being committed there.  I have seen the real fear and anxiety in Kyiv and in each European Union country that borders Russia.  It is very hard to be neutral when we look at the pictures each night or talk to people in any of those places.  It is very hard to have no feelings on what Putin is doing or a neutral view of what he is doing to the people of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  I mention that because in the context of this debate the European Council meeting is an opportunity for us to restate our solidarity with the people of Ukraine and our commitment to them in the face of the utterly unacceptable infringement of their sovereign territory.  How can Ireland help in that context and in the context of us being neutral and having a long tradition of military neutrality?  We know that even in the case of war on this island it was only solved by talking and us coming to an agreement.  There will ultimately have to be an agreement between Russia and Ukraine.  A further escalation of the conflict is not needed and should not be encouraged.<\/p>  <p>  How does Ireland react to the pictures and our desire to stand with Ukraine and by the same token play a part and ensure other powers do not escalate the conflict?  I believe our proud tradition of humanitarian response is the best approach to take, both through Irish agencies on the ground that have a long tradition of operating in such areas, and also at home.  We must consider the comments from Deputy Fitzpatrick.  We must consider how the people who come to Ireland are dealt with, but in dealing with the humanitarian response we must not allow a space to develop for people on the far right or those who want to exploit racism in this country.  We must also ensure we do not bypass the people who have been seeking asylum in the direct provision system.  The Government has made a commitment to end the direct provision system.  We cannot satisfy the need of the Ukrainian people in Ireland and bypass the people who are in direct provision.  Neither can we satisfy the housing needs of the Ukrainian people and bypass the broader need for housing in this country.  The answer is not to help one over the other or to turn one against the other, but to try to deal with both and to ensure that we do not have a competition for resources because that would be the ultimate breeding ground for racism.  We must make sure that Ireland responds.<\/p>  <p>  I reject the suggestions in the Seanad that we have changed our policy on neutrality.  Even in the Second World War when we were clearly militarily neutral, the Government criticised the invasion of Belgium and Holland.  Perhaps in hindsight it should have done far more than criticise an evil despot, but it did criticise the invasion of small countries such as Belgium and Holland.  On this occasion we must at least do the same.<\/p> <p>We cannot bypass the need to switch from carbon deposits.  We must switch towards more renewable resources and go tapaidh, which would be much better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200025#X00200","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647970800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I will pick up on a couple of the points raised by Deputy Carthy, but will focus on them through a slightly different lens.  I looked through the European Council agenda, which states that it \"will continue its discussion on how to build a more robust economic base ... notably by reducing strategic dependencies in sensitive areas like critical raw materials, semi-conductors, health, digital and food\".  The food security piece jumped out at me.  We are dealing with the immediate crises, which are physical security, mass migration and energy security.  These are self-evident.  We cannot help but deal with them as they are right in our faces at present, but the outworkings of this crisis will take months to play out.  It is appropriate that the Minister of State is receiving these because some of the worst effects will play out beyond the borders of Europe.<\/p>  <p>  We know that Russia and Ukraine account for 30% of the world's wheat exports, 17% of its corn exports and 32% of its barley exports.  Ukraine alone provides the wheat supply for more than half of the world food programmes.  Where does this harvest go?  We know that Ukraine is the leading supplier of wheat to Tunisia, Libya and Syria.  There is a terrible irony that so many of the countries in the fertile crescent are affected in this way.  Egypt is the world's largest wheat importer.  It relies on Russia and Ukraine for more than 80% of the wheat purchased on international markets.  Lebanon, which has seen its currency devalued significantly over the past couple of months, relies on Ukraine for 70% of its wheat imports.  As the price of world commodities shoots through the roof, the value of Lebanon's currency drops through the floor creating a perfect storm for it.<\/p>  <p>  The global nature of world commodity prices means that the impact will not stop there.  The war in Ukraine will compound the expected shortages caused by adverse weather conditions in China and will drive grain prices up worldwide.  Those who can afford it least will suffer the most, as it ever was.  Already, 811 million people go to bed hungry every night and a total of 44 million people in 38 countries are teetering on the edge of famine.  How much worse will this unjustified and unjustifiable war make this?  The UN Secretary General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres summed this up by saying, \"This war goes far beyond Ukraine\" and \"a sword of Damocles hangs over the global economy\", especially in the developing world.<\/p>  <p>  This has to be a moment when we take stock and look at the structures underpinning our global and globalised economies.  We are beginning to do that in respect of our energy systems and we are having to do it for our agriculture.  It has thrown into sharp relief, and Deputy Carthy raised some of these points, how reliant we are on imports of fodder and fertiliser.  I worry that we might be looking at our fourth fodder crisis in somewhat less than a decade this coming winter.  All of this is against the backdrop of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which has barely been mentioned due to everything else that has happened in the world.

I hope the Minister of State will bring that message to Europe.

Guarantees regarding the supply of energy and affordable prices need to be given to everyone, but especially food producers.  The pig industry sector supports 8,000 jobs and generates &euro;1.7 billion in output.  This week, the Irish Farmers Association, Meat Industry Ireland, the Irish Grain and Feed Association and food processors are looking for a pig stability fund.  This has to happen for the producing of food in this country.  I said to the Government and the Opposition last October that shelves would be empty and that our food producers would not be able to produce food due to the escalating cost of fuel.  Currently, in order for those in the pig industry to bring in an acre of extra silage at today's prices costs &euro;50 an acre more.

There is a fund.  What the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, gave to pig farmers was a pittance.  They thought they had a good meeting with him.  Grown men, who were farmers for 40 years, cried at that meeting in Kildare.  The poor fellow is at sea and does not have a clue.  Farmers want a &euro;70 million fund at least; otherwise the pig industry will go the way of the beet industry.

Winter wheat can be set in October-November, definitely.  The Government does not even know the basics of farming, which it should.

In fact, our people were left to get through the entire winter before the Government acknowledged, or acted in a half-baked way, to reduce excise on petrol and diesel.  This was a full six months after the EU Commission signalled a need for member states to act.  The action engaged in by this out-of-touch Government was disgraceful.  On 13 October 2021, the Commission released a communication which included a toolbox of measures that the EU and member states could use to address the immediate impact of price increases.

I stand, as I have already repeated, in full solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  I deplore what has happened.  Words do not convey it.  We should do everything possible on a humanitarian level, as we are doing.  I welcome the briefing that will take place later this week on the practicalities of the numbers of refugees coming to our country.  However, I fully agree with what Deputy Boyd Barrett said that if the message from this is that we must increase our military spending then we are absolutely doomed.  We speak today in a world where 44 million are on the brink of famine globally.  In addition 23 million are just one step away because of wars or the direct effects of climate change, war, the inequality of power and the powers that be playing war games generally.  That in no way takes from anything else and I wholly condemn what Putin has done.<\/p>  <p>  The meeting this week, which we are not sure if the Taoiseach can attend and that is no reflection on him, is one where we should reassert our voice.  That is that positive, strong, proactive, neutral voice that is not adding to the warmongers in the world because you cannot make peace with war.  It is not possible.  We need to use our voice, now that we have a seat at the UN Security Council, to call for a diplomatic solution.  Whether we like it or not, we will have to sit with Putin or people on his behalf.  Bad as things are now, they will get worse with a further war.  It is in all our interests to find a solution.  In my opinion the ingredients are there, whether or not we can trust him in terms of diplomacy.  Ukraine has said that it will not join NATO, and so on, in a package of solutions.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, I am worried by what an unelected member has said about the strategic compass that we passed without discussion that Europe must learn to speak the language of power.  I think Europe has to learn to speak the language of peace.  They talk about things being rule-based but then we must apply rules in an even-handed fashion.

First, on the upcoming European Council, I am satisfied with Ireland's position on Ukraine's application for EU membership.  However, I want more clarity on our position on sanctions particularly around purchasing Russian coal, oil and gas.  The impact of sanctions in this area would be very powerful but it would also hit the European and Irish economy very hard.  We have to make choices and ask ourselves if we starve the Russian military machine now and literally cut off the supply lines of euro and dollars will it bring Putin to the table sooner?  Would it shorten the war and human disaster unfolding in front of our eyes?  My view is the tougher the sanctions now the greater the impact and the greater the likelihood that we just might shorten this war.<\/p>  <p>  Second, the response of the Irish people in offering assistance and shelter has been so positive and heartwarming but we urgently need immediate co-ordination at local, county, regional and national levels.  I know that reception centres have been set up and good work is being done but the Taoiseach himself said that we are in a war situation and being on a war footing requires a war-type response.  At the very least we need a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for co-ordinating our refugee response.  So many of the pieces are already in place.  People have shown generosity.  Local voluntary community groups, NGOs, local authorities and so many bodies are willing, ready and able but the Government has ultimate responsibility to join the dots, put the supports and the structures in place.  This will be far more difficult than we think both at individual and national level.  We can make it work but we need a co-ordinating body and a Minister with full responsibility to manage the situation.  Otherwise the difficulties will multiply.  They will multiply anyway but if somebody is in charge that helps.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, human trafficking and women and children must be at the top of our agenda.  Our systems at both national and European level must ensure that those women and children fleeing one horror do not find themselves in another.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200027#Z00300","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1647971400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>The agenda for this week's meeting of the European Council is being discussed by EU affairs ministers at the General Affairs Council meeting today at which the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is representing Ireland.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, has outlined his expectations for the discussions around Russia's aggression against Ukraine, security, defence and Covid-19.  I will address the issues of energy, economic issues, and Euro summit and EU external relations.<\/p>  <p>  At the informal meeting at Versailles the members of the European Council discussed how to ensure the security of energy supplies and agree to phase out dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports as soon as possible.  This can be achieved through a strong focus on accelerating the development of renewables, promoting energy efficiency and improving the interconnection of the European electricity and gas networks.  Reducing overall reliance on fossil fuels, diversifying supplies and routes and improving levels of gas storage and enhancing the EU contingency planning will all support increased security of supply.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has been invited to propose a REPowerEU plan by the end of May, building on its recent communication of a joint European action for more affordable, secure and sustainable energy.  EU leaders will also discuss soaring energy prices that have reached unprecedented levels across Europe, including here in Ireland.  There was already an issue of significant concern and it is one that has been exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Energy prices are at record highs and remain volatile.  The Government is acutely aware of the social and economic impact of these increases on the whole of our society.  The Government has utilised the tax and social welfare system to counter the rising costs of living of which energy costs are one of the biggest drivers with a number of measures implemented in budget 2022.  Earlier this month, we announced a temporary reduction in the excise rates for auto fuels.  This is in addition to the extensive supports already announced, including the &euro;200 energy credit, public transport fare reductions, fuel allowance increases, an enhanced drug payment scheme and bringing forward the working family payment.  In February, the Government announced a new national home energy upgrade scheme providing increased grant levels up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit.  Unfortunately, in these exceptionally difficult times, governments cannot fully shield society from the impact.  The best medium- to long-term approach to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to accelerate our efforts to deliver on the green transition.<\/p>  <p>  Leaders will also return to economic issues and this week's meeting.  This will include endorsing the political orientation of the Versailles declaration insofar as strengthening Europe's economic basis is concerned while unlocking the full potential of our Single Market to underpin the green and digital transitions.  It is expected that leaders will also endorse the strategic priorities of the Commission's annual sustainable growth survey and invite member states to reflect them in their national plans, national reform programmes and stability programme updates to be submitted in April as part of this year's European semester process.<\/p>  <p>  The annual sustainable growth survey produced by the Commission in November identified four key dimensions of competitive sustainability as guiding principles for Europe&rsquo;s economic revival: environmental sustainability, productive productivity, fairness and macroeconomic stability.  These four dimensions are closely interrelated, mutually reinforcing and fully consistent with the strategic direction established by the recovery and resilience facility, forming the core component of the historic next generation EU budgetary package.  The Government agrees that they continue to provide the right emphasis at this time, including having regard to heightened economic uncertainties.  Leaders will also meet in Euro summit format this week joined by the European Euro group President, Deputy Pascal Donohoe, and European Central Bank President, Christine Lagarde.  It is expected that the leaders exchanges on the economic outlook for the single currency area will be informed by the most recent monetary policy decisions adopted by the ECB and the statement on fiscal guidance for 2023 adopted by the Eurogroup finance ministers on 14 March.<\/p> <p>Given renewed uncertainties and risks, the Government&rsquo;s view is we need to remain agile and flexible in our political response to current circumstances.  The Taoiseach looks forward to further constructive exchanges with leaders to this end.<\/p> <p> The European Council will also prepare the EU-China summit to be held on 1 April 2022 and exchange views on relations with China in the new global context.  The events of recent weeks will have systemic effects on world geopolitics, including on the EU's relations with China.  The EU-China summit is an opportunity for an open and frank discussion on Russia&rsquo;s aggression on Ukraine, on the EU&rsquo;s and China&rsquo;s response to that aggression and on what that might mean for EU-China relations and wider global relations.<\/p> <p> The European Council will also discuss the prolonged political crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The Government is a strong advocate for the western Balkans.  This will be a useful opportunity to discuss how the EU can further engage in order to buttress stability.  Leaders will also meet on Friday for a Euro Summit.  They will discuss the economic situation and review progress on banking union and capital markets union.<\/p> <p> Before I conclude, I thank Members again for their active participation in this debate.  The Taoiseach will report to the House early next month following this week&rsquo;s European Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200027#Z00400","speaker":"1573","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Rising Energy Costs: Motion [Private Members]","time":1647972000,"counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200028#AA00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1647972000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>notes that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the cost of household energy is spiralling, with more than 30 different price increase announcements from Irish energy suppliers over the past year;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; costs have risen by around &euro;500 for an average household, with energy suppliers announcing further rises next month;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; home heating oil has increased in price by over &euro;1,000 for 1,000 litres this year;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Bord G&aacute;is Energy have announced price rises of up to 39 per cent next month;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the price of coal increased by &euro;4.50 per bag last week and is anticipated to increase by a further &euro;2.50 at the beginning of April;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; according to the Government's most recent strategy to tackle energy poverty, up to 28 per cent of households in Ireland are in or at risk of energy poverty, equivalent to some 475,000 households;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has had a 49 per cent increase in the number of requests for help with energy costs in February 2022, compared to the same period last year; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; a recent RED C poll from January 2022 found that 37 per cent of people have cut back on essential heating and electricity use, and 17 per cent have cut back on other essentials such as food; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; there are currently no supports for the vast majority of workers and families to assist with rising heating costs;<br \/><br \/>further notes that: <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government's recent measures to reduce excise duty do not extend to home heating oil;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Fuel Allowance is only available to limited households and does not include those on the Working Family Payment (WFP); <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government have continually insisted that households can seek support for energy costs through the Exceptional Needs Payment (ENP), yet those working 30 hours per week or more cannot avail of this; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the carbon tax increase in May will further increase the price of home heating oil, gas and solid fuels; and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to take appropriate emergency action, to include:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the introduction of a &quot;cost of living cash payment&quot; of &euro;200 for every adult with an income less than &euro;30,000 and &euro;100 for every adult with an income between &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the further reduction of excise duty on petrol and diesel;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the securing of a derogation from the European Commission in order to reduce Value Added Tax on bills temporarily and as required;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the removal of the excise duty on home heating oil for a temporary period; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the extension of Fuel Allowance eligibility to those who are in receipt of the WFP;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the establishment of a discretionary fund of &euro;15 million, to assist households with utility debt;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the relaxation of the rules for the ENP, including the 30 hour working rule on a temporary basis;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the collection of data from Community Welfare Officers on the number of requests received for assistance under the ENP; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the cancellation of the increase in carbon tax scheduled for 1st May. <\/blockquote>  <p>When it comes to many of the issues of the day, with all the data and percentages, the lived reality can sometimes be missed.  I have engaged with many people ahead of this motion, both online and in person.  They included a mother who gets up in the middle of the night to refill her little boy's hot water bottles because she cannot afford to buy oil, a nursing student commuting daily for college having to miss days as she cannot afford to fill her car five days of the week, a working couple who will have to decide next month whether to make their mortgage payment or get a fill of oil and a worker in the oil industry who told me how older people are crying on the phone wondering how they will keep paying for coal.  This is not make-believe.  The CEO of ALONE, an organisation that advocates for older people, has said older people are choosing between heating and eating.  That is someone's mother, father, granny or granddad deciding whether they should buy fuel or buy food.  Imagine that is a decision to be made by older people living in our State in 2022.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has seen a 49% in calls in February of this year compared to the same time last year.  People are ringing it seeking help with energy costs.  The Government does not have to listen to Sinn F&eacute;in or other Opposition Members in this House, it could just listen to the people who are out there, that is, the workers, the families and organisations like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that are spending millions every year helping people with energy costs.  This is now the reality for workers and families right across this State.<\/p><p>Just last week, Bord Gais announced unprecedented increases in electricity and gas.  Those increases will kick in in just a couple of weeks' time.  They will see gas bills increase by &euro;340 per year and electricity by &euro;350.  This price hike follows almost 40 price hikes from energy providers in the last year.  Home heating oil, which many of the people of Roscommon and Galway whom I represent rely on to heat their homes, has doubled in the last year.  Carbon tax, which the Minister of State's Government will increase from 1 May, will further increase gas and oil prices at a time when many households are spending more their bills than they ever have before.  We also know coal is up 50% since September of last year and further increases are expected next month.<\/p><p>At every point when we have raised the cost of living crisis and especially energy prices - and we see again it in the Government's amendment this evening - it speaks about the budget last year and the social welfare increases that are more or less irrelevant given where we are now compared to where we were last October.  Of course, those increases in social welfare came when we had two previous years with no increases whatsoever and we are also at a point where every single working-age weekly social welfare payment is already well below the poverty line.  The Government speaks about those increases like it speaks about the fuel allowance, namely, as if it were doing people a favour.  The reality is we have entire cohorts of people, including those who rely on social welfare like lone parents, carers and persons with disabilities, and also entire cohorts of workers who are getting up early in the morning, paying their taxes and are not able to cover their basic costs week-to-week.  The Government has also overemphasised the fuel allowance.  It is still not back up to the 32 weeks that Fine Gael cut back in 2012.  Again, many households are locked out of the fuel allowance.  This is a point we have made repeatedly.  This includes those out sick from work on the illness benefit, those on low wages relying on the working family payment and many older people who have a small occupational pension.  The exceptional needs payment is then cited as an additional support for those who might be struggling with their fuel costs.  What is not said when the Government brings that forward as a suggestion is that if a person works 30 hours or more per week he or she cannot get the exceptional needs payment.  That means we are leaving entire cohorts of workers - people who are paying their taxes and working - unable to afford mounting fuel bills every single week and month.  The exceptional needs payment is not mentioned in the Government amendment, which is a wonder.  There are measures brought forward in this motion related to social protection that can and should be taken by the Government to give people the assistance they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200028#AA00300","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1647972000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>The people are in the grip of a cost of living crisis and, as we all know, in the past month as a consequence of the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia, energy prices have soared.  The impact of the conflict has also led to spiralling commodity prices.  The prices of wheat, fertiliser and other industrial inputs all rising sharply.  In the current context it is easy to forget the cost of living crisis predates this conflict, with rents and energy prices both rising with terrible consequences for renters, workers and families.  We are seeing what is a very deliberate narrative shift that says the entire cost of living crisis has been caused by the invasion of Ukraine and that all of us must make sacrifices and bear the cost.  That simply is not true and needs to be challenged, because the cost of living crisis predates this conflict, as does the Government's failure to respond to it.  In December prices had risen by 5.7%, with energy prices up 27% and home heating oil up 53%.  As a result, even then, core social welfare rates, as Deputy Kerrane mentioned, had been cut in real terms, thus impacting the most vulnerable in our society.  The Government rejected Sinn F&eacute;in's request that it respond.  As I have said before, the cost of prices rises will not be borne by everyone equally.  As always, low and middle-income households will bear the greatest costs in all of this and the wealthiest the least, unless action is taken.<\/p>  <p>  Inflation hits those on lower incomes hardest.  As a proportion of income, the lowest-income households spend three times more on fuel and energy than the top 10% do.  Workers and families therefore face difficult choices.  Their incomes are being squeezed and their pockets burned.  We have had more than 30 price increases announced by energy providers in the past year.  Bord G&aacute;is announced last week it was hiking prices again by 39%.<\/p> <p>More price hikes are expected in the months ahead.  The narrative from the Government is that this is a result of the war in Ukraine, but gas is bought on the international market months in advance.  The price hikes announced by Bord G&aacute;is, and likely other utilities, are because of the spike that took place last year.  We will likely see further increases, given that the gas being bought now will be consumed at the later end of the year and the large increases that have happened as a result of the invasion of Ukraine will be passed on to consumers.<br\/><br\/>Home heating oil has increased by &euro;600 for 1,000 litres since the start of the year.  The response from the Government has been bizarre.  Last week, the Minister for Finance ruled out any measure to support low and middle income households until October.  Separately, a Government party is knowingly spreading disinformation online and on the airwaves by falsely claiming the Government could not reduce excise on home heating oil and support households even though it actually could.  It is a pity the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, has left the Chamber because this would be an opportunity for him to withdraw his accusation against me that I was lying on the national airwaves when I claimed there was excise duty on home heating oil.  I am sure he has read <i>The Journal's<\/i>fact check as well as the comments from the Department of Finance and Revenue clarifying that Sinn F&eacute;in was right and the Government was wrong in this regard.  None of that means much to people, though.  What they want is for the cost to be driven down, and this shows that further action could be taken by the Government.<br\/><br\/>The Green Party's leader is telling people to slow down while the Minister of State sitting across the floor from me has told people to stop complaining and shop around.  This is the level of arrogance that we are getting from a Government that is out of touch with people who are really suffering.  Will the Government wake up to the cost of living crisis that workers and families are suffering and support them?  That is what this motion does.  It starts by calling for excise duty on home heating oil to be removed in order to support families who are struggling to heat their homes.  This alone would reduce the cost of a fill by &euro;100.  The motion calls on the Government to move as far as it can on the cost of diesel and petrol through further reductions in excise duty and to win a special derogation to reduce the level of VAT applied to household energy bills.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling on the Government to negotiate with the European Commission on this issue since last September.  Each time, the Government has ruled out that.  As such, I welcome that it has started to deal with this issue in the past two weeks.  Targeted supports are also necessary.  That is why we are proposing cost of living cash payments at a rate of &euro;200 for individuals with incomes below &euro;30,000 and &euro;100 for individuals with incomes between &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000.

That is no good to people who are struggling and juggling to pay their bills and infuriates them because they are bearing the burden of all of this.  Energy costs permeate through all economic transactions and bear down heavily on the shoulders of ordinary workers and families.  That is a fact.<\/p>  <p>  The Government must listen.  It needs to know with what people are struggling.  It needs to listen to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the people who are missing hospital appointments because they cannot afford to put fuel in their cars.  We told the Government that it could go further in terms of diesel, petrol and home heating oil.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, knows it can go further than this.  Last week's argument over excise duty on home heating oil was bizarre.  Revenue came out and clearly stated there was excise duty on energy.

In my area, there is a two-year waiting list for the warmer home scheme.  It is not dealing with the crisis right now where people cannot afford to live.  They can barely afford to survive.

We already had unaffordable rents as well as childcare that cost as much as a second mortgage and we were the fourth most expensive EU country where electricity was concerned.  Before Christmas, Social Justice Ireland told us that almost one fifth of adults were living in poverty when housing costs were included.  That was the crisis point before the war, and it has now become unmanageable for many people to keep the lights on, keep the house warm and put food on the table.  People need targeted supports right now to help them through this difficult time.  It is high time that the fuel allowance was extended to those in receipt of the working family payment.

I spoke to the owner of the shop today.  A drum of oil is up 23%, the price of chicken has doubled, the price of lamb is up 50% and the prices of breading, packaging and butter are up 30%.  We are not here to speak about prices in the butcher's shop, but one of the main factors in all of this is the increase in energy prices.<\/p>  <p>  Kerry is a county that has been heavily affected by the rise in fuel costs, which will undoubtedly continue to increase.  There does not seem to be any end in sight.  Obviously, the invasion of Ukraine has not helped, but inflation across the board has been a long time coming as a result of policies dating back over a decade and fully endorsed and pursued by members of this Government.  In 2013, we in Sinn F&eacute;in called on the then Government not to sell Bord G&aacute;is to Centrica for the knock-down price of &euro;129 million.  In the past three years, Centrica's profits from Bord G&aacute;is have been &euro;50 million, &euro;33.5 million and &euro;55 million, so that was not a bad price at which to get Bord G&aacute;is.

We are even more affected by the increase in energy prices as a result of the Government's policies.<\/p>  <p>  During Leaders' Questions today, the Government stated that it could not control what was happening on the world stage.  It cannot, but it can react to it.  I call on the Minister of State to take steps to react to it and make the burden easier for the people who are standing at the butcher's counter and who were going to buy three breasts of chicken but left the shop with only one because they could not afford the second and third.  This is the type of crisis we are hearing about.

The rising cost of living is being felt across communities, whether in Ringsend, Donnybrook, Kimmage or Kevin Street.  It is the issue that people are raising with me.  People have to decide between heating or eating.  That is of huge concern to everybody in this House.  Everyone is feeling the pressure of these rising costs.<\/p>  <p>  Recent research from Red C on behalf of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul found that 30% of people have had to cut back on essential heating and electricity costs and approximately 20% have had to cut back on essential food costs.  We know who feels these sharp increases in the cost of living most.  Low and middle income workers and their families are hit hardest.  These households must spend a higher proportion of their income on food and fuel.  Week after week, they are left with less of their disposable income.  This is having a devastating impact on inner city communities across Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The rising cost of living and the housing crisis are ripping these communities apart.  For so many, these rising costs are making the hope of owning a home or renting within their community almost impossible.  The rising cost of renting swallows a large chunk of most people's salaries and many people feel suffocated by all of these rising costs.  This devastates local communities, families and couples who simply want to settle down and start a family.  So many of these young people are being forced out of their communities in search of housing.  We need to see a meaningful suite of measures put in place to ease the burden on people.<\/p>  <p>  This motion brings forward a wide range of measures aimed at easing that burden and giving households much-needed support and a break.  It includes a cost of living payment of &euro;200 for adults on an income of less than &euro;30,000 per annum and &euro;100 for those on between &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000 per annum, further reductions in excise duty on petrol and diesel and the temporary removal of excise duty on home heating oil.

The House has engaged in a number of debates on the issue in recent weeks, reflecting the seriousness of the issue and the impact these increases are having on households and businesses throughout the country.<\/p><p>Let me begin by again stressing that this is a worldwide issue brought about by a perfect storm of global supply chain disruptions and the imbalance between demand and supply that emerged as the economy re-opened and global demand increased.  More recently, as a result of the war in Ukraine and Russia's role in global energy supply, oil and gas prices have risen further and these increases will feed into higher inflation over the coming months.  The final retail price of fuel is determined by a number of factors, including the costs of production, distribution, global market factors, international exchange rates, taxation and wholesale market contracts, as well as individual retail pricing policies.  I am very aware of the severity of the financial impact that this is placing on Irish households and businesses.  The current trends in energy prices are not unique to Ireland and are, in fact, part of global trends.  In terms of explaining price dynamics, a multitude of factors are at work.  For the sake of brevity, I will focus on the key drivers.<\/p><p>Demand for oil and other energy products such as natural gas has increased sharply following the re-opening of many economies in the second half of last year.  Additionally, the increases in international gas prices are more complex and relate to increased demand from certain parts of the world, in part as a result of extreme weather events, lower than expected gas supply and low gas reserves.  Unfortunately, Ireland, along with the rest of the EU, is a net importer of gas and, as a result, a price-taker on international markets.  These gas prices are the most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland.  Across Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have risen and remained high since the second half of 2020.  Gas prices began to rise in mid-2020 due to factors such as strong demand for gas as the pandemic receded and the move from coal to gas increasing the demand for gas for electricity generation.  Gas prices are now unprecedentedly high, with UK wholesale gas prices, where gas for use in Ireland is traded, reaching record levels in the recent past.  Additionally, geopolitical tensions, including the war on Ukraine by Russia, continue to affect negatively international gas prices.  This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.  While the future is uncertain, current market expectations are that significantly elevated wholesale gas prices will continue into 2023.<\/p><p>It is clear that taxation of energy products in not behind current energy prices.  Ireland's taxation of fuel is based on European Union law as set out in the energy tax directive. ETD.  The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all member states must comply.  Ireland applies excise duty, in the form of mineral oil tax, MOT, to fuels used for motor or heating purposes.  MOT is comprised of a non-carbon and a carbon component.  The carbon component is also referred to as carbon tax.  Deputies will be aware that the 2020 programme for Government committed to increasing the amount that is charged per tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions from fuels to &euro;100 by 2030.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, followed through on this commitment by introducing legislation, the Finance Act 2020, to provide for a ten-year trajectory for carbon tax increases to reach &euro;100 per tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions by 2030.  This measure is a key pillar underpinning the Government's climate action plan to halve emissions by 2030 and to reach net zero no later than 2050.<\/p><p>A further key component of the Government's carbon taxation policy is the hypothecation of revenues raised from rate increase to fund important just transition measures.  It is important to note that a significant portion of carbon tax revenue is allocated for expenditure on targeted welfare measures and energy efficiency measures, which not only support the most vulnerable households in society, but also in the long term provides support against fuel price impacts by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.  Analysis undertaken using SWITCH, the ESRI tax and benefit model, to simulate the impact of the carbon tax increase and the compensatory welfare package has confirmed that the net impact of the combined measures is progressive.  Households in the bottom four income deciles will see all of the cost of the carbon tax increase offset, with the bottom three deciles being better off as a result of these measures.  In the long run, the best way to protect Ireland from the impact of international fossil fuel prices is to reduce our dependence on them.  We will achieve this through the progressive decarbonisation of Irish society and through the steps that will be taken to meet the Government's commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.<\/p><p>For context, it must also be noted that changes to carbon tax rates are having a relatively small impact on current energy prices.  The budget 2022 carbon tax increase, which came into effect in October last year, added approximately 2 cent per litre in tax to petrol and diesel.  The increase in rates for home heating fuels such as kerosene, gas and solid fuels was delayed until 1 May 2022 to mitigate against impacts during the winter heating season.  It is clear that carbon tax is not the cause of current energy price inflation.<\/p><p>Let me now turn to the Government's response to the increase in energy prices.  Less than two weeks ago, the Government brought a Financial Resolution to this House providing for excise duty decreases on mineral oil taxes with effect from 10 March.  This provided for a 20 cent reduction in the excise rate for petrol and a 15 cent reduction on auto diesel, with a proportionate 2 cent reduction for the excise on marked gas oil, known as green diesel.<\/p> <p>These measures were VAT inclusive and will last until 31 August 2022.  They will continue for several months to come, right throughout the summer.<\/p> <p> The Government has recognised the impacts of the current fuel price increases.  While these trends are driven primarily by global factors, the Government made the decision to alleviate some of these impacts through the domestic taxation of fuel.  The measures implemented provide significant mitigation against these recent fuel price increases.  It is not possible to offset all of the recent increases, which are driven by market factors, just by using the taxation system.  The excise reductions strike the balance between passing on a significant benefit to consumers while managing the tax base and respecting the minimum rates allowable under the energy tax directive from the EU.<\/p> <p> The Government is acutely aware of the increases in consumer prices, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices, and it is for this reason we brought in the temporary excise cuts two weeks ago.  These measure come in addition to the recently announced package of measures to alleviate the impact of increased costs of living on households.<\/p> <p> In terms of revenue impacts, the six-month decrease in mineral oil tax is estimated to cost &euro;320 million.  In putting these reductions in place, the Government had to take account of the restrictions of the EU excise and VAT directives.  The combined effect of the measures in respect of the 15 cent reduction in excise on diesel, along with the scheduled 1 cent reduction to offset the biofuel obligation scheme increase and the diesel rebate scheme, meant that any further excise reduction would bring the effective rate below the minimum permissible rate.<\/p> <p> In looking at the cost of home heating fuels, we were conscious of the need to retain our 13.5% rate on such fuels.  In this regard, it has been well rehearsed that Ireland has retained its historic application of 13.5% to a range of services, including the supply of fuel, gas, oil and electricity services, and under the directive the rate applicable to such services can be maintained but cannot be reduced below 12%.  If it is reduced below 12%, even on a temporary basis, it loses the derogation of the reduced rate and must be returned to the standard rate, which is much higher.  We have engaged with the Commission seeking greater flexibility for member states with regard to the application of both the energy tax directive and the VAT directive in terms of our ability to address the issues facing our citizens.<\/p> <p> The rapid rise in consumer prices is certainly unwelcome, and the Government is conscious of the impact on the Irish people.  We have responded in a proactive manner and in line with policies taken in other jurisdictions.  Some of the drivers are outside of our control and our policy response will help to mitigate their impact.  The comprehensive response of Government to the energy crisis and in other areas will soon begin to have a positive effect.  While this happens, we cannot compromise the progress we have made on implementing the climate policies which are critical to ensuring we reduce emissions and mitigate climate change impacts into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200030#CC00300","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647973800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>The astronomical increases in fuel costs have pushed hundreds of thousands of Irish households to the brink, and the statistics laid out in this motion are quite shocking.  There have been more than 30 different price increases from energy suppliers in the past year, and costs have risen by around &euro;500 per annum for the average household.  Home heating oil has increased by more than &euro;600 for 1,000 litres this year.  Coal has increased by &euro;4.50 per bag in the last week.  We are expecting major increases in the coming weeks and months.  Next month, gas will increase by 30% and coal by a further &euro;2.50 per bag.  These figures mean one thing for low and middle-income families.  It means hardship and the real risk of poverty.  We are aware that up to 475,000 households in Ireland are at risk of energy poverty.  In January 37% of people reported having to cut back on essential heating and electricity use.  This figure is much higher by now.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure that the Government fully appreciates the pressures that families are under, including those who have no choice but to use their own cars and who are struggling to keep them on the road.  There are no supports available to most people to cope with this.  The once-off payment from the Government is, unfortunately, a drop in the ocean when compared to the cost of energy.  The measure to reduce excise duty does not include home heating, as we all know.  The measure to extend the fuel allowance will only benefit those who already qualify for the payment.  The exceptional needs allowance has been put forward by the Government as a solution but it does not apply to anybody who works more than 30 hours per week.<\/p>  <p>  The motion puts forward a number of simple and practical measures that will help to ease the burden for people.  I hope that this time around the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and his Government will listen, and that they will plan and act to help families through this very difficult time.  I appreciate that the Government has introduced some measures but the Government is simply not doing enough, and it has heard this from everyone in this Chamber today.

These older buildings are difficult and expensive to heat.  Much of the heat escapes through the walls, roofs and chimneys.  There are thousands of such homes across the State that need to be fully insulated to be energy efficient.  This would help to lower household spend on fuel to heat a house and will make houses more energy efficient.  This can be done by insulating attics, fitting heat pumps, doing wraparounds, pumping insulation into walls or by changing windows and doors, where necessary, in order to bring the houses up to an acceptable energy rating standard.  Without such work these houses can be very cold.  Many are inhabited by senior citizens who are very vulnerable to the cold and who can ill afford to pay from their small incomes for domestic fuel and gas to keep their houses warm.  Those dependent primarily on domestic fuel to heat their homes have seen an eye watering rise in price per litre from 43 cent per litre in Dublin only 18 months ago, to &euro;1.76 per litre at its peak this month.  This is more than 300% of an increase in domestic fuel costs in Dublin in this short period.  This is just not sustainable for many families and pensioners.  They are left with a terrible dilemma in having to make choices based on their limited incomes, the rising costs of living and the cost of domestic fuel and electricity.  It is not a clich&eacute; to say that they must make a decision as to whether they can heat their house or put food on the table.  The cost of domestic fuel has become so prohibitive that many people are reverting back to using coal fires.  This is not an efficient way to heat a house, nor is it cost-effective because so much of the heat is lost up the chimney.<\/p>  <p>  Our motion lays out a number of solutions that would mitigate against the worst of the extortionate fuel costs on households.  For those families, and especially senior citizens, who are dependent on their cars, the Government should consider an additional reduction in excise duty on diesel and petrol, as well as its removal from domestic fuel, even if only on a temporary basis to give families some breathing space.  Families on low incomes and in receipt of the working family payment should be eligible for the fuel allowance.

Others are telling me that they feel nauseous when they hear their electricity and gas bills popping through the letterbox.  These are the people who get up very early in the morning, either to work or to care in the home.

He should take that on board when making his decisions.<\/p>  <p>  There are almost weekly announcements from different providers of price increases for consumers.  People have nowhere to turn.  There are currently no supports for the vast majority of workers and families to assist with the rise in heating costs.  That is the view of most of the people I have talked to.  Home heating oil has increased in price by over &euro;1,000 for 1,000 l in one year.  How are people supposed to keep up with that?  People have talked about the carbon tax.  Where is the just transition?  Implementing a carbon tax in the current circumstances is simply kicking people when they are down on the ground.  It will only add to the crippling energy prices and put further pressure on families.  The Government needs to reduce excise duty on petrol and diesel and secure an agreement in Europe in order that it can reduce VAT on bills.  Workers and families need help now, not down the road.  They cannot afford to wait for grandiose plans and lofty notions to come to fruition.  The question is whether the Government is doing enough.  I would argue that it is not. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200032#EE00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1647974400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Sherlock.  I welcome this motion and the opportunity to speak on it.  I am always conscious when speaking on these issues of the suffering of the people of Ukraine.  That is the issue of paramount importance.  That is the paramount issue we face today globally.  We have a sense of proportion.  None of the problems we debate here, important as they are, come close to the suffering of the people of Ukraine.  Rising fuel and energy costs were already having a very real impact on the cost of living for those on fixed, low and middle incomes pre war.  The illegal war waged in Ukraine has only exacerbated those rising energy and fuel costs.<\/p><p>The initial response from the Government to these rising costs was meek and anaemic.  I have said that time and again.  We warned in our response to last October's budget that social welfare increases would not keep pace with the rising price of fuel, energy and the basics needed to keep the fridge stocked.  Laterally, the &euro;200 gimmick for everyone, regardless of income, was never going to cut it.  It certainly will not pass muster now.  A cost of living crisis has every chance of becoming a cost of living catastrophe.  I say that with some sensitivity and a sense of proportion.<\/p><p>Yesterday, I spoke to a pensioner couple in Louth who missed the fuel allowance threshold by &euro;9.30.  One of them has a serious medical condition.  Their response is to only put the heating on for a maximum of four hours a day.  That is what they are reduced to.  These are people who have worked all their lives.  Why can the fuel allowance not be extended to another 150,000 households that are borderline, as I recommended as far back as October's budget?  That is a simple measure that would alleviate, address and counter fuel poverty.<\/p><p>The Exchequer has made windfall gains on VAT as companies like Bord G&aacute;is shamelessly protect their profits with massive price hikes.  It should be a source of embarrassment for the Taoiseach that he has only in recent days sought a derogation from the European Commission to see if VAT can be cut on energy bills.  We have been calling for this for months and it is only being explored now.  Yesterday, a local drugs service came to me with its Electric Ireland bill.  It is &euro;2,166 since January, which is up from &euro;1,742 for its last bill.  It already runs that crucial service on fresh air.  Given the tight margins within which the community and voluntary sector operates, can we expect line Departments to help these services meet their costs?  I think we know what the answer is.<\/p><p>The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will remember Carlinn Hall, Dundalk.  When he was last in office, he welcomed this residential development.  It is a 200-unit development with district communal heating.  It was meant to be fuelled by biogas.  It was billed as an estate of the future and the system is now powered by gas.  The further rub is that the residents are being charged commercial rates by an intermediary called Frontline Energy, which is acting for Energia.  Costs are escalating massively.  Surely these people should be paying a residential rate and not a commercial one.  The Minister washed his hands of this issue in a response to a recent parliamentary question from me.  I have asked a regulator to make a determination on this.  Surely these people should be paying residential bills and not bills at commercial rates.  I mention this situation because this is one of the real-world problems that my constituents and others across the country are experiencing.  I accept that it is not always possible for the Government to mitigate against all the effects this dreadful war will have on living standards in Ireland.  I get that.  All we are asking the Government to do is use the tools available to it to help people manage throughout this crisis.  Unfortunately, many of those tools remain locked in the shed.  That is a fact.  Why, for example, did the Government not consider, and why is it not considering, activating maximum price orders for fuel at the pumps?  Why is it not doing that in the short term?  It is beyond me.  This is provided for in the Consumer Protection Act 2007, yet that provision remains idle.  It was for times like this that that provision was designed. <\/p><p>In 2010, under pressure from Intel, Lufthansa Technik and other multinationals, the then Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, asked the energy regulator to rebalance electricity tariffs in favour of businesses that were large consumers of electricity.  The Minister of State will remember this as he was a Government Deputy at the time.  That was done at the expense of householders.  In August 2010, the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>said that the move added an additional 3% to the electricity bills of domestic users across Ireland.  That was at a time when there were an average of about 900 disconnections every month and the country was heading towards unemployment levels of 500,000.  At this time of crisis, will the Minister of State now reverse that decision, or appeal to his Government colleagues to reverse it, and rebalance the tariff in favour of hard-pressed householders?  That action alone would make a very real difference for households across this country, which are struggling to make ends meet and will continue to struggle over the next few months in this extremely insecure and uncertain time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200032#EE00300","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1647974400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  Just today, I spoke to a 94-year-old man who, with his wife, is in receipt of an occupational pension.  They do not pass the means test for the fuel allowance.  Last week, I spoke with a couple of retirement age who have a combined working life of 84 years between them, and they do not fulfil the criteria for the fuel allowance.<\/p> <p>The common denominator there is that both couples worked hard all of their lives, raised families and paid their contributions to the State.  They feel marginalised and hard done by in the midst of this crisis because the fuel allowance will not cover them.  I will not advise them to go to a community welfare officer for an exceptional needs payment because they are not that type of people.  They are proud people and they feel that the contributions they have made through their taxation should be enough to allow for access, albeit it might be on a temporary basis while this crisis is ongoing, to some recognition by the State of their needs and the costs they are incurring, particularly on fuel.  I mention the 94-year-old gentleman.  He is most lucid and his mind is as sharp as it ever was but his body is not where he would like it to be.  He said to me today that he has to keep the heating on because of the type of medication he is on.  The money is flowing out of the door, so much so that the couple are incurring personal debt.  He said to me that if the fuel allowance was expanded, albeit on a temporary basis, to allow for his circumstances and that of his wife, it would allow him to maintain his dignity and pride with a temporary payment to get him over this challenge.<\/p> <p> We all recognise that there are external forces at play and nobody would deny that but we must take cognisance of the people who are not fulfilling the criteria for fuel allowance and who are living in fuel impoverished households.  They should not have to wait for the national retrofitting scheme, which Age Action Ireland tells us we will take at least eight years to meet its full targets.  God only knows where my 94-year-old man will be at that stage of his life.  We should at least put something in place now by way of an expansion or extension beyond the 372 households that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, announced on 14 March.  I note that the Minister of State mentioned 390 households in his speech so there is a contradiction of 18,000 houses there and there has been an inflation of figures between Departments since 14 March.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding that, there is a simple ask here.  These are working people who paid massive taxes to the State in the 1970s and 1980s and made massive sacrifices to put their children through college.  Many of these people their children were the first generation of children in their families to go to university or third level institutions.  We must recognise the predicament they are in and we should not force them to have to go to a community welfare officer.  The State, through its Departments, should recognise that predicament and extend the fuel allowance, albeit as a temporary measure, to get them over the challenges they face because along with the increase in costs as has been articulated by many Members, there is also the increase in the price of food.  All of these people are on fixed incomes and they do not want to eat into their credit union savings because by and large, these savings are what these people have left to bury themselves in some instances.  The savings will be used to meet emergency family crisis needs or to bury themselves.  We do not want to have them in a situation where they have to dip into those savings.  There is scope for the Government to introduce a scheme of this nature and I ask that the Minister of State would take that on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200032#EE00400","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647975000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I welcome the motion and the opportunity to speak on and debate this issue.  Unfortunately it is not the first time we have debated this issue and it will not be the last time we do so.  Each time we have these debates and discussions the crisis is bigger for people.  The Government's responses have failed to meet the needs of those people and the crisis gets worse and worse.  Those who are in energy poverty are unable to cope and the reality is that more and more families are entering energy poverty, inevitably leading to a rise in overall poverty rates in this country.  Two weeks ago Barnardos produced a stark report, revealing that one quarter of families fear they will not be able to feed their children as rising costs make it harder to put food on the table.  That is the reality for many families around the country.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has revealed that the number of requests for help with fuel in February 2022 has increased by a staggering 497% on the same period last year.  It also revealed that there is a 152% increase in the number of people seeking its support for fuel since January of this year.  That is a clear illustration that the measures the Government has put in place are not meeting the needs of our vulnerable people.  ALONE has said that things are so bad that it has called on the Government for a pandemic-like response to alleviate the rising costs of living to help those in greatest need.  It is clear that the rising costs of energy, coupled with rising rents and other challenges, are placing huge pressures on families already in poverty or at threat of poverty, especially those with children, lone parents or those on fixed incomes.  The Government&rsquo;s focus must be on those people and on helping and supporting them.<\/p>  <p>  We are all aware, we all agree and we all acknowledge that there is a global crisis happening that is outside of the control of the Government and that the market is in a constant state of flux.  However, there is a lot that the Government can do to buffer the experience for those people in need.  It is the lack of preparedness by Governments past and present that means more people are made vulnerable to this changing environment.  The Government&rsquo;s first mistake in this crisis was to delay.  The Government delayed its reaction in the first place and then when it reacted it failed to respond adequately.  The Government has consistently responded in an unambitious and untargeted manner that is not meeting people&rsquo;s needs.  I first raised the issue of rising energy costs back in September 2021 when I asked for statements on the issue in the D&aacute;il, which was refused.  It was clear that a lot more needed to be done in budget 2022 to address existing energy poverty by increasing the supports for those who we knew were about to enter a very difficult winter of rising fuel costs.  While inflation has risen further and faster than even the European Central Bank foresaw, it was clear from early October that winter fuel bills would be challenging for those on low budgets.  The Government failed to respond properly and in time and now we are presented with this unimaginable global situation that will further impact us and that we could never have envisaged.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has come up short in the short-term measures needed to address this issue time and again.  The &euro;200 energy credit that was first spoken about in early December was an untargeted measure that would have benefited people who did not need to receive that support.  The reason that was given for that at the time was that we needed to act quickly with a fast measure that reaches people&rsquo;s pockets as quickly as possible.  That still has not hit people&rsquo;s bank accounts and we are nearly in April.  The Government has failed to move on other issues.  The costs that people are facing are heating and transport.  The reductions in public transport costs have not come into play yet either and they will only benefit people in certain areas of the country, predominantly those in more urban areas.  We appeal to the Government to do a lot more in respect of public transport.  It should invest a lot more to make off-peak travel free so that people can use that if possible.  There is also a need for the Government to focus on rural communities that may not necessarily have access to Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus routes.  The Connecting Ireland plan is a good one but it needs more investment.  We need those local community buses all over our rural areas.  The Government has invested &euro;5 million for this year in Connecting Ireland for the entire country, including every rural route in this country.  It is a tiny amount of money that will not meet anybody&rsquo;s needs.  If the Government was to invest properly in Connecting Ireland, it would help people in this crisis and would also help us to meet our carbon emissions targets.  It would get people into public transport and help those in rural Ireland to deal with this crisis.<\/p> <p> The other issue the Social Democrats have raised time and time again is the fact that a large number of people who are not in receipt of fuel allowance are being hit hard by these rising energy costs.  A huge number of people are struggling despite working and, despite never having a need for these support before, they now need them.  The Government had an opportunity and still does.  It needs to link the fuel allowance and widen it further to those in receipt of the working family payment.  That would make a big difference.<\/p> <p> Another issue the Social Democrats have raised time and time again, which I am glad the Minister finally raised at EU level, is the fact that there is a need for a penalty-free derogation on VAT.  I wonder whether the Government&rsquo;s hesitancy in raising this at EU level is down to the fact that it is actually profiting from higher fuel costs.  The higher the fuel costs are, the more VAT the Government brings in.  I would be interested to see figures in respect of the VAT the Government has pulled in in recent months.  The reduction of excise was on a fixed rate.  It was not on the proportion of the overall fuel cost.  That is why the Government has been hesitant in addressing the VAT issue.<\/p> <p> The Government is not doing the simple things it could be doing.  Where is the energy poverty strategy?  It is years out of date.  I have consistently raised it with the Minister with responsibility for the environment.  There has been little progress on this.  Even things that are within the Government&rsquo;s control, it is not doing them.  It is important that we see movement on these issues.<\/p> <p> We often hear Ministers talking about what they are doing in regard to this issue.  They talk about retrofitting as if it is a short-term measure.  It is clear to people who have tried to retrofit their homes or get State support to do so that it is far from a short-term measure.  The current waiting time is approximately two and a half years, and that is before works begin.  We need to see significant ramping up of the retrofitting programme.  I do not believe the measures the Government is putting in place will meet the needs of that cohort of people who will not be in a position to take out a loan, regardless of the interest rate being offered, to retrofit their homes.  They cannot afford their rent, their mortgages or their childcare costs.  Now, they cannot afford their fuel costs.  They will not be able to take a loan out and we should not expect them to take a loan out to do the job that we need them to do.  We need them to retrofit their homes.  We need them to be more energy efficient.  The Government should be supporting them as much as possible to do that.  Relying on the one-stop shop, on corporate entities and on the market to fix this issue will mean that action will not come quickly enough and that it will not target the right people.  The reality is that this should be a programme that is led by the State, be that through the local authorities.  It should certainly be a State process in which a rapid retrofit programme is put in place that targets households at risk of energy poverty, regardless of whether they are in receipt of social welfare.  That is how it should be done.  Those who can afford retrofitting or get a loan, can work independently through the corporate side of things.<\/p> <p> The Government&rsquo;s responses are not ambitious, quick or fair enough.  That is what this comes down to.  It is about the fairness of it all.  We all need to move away from fossil fuels - that is clear - but some people will need more support to do it.  By doing so, they will buffer themselves from these high and rising fuel costs.  The Government needs to intervene and work with them to make sure they can do so as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200033#FF00200","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647975600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith, Paul Murphy and Barry.  We are happy to support the Sinn F&eacute;in motion on energy price increases and the proposed measures, but we also will move an amendment to the motion that the Government needs to use the powers it has under the Consumer Protection Act to put caps on prices to declare an emergency in respect of the supply of energy and fuel and put caps in place.  The reason we are proposing this - and have done from the beginning - is because, essentially, the Government and most European and global leaders are peddling a lie as to the reasons for the staggering increases in energy and fuel prices.  The increases are not happening because of the weather.  They are not even happening because of the war in Ukraine.  While hundreds of thousands of people are suffering as a result of these energy price hikes, huge numbers of corporations are profiting.  The crisis results from profiteering by energy companies, oil producers, electricity producers and suppliers.  Our Government and EU and global leaders do not want to do anything about it because they are in cahoots with these companies that are making enormous amounts of money.<\/p>  <p>  By way of some facts, a Saudi Arabian oil company's profits last year were $49 billion, up from previous years.  Russia's Surgutneftegas made $9 billion in profit, also up on the previous year.  Shell made $20 billion profit last year, which was up on the previous year.  BP made a profit of $7.5 billion last year, an eight-year high.  Here in Ireland, the ESB's profits were up again last year, standing at just under &euro;700 million.  Energia profits were up 46%.  In the previous year, they were up 45%.  I could go on.<\/p>  <p>  Given that Ukraine is being cited as an excuse, another group of companies making enormous amounts of money out of the crisis there and the global arms industry are those that produce weapons.  Last year, with global expenditure of $2 trillion, profits of up to $520 billion were shared between American, Russian, UK, Chinese and Saudi Arabian companies.  I say to the public out there: \"Do not believe the lies of governments to the effect that everybody is losing in this crisis.\"  Actually, some people are making enormous profits and, sadly, our Government, as well as European and global governments, are facilitating them in doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200034#GG00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1647975600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I welcome this motion and I urge Sinn F&eacute;in to accept our amendment.  It is important that we get our heads around what has just been argued.<\/p>  <p>  First, it is clear that the Government's response is half-hearted and inadequate in the context off the crisis and the job we need to do to relieve the pressure on many of our citizens.  Some &euro;200 and a 20% cut in public transport fares can only be seen in the context of the current situation as a start, not the end.  The idea that any further support of intervention can wait until the budget is insane and tells us just how out of touch the Government is and how submerged it is in its own PR spin.<\/p>  <p>  Second, while presented as some freak of nature, as has been said, or a result of an external disaster, such as the war in Ukraine, it is clear that a significant portion of the rising costs of fuel, energy, electricity, etc., is not the fault of the workings of the market; it is the fault of the market itself.  It is far from some quirk caused by external factors.  The hikes faced by ordinary people stem from deregulation, privatisation and the creation of markets in key areas, such as electricity generation and supply.  I remind the Minister that in this country, we went from having one of the cheapest and most efficient sources of electricity generation in Europe, under the ESB before it was deregulated, to having the present disjointed, dysfunctional system with several generators and multiple suppliers and one of Europe's most expensive electricity supply prices to our citizens.  This deregulation proliferation of competing firms has hindered, not helped, the provision of cheap, safe, efficient power supplies.  For ordinary people, it has been a suffering to ensure that profit, and often hyper-profit, remains the order of the day.  Never waste a good crisis or let anything get in the way of profit.<\/p>  <p>  Third, I am struck by the Government's narrative on this crisis.  It has echoes of other crises, such as in climate and health.  Unless we intervene in the market, how the hell are we going to solve the greatest crisis facing us, namely, that relating to the climate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200034#GG00300","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1647975600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>There is a lot of mysticism that goes on when talking about the increase in energy prices, which basically presents laws of a private, for-profit market as if they are laws of nature.  It is as if these prices are going up by themselves, and that it is a natural disaster about which nothing can be done.<\/p> <p>It removes what is actually going on, which is the profiteering that has already been spoken about.  One other example about which people will know is that Bord G&aacute;is Energy is increasing gas bills by 39% next month.  People simply cannot afford it.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy is a profitable company that was privatised and sold off to the British energy giant, Centrica.  It is a company that's profits doubled last year to more than &euro;1 billion.  There is no increase in the cost of producing gas and oil and certainly not in the cost of producing energy from wind or solar power.  Instead, what is happening is supply and demand.  In other words, massive profiteering by the fossil fuel industry internationally taking advantage of the invasion of Ukraine to drive up prices.  Nothing is being done to tackle the profiteering.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is right to say we need to scrap the carbon taxes and cut the excise duty and VAT.  I also urge Sinn F&eacute;in to back our amendment on price controls, however.  Otherwise, there is nothing to stop the fossil fuel companies from simply pocketing these cuts like they seem to have done with the recent excise duty cut.  We need to stand up to the profiteers and cap energy prices at levels that are affordable for ordinary people.  We need to bring the energy system back into public ownership and under democratic control in order that it can be run in the interests of ordinary people, both workers and householders, as opposed to being run for profit, which is the cause of the current crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200034#GG00400","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647976200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Centrica made profits of &pound;948 million, which is more than &euro;1 billion, last year.  Centrica is the parent company of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, which in turn made profits of &euro;70 million between 2020 and 2021.  This is the company that wants to hike people's gas bills by 39% and electricity bills by 27% from next month.  Is the war on Ukraine to blame for energy price rises?  Yes, but let us be clear; capitalist interests closer to home are very much part of the equation.  Their profiteering is being covered up by the Government but will be exposed by the socialists.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking of profiteering, the ESB made profits of &euro;679 million last year; a State-owned company making massive profits off the backs of the people in a cost-of-living crisis.  What is the Government going to do about this?  The ESB should be mandated by Government to operate now on a break-even basis.  I am not arguing for the ESB to make a loss, merely to break even.  This would not only prevent price hikes; it could even result in price cuts.  Of course, such a move would undersell every for-profit operator in the market.  Quite possibly, they would leave the market and the country as well.  I would shed no tears to see them go and I would offer all their workers good, well-paid union jobs in the ESB.  The Government is prioritising the free market and high prices over the welfare of the people it was elected to represent.  The Government is favouring the profiteers over the people.  If it wants to deny that then it should change the policy.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the energy price hikes on the cost-of-living crisis impact every home and working-class home, none more so than the households of low-paid workers.  The Government increased the national minimum wage by 2.9% at the start the year.  Inflation now runs at 5.6%.  SIPTU economist, Mr. Michael Taft, calculated that 5.6% inflation translates to 8.5% for the lowest paid.  In other words, the Government has, in effect, cut the pay of the lowest-paid workers in this country by more than 5.5%, which is headed now towards 10% as inflation continues to rise.  Government Ministers have for years sneered at the socialist demand for a national minimum wage of &euro;15 per hour.  The Government said &euro;15 is totally unrealistic.  In light of all the relevant information now, I respectfully suggest that anything less than &euro;15 would truly be unrealistic and that this country's national minimum wage rate now needs to change very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200035#HH00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1647976200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I am delighted be able to speak on this very important issue.  As the Minister knows, I represent Galway East, which is predominantly rural.  It has villages and towns and growth centres around Galway city but we have very little in terms of public transport or taxi services available to us.<\/p>  <p>  Those people who elected me to represent them here leave the east of the country and drive into Galway city to work every day.  They can be stuck in traffic for maybe up to an hour, burning away very valuable fuel trying to do that.  It is very expensive fuel and has become even more expensive in the last couple of weeks.  They are trapped in their cars for the simple reason that they do not have any public transport.  It is very limited.  Some private bus providers are doing their best to try to help the situation.  When these same workers go home, however, they have to pay more for their electricity, fuel, heating oil, gas cylinders or whatever they are using to heat their homes.  The cost of food is also rising.  These same people are the backbone of our economy.  They are the people who are bringing in PAYE to make sure we have enough money in the Exchequer to provide the services we provide.  Right now, there is an unprecedented level of increase, which is genuinely having a huge negative effect on these families and their disposable income.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of fuel has also continued to have a negative effect on business, including agriculture.  We need to get to grips with this problem.  We cannot solve the problem straight away but we need to do a few things.  The Government talks about EU rules but at the end of the day, our citizens are the people we have to make sure are protected, not the rules that have been set up.  The rules are there to be adjusted and have been in the past when we had emergencies.  We all know the reasons why fuel prices are rising.  We do not need a preview of what is happening like the previous Minister gave us.  Everybody knows it when they go to the fuel pump.  We do not need to know the analysis of all that.  We need to know what we are going to do.<\/p>  <p>  People on fuel allowance are struggling.  As well as that, the thresholds for the income for fuel allowance need to be adjusted, as do the criteria for people who are trying to get it and who need it.  I have a constituent who is &euro;5 over the limit for fuel allowance.  He is caring for a family member and providing a huge service to the State and yet he cannot get the fuel allowance.<\/p>  <p>  I also contend that we will not see the full effects of what we are talking about today until next autumn when the harvest comes in from our agricultural products.  I have spoken to builders providers, farm suppliers, farmers and agricultural contractors who all believe the effects of increasing costs and scarcity of fertiliser will not be properly seen until next autumn.  A building provider told me last night that he is not buying in any more fertiliser because the next pallet he buys will cost him &euro;500 more than the one he bought last week.<\/p>  <p>  The solution being talked about is energy independence and making sure we have retrofitted houses and public transport.  All of this agenda is fine but it is a medium-term approach.  What we need now is to take away the carbon tax and excise duties and also give additional PAYE credits to our workers - the people who work every day for our country to raise their families.  These things can be delivered now as a matter of urgency.  I ask the Minister to consider them strongly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200035#HH00300","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1647976200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling this motion, which allows us to discuss further the rising cost of living and the developments of the week, which now sees the motion calling for many reductions, including that of VAT which I proposed last week.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the earlier price surges were seen as temporary due to supply chain bottlenecks associated with the lockdown.  The longer they go on, however, the more \"temporary\" fuses into \"permanent\", resulting in the economy moving from underperforming to overheating with no period of stability in the middle.  Once inflation becomes embedded into the system, it is very difficult to wring out.<\/p>  <p>  While acknowledging that not all of the current cost of living problems can be blamed entirely on Government, decisions taken by the Government have certainly made the problem worse than it otherwise would have been.  It is within the Government's power to reverse some of its detrimental decisions.<\/p> <p>Over the past few months, the Government did number of things that are contributing to the problem.  The first major thing that is impacting on the cost of living is the lack of supply in the housing market in the context of both properties for purchase and for rent.  The Office of the Planning Regulator has been advising councils on planning by trying to enforce planning guidelines that are not prescribed in law.  Councillors believe that the advice of the regulator is infallible, which is resulting in many examples of houses not being built, judicial reviews, projects being scrapped and supply being restricted.  We all know that when the supply is restricted, the price of the existing units will increase.  I have yet to see evidence of the Government addressing this issue.  In fact, whenever I raised it previously, I have been met by Ministers trying to stonewall.  Addressing the problems in our planning system would ultimately help with the problems relating to the cost of living.<\/p> <p> The second example relates to petrol and diesel.  Currently, approximately 55% of the price of diesel or petrol comprises  Government taxes and charges.  Every time the carbon tax has increased, the Government has not only benefited from that increase, it has also benefited from the extra VAT being charged.  Likewise, when the wholesale price of petrol or diesel increases, the VAT returns to the Government also increase.  There is no entity in Ireland that has caused fuel prices to increase more than the Government.  Not only does a rise in the cost of diesel hurt the commuter travelling to work, it also means a major increase in the overheads of many businesses.  Anything that needs to be delivered will be more expensive to deliver.  Anything that is farmed will be more expensive to produce.  Ultimately, the consumer will be met with a double or triple whammy of price increases, all resulting from an increase in the cost of motor fuel.  Ending the practice of applying VAT on excise duties would be a start.  Perhaps the VAT rate could be reduced as was done in Poland or maybe we could just get rid of the carbon tax.  All of these options are within the Government's grasp if the political is there to avail of them.<\/p> <p> My third example relates to home heating.  Most people within the Pale may not realise it, but a bag of coal today costs &euro;24.  For every bag of coal that is purchased, the Government takes &euro;7.  Last week, the cost of a bag of coal increased by &euro;4.50 per bag plus VAT.  Another increase of &euro;250 will happen on 4 April.  Then, an increase of carbon tax on 1 May will apply.  All of these are subject to VAT increases, which will make the Government&rsquo;s tax take &euro;8, while the price of a bag of coal will have doubled in the past seven months.  The cost of home heating oil has risen significantly.  I am not sure by how much it has increased in recent weeks, but we have all heard the stories of home heating oil prices going up overnight and of companies not being able to guarantee prices even within the few hours before delivery.  What has surprised me are most utterances from Members of the House about home heating oil purchases of 1,000 l.  Most people or families with whom I speak to are barely able to purchase 300 l at a time.  I am greatly worried about the disconnect between those in this House and the people who are trying to purchase 300 l of home heating oil or a bag of coal.  Nor does the fuel allowance cover the level of increase, about which we have heard from many people today.  We must remember that those who qualify for the fuel allowance are the people who are least able to transition to expensive green alternatives.<\/p> <p> We have one of the highest VAT rates in the world.  We are charging VAT on other taxes.  I do not know how the practice of applying VAT on excise duties was ever allowed to come into play, but it is a scandalous state of affairs that needs to be changed.  The Government must acknowledge that it is morally reprehensible at all times, but moreover at this time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200035#HH00400","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647976800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200036#JJ00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1647976800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I am almost there.

I do not know how many motions or debates we will have to have in order to get the Minister and the Government to have respect for the people who we are supposed represent.  We should respect them as ordinary, hard-working, decent people.  I say this because at the moment the Minister is driving them to misery and into perishing in their homes.  They are unable to drive when they have to drive.<\/p>  <p>  The genie is out of the bottle.  We know that the Government is the single, biggest increaser of price across the board, whether it be Bord G&aacute;is, the ESB, oil, home heating oil or whatever.  The Government has a brass neck to continue doing it.  I asked the Minister two weeks ago whether he would confirm it for me.  However, I know the answer and so does he.  The more the price goes up, the greater the tax take.  They are putting VAT on top of excise duty.  I cannot imagine that the Minister will come in here next month and put on more carbon tax.  I just cannot imagine that.  However, I would not be not surprised.  Take the ESB, for instance.  Most people in ordinary or modest homes have heating bills that have gone up from anywhere between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,300.  The price of a bag of coal has doubled in 12 months.  Who is codding whom here?  They are blaming this on the unfortunate, horrible war in Ukraine.  If there is a war, we should dispense with all of the fanciful green projects and deal with people on a wartime footing.  We should have wartime solutions to wartime situations.  It is as simple as that.  The Minister cannot have his cake and eat it.  He cannot have butter on both sides and jam as well.  The people know full well now and we will keep reminding them of who is the biggest - I hate to use the word &ldquo;tease&rdquo; - who has the biggest impact in the pocket of the housewives and of the people.  It is t&uacute; f&eacute;in.<\/p>  <p>  The ESB made &euro;693 million gross profit last year.  They made &euro;191 million in net profit.  It paid into the Government&rsquo;s coffers &euro;126 million of a gratuity or a fund, thereby robbing the people again.  Why could the Minister not forgo that &euro;126 million and investigate why in the ESB - which a company that is 95% owned by the taxpayer and not the Government - the gross profit was &euro;693 million and the gross profit was only &euro;191 million?  Where did the rest of it go?  They are codding us all the way.  We have sold most off most of our resources here.  We have sold them off.  Bord G&aacute;is had the audacity to come out at the weekend and talk about 30% and 40% increases.  People cannot afford this.  The Government knows that but it does not seem to care.  As I said, if it is a wartime situation, we should opt for wartime solutions.  We should get rid of the fancy pipe dreams that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Green Party have and that the Government is pursuing, along with carbon tax and everything else.

At the same time, I would like to point out that last October when the price increase in fuel crisis was here, I asked Sinn F&eacute;in to help me and the Rural Independent Group to highlight the energy costs and fuel costs.  It took Sinn F&eacute;in until March to finally realise that there was a crisis, although I could see it last October.  I stood here last October and I was heckled by the Minister for Finance.  I spoke to the Minister about the toolbox that Europe gave to him to use.  He told me here in the House at all I was doing was complaining.  Now the entire Opposition is complaining.  What I was saying to the Minister last October was common sense and truth.<\/p>  <p>  All of the expensive Department that the Minister has behind him could not see what an Independent Member sees.  Why does an Independent stand out so much in this D&aacute;il?  It is because we are on the ground with the people of Ireland.  We understand business.  We understand farming.  We understand people.  We understand poverty.  The Minister does not understand.  He was given a toolbox by Europe to use.  The latest figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show that the cost of energy is up by 31.9%, animal feed is up by 18.2%, seed is up by 11.6% and fertiliser is up by a whopping 127%.<\/p> <p>Ireland was directed by the EU to use a toolbox of measures in October 2021 to work with householders and companies and apply tax reductions.  None of this happened.  The EU energy taxation directive allows member states either to exempt households or to apply reduced rates for electricity, natural gas, coal and solid fuel.  This was not done even though the Government had been given a toolbox by the EU to do it.  It stated member states could give effect to these exemptions or reductions in the level of taxation directly.  This was not done either.<\/p> <p> Household electricity costs increased by 70% during 2021.  Bord G&aacute;is last week predicted a hike of 27%.  In real terms, this means a home's electricity costs will increase by &euro;1,300 per annum.  The ESB has announced operating profits of &euro;679 million for 2021.  This country has no alternatives but to burn petrol and diesel to put food on the tables.  People are now coming in from Ukraine and we will hardly have enough food to feed ourselves.  The Irish people wear their hearts on their sleeve and they will give their last bit of food to other people to help them, but the Government taxes us out of existence.  That is all it does because it lacks an understanding of real life in its bubble in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200036#JJ00600","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647977400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>My colleagues in the Rural Independent Group and I have been very vocal on the cost of energy and the sky-rocketing costs of fuel for farmers, parents, hauliers and employers.  In fact, it affects every person in this country.  I again call for the abolition of carbon tax and I ask Sinn F&eacute;in whether it will now join with the Rural Independent Group in calling for the abolition of this punitive and out-of-touch carbon tax.  At the very least, Ireland should now hold a referendum on carbon tax and give the people a say.  Let us debate all the issues and see what the people have to say about carbon tax.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, my Rural Independent Group colleagues and I moved a motion calling on the Government to hold a mini-budget to deal decisively with the cost of living and the energy price emergency.  Unashamedly, all the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party Deputies blocked the motion, voting instead to maintain crippling fuel taxes despite the obvious pain this policy is inflicting on everyone.  Our motion paved the way for the price of home heating oil, petrol and diesel to be dropped significantly.  Instead, Government Deputies are allowing it to climb to more than &euro;2 per litre in order to stay in office and rake in about &euro;1.15 per litre in taxes for the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Our policy on carbon tax has been consistent.  We do not support this unfair and burdensome tax and have been warning of its detrimental impact for many years.  Ordinary families and all rural residents are carbon-tax losers and are carrying the brunt of the Government&rsquo;s mad agenda of keeping the ideology of the Green Party on side.  We pleaded with Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, the Social Democrats, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party not to bring in this carbon tax because it is a tax on the people of rural Ireland and we were ignored.  They all sat on their hands and quite happily voted for it.  Now some of them are crying against it, while the Green Party is wagging the Government&rsquo;s tail continuously, bringing this country close to being ground to a halt.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to a silage contractor who called into my clinic at the weekend.  He said he is going to be paying an additional &euro;130,000 for fuel this year, an astonishing increase.  The Government is standing idly by while the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been going around today like a fool, telling people they will be given a few quid to allow them to sow a bit of seed.  The Government is codding the farmers of Ireland.  They are not fools.  They are going bust.  They cannot even get fuel at this stage, no matter what they are willing to pay for it.  Farmers are in dire trouble.  Fishermen have told me they will tie their boats to the piers until this fuel crisis has been resolved.  One man told it would cost him &euro;30,000 to go out to sea for the week, &euro;27,000 of which would go to the quota.  It would have been pointless for him to go out, so he tied his boat to the pier.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance might not be interested but he soon will be because the public are outraged at the carry-on here.  The 20% discount from public transport fares the Government announced in its mini-budget - it can call it what it wants but it was a joke - has sorted out people who use the DART, the Luas or the train but the private contractors of rural Ireland will not get it, so the young people of rural Ireland will not benefit from that decrease.  The &euro;200 off the electricity bill is farcical.  The Government is laughing in people's faces.  The people are struggling and it is not willing to make a move.  It is drip-feeding small advantages that go nowhere.  The soaring costs of food, heating, fuel and housing are causing social inequality and hardship and are pushing people into poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200037#KK00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1647977400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling this Private Members' motion and welcome the opportunity to speak to it.  The significant increases in energy prices, and the knock-on effect on inflation in general, mean many individuals and families now face a severe cost-of-living crisis and there is no guarantee this crisis will go away any time soon.  Even if, in their current talks, Ukraine and Russia come to some agreement, although there is certainly no guarantee of that, sanctions on Russia are likely to remain in some form.  We are now paying a price for the inaction in regard to moving away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.  Offshore wind farms can give us cleaner energy with security of supply but it will take us decades to get there.<\/p>  <p>  Measures to reduce energy consumption, such as retrofitting, will also take years, if not a decade.  Dublin City Council, in its report last year for its housing committee, stated that at its current level of funding, it will take 12 years to carry out its retrofitting programme.  This needs to be done soon.  Retrofitting all homes and buildings would have a greater impact on CO2 emissions than almost anything else we could do over the next period.  People on medium incomes will not be able to afford the &euro;25,000 it will cost for a full retrofitting of their home, yet they must pay the same level of carbon tax as someone who earns &euro;100,000 a year, who can well afford to get retrofitting done.  As we exit the winter months, the cost of home heating will probably begin to recede as a major problem, but if these circumstances continue into next winter, it will be a nightmare for many individuals and families.  The Government should be preparing an emergency plan for that scenario.  The cost-of-living hikes will continue for a number of years.  The annual rate of inflation was estimated in mid-February to be 5.9% and the latest increases in the costs of energy, electricity and gas will impact heavily on everything.<\/p>  <p>  While I support the measures in the motion, I believe the measures open to the Government in regard to reducing energy prices, which are set on the international markets, are limited.  Such an emergency programme must be targeted at those who are most vulnerable, in low-paid jobs or dependent on social welfare.  There must be a guarantee that no individual or family will be left without electricity or adequate heating or have to make the decision to heat their home or eat.  This can be achieved by a directive from the Department of Social Protection such that those struggling with heating costs or electricity bills will automatically qualify for emergency needs payments.  Alongside the suspension of the 30-hour working rule, an extension of the fuel allowance to those receiving the working family payment should be introduced and other social payments should be examined.  I have repeatedly raised the issue of relocating community welfare officers, CWOs, to the community to make them more accessible to those who need help.  CWOs were removed from the community to make them less accessible as an austerity measure, which now needs to be reversed.<\/p>  <p>  The other aspect of this crisis is the knock-on effect of energy prices in general and especially on food prices.   A recent report by Barnardos on food poverty and its effects on children and families makes for sobering reading.  A total of 25% were found to worry about not being able to provide food for their children, while 79% said the greatest impact was from the rising costs and the pressure on household finances.  A further 51% of parents had cut back spending in areas such as gas and electricity, transport and medical bills to afford food, and 10% of parents and guardians skip meals weekly.  Some 90% of parents felt close to food poverty, while 29% of people had first-hand experience of children for whom the impact of not having sufficient nutritious food was evident.  That this is Ireland in the modern day is just not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's emergency plan must be targeted in this area.  Basing CWOs in the community in order that they can administer a well-resourced hardship is essential, along with providing for increases in core welfare payments.<\/p> <p>Lastly, the trade union movement also has a key role to play.  It must set a target of &euro;15 an hour as a living wage and campaign seriously to achieve it, including marches, rallies and strike action where necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200037#KK00300","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647978000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  I also thank Sinn F&eacute;in for putting forward the motion because it is important we debate it.  While it is one of a number of similar motions over the past while, it shows the importance of the issue as well.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully in support of this motion in its intention to address the rising energy costs.  It is completely inexcusable that more has not been done by the Government to address these costs yet.  There seems to be a complete lack of awareness of and, sadly, of care for families who have been hit the hardest due to increasing energy costs and who are constantly being pushed to the brink with no end in sight.  People cannot be expected to continue as they have done over the past few months.  Costs are spiralling out of control and with no sign of this stopping any time soon, households are getting increasingly desperate and frustrated at this never-ending spiral.<\/p>  <p>  We have all seen the shocking price hike announced by Bord G&aacute;is Energy last week.  An increase in the average electricity bill by 27% and in the average gas bill by 39% from April is an incredible jump that will create an incredible burden.  It has been reported that due to this price hike households' energy bills could rise by approximately &euro;700 per family per year.  This is nearly the equivalent of an average monthly mortgage repayment.  It is like having another mortgage month a year on top of already high energy bills.<\/p>  <p>  Due to Bord G&aacute;is Energy's price jump, many energy providers are expected to follow suit.  Electric Ireland has stated that it has not ruled out an increase as it is exposed to the same wholesale electricity and gas prices as other providers.<\/p>  <p>  Increases such as these particularly affect constituents of mine in Donegal who depend wholly on petrol and oil, and turf, rather than gas or anything else.  Indeed, we all know there is no chance of supposedly cheaper natural gas coming to Donegal anyway.  What is more, Greenleaf Bioenergy stated that it is unlikely there will ever be a gas pipeline into Donegal.  Not only is there no alternative, but we have been advised there never will be one.  It seems the nickname of \"the forgotten county\", once again, rings true as Donegal has been left behind as per usual.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that urgent action is needed and yet despite all the recent price hikes and the threat of even further hikes, the Government has to date stated it is not planning any further cost-of-living measures this side of the budget.  I was absolutely appalled to hear this.  People are struggling to make ends meet and parents are struggling to put food on the table.  Not only is the Government refusing to help them but it is actually intending to punish them further with the introduction of the carbon tax increase in May.  This tax increase will further increase the price of home-heating oil, gas and solid fuels and the last thing that is needed at this crisis time is further increases.  How do we expect people to survive at all?<\/p>  <p>  Government Deputies cannot stand here and say they care about the people of this country and of their constituency while they do nothing to ease the burden of families at the mercy of continuous rising costs.  The decision of the Government to go ahead with the carbon tax increase on households, given these out-of-control costs, would be unforgivable.  The carbon tax as it exists will do nothing but push people further into fuel poverty and do little to make any sort of real change and we need to see structural change on a larger level.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the Minister will say probably in his concluding remarks that the Government has already introduced a package that will give &euro;200 a year off the electricity bills of consumers.  That is correct.  It will do so but it will give &euro;200 a year off a millionaire's electricity bill.  A millionaire who owns four or five houses will get four or five times the &euro;200 off bills whereas somebody dependent on social welfare will get the same amount of &euro;200.  That is wrong.  The excuse the Government gave at the time was that it could not change it because it did not have time to implement a proper scheme to provide for that.  That was last October, when the Government announced it.  The provision still has not come in.  It will not come in until April or May, and yet there still was not time to introduce a proper scheme.  Why should I get &euro;200 off my electricity bill when I can afford it and people on lower incomes than I are getting punished?  We should be putting a proper scheme in place that benefits people who need it.  That is the least we could be doing.<\/p>  <p>  In last year's budget, I put forward ideas on how Ireland could be energy independent in the next ten years using only wind and hydroelectric power, through, for example, the Spirit of Ireland project that has been talked about in Donegal which will look to harness our significant wind energy potential by using our natural coastal valleys to provide hydroelectric storage reservoirs.  Wind farms could be used to pump seawater into these reservoirs which would then be passed through turbines generating significant amounts of power.  Indeed, three of those projects along the west coast would provide all the energy that is required for the country to manage it and it would make wind power available all the time to the country as well.  These are the types of ideas and projects that should be progressed.  Wind and hydroelectric projects not only have the potential to reduce our dependence on imported energy and fossil fuels, but would also address the cost-of-living crisis we currently find ourselves in.  Furthermore, wind and hydroelectric projects could create jobs and benefit us significantly economically.<\/p>  <p>  Something needs to be done.  The Government cannot continue to try to price people in this country out of existence.  Families are running out of options and are being forced to make impossible choices - heat or food, electricity or rent.  What we require is more creativity in how we address the problems we face but the way we address these problems should never be at the expense of ordinary citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200038#LL00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1647978000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I want to open by acknowledging the great challenges many are facing at present due to the rising cost of energy and to the change in the price of gas, oil, coal and diesel, primarily due to the impact of the war taking place in Ukraine.  After the terrible difficulties of the past number of years due to Covid and with all of the challenges imposed on so many, and hoping that was beyond us, I absolutely understand why to be confronted by bills that have gone up so much in recent weeks is a cause of concern to so many and why it is a topic we debate regularly on the floor of the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Given the number of charges being made about the Government not acting because we do not have compassion, the Government not acting because we do not care and the Government not using more money to respond to the needs I absolutely acknowledge are so real for so many, it is important to be crystal clear about one point here this evening, which is that the Government does not have any money.  The money the Government has is the money we collect in taxes from the people and the money we borrow that the people will pay off in the future.  Those are the only two sources of money the Government has available to make decisions about - money we collect in taxes and money we borrow that will be paid off from taxes in the future.<\/p>  <p>  When the charges are made about the Government not doing more because we do not care, what we are doing is recognising two realities that were not acknowledged by any Opposition Member I heard here this evening.  I did not hear - granted, I was not here for all of the debate - a single Opposition Member talk about how much any of his or her measures cost.  There are two realities that we acknowledge.  The first reality we acknowledge as a Government is that the bills or costs that are increasing are, of course, a cause of additional pressure and worry for many.  We understand that, but the other reality we confront is that the money we are collecting through the taxes that most of the Opposition appear to want to abolish in their entirety is the same money we are using to pay for our schools, hospitals, public services and those things that are essential to our society and fundamental to the operation of our country.  The irony cannot but be lost on me that we have many members of the Opposition make the charge that the Government is open to leaving too much to the market to deliver on its behalf while at the same time wanting to cut the very taxes the State needs at present to pay for public services the Opposition wants to improve all the time.  On the one hand, members of the Opposition are repeatedly making the charge that the Government is not doing enough but when it comes to the very money the Government needs to do more with at present for all the reasons the House is so aware of, the Opposition comes in here and, by and large, says we should abolish the taxes that pay for the public services needed at present.  I will come back to that word \"abolition\" in a moment.<\/p>  <p>  Let us look at the steps the Government has taken which were covered off by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming.  Measures worth &euro;1.9 billion have been put in place by the Government using the people's money to respond to the impact of prices we know have already gone up and in anticipation of further change that could happen in the future.<\/p> <p>I refer to the measures that were taken on budget day, in particular regarding personal taxation, that the Opposition voted against.  The Opposition was against tax reductions in October, and it is for them in March.  The measures are making a difference to those on low to middle incomes in particular, who are already paying the higher rate of income tax.  That is something we changed on budget day.  We sought to make progress on it in anticipation of the higher cost of energy and rising inflation as we moved through the year, but the Opposition voted against it - the single measure that could make a difference year by year to the cost of living challenges so many face at the moment.<\/p> <p> Additional measures were introduced earlier this year.  I refer to the &euro;125 payment that will go to those most at risk of fuel poverty and the &euro;200 energy rebate that will soon appear on energy bills.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe stated the Government says it has done enough.  That is not a claim I have ever made, nor would I ever make it, cognisant of the difficulties so many face.  What I say here this evening, as I have said in every debate up to this point, is that we cannot do everything to meet all of the needs the Opposition continually raise regarding the rising cost of energy and every other issue on which the Government also has to make progress.  In recent weeks, we introduced a change in excise on petrol and diesel, again using the country's money to a value of &euro;300 million.  Overall, there are &euro;1.9 billion of measures in response to an issue we appreciate is again a challenge for many at the moment.<\/p> <p> The reality is that regardless of what measures I or the Government have introduced, they would not be enough for the Opposition.  The Opposition would come to the House with the scripts already written and the tweets already drafted.  Regardless of what the Government did, it would not be enough; because it is never enough for an opposition that will always look to change the goalposts on any argument.  Whatever measure the Government brings forward will always be condemned by Sinn F&eacute;in and other Members of the Opposition as not being enough.<\/p> <p> In response to Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe's statement that the Government had indicated that it had done enough, the Government has always been clear that we want to help and to make a difference, but we want to be honest about the constraints we face.  We want to be honest that the only money we have that is available to spend, in dealing with this growing challenge, is the country's money.  It is the taxes we collect that also pay for public services that already face challenges that we want to deal with, of which the Opposition is frequently critical, and where we want to make a difference and improve as we move through this year and beyond.<\/p> <p> Deputy Ellis talked about the cold houses that we know are getting more expensive to heat for too many at the moment.  That is why the Government is going ahead with the national retrofitting programme, which is being co-funded by the carbon tax, the same carbon tax the Opposition wants to get rid of and axe.  On the one hand, the Opposition says we are not making enough progress on retrofitting, while at the same time it wants to abolish the tax that helps to pay for the retrofitting programme.<\/p> <p> I heard the charge from Deputies Paul Murphy, Mattie McGrath and O'Donoghue that the Government is the cause of the price increases that are happening due to the changes in carbon taxation.  Let us be absolutely clear about the truth here: the changes in carbon taxation that the Government has made are a tiny share of the increased costs that we know many face at the pumps, on their bills, in their homes due to the rising cost of energy.  The changes that we have made to the carbon tax are a small share of the overall cost that many are facing and enduring at the moment, but the additional money that we have raised in carbon tax is the same money that is then being used to make progress on the issues the Opposition always call for more to be done to address.<\/p> <p> That leads me to the Sinn F&eacute;in motion before the House this evening, which calls on the Government to take many additional measures in response to the challenge we now face.  I put it to Sinn F&eacute;in that the motion this evening talks about the reduction in VAT.  Today on Leaders' Questions, the party's leader called for the abolition of VAT.  Which is it &ndash; abolition or reduction?  It is one thing to be confronted by an Opposition party that engages in auction politics; it is an entirely different thing to be confronted by an Opposition party that managed to outbid itself in a single day.  That is what we face.  The motion talks about reduction and the party's leader talks about abolition.  Which one is it?  I know the costs are going up for many at the moment, but the Government is doing all it can to help.  We want to be honest about the constraints that we face.  We could do with the same honesty from Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200038#LL00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647978600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>The reply from Sinn F&eacute;in is coming from Deputy &Oacute; Broin, who is sharing time with Deputies Carthy and Kerrane, who will wrap up.

We do not need the Minister to tell us that, because ordinary working families across the State know that.  Nobody on these benches is telling the Government to do everything; we just want it to do more.  The reason we ask the Government to do more is that every single day in our constituencies, as I am sure in the constituencies of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, working families and small businesses are urging them to do more.  The Minister is a constituency politician, as is the Minister beside him.  I know they talk to their constituents every day, as I do.  They are telling us, collectively, in this House that more needs to be done.  They are only too aware of the fact that it is their taxes that fund the public services or any additional temporary relief that the Government provides them with.<\/p><p>It is a bit rich for the Minister to talk about honesty when last week, when Sinn F&eacute;in first started to outline the types of measures that are in this motion today, we were told by the Government that it was not possible - that it was not legal - even though Deputies Kerrane, Doherty and McDonald outlined what was the case.  In fact, probably the most dishonest contribution to this entire public debate has been a Fine Gael tweet which claimed there was no excise duty on home heating oil.  Of course, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, knows, because the officials in his own Department as well as Revenue confirmed to<i>thejournal.ie<\/i>FactCheck that it is not the case &ndash; carbon tax is a form of excise duty.  The Minister knows, but at least tonight he is honest enough to make the argument that it is about cost and not legality.<\/p><p>The problem is that the measures taken to date, those that were outlined in the budget, which were not enough to deal with the rising cost of living at that stage, or the measures that were taken a week and a half ago, are not doing enough to constrain the rising cost of fuel.

I would go further and say, if anything, they came across as disinterested in the realities that face many of the people we all represent.  Unfortunately, it is not surprising because from time to time we have heard the real inclinations of a Government that is quite simply out of touch: from a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister of State telling people to shop around, to a Green Party leader telling us to drive slower, to a Fine Gael Minister for Finance who tonight essentially confirmed that he has no intention of doing anything further.  The next measure that this Government will implement regarding the cost of living crisis is to increase those costs further through an additional hike in the carbon tax in May.<\/p>  <p>This is not fair.  It is not fair on those ordinary people who are consistently asking themselves what the Government has delivered to alleviate the increased prices they are bearing on essential heating, travel and electricity costs, but who are largely coming up blank.<\/p> <p> We are a food-producing nation and an affluent State.  It is not good enough that families with two earning workers have to make the stark choice, as they do today, between eating or heating their homes.  I am sure the Minister knows people who are in this position.  Certainly, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys does, because they are her constituents as well as mine.  They tell me about keeping an eye on the gauge as they travel home, holding their breath, hoping they can make it and trying to get through today because they are afraid to even think about tomorrow.  There has never been a boom for many of those same workers; just a bust.  This Government has forced upon many of those people exorbitant rents or mortgage rates, childcare costs and insurance premiums and is now, through its lack of support, leaving them with the choice about how they can put food on the table.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward proposals that will make things a little better.  They will not resolve everything because we understand the Government cannot do everything but it can do much more.  It is shameful that Government Deputies will, in effect, vote through an amendment this week that proposes precisely nothing additional is done to help those hard-pressed workers and families. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200039#MM00400","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647979200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I am at a loss to know how the Government's response to what it calls an energy crisis can be described as comprehensive.  The main issue being debated and that has been raised by those who have spoken is household heating costs.  The Minister said that the Opposition would not be content no matter what Government proposal is brought forward, but there is no proposal regarding household heating.  That is the problem.  Aside from the &euro;200 electricity credit announced nearly four months ago, which we are still waiting for, nothing has been brought forward to assist people with heating their homes.  That is a fact.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has overemphasised the fuel allowance time and time again but the vast majority of workers and households do not receive that allowance.  A person out sick from work on illness benefit cannot get the fuel allowance.  Someone who is on a low income and relying on the working family payment to top up that income cannot access the fuel allowance.  A couple or older person with a small occupational pension does not get the fuel allowance.  The Minister spoke a lot about energy efficiency but energy efficiency and retrofitting are completely irrelevant for people today who cannot pay their bills.  That is a fact.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also overemphasised the exceptional needs payment but what the Minister has not said each time he has raised it is that if someone works 30 or more hours per week, he or she cannot access that payment.  That means there is no assistance or support for any worker who is working 30 hours or more a week.  That worker has nothing; no help, no assistance and no support.  He or she does not get the fuel allowance or the exceptional needs payment.  That is the cohort we are referencing in this motion, primarily, and the Minister has no proposals for them.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised the matter of the discretionary fund for 13 months now; I brought that forward in February last year.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul clearly does not think the exceptional needs payment fund is working either, otherwise it would not be suggesting a discretionary fund.  We need a fund for people, especially those who cannot access the fuel allowance, to assist them with utility debt in particular.  This is something the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, has raised repeatedly and for which the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has been calling for more than a year now.  If the exceptional needs payment that the Government keeps pushing was working and doing its job we would not need the discretionary fund, but clearly it is not.  We ask in our motion that the fuel allowance in particular be extended to those people who are receiving the working family payment.  We have also asked that the fuel allowance be extended by two additional weeks.  We know the fuel allowance was cut by Fine Gael in 2012.  It was at 32 weeks.  It is now at 28 weeks and has still not been restored to what it was.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned those people I have engaged with in the past week in advance of tabling this motion.  These include a mother who gets up in the middle of the night to refill her children's hot water bottles because she cannot afford oil; a nursing student who is commuting daily to college but has to miss days because she cannot afford to fill her car to run for five days; and a working couple who have to decide next month whether they make their mortgage payment or get a fill of oil.  A worker in the oil industry told me about older people who are crying on the phone about how they will afford coal as the price of bags of coal continues to increase.  Nothing the Minister said this evening, nothing he said earlier and nothing that is in the Government's amendment will assist or do anything for these people.  This is not make-believe; these are real people and real families.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister does not want to listen to Sinn F&eacute;in or people in the Opposition, he should listen to people such as those in ALONE, which is a huge organisation that has been representing older people in this State for a very long time, who are telling us that older people in 2022 are deciding between buying food and buying fuel.  He should listen to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which has seen an almost 50% increase in calls in February of this year compared with last year.  People are calling that organisation looking for help with their energy costs.  These are primarily older people.  They are somebody's mother, father, granny or grandad, who are deciding between fuel and food.  It should not happen, but it is happening all the time.  Nothing the Minister said this evening will make a difference.  The Minister has clearly said that anything he does will not be enough but I will again make the point that he has done nothing on home heating oil.  I again ask him to look at it and to look at this motion and the proposals we have brought forward.  I have a list of costings if the Minister would like to see them.  He should know that we never bring forward any proposals that are not fully costed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200040#NN00200","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647979200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1647979200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Wednesday, 23 March 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200040#NN00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna ar Sonra\u00edodh Uain D\u00f3ibh - Priority Questions","time":1647979200,"counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200040#NN00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments","time":1647979200,"counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200040#NN00550"},{"type":"question","time":1647979200,"counter":230,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[14850\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200040#NN00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to an issue (details supplied) in relation to the legislation regarding the liable relatives unit and the significant challenges it presents to lone parents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1647979200,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The Minister will be aware of the legislation that was debated on Second Stage in the House two weeks ago.

There is a legal responsibility on parents, whether married or unmarried, to maintain dependent children in accordance with their means.  The legislation on liable relatives is not to be confused or conflated with the payment of maintenance.  Under the liable relative provisions, the Department is not arranging maintenance but ensuring, where possible, that where a one-parent family payment is in place the other parent makes a financial contribution towards the cost to the State of providing that support.<\/p>  <p>  This recoupment can be done in two ways.  First, the liable relative can pay an amount to my Department directly.  Alternatively, the liable relative can make the payment to the one-parent family payment recipient.  Where this happens, it will be assessed as means and the level of the one-parent family payment may be adjusted as a result.  The fact that the liable relative provisions do not extend to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment has led some to suggest that the obligation on the non-resident parent to pay child maintenance ceases when the child turns seven and the other parent moves from the one-parent family payment to jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.<\/p> <p>This is not the case and people are advised of this at the time.  Furthermore the liability to maintain family provisions contained in social welfare legislation are separate to and do not negate or supersede parents' obligations under family law.  <\/p> <p> The Government established the child maintenance review group to review certain issues in respect of child maintenance.  The group is chaired by former Circuit Court Judge Catherine Murphy and includes legal, policy and academic professionals as well as officials from the Departments of Social Protection and Justice.  The group is examining the liable relative provisions under its terms of reference.

In order to receive jobseeker's transitional payment in the first place, a lone parent must prove that they have sought maintenance.  In some instances, this forces lone parents into court.  We know that this happens from the lone parent organisations SPARK and One Family, which have raised this issue many times.

Until the child reaches the age of seven years, the one-parent family payment is made to the parent who is looking after the children.  The other parent, therefore, should pay the State out of his or her income towards the support of the child.  Such parents can do it in two ways, either by paying it directly to the State or to the parent who is looking after the child, whose one-parent family payment is reduced accordingly in order that he or she still receives the same amount.<\/p>  <p>  It is complicated and I accept that.

A fast-track approach in processing these supports includes a simplified decision-making process and quick processing of PPS numbers to allow access to public services.

Last month, the Government agreed a further package of &euro;505 million, including the &euro;200 energy credit and a lump sum payment of &euro;125 for those in receipt of the fuel allowance.<\/p>  <p>  The supplementary welfare allowance is a demand-led scheme acting as a safety net within the overall social welfare system to help eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.  The 30-hour rule regarding exceptional needs payments reflects the fact exceptional needs payments are primarily aimed at those who have limited income from employment.  Those working at or above the 30-hour limit will have earnings above the basic supplementary welfare level of payment or may also be entitled to other in-work supports from my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone works above the 30-hour limit, the urgent needs payment is more appropriate, as it is not limited to those working less than full-time hours.  As with the exceptional needs payment, urgent needs payments can be made on a flexible basis, taking into account all the relevant circumstances.  Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  I encourage any person who considers that he or she may have an entitlement to an exceptional or urgent needs payment to contact the community welfare service at his or her local Intreo centre.

Most of these people are elderly and some of them are very ill.  Many of them are paying mortgages, rent and loans.  Nothing is taken into account other than income.  In many cases, their outgoings far exceed their income.

The social impact of budget measures is also modelled using the SWITCH model developed by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  It is through this approach that, over the past ten years, budget measures have exceeded inflation and have been targeted to support those most at risk of poverty.  Having said that, I am aware that, due to the geopolitical situation, the increase in consumer prices, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices, has exceeded even the highest forecasts for price increases.  That is why this Government did not await a further budget cycle but acted early.<\/p>  <p>  To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government announced a package of measures in February that will have a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.  This package will cost in excess of &euro;500 million.  These measures include an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 to all households in receipt of the fuel allowance payment, which was paid last week at a cost of approximately &euro;49 million.  This means low-income households will see an increase of 41% in fuel allowance support provided during this fuel allowance season compared with last season.  When added to the electricity costs emergency benefit payment of &euro;200, which will be paid to each household in April, the combined value is &euro;325, which is the equivalent of just under ten weeks of fuel allowance payment.  The increase of &euro;10 to the weekly income threshold of the working family payment is also being brought forward.  This measure will now take effect from early April 2022 rather than from June.  These measures are in addition to those introduced as part of budget 2022, which included the largest social welfare budget package in 14 years.  In January, around 1.4 million people received a &euro;5 increase in weekly payments, and more if they had dependants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200047#UU00500","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1647983400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response and I welcome the steps she, the Department and the Government have taken so far to help with the rising costs of living.

Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.  A primary qualifying condition for these carer payments is that the applicant provides full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care.  The person being cared for must be so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention and be likely to require this full-time care and attention for at least 12 months.  However, to support a carer&rsquo;s continued attachment to the workforce and broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some employment, education or training while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full-time care.  In these circumstances they can continue to receive their full payments.  The maximum period in which a person may engage in employment, education and training is 18.5 hours per week.  I consider that limit of 18.5 hours to represent a reasonable balance between meeting the care recipient's requirement for full-time care and the carer's need to maintain contact with the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to income supports, my Department has utilised the Dormant Accounts Fund to support projects that promote training and support for family carers.

The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  In acknowledgement of the important role that family carers play in our society, I introduced a number of measures as part of budget 2022 in relation to supports provided by my Department.  These include the following changes to the carer's allowance means test, which will take effect in June of this year.  There will be an increase in the weekly income disregard for carer&rsquo;s allowance to &euro;350 per week for single carers and &euro;750 for carers with a spouse or partner, and an in increase in the capital savings disregard for carer&rsquo;s allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000.

It was something he raised with me, in fairness to him.<\/p>  <p>  A more generous means assessment for carer&rsquo;s allowance has been called for over successive budgets by organisations representing carers.  This increases the general weekly income disregard and will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for carer&rsquo;s allowance and, therefore, provide an income support to carers whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities.  Increasing the capital disregard will allow carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings, often to provide sufficient moneys to care for a loved one, to retain these savings without it impacting upon their carer&rsquo;s payment.<\/p> <p>It also brings the capital formula applied to savings in the means assessment for carer&rsquo;s allowance in line with disability allowance.  Notwithstanding the increased level of support that in place for carers, I have asked my Department to keep these measures under review as part of the annual budgetary process.  We are currently doing a review of recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance so that they can immediately benefit from the changes that we will bring in in June.  There are thousands of carers on the reduced rate and they will get an increase because of those changes.  We are doing the review and it is important that we review all of these schemes during the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200049#WW01400","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647985200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Is f&eacute;idir teacht ar Cheisteanna Scr&iacute;ofa ar www.oireachtas.ie.\r\n\r\nWritten Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1647985200,"counter":352,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200050#XX00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1647985200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Jennifer Whitmore - to discuss the recent closure of the Wicklow town citizens information centre in County Wicklow; (2) Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v - to discuss the publication of the matrix-algorithms used to determine eligibility for the amended DEIS programme; (3) Deputies Michael Ring, Louise O'Reilly, Dara Calleary, Rose Conway-Walsh and Maurice Quinlivan - to discuss Government supports to employees and subcontractors affected by (details supplied) going into receivership; (4) Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin - to discuss implementation of recommendations from the interim report on mortality in the single homeless population 2020; (5) Deputy Maurice Quinlivan - to discuss steps to ensure completion of the Coonagh to Knockalisheen road in Limerick; (6) Deputy Pauline Tully - to discuss the High Court ruling dated 11 March 2022 in CTM and JA <i>v<\/i>.

Some schools were disappointed and surprised that they were not included in the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme.  I understand that it is a process whereby the Department, as far as it has access to data, has used objective data to try to determine which schools should be part of the scheme.  My understanding is that the primary online database, POD, information given is name, address, Eircode postcode, PPSN, pupil ID number, gender, nationality, whether the mother tongue is English or Irish, ethnic or cultural background - presumably that means Roma, Traveller, etc. - and religion.  The other source of data is the Pobal HP deprivation index for small area data.  My understanding is that data is into the mixer.  It is a little bit of one and a little bit of the other.  Which of those details is the Department using?  Clearly, as the Minister has said previously, it uses the small area data.  What weighting is given to each index?  For example, the Department knows where the children live because it has their Eircode postcodes and knows their nationality.  These are the kinds of questions that I think need to be clarified.  What happens if one parent is Irish and one is non-Irish?  Does it depend on where the child was born?  What happens if both parents are naturalised Irish and a child was born here, etc.?  Because the information the Department has is fairly scant, how does it work this out?  Schools authorities will look at this and will say:<\/p> <blockquote> \tHang on the second.  Was the information we gave accurate, and did it reflect all of the possibilities?  We never realised that such a major decision would be made on our application to the scheme based on this data. <\/blockquote>  <p>Another issue that arises relates to ethnic or cultural background.  Let us take it that that means Roma and Traveller ethnicities.  The Minister specifically mentions, in fairness to her, educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners.  Here again we might challenge.  While I do know how we will deal it, I want to highlight it here this evening.  Many people from Traveller or Roma background might not identify as such for various reasons.  There were some interesting examples of that on the television on &ldquo;Claire Byrne Live&rdquo; last night.  People said that they hid their identity for fear that it would be a disadvantage to them.  I recall a Traveller parent who came to me.  She was really suspicious when she was enrolling her child as to why the school wanted to know whether the parent was a Traveller because she felt that if she said, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, it might be a reason that the school would use - I knew the school would not have used it, but she did not know that - to not accept the pupil in the school.<\/p><p>I know of two schools in particular that seem to have an odd situation.  One is a school that everyone would say is very mixed in terms of nationality and the background of children.  It is in an area that is certainly not that affluent.  It has missed out on the scheme or the second time whereas, in the same area, other schools that would seem more advantaged have been accepted into the scheme, although I do not begrudge that.  The second school is an island school.  One school on the island was in and the other school on the same island was out.  This seems unusual.  Again, if we knew the matrix in detail at least people would have some understanding of how the Department arrived at its answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200050#XX00500","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1647985200,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  DEIS is the main policy initiative of my Department to tackle educational disadvantage at school level.  Schools in the programme avail of a range of targeted supports aimed at tackling educational disadvantage, including additional classroom teaching posts, home-school community liaison co-ordinator posts, DEIS grant funding and access to the school completion programme.<\/p>  <p>  On 9 March, I was pleased to announce the expansion of the DEIS programme.  This will see the programme extended to an additional 310 schools.  In addition, 37 existing DEIS schools are being reclassified and are eligible for increased supports.  These schools were identified as having the highest levels of educational disadvantage.  This now means that in the 2022-23 school year, there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS programme, 960 of which are in primary and 234 in post-primary.  <\/p>  <p>  From next September, more than 240,000 students, or nearly one in four students, will be supported in the programme.  This is the largest ever single investment in the programme, and it will extend DEIS status to schools that are serving the highest proportions of pupils at a risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  From 2023, the Department will spend in the region of &euro;180 million on the DEIS programme.  This is an increase of &euro;32 million.  This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated level of disadvantage in schools.  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model, which is an objective statistics-based model.  The model was applied equally to all schools.  The model uses address information that schools provide under their annual returns to the Department.  These addresses were then combined with the Pobal HP deprivation index, which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  The HP index divides the country into approximately 18,500 small areas, with approximately 100 dwellings in each.<\/p>  <p>  The refined DEIS identification model being applied to schools in 2022 builds on the objectivity and fairness of the 2017 version, but now captures a greater breadth of disadvantage and accounts for severity of disadvantage through the application of a weighted process.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students who are residing in direct provision or students who are residing in emergency homeless accommodation.  Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme.  The model has been fairly and equally applied to all schools.  To ensure all schools are treated equally and fairly, those that have not been included in the programme at this time will have an opportunity to have the decision reviewed.  The Department will provide further information in the coming days on this appeals process on its website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200050#XX00600","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1647985200,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply, but to certain extent it reminded me of Tim Figgerty from long ago, although the Minister is probably too young to have ever heard of him.

It is only fair, in the interests of transparency, that the Department would give detail of the mathematical formula it used in order that people making appeals will know how they failed to get into the scheme and what information carries the most weight.

The HP deprivation index, as employed by the DEIS model, is also employed in a number of Departments, including the Departments of Justice, Health and Social Protection.  The tool measures relative advantage or disadvantage.  There are 18,500 small areas of approximately 100 dwellings, and the purpose is to identify not individual deprivation but pockets of deprivation, that is, what is called cumulative disadvantage.  It has been acknowledged in both national and international studies that, where there is an accumulation of disadvantage in an area, that is an even more significant disadvantage to a student.  It is for that purpose that we have this model in order that targeted interventions can take place where there is cumulative disadvantage.

The ice in the Antarctic and in Greenland is melting at an alarming rate, as was stated in a joint report published in Ireland last year by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Marine Institute.  That report, in a finding similar to that of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, found that sea levels are, as a result, rising at a startling rate.  It is really frightening.  John Englander, a climatologist and oceanographer, wrote a book called <i>Moving to Higher Ground<\/i>, which I would recommend to anybody who is interested in this topic.  It is truly frightening.<\/p><p>In my constituency, for example, Midleton, Youghal, Cobh and Shanagarry will be impacted, as will Waterford, Westport and Galway.  This is going to happen; it cannot be stopped.  I have read a lot about this issue.  The sea levels are going to continue rising.  We can talk about climate change, reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and so on, but that will not impact on this at all.  The sea levels are going to continue to rise.  The UK has established a flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy action plan and it is in place.  The Dutch saw this coming - they would have, of course - and in 2008, they established a serious action plan.<\/p><p>As for what will happen when the sea continues to rise, the predictions are quite frightening.  It is difficult to predict but scientists say that by the end of the century, sea levels could have risen by 1 m.  We might not think that is a lot, but the impact that would have on our towns, cities and utilities would be very significant.  When the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage launched the national coastal change management strategy steering group in 2020, he stated 2 million people in Ireland could be impacted, as well as all our major cities and utilities, and that cannot be stopped.  We have to start planning for it now.  We have to ask what we can do.  For instance, can people who live in an area that might be flooded get insurance for their homes?  Can property be insured in case that happens, which it will?  What can we do?  Will we put strategies in place to protect property or should we all, as John Englander suggested in his book, move to higher ground?  There is no point waiting until the sea water is up to our knees and then saying we should have planned for this 20 years ago.  Now is the time to put a plan in place with a series of actions and strategies to mitigate this.  There is no point waiting until it is too late.<\/p><p>I am anxious that the national coastal change management strategy steering group would report soon in order that we can debate its recommendations in the House, analyse them and put in place an action plan, as is the case in the UK, the US and elsewhere.  Even the US Department of Defense stated in 2016 that the country needed to start planning then, and it did so.  Many parts of the world could disappear, including Florida and Bangladesh.  Many cities throughout the world will be under threat, but we have to look after our own patch in Ireland.  We should not confuse the reduction in greenhouse gases with the real challenge of dealing with increased flooding from the rising sea.  They are different things.  This is going to happen.

I welcome the opportunity to bring some clarity on the matter.  Climate change projections indicate flooding events are expected to become more frequent and severe in the future.  This will have a considerable impact on flood risk in Ireland, particularly where our cities and most of our main towns are located, either on the coast or alongside our estuaries or rivers.<\/p>  <p>  Following the review of national flood policy launched in 2018, the OPW flood risk management plans, which are a roadmap for flood risk management measures, will, in conjunction with flood risk schemes already constructed, provide protection to approximately 95% of properties assessed to be at significant risk of flood.  Building on the flood risk management plan, the OPW has published a climate change sectoral adaptation plan for flood risk management 2019 to 2024, in line with the requirements of the national adaptation framework and the Climate Action Plan 2019.  The sectoral plan, approved by the Government in October 2019, includes 21 actions, which are being implemented as part of the strategy, to meet the objectives of ongoing research and assessment, adapting our flood risk management practice across government to effectively manage the potential impacts of climate change on future flood risk.<\/p>  <p>  To support the need for adaptation, the Government established the interdepartmental group on managing coastal change to scope out an approach for the development of a national co-ordinated and integrated strategy to manage the projected impact of coastal change.

It has met on three occasions to date and is also supported by a technical working group.<\/p> <p>During 2021, to assist and support the work of the group, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the OPW also engaged in a series of bilateral meetings with relevant Departments and key stakeholders to discuss the emerging work of the group and to allow issues relating to coastal change management to be identified and explored in the context of the particular operations of the participating organisations.

That part of our island that will be under water will not emerge again.  It will be submerged forevermore.<\/p>  <p>  Flood risk is a misnomer in some ways.  I would prefer if we were talking about sea level rise.  It will rise and it will not go back down because the ice melts.  For the Ceann Comhairle's information, there are 200,000 glaciers shrinking in the world.  Some of these are enormous; they are as big as Manhattan.  If all the ice in Greenland and the Arctic were to melt, global sea levels would rise by 200 ft or 60 m higher than they are at present.  Neither I, the Ceann Comhairle nor anyone here will see that, but our children or grandchildren will possibly be affected by this.  It is serious, it is happening and there is no point in waiting until it is up to our knees or our oxters.  We have to start planning for it now and to start talking about it now.<\/p>  <p>  I very much want to see the interdepartmental group the Minister of State referred to publish its report fairly soon.  The UK and other countries are way ahead of us on this.  They have action plans.  They have things happening right now to plan for this.  We have to start doing it before it is too late.  There is no point in having the Minister of State below in Waterford with the water coming in over her wellies and saying, like King Canute, that it will go out at some stage; it will not.  It will come in and it will stay in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1647986400,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I have listened carefully to Deputy Stanton's views.

Funnily enough, and call me old fashioned, I did not mention the Department of Health and specifically did not mention mental health.  That is for others to determine.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk about post offices, which as the House will be aware have been under threat for many years.  Consecutive governments of all colours and none have paid lip service.  We have gone to the public meetings, we have listened and we have done the three bags full, but we have continued to close them, digitise, strip out services and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Next week, the postmasters' union will contemplate whether to take industrial action and withdraw services.  Meanwhile we had a very detailed Grant Thornton report published in 2020.  The shortfall is only &euro;17 million for a service the report indicates gives a value to the communities of between &euro;335 million and &euro;750 million.  These are hardly snake oil claims from an unknown company because the Government subcontracts many of its decisions to companies just like Grant Thornton.<\/p>  <p>  I have some suggestions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, was given specific responsibility last year, having trawled through all Government agencies in the Departments, to see what additional work we could give to post offices.  As the Minister of State will see, the Ceann Comhairle will agree, and Deputies who are here a hundred years, such as Deputy Ring, will have seen hundreds of times before, there are more questions on the Question Paper today to do with passport applications than in the history of the State.  Twenty years ago, when I came here first, there was a drop box out at Leinster House, and when we came in we would put in the applications.  If there was a problem, you would get a call, you would get it dealt with and you would be going home to the west on a Thursday evening with the passport for whatever family.  Now we have gone in reverse.  There is an additional &euro;10 million in the budget, 300 more staff but still there is one child in my neighbourhood waiting eight months for a passport.<\/p>  <p>  I will make an outrageous proposal that we look, as we have often done in the past, to the UK where they have a check and send proposal for UK passports for which the postmaster gets &pound;16 or, if we convert it at today's rate, approximately &euro;19.20.  This would go a long way to help the many families throughout the country with basic errors.  The postmaster could say the date is wrong, the signature by the garda is in the wrong place or the consent form is not uploaded correctly.  We could have a level 1 checking system instead of pallets of post in Balbriggan or, for the Munster passport applications, in Cork.  No doubt the public would quite happily pay a score for the purpose so that they would not have to cancel the holiday or miss the loved one's funeral or so they could get medical attention on the cross-border scheme or whatever else.<\/p>  <p>  I suggest to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, on whom the postmasters' union has been waiting since before Christmas to come back to it, that here is one tangible measure with which not one Deputy in this House or Senator in the Seanad would disagree.  Let the post office do a level 1 check on all applications and help applicants to upload digitally.  Then we could, in the words of some of my own intelligence officers in the Passport Office, take up to four days' work off an individual application as they are currently being processed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200052#ZZ00600","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1647986400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy MacSharry for the question.

The passport service expects to receive 1.4 million passport applications in 2022.  So far this year, it has issued 264,000 passports.  This means 41% of the total number of passports issued in 2021 have been issued in less than three months this year.<\/p> <p> There are currently more than 182,000 applications in the passport service system.  While this is a very high volume of applications, it does not represent a backlog.  These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports occurring every day.  The passport service is currently processing 45% of adult online renewal applications in one working day, while 95% of online child renewal passports are issued within the advertised processing time of 15 working days.  These turnaround times, especially for adult renewals, are possible due to the inherent efficiencies of the online system and cannot be achieved in the traditional paper-based system.  They also compare very favourably with processing times internationally in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Denmark and Spain.<\/p> <p> As a result of the investment the Department is making in the passport service, the turnaround time for first-time applications has recently been reduced from 40 working days to 35 working days, even in the context of the unprecedented volume of applications being received.  The passport service is focused on reducing this processing time even further in the coming months.  The passport service continually works to streamline the application process and to improve its customer service.  It also monitors and responds to issues that arise for applicants during the application process.<\/p> <p> A number of measures are in place to ensure that passport applicants complete their applications correctly.  The Department of Foreign Affairs website has been updated to include a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application.  When applying online, the applicant is given comprehensive instructions on what documents to submit.  The customer service hub is available to answer applicants' questions by phone or webchat.  The customer service hub handled almost 170,000 queries in 2021 and has responded to more than 60,000 queries since the beginning of this year.<\/p> <p> The passport service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly.  The passport service operates its paper-based, mail-in passport express service through An Post.  This provides an option for citizens to submit their passport application through the network of more than 1,000 post offices across the State.  All types of passport application, both renewal and first-time applications, can be made via the passport express service.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is in regular contact with An Post regarding possible initiatives to develop this service further.  Currently, more than 90% of passport applications from Ireland and overseas are received through the passport online service.  This is an increase from 47% in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200052#ZZ00700","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647987000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for reading out the reply.

I expect the other Deputies in the Chamber and you, a Cheann Comhairle, would agree that the lived experience of passport processing in this country is that we have gone into reverse, at warp speed.<\/p>  <p>  The helpline for Deputies is not fit for purpose.  I will give an example.  The Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, will be annoyed that I am putting this on the record but I am going to do so.  He rang the Deputies' helpline on a Tuesday and said he was a Minister and had someone who needed a passport by the Friday to attend a funeral in New York on the Saturday.  He was told there was not a hope.  He was laughed at.  He dutifully went back and told the person seeking the passport he was sorry but he could not make it happen.  The Minister of State was told he was useless and the person said he would go to someone else to get this done.  The Minister of State told the person he was welcome to do so but that, in his view, the person would not succeed.

The Government has responsibility for this because, as recently as July, it awarded a major tender to Roadbridge to complete the N5 from Ballaghadereen to Scramogue, thereby sending a message of confidence in the company.

The fact is many subcontractors and suppliers have now been burnt twice in the past decade and this is catastrophic.

Following joint engagement late last week with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Social Protection, the receiver has confirmed to employees that there is no statutory restriction on them taking up additional employment during a statutory redundancy consultation period in circumstances where they are not expected to attend the workplace.  Provided that they do not resign from their current employment, there should be no obstacle to retaining their statutory redundancy entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Social Protection have already met with the receiver and employee representatives to provide information and assurances regarding measures taken to accept online applications for income support as quickly as possible.  My Government colleague, Deputy Heather Humphreys, the Minister for Social Protection, has already gone on record to encourage individuals now seeking jobseeker's payments to apply online so that her Department can process their claims as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been in regular contact with the company, including engaging in discussions with the acting CEO of Roadbridge and the receiver to investigate whether any Roadbridge contracts can be fulfilled by other operators in the market.  This, however, will be challenging given the current inflationary pressures.  Nevertheless, these discussions are ongoing and everything possible will be done to achieve as positive an outcome as possible.  Indeed, the receiver has given an undertaking to continue discussions with Enterprise Ireland on the ground in the coming days to further discuss how Enterprise Ireland can further support employees and subcontractors impacted by the receivership.<\/p>  <p>  Indications are that the staff of Roadbridge should be able to find alternative employment very quickly.

The Department is still gathering information as to the scale of the potential adverse impacts on sub-suppliers and subcontractors and it would certainly welcome any further intelligence or information that Deputies may have in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  There were a couple of questions.  Will employees be able to access income supports?  Yes, the Department of Social Protection has moved quickly to ensure that employees can access income supports through online application.  Can an employee take up another job?  There is no statutory restriction on employees taking up additional employment during the 30-day consultation period in circumstances where they are not expected to attend the workplace.

Businesses that have been in operation, some of them for 30 or 40 years, and family businesses that have been in operation for 70 or 80 years, will now be put out of business by a company like this.  The Government has to step in.  I again say to the receiver, and it was in the Minister of State's reply, that another company will not come in to finish that project.  We had the Shell to Sea debacle.  We will now have another debacle but I will be with those businesses, as will Deputies Calleary and Conway-Walsh.  We will not allow another contractor to come in unless our people are paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200054#BBB00500","speaker":"1500"},{"type":"speech","time":1647987600,"counter":395,"content":"<p>The best support the Government can give is to get these subcontractors paid.  I welcome the changes that have been made for employees but there are subcontractors tonight who are facing redundancy decisions for their employees.  Semi-State companies, such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and Government agencies, had these contracts.  Bonds are in place on these projects that can be used to pay subcontractors and insurance policies are also in place.  That is why I reiterate the call for an urgent taskforce from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to establish what is available so these companies can be given that information and can pursue it.  I reiterate what Deputy Ring said.  Other companies are being asked to price jobs.  As we speak, they are on-site pricing jobs for some of the projects, while Mayo-based companies are being left without any money.  That cannot be allowed to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200054#BBB00600","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1647987600,"counter":396,"content":"<p>The people of Mayo will not stand for this.

There was some confusion on that matter.  The receiver clarified the issue with Roadbridge employees on 15 March that provided they do not resign from the current employment there is no statutory restriction on employees taking up additional employment during the 30-day consultation period in circumstances where they are not expected to attend the workplace.  Those are the two caveats: if one is not expected to attend the workplace and also that one does not resign from one's current job.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is now working in a co-ordinated way to assist the workers in terms of employee supports.  The receiver issued a clarification on 15 March which should at least ease the fear of workers and provide assurance that the State will provide appropriate supports to them.  The Intreo services of the Department of Social Protection will proactively help them to assess opportunities available for employment or appropriate training and development options.  The concerns expressed by the Deputies about sub-suppliers and subcontractors are very real.  The Department does not know yet the exact scale of the debt problem in Roadbridge but it could be significant.  It may be that the only route for recovery is through the normal insolvency and receivership process.  It may be, therefore, that certain major construction projects will suffer delays if such projects need to be retendered.  However, the Minister and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are working across Government, including with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Transport to examine what options are available with regard to how these projects might be progressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200055#CCC00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from the Seanad","time":1647988200,"counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200055#CCC00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1647988200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill 2022, without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200055#CCC00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647988200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar athl&oacute; ar 9.33 p.m. go dt&iacute; 9.12 a.m., D&eacute; C&eacute;adaoin, an 23 M&aacute;rta 2022.\r\n\r\nThe D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.33 p.m. until 9.12 a.m. on Wednesday, 23 March 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
