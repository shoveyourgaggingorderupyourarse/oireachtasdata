Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate if he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and he is also attending remotely.<\/p> <p>  Today, we are engaging with officials from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to discuss its 2019 financial statement.  To assist us we are joined remotely by the following officials from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board: Mr. David Gunning, chief officer; Mr. Phelim Devine, project director;Mr. Jim Farragher, finance manager; Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director; and from the Department of Health by Mr. Greg Dempsey, deputy secretary general.  I welcome you all to the meeting.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their computers when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  I also ask that contributors use the button to raise their hand when they wish to contribute and that they remove their masks when speaking to ensure they can be heard properly.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile telephones are on silent mode or switched off.  When they finish speaking they should take down their hand signal.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  However, a number of today&rsquo;s witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask members, where possible, to direct their questions to a specific witness.  If a witness has not been referred to, I ask the witness to state his or her name before responding. <\/p> <p>  Before I ask for the witnesses&rsquo; opening statements, I must make members aware that on Friday I received correspondence from the interim Secretary General of the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt, concerning the difficulty in discussing cost and timelines for completion of the hospital until the board and the Department finalise an analysis of these matters, which is currently ongoing.  I responded that the matters raised by the interim Secretary General could be addressed as part of today&rsquo;s opening statement.  The correspondence will come before the committee on Thursday.<\/p> <p>  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021020900002#B00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612875600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is a special purpose public body established in 2007.  It is responsible for the planning, design, construction and fit-out of a new children's hospital located at the St. James's Hospital campus in Dublin and of two new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres based at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.<\/p><p>Following completion, the hospital and the units will be operated by a separate agency, Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, which was formally established on 1 January 2019.   <\/p><p>It is noteworthy that the new outpatient and urgent care centre located at Connolly Hospital has been commissioned and became operational in mid-2019.<\/p><p> The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is funded by State grants provided by the Health Service Executive.  In 2019, such funding amounted to just under &euro;200 million.  The board&rsquo;s statement of financial position indicates that, as at the end of 2019, the cumulative value of the assets under construction was &euro;422 million, inclusive of VAT.  This was the position after transfers valued at &euro;34.9 million and &euro;2 million to the HSE and Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, respectively.  These relate to the transfer to the HSE of the newly-constructed building housing the outpatient and urgent care centre, located at the HSE&rsquo;s Connolly Hospital, and the transfer of specialist equipment in the Connolly unit to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland.<\/p><p> The 2019 financial statements were certified by me on 17 June 2020.  The financial statements were qualified on the basis that, following the directions of the Minister for Health, the hospital development board accounts for pension liabilities only as they become payable.  This does not comply with the requirements of the financial reporting standard, which requires that financial statements recognise the full costs of retirement benefit entitlements earned in the period and the accrued liability at the reporting date.  Other than the pension accounting, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the board&rsquo;s financial position at the year end, and of the transactions during 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021020900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612875600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and now ask Mr. Gunning, on behalf of the board, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021020900002#C00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612875600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for their invitation to discuss the 2019 accounts.  I am joined by Mr. Phelim Devine, Mr. Jim Farragher, finance officer, and Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, all of whom are on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.<\/p> <p>  The board was appointed to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital on a campus shared with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin 8 and the outpatient and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown and Tallaght University Hospital.  In December 2018, the Government approved an investment decision of &euro;1.433 billion for the project.  As has been stated since the outset of the project, there are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainty for them and nor can there be for the duration of the project.  These include construction inflation, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes and the employment order.  From August 2019, in accordance with the contract, the contractor has recovered the cost of national construction inflation in excess of 4%.  The inflation payment to the main contractor for the period of August to December 2019 was &euro;1.6 million including VAT, paid in July 2020.<\/p> <p>  The board's 2019 accounts were audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 12 June 2020.  The expenditure as of 31 December 2019 for that year on the design and build of the hospital was &euro;199,622,610.  This spend was against budgeted spend of approximately &euro;262 million.  This underspend in 2019 is primarily due to the fact that the main contractor did not advance the construction of the build against the planned original programme.  This lack of advancement of programme is primarily due to underresourcing of the project by the main contractor, a situation that has been in place since the beginning and which continues.  By way of an example, at the end of December 2019, the year in question, the contractor had progressed 8.5% of the works by value when it should have progressed 22% of the works by value and this delay has continued to grow month on month.<\/p><p>An analysis of the expenditure to December is set out in the table in the document provided to the committee.  I do not propose to read out the numbers as I presume members have them in front of them.<\/p><p> Moving on to the programme timeline, the construction contracts for the project were awarded in August 2017 and the construction\u00a0completion date for the new children's hospital set out under the terms of the contract was\u00a0August 2022.  When the construction is completed, the hospital will then be handed over to Children's Health Ireland for a period of commissioning ahead of opening.  When we last presented to the Committee of Public Accounts in November 2019 and to the Joint Committee on Health in 2020, we informed both that the project was behind schedule.  Since then,\u00a0the delay has been exacerbated as a result of the Covid-19 crisis and ongoing issues with resourcing\u00a0on the site.<\/p><p> The outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown was completed in May 2019 and successfully handed over to and opened by Children's Health Ireland in July 2019.  The\u00a04,600 sq. m paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Tallaght University Hospital was\u00a0contractually scheduled to be completed this month.  However, the contractor has advised us that construction will not complete before September.  The\u00a0 building will then be handed over to Children's Health Ireland in order that it can open the facility after an eight-week period\u00a0of operational commissioning and equipping.<\/p><p> The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board tracks progress and performance on a weekly and monthly basis and continues to engage with the contractor in an attempt to make up lost time.  The contractor\u00a0 is contractually obliged to provide the development board with a compliant programme of works which\u00a0sets out its approach to delivering the new children's hospital in accordance with the\u00a0contract.  However, since the agreement of the programme as part of the phase B instruction,\u00a0the programme updates provided by the contractor have not been compliant with the\u00a0contract.  As a result, the development board is currently withholding 15% of monthly certified payments until\u00a0such time as a compliant programme is submitted.  This is one of the levers permitted to the board under the contract to incentivise the contractor to deliver on its contractual obligations.<\/p><p> While the contractor has been underperforming as regards project execution, it has been\u00a0extremely assertive as regards claims, as has been indicated at previous meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and the Committee of Public Accounts.  Since the commencement\u00a0of this project, there has been a significant number of claims of a very substantial value.\u00a0 There is an agreed dispute management process in place under the contract.  As matters stand, claims are active at all levels of the dispute management process,\u00a0which involves the employer's representative, the project board, conciliation and adjudication.  One of the cases has reached the High Court.  We have also been involved in a number of adjudications.  The board is defending each claim robustly in\u00a0order to manage the cost of the project and defend the public purse.  However, the sheer\u00a0volume and nature of claims on the project is consuming a significant amount of executive\u00a0and project team time and incurring significant costs.<\/p><p> Updates on timeline challenges and the associated impact on cost have been shared with all\u00a0key stakeholders through the established reporting and governance structures, primarily the\u00a0children's hospital project and programme steering group and the children's hospital project and programme board, which has members from\u00a0the Department of Health, the HSE and Children's Health Ireland.\u00a0 In addition to the regular reporting, the development board has undertaken a detailed review of progress on the project.  The objective of this report is to provide as much clarity as possible to all stakeholders on the implications of any delay, both in terms of the ultimate\u00a0delivery date of the hospital and the forecasted impact on cost.<\/p><p>The development board's analysis has been submitted to the Department of Health and we continue to work closely with our colleagues in both the Department and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, as the analysis submitted is now subject to a robust, independent review and scrutiny.  We look forward to returning to the committee in due course to discuss the final details of this report upon its completion.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the fact that there are delays to the programme, the building is taking shape, as committee members will see from the images distributed in the briefing pack.  Over 90% of all concrete has been placed and we have been advised by the contractor that the concrete frame will be complete by the end of this quarter.  The stone and glazed facade to the south fingers, the south elevation and part of the east elevation is well advanced, with the first finger block at the Rialto bridge now completed.  The main mechanical and electrical plant at basement level is nearing completion, with the primary distribution under construction up through the building.  The fit-out of the south fingers comprising outpatients, cardiology wards, therapies, etc., is progressing well and the fit-out of the hot block, which comprises the emergency department, critical care and theatres, has already commenced.<\/p><p> The development board is aware of how badly needed the new children's hospital is and of the impact that further delay will have on the children and young people, their families and the staff who are waiting for it to open and indeed on the residents who live close to the site.  Everyone working on the project is focused on making the new children's hospital a reality as soon as possible.  I look forward to answering any questions the committee might have on the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021020900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612875600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gunning.

My name is Greg Dempsey.  I am the deputy secretary responsible for the governance and performance division in the Department of Health.  This includes the newly created strategic capital investment directorate, which has responsibility for major capital investments, including the new children's hospital.<\/p> <p>  The national paediatric hospital project is the most significant capital investment project ever undertaken in Ireland's healthcare system.  The development of the new children's hospital is a Government priority project and will bring together the services currently provided at three children's hospitals into a modern, custom-designed, world-class, digital hospital to deliver the best care and treatment for Ireland's sickest children.  As well as playing a central role in the provision of excellent paediatric healthcare services, it will be the primary centre for paediatric education, training and research in Ireland.  The project comprises the new children's hospital at St. James's Hospital as well as outpatient and urgent care centres located at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown, and Tallaght University Hospital.  The construction project forms one of three interrelated elements of the new children's hospital programme for the delivery of a new paediatric model of care in Ireland, the others being the ICT infrastructure and the operational integration of the three existing children's hospitals.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, or the development board, is established under a 2007 ministerial order and has statutory responsibility for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital and the two satellite centres.<\/p> <p>  Under that same order, the development board is charged with keeping all proper and usual accounts and all special accounts as the Minister may from time to time require and, additionally, to submit an annual financial statement to the Comptroller and Auditor General for an audit report to be carried out in accordance with the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  The board's annual financial statements for 2019 were submitted to the Department on 11 August 2020, following the completion of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit.  They were then laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 August, pursuant to section 11 of the 1993 Act.<\/p><p> The board receives its capital funding for the project from the HSE as the sanctioning body for the new children's hospital programme.  As set out in the 2019 financial statements, costs of &euro;199.6 million were incurred by the board in 2019.  I am satisfied by the Comptroller and Auditor General's note as to the completeness and accuracy of the accounts and by my Department's internal review of same.<\/p><p> I will take this opportunity to thank the board for the work it has conducted since it was last before this committee with the Department, including the completion of the additional governance systems and increased resourcing and expertise recommended by the 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report.  This puts the board in a strong position to deliver the project to completion.<\/p><p> I will also take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the outgoing chair of the board, Mr. Fred Barry, for the work he has done in the past few years leading the board and this project.  I must not forget the sterling work of the other members of the board.  For the Department of Health, finding a replacement for Mr. Barry is an immediate priority and officials have already initiated the process to seek to appoint a new chair through the Public Appointments Service.  This may take time but it is considered important that we cast the net wide to find the right candidate for this challenging role.  In the meantime, and to ensure continuity and leadership, the Minister is likely to seek an interim chair for the board.<\/p><p> I note the significant progress that has made to date on the St. James's Hospital campus despite the challenges that Covid-19 has imposed on us all.  The board advises that it has already submitted a progress update to the committee illustrating the activity to date and it is welcome to us all that the distinctive design of the building is now beginning to take shape.<\/p><p> I am aware from the invitation to today's meeting that, in addition to the task of examining the 2019 annual financial statements, committee members have expressed an interest in the timeline and projected costs for the completion of the hospital.  The Department acknowledges the responsibilities and duties of the committee and the interest of members in such matters.<\/p><p> A thorough analysis of the project was sought by the Minister in the summer of 2020 and the Department and other stakeholders have been working closely with the development board in the intervening period.  The development board and the Department are nearing finalisation of this long and detailed analysis, which includes a determination of potential updates to the timeline and costs of the project.  A submission was recently received by the Department and is now subject to review by departmental officials, together with a robust and thorough independent analysis and scrutiny.  This is an important quality assurance step to be able to provide assurance as to the validity of the modelling used by the development board to the Government and other stakeholders, including this committee.  This detailed analysis is nearing finalisation.  Following its completion and submission to the Minister for Health, who commissioned it, an update on the position will be provided to the relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p> It is anticipated to have a final determination before the end of February or in early March.  The Department and the development board would be pleased to return to appear before this committee early next month to address the areas of interest to it and will be in a much better informed position at that stage to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021020900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612875600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dempsey.

Those particular numbers are a key part of the submission we made to the Department, which will be shared with the committee in the not too distant future.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the PwC report, eight particular recommendations applied to the development board and a number applied to the HSE and the Department of Health.  For the eight recommendations, there were in the order of 45 specific action items.  The development board formed a board subcommittee to supervise the implementation of those actions.  Again, I can confirm to the committee everyone of those actions were discharged and the remediation plans were put in place.

I am joined today by Mr. John O'Gorman, ICOS dairy committee, and Mr. Ray Doyle, ICOS livestock services executive.  Mr. O'Gorman is a dairy farmer from south Tipperary and also the chairman of the Dairygold Co-operative Society.  Mr. Doyle leads our policy efforts in animal health and animal welfare.  I will defer to my colleagues in a moment but I will first make some brief opening comments on the matters at hand.<\/p> <p>  ICOS has long been involved in the development of the regulatory regime for animal remedies in Ireland.  From the 1999 report of the Irish Medicines Board, which is a predecessor to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, recommending that access to intramammary antibiotics \"should be on the basis of informed choice such as that available from a properly established and audited mastitis control programme or herd health programme.\"<\/p> <p>  The European Communities (Animal Remedies) Regulation SI 786\/2007, schedule 8, formally recognises the status of a co-op mastitis control programme as a recognised structure within which a vet is in a position to make an appropriate assessment on the treatment needs of dairy cows with regard to intramammary remedies.  The same regulation provides the exemption for antiparasitic remedies to allow them to stay prescription free on the basis that there was, at the time, no evidence of the development of resistance in cattle.<\/p> <p>  We are now faced with a new challenge with the HPRA recently recommending that antiparasitic products can no longer avail of the aforementioned exemption due to the proven evidence of anthelmintic resistance in cattle, which was first demonstrated on Teagasc farms.  This will result in those medicines becoming prescription only.  The members should be in no doubt that shifting this group of medicines from the current merchant and co-op route of supply, or responsible persons in licensed merchants, LM, to prescription only, will result in a significant shift in sales from co-ops and merchants.<\/p><p>This will result in economic loss and the undermining of the economic basis for the stores network, as well as a substantial increase in the cost for end users.  Co-ops want to reduce rather than to increase the sales of medicines, but they do want to be able to sell medicines to their members.  Footfall generated in small rural branches by the sale of animal health products is an important part of their activities and if it were to be lost branches would undoubtedly close.  It is the view of ICOS that the simplest solution to this change would be to investigate the potential to extend the right to prescribe those medicines to the responsible persons who now work in co-ops and merchants, as provided for in the directive.  We will, however, need to substantially enhance the data gathering and controls associated with that activity so we can reduce usage, halt the development of resistance and protect those valuable medicines.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the European Commission have rejected this proposition.  Pending a definitive view from the Office of the Attorney General, and being conscious that time is very tight, we must prepare contingency strategies.  Mr. Doyle will go over those in a moment.  <\/p><p> In parallel, the world has changed regarding the use of antibiotics, and the co-ops have shown great leadership in driving down the usage of dry cow tubes especially.  Using the mastitis control programme, as set out in schedule 8 of the 2007 regulations, we have seen substantial reductions of sales in dry cow tubes, a move towards selective dry cow therapy and many co-ops banning the use of critically important antibiotics.  We accept that substantial changes will need to occur in the mechanics of prescribing dry cow tubes, with the likely necessity of moving to 100% milk recording to get a dry cow prescription.<\/p><p> The concept of a specialist or consultant vet working out of a co-op laboratory, with access to the data on milk recording, bulk milk, sensitivity and detailed reports on dairy hygiene and other audits, continues to be robust and scientifically sound.  Unfortunately, one stakeholder, the Veterinary Council of Ireland, has taken what we see as being a view more appropriate to a representative body than a regulator and has thus far rejected the concept of a co-op specialist vet.  We call on the Department to do what it did in 2007 and to recognise the strategic importance of the co-ops, large and small, in animal health and to ensure that the Veterinary Council of Ireland does not exceed its remit in this regard.  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. O'Gorman, now.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021020900002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.J. Flanagan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address the committee this afternoon.  The committee members will be aware that the Irish dairy industry exports more than &euro;5 billion worth of dairy products and ingredients to over 120 countries.  It is Ireland's largest indigenous sector.  The sector is extremely focused on food safety, the consumer and its reputation as a trusted supplier of safe and traceable foods.<\/p> <p>  As a responsible and trusted stakeholder, the Irish dairy industry has identified the need to provide antimicrobial and antiparasitic resistance as a key priority for our farmer members.  In the past decade, the Irish dairy industry has invested more than &euro;1 billion in processing capacity, routes to markets and in people and systems to ensure compliance and food safety.  The co-operative structure of the Irish dairy industry has ensured that it has developed a significant degree of vertical integration with its farmer members and it surrounds and supports them with systems and expertise to deliver on safe and sustainable milk production.  <\/p> <p>  Included in this support is major investment in milk quality, built on animal health including lowering somatic cell count, SCC, levels and reducing antibiotic usage.  The current position of the Irish dairy co-ops in the supply chain for appropriate medicines allows them to control and influence the delivery of key priorities.  This includes reducing the use of critically important antibiotics which are also used in human medicines, moving towards selective dry cow therapy and protecting and maintaining valuable antibiotics from the development of resistance.  For example, my co-op, Dairygold, has destocked critically important antibiotics.  In addition, we provide sensitivity testing as a service to our farmers to allow them to identify the most effective drug to treat their animals.<\/p><p>Co-ops have led the national effort in improving milk quality and mammary health through individual co-op mastitis control programmes provided for under Schedule 8 of the current legislation.  This has resulted in substantial reductions in somatic cell counts and a reduction in antibiotic use, particularly CIAs.  It is essential that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine legislates for the continuation of the co-op mastitis control programme.<\/p><p> We fully accept and understand that we will need to evolve to address new challenges such as selective dry cow therapy.  The current routes of supply for veterinary medicines are strategically important to co-ops as a way of ensuring the competitive and safe availability of necessary medicines to our farming members.  While co-ops are committed to substantial reductions in the use of animal medicines, in line with their prudent use, the ability to retail them in branch networks is vitally important to that network as it maintains competitiveness in the marketplace.<\/p><p> ICOS is calling on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure an appropriate balance in this regard.  It is essential for the Department to recognise the positive role that the co-ops can play in delivering on shared objectives, such as AMR, when finalising the new legislation for veterinary medicines.  Key to this is ensuring a proper definition for any other assessment under Article 105 that allows a holistic approach to herd health planning, supported by data-assisted prescribing for inter-mammary tubes and co-op herd health plans for other veterinary medicines.  <\/p><p> As food processors the dairy co-op sector has a vested interest in ensuring that animal medicines are used in a responsible manner in full compliance with legal requirements and best practice.  Co-operatives are trusted and reliable partners in the process and are extremely well-placed to help our farmer members to address and prevent the challenge of antimicrobial and climatic resistance.  I thank the Chairman and welcome questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021020900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>We are under severe time pressure.

The Department was very cognisant of the problem of antiparasitic resistance and in recognition of that it set up the antiparasitic resistance stakeholder group.  ICOS is a member along with the ILMA, Veterinary Ireland, the HPRA, Teagasc and others.  The Department submission listed what this stakeholder forum has been dealing with and the sixth item mentioned was to &quot;facilitate an efficient, competitive supply chain through effective regulation and innovation&quot;.  My interpretation of that, and they are the Department's words, is the <i>status quo<\/i>.  What negotiations, dealings or discussions have the witnesses had on the regulation within that stakeholder group?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021020900002#L00300","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I will respond to Senator Daly's questions through a small address.  I will then answer his questions directly.<\/p> <p>  The issue of a responsible person's right to issue prescriptions for products that did not require a prescription in the past is not the only issue at stake here.  The Irish dairy, beef and sheep industry depends heavily on having a suite of antiparasitic products that are effective and continue to allow Ireland to capitalise on its natural advantage of growing grass and turning it into valuable protein sources for an estimated 60 million people worldwide, whilst generating an income for more than 120,000 Irish farm families and over &euro;14 billion in exports for Ireland's GDP.<\/p><p>The committee needs to be made aware that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has delegated the design of the new prescription-only medicine prescribing regime to the Veterinary Council of Ireland, VCI.  In our discussions directly with the Department, it insisted that ICOS meet directly with the VCI to air our concerns on creating a practical, transparent, fair and internationally defendable prescribing regime for prescription-only medicine products for food producing animals.  At a recent meeting between the VCI and ICOS, the VCI publicly expressed its view that the current legal method via Schedule 8 of the Animal Remedies Regulation 2007 of using data to assist veterinary prescriptions, cannot be allowed in the absence of a costly clinical visit which cannot on its own diagnose clinical and sub-clinical disease of certain mastitis and parasite conditions but data assisted diagnosis can in isolation detect these infections even before they affect animal productivity, let alone welfare.<br\/><br\/>Increasingly, data is now being used in all aspects of human and veterinary diagnosis.  Even on farms the use of robotic milking has empowered farmers, in consultation with the veterinary profession, to intervene early in treating animals and drive down the overall use of valuable antibiotics in Irish agriculture.  For example, Catherine McAloon stated at a recent Animal Health Ireland, AHI, sow check meeting that usage of antimicrobials, through the current mastitis control programmes as administered by the co-ops via the Schedule 8 remote prescribing legislation, has resulted in a dramatic 43% reduction in antibiotic usage over the 2015-2019 period.<br\/><br\/>However, during this time our overall national usage of antibiotics has increased which must have been as a direct result of antibiotics being prescribed and supplied via the vet-only channel, which relies almost entirely on costly clinical visits as per the VCI guidance.  This clearly has not worked in driving down antibiotic usage but the VCI is adamant it should be the only route prescriptions are generated on.  Preventative medicines such as vaccines, many of which are prescription-only medicines, must be increased in their use and availability to Irish farming if we are serious in driving down antimicrobial resistance and antiparasitic resistance.  Yet many of these products are currently not available through the co-op network and remain a veterinary only channel of supply.<br\/><br\/>Dairygold, one of Ireland's largest co-ops, has reduced its sales of antibiotic dry cow tubes by 35% in the last ten years, even within the context of an increase of 40% in cow numbers, and increased its sales of a simple teat sealer in the same time frame by 64%.  It is not in the co-ops' interest to increase sales of antibiotics, anthelmintics and antiparasitics.  However, it is in the co-ops' and farmers' interest that they can deliver them in a timely and cost-effective manner to all farmers when required.  The use of multiple data sources through laboratory, on-farm dairy advisers and co-operative vets has delivered for Ireland and must be allowed to continue.<br\/><br\/>There are currently three possible options available to Ireland to resolve this issue, and, in the absence of doing nothing between now and next January 2022 when the European regulation must be transposed into Irish law, we are faced with three options: <i>status quo <\/i>regarding the point of sale of anthelmintics, inter-mammaries and antiparasitic drugs via co-op branches, independent merchants and pharmacies where responsible persons are allowed to generate prescriptions for all antiparasitic products, but the Irish Government is going to need to seek changes directly to the EU regulation in this regard if this is to become a reality; prescriptions generated via co-operative vets to farmers when they are part of an overall herd health plan and prescriptions generated on accurate data decisions for select drug types and ruminant species remotely with a clinical visit; or break the dispensing and prescribing links completely and align it with current best human practice.  Indeed, several other competing EU countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Italy have done so with their farmed animal prescriptions for maximum transparency and the least market disruption.  <br\/><br\/>We are running out of time on this issue.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine needs to decide the policy that is best for Ireland and not delegate its responsibility in this regard to other stakeholders who can create a legal framework that will only enrich one profession and damage the competitiveness and sustainability of the entire food production chain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021020900002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>ICOS has clearly outlined its stance.

I had hoped it would help clarify some of the matters.  I will defer to my colleague, Mr. Colm Forde, on the question relating to the Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society, ICOS, interaction on action point No. 6 in the antiparasitic stakeholder group.<\/p><p>I will mention the draft at EU level and why the responsible persons, RPs, were not defended.  Ireland was an active member in the negotiations with Brussels.  Various different members from the Department, who I will not name, drew up the policies through consultation, not only in-house but also at a wider level with industry, even at that time.  The regulation has been largely transposed.  In other words, like what was put in during 2007, when responsible persons were introduced to dispense antiparasitics, that could continue under the current situation.  However, even the older regulation had a caveat on it, that is, that it complied with a specific part of the derogation regarding antiparasitic resistance.  When the negotiations were finished, RPs were still doing the job they had always done.<\/p><p> However, it was around that time that the HPRA, through its task force, did an examination of data and of various research that was available.  Through that research, it determined that there was no longer compliance with the directive.  It was on that basis that the antiparasitics moved into the sphere of requiring a prescription.  There was no question that the responsible persons were not defended.  The other point about it is that the responsible persons do more than give out antiparasitics.  They are also involved in another interaction with their clients on a professional level in dispensing and retailing other products.  In the future, it would be envisaged that where a prescription for an antiparasitic would go to a licensed merchant, which is the situation we are striving to maintain in the Department, the responsible person would have a role in the dispensing of the prescriptions that would be issued on foot of antiparasitics.  That deals with the second part of the question.  I will defer to my colleague for the first part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021020900002#P01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Barry Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>The Department's approach to policymaking, particularly now, is to facilitate extensive consultation with stakeholders in developing any policies.  That is part and parcel of what we do.  One of the consequences of that is that policymaking can take time because we need to take account of everyone's viewpoints.  I appreciate that Senator Paul Daly asked Ray Doyle that question during the earlier session and the answer that came back to him may not have gotten across the breadth of consultation that we have had.  I am sure Mr. Doyle will confirm this subsequently if asked but I have met with him countless times on these regulations, be it bilaterally with ICOS or though the different stakeholder groups we have.<\/p> <p>  The antiparasitic stakeholder group was set up in the middle of last year to address all of the various concerns that have been brought forward by stakeholders.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, one of the key objectives of the group is to look at an efficient and competitive supply chain through effective regulation and innovation.  The major concerns we have with this regulation are that there are certain entities which fear that they may suffer a loss in business as a result of the new prescribing regime.  There are two different aspects involved.  We want to make sure that the prescribing of these products is done prudently and effectively so that we can protect their efficacy.  ICOS relayed that point well.  It is so important that we protect the efficacy of these products to support the pasture-based farming model, which we are all so proud of.  If these products fail to work, however, then we cannot help support that type of farming and that will ultimately impact on the ability of farms to cut costs.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to objective 6 which concerns facilitating an efficient and competitive supply chain.  We would like to have a system whereby all suppliers in the market can continue to supply farmers and that, ultimately, farmers will have that choice on where they want to buy their medicines from.  Farmers are savvy business people and if we allow them to have that choice it is up to them to decide where they buy their product.<\/p><p>There are five or six different actions within that strategic objective and maybe the most important one of those is the development of a secure electronic prescribing system.  As outlined in our opening statement, our ambition is to have all prescriptions available online and that a farmer, in theory, could get a prescription sent to him or her by text message on his or her mobile phone.  He or she would then be able to buy that wherever he or she may choose.  We hope that would open up the market to a competitive level so that farmers can buy from their vet, pharmacist, or licensed merchant, whichever one they choose.<\/p><p> One of the issues we have been asked to consider, and I think ICOS is supportive of this, is to look at the decoupling of prescribing and sale of medicines.  Some member states in Europe have gone down the route of not allowing vets to sell veterinary medicines.  They only allow them to prescribe.  We have committed to doing a piece of research on that and will present the pros and cons associated with that approach to the antiparasitic stakeholder group.  It is important to say that there is no silver bullet answer to this.  Obviously, if one stops vets from selling then that has other potential consequences.<\/p><p> We also outlined that we made representations to the Commission about the continued role of responsible persons.  We received that response and it clearly indicated to us that we are not able to avail of the derogation in Article 105(4).  As ICOS outlined, we separately sent a request for legal opinion on that to the Attorney General, which we are awaiting a response to.  ICOS referred to the role we have given to the Veterinary Council.  It is important to highlight that the Veterinary Council is an independent statutory body tasked with overseeing the practice of veterinary medicine in Ireland in the public interest.  I think it was suggested that the Veterinary Council may be aligned with the views of particular stakeholders.  It is important to outline that it is an independent regulatory body and is under the Department's remit.<\/p><p> One of the key articles in the regulation states that a veterinary prescription can only be issued following a clinical examination or any other proper assessment.  The question from many of our stakeholders is, what exactly does that mean and what is a proper assessment?  We tasked the Veterinary Council with meeting all stakeholders, including experts in the field, farming organisations, ICOS, Teagasc, and Animal Health Ireland, to benefit from the best practice that is out there and to determine what is a proper assessment.  ICOS referred to the kind of data one should be aware of when determining the kind of prescription that should be used and for how long that prescription should last.  If I get a prescription for some dosing products perhaps that could last for several months at a time, again this would give a farmer the choice as to where he or she could buy that product over a period of time.  The council engaged extensively with stakeholders throughout the end of last year and early this year, and will be presenting its views on what constitutes a proper assessment to the antiparasitic stakeholder group in March.  I hope I have given members an overview of where we are at with those consultations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021020900002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Forde","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Mr. Forde has given a comprehensive answer but I think he has generated many questions as well.

Licensed merchants, LMs, have expressed concern around whether a prescription will shift the buying, selling and dispensing directly between the farmer and the vet who will prescribe it.  I understand that fear but in the context of the overall change of business models, it is impossible for us to determine today whether things will cost money.  I am at pains to say that when one looks at the overall context of the antiparasitic resistance stakeholder group and the objective behind it, less antiparasitic medicines will be sold.  ICOS actually identified it very well.  It recognised that and we recognised that.  However, what is not at stake and what we seek to maintain is the animal health and welfare status of the country's herds and flocks.  Within that, there is a need to safeguard the &euro;14 billion trade, which was referenced earlier.<\/p> <p>  There will be and can be decreased costs for farmers in the context of less antiparasitics.  In a changed business model, what can happen is that veterinarians and their expertise will be needed in the context of animal herd health.  Their expertise will be a necessary prerequisite to ensure any lessening of antiparasitic sales will be met by increased herd health management programmes and increased awareness.  It is not that farmers are unaware or that they are not well-educated but we hope to increase education and awareness across the whole system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021020900002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Barry Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I am trying to ask a few quick fire questions.

Do the witnesses think the people in co-ops who are qualified to give out antiparasitic medicine at the moment will be made redundant due to this regulation?  Do the witnesses fear that there may be a clause in EU law that one cannot take a living from someone?  There is also something called a \"grandfather right\".<\/p> <p>  On top of that, do the witnesses think the Department is fully responsible for what we are facing at the moment?  Looking at what the Brits have done, they were ahead of the posse.  My understanding is that the industry asked the Department going back years to allow not only vets but others to prescribe.  However, the Department said no.  One can look at what the UK has done, especially in the context of the Brexit situation.  Whether one likes it or not, a suitably qualified person, SQP, can operate in the North.

We recognise the qualifications of responsible people.  These are the persons who are currently giving out veterinary medicines and antiparasitics.  Due to the fact that we were involved in the drawing up of the course, we are well aware that they are trained not only to sell antiparasitics but they are required to retail other categories of veterinary medicines that can be supplied to date other than the antiparasitics.<\/p><p>They continue to be dispensed.  I do not want to repeat myself with regard to prescription-only medicines.  When one goes into a pharmacist with one's own health prescription, that does not mean one does not have some questions for a knowledgeable person at the point of sale.  We always consider that they have an important role to play.  There are other veterinary medicines that are retailed from licensed merchants.  Rather than saying whether people will be let go, which is something I cannot reply to, I can say the Department is very focused on ensuring the licensed merchants remain viable and active.  It is in that context we see a suite of arrangements such as those laid out by my colleague.  Those arrangements are focused on ensuing that licensed merchants as an entirety will remain viable and, within that, will have the employees they need.<\/p><p> A question was asked about the UK and SQPs.

Did this come out of nowhere or did the Department have any sense of the difficulties that would be presented by that particular formula with respect to the derogation?  The derogation was put in place for a reason.  The derogation was there to be availed of by some member states.  I know the British Government appears to have used the derogation in a more practical way, if I can put it that way, compared to the Irish Government.  I want to know where the difficulty was in that regard.  European legislation is the same as Irish legislation, in that it can be changed.

One of the issues that has not been touched on too much is Article 33 of the regulation.  It states all veterinary medicinal products for food producing animals must require a prescription but there are certain exemptions to that.  Certain products can be made available without a prescription if there is no evidence of resistance, no harm to humans or no environmental damage, in addition to a number of other criteria.  It was on the basis that we met those criteria historically that antiparasitics could be sold without using a veterinary prescription.<\/p> <p>  Since the regulation was finalised, the Health Products Regulatory Authority has become the competent authority for analysing medicines.

The claim is that Regulation (EU) 2019\/6 precludes availing of the derogation that has been in place here for years.  I take issue with that based on legal advice with which we have been issued.  Is it not the case that an offer was made in 2011, years before Regulation (EU) 2019\/6 existed, to further upskill the recognised persons and the Department turned it down at that stage?  Is it not true that the UK approached the Department about replacing the derogation with proper legislation and that was also turned down?  That regulation came into effect on 28 January 2019.<\/p> <p>  Why was there no consultation with the stakeholders ahead of the regulation coming into effect in 2019 because any real public engagement happened afterwards, more or less after the horse had bolted.  Is it not true that the Department was intent on relying on the derogation rather than addressing the fundamental reasons the derogation was needed which was that necessary legislation was not in place?  This was despite the fact that a significant number of jobs and livelihoods relied upon it.  Why was that and why now that the regulation has been signed is the Department suddenly reluctant to use the derogation?  Is it because the Department is concerned it will be found that it messed the whole thing up?<\/p> <p>  In 2005 an identical situation arose that was referred to the Competition Authority, which is now called the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, for its view.  Its opinion was that creating a situation where vets could be the only prescribers of veterinary medicines would restrict competition, raise transaction costs and restrict consumer choice.  Will the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, now instruct the Department to respect that opinion and seek a solution with the stakeholders to avoid the need to re-engage with the CCPC?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021020900002#X00500","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Barry Walsh, Mr. Forde and Ms Garvan for coming in and for what, quite frankly, are their robust responses.

Our view on that is simple.  We do not think it is a legal option to us.  It would be breaching European law if we allowed people other than vets to issue prescriptions.  We are awaiting the Attorney General's opinion on that point.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Ms Barry Walsh's point on competition concerns.  Other than Northern Ireland, no country in the European Union allows people other than vets to issue veterinary prescriptions.  In terms of competition concerns, European law has precedence, so I do not think there is an issue.  As Ms Barry Walsh said, we are in line with other member states.  We are in line with international best practice, which is important when we export 90% of our agrifood produce.<\/p> <p>  In terms of any potential conflicts of interest, first and foremost, we are all public servants.  We all take that incredibly seriously.  We are fully transparent and objective in our analysis.  I can assure Senator Boyhan that is not an issue that causes any conflict with us.<\/p> <p>  We have discussed a regulatory impact assessment at length with our stakeholders, including the licensed merchants association.  We said we were not refusing to do an economic impact assessment.  However, what one is seeking from an economic impact assessment is captured under a regulatory impact assessment, which we are doing as part of the transposition of this regulation.  We have asked our stakeholders, including the licensed merchants association, to provide us with any information which can feed into the developing of that regulatory impact assessment.  We cannot complete a regulatory impact assessment until we have confirmed and clarified all the various regulations.  As I said earlier, this takes time because we are committed to extensive stakeholder consultation with all of our stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the advices from the Attorney General's office, we have our own internal legal team.  We wanted to make sure we provided a request to the Attorney General's office which was substantive, clearly laid out the issues and provided all the correspondence from our stakeholders, including the legal advices from the licensed merchants association.  It was submitted to the Office of the Attorney General.  We got confirmation it had received it on 16 December.  We are still awaiting a response.  I will keep asking the Attorney General to provide us with those advices.  We can then provide the committee with a synopsis of what is in the Attorney General's advice when we receive it.<\/p><p>Many of my questions have been asked.  Mr. Forde mentioned the derogation.  Is he sure that no European country other than the UK had used the derogation or is doing so now?  He spoke of vets issuing prescriptions.  It would be similar to when the doctors set up pharmacy practices beside their business.  It will have an awful negative effect.  The issue really comes down to a way of life for farmers and merchants who had businesses in this country since the foundation of the State and now some of them will be put out of business because of this new regulation coming in from Europe.  I am not being disrespectful - I have a lot of time and respect for officials, they have a job to do and so do we - but this does not seem to have been fought very hard at European level by the Department or anyone else.  They were quite prepared to go along with the professional view that the merchants were not really capable of issuing these prescriptions.  I do not agree with that.  As others have said, maybe it boils down to a decision that has to be taken not in Europe or the Parliament, but in the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021020900002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Forde","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I will make some points and ask some questions.

Did the farmers look for the system to be changed?  It is very disingenuous to suggest they did.  I raised this directly with the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il and his view was that we do not want a cliff-edge scenario where thousands of jobs in rural Ireland are lost unnecessarily.  I do not remember any farmer or group of farmers seeking change in the current system.<\/p> <p>  The regulation was passed by the 27 permanent representatives to iron out any major difficulties and obstacles.  At that stage the derogation clause was drafted, scrutinised and agreed with Ireland, joining others to support the inclusion of the derogation.  This action proves that Ireland needed to avail of the derogation to enshrine the responsible persons in future prescribing.  Why is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine reneging on all that work and adopting the opposite view in light of the fact that the chief veterinary officer and the HPRA recommended a multi-stakeholder approach to address resistance?<\/p> <p>  The Department will be aware that in 2010 a new class of wormer was launched as vet prescription-only for sheep with nil resistance.  Within four years of vet control the first case of resistance was recorded in New Zealand, and in 2018 in the UK.

I would like a response on that.<\/p> <p>  On the secure electronic prescribing system, it is outrageous to recommend such an approach and not be able to give any cost.  Did no cost-benefit analysis take place?  Is the Department not concerned about wasting money unnecessarily?<\/p> <p>  This looks as though it is simply about putting all control in vets' hands.

The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has nominated me to serve as chairperson of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  If I may, I will begin by briefly summarising my career before setting out my vision and priorities for the authority.<\/p> <p>  I joined the ESB as a graduate engineer in 1973.  As members will know, this was at the tail end of the rural electrification scheme that underpinned one of the greatest societal transformations that this country has seen in terms of its impact on people's lives.  One of my last assignments in the ESB was to head up the newly formed ESB Networks directorate and, in that capacity, to revisit and upgrade the rural electricity networks to make them fit for service in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>  In 2005, I was appointed as the CEO of the newly formed EirGrid.  Over the following years, we assumed responsibility for the all-island electricity market.  We also built the east-west interconnector, which was a &euro;600 million project that we brought in on time and within budget.  I am particularly proud of the work we did in setting EirGrid on a path to be a world leader in integrating wind energy in the power system.<\/p> <p>  Since retiring in 2012, I have been active in a number of energy-related activities.  On behalf of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, I chaired an expert group to develop an energy research strategy to support the transition to a low-carbon energy future.<\/p> <p>  For the past six years, I have chaired Vita, an Irish development agency that works in east Africa with a mission to reduce poverty, hunger, and inequality among rural households through knowledge backed, community-led initiatives leading to sustainable livelihoods.  Climate action, both mitigation and adaptation, is a core element of our work with these African communities who are on the front line of the climate crisis.<\/p> <p>  As president of Engineers Ireland in 2016 and 2017, I witnessed and worked with a community of professionals who are determined to play their part and lead on climate action, and, critically, to inspire the next generation to take on the technological and societal challenges that we face.<\/p> <p>  The reality of the existential threat posed by climate change is, I believe, beyond question.  The science is very clear.  The Paris Agreement sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2&deg;C and closer to 1.5&deg;C.  The Government is committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, a halving over the decade, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  We saw last week in the joint report by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, that emissions last year reduced by 6% on the previous year, and that was largely due to the impact of the pandemic.  We know the size of the challenge we face in the next ten, 20 and 30 years.<\/p><p>However, having a clear goal to aim for, one we all subscribe to, is extremely powerful as a means of unlocking the energy and creativity of all sectors of society to deliver that goal.  A good example was the target of 40% renewables in the electricity sector by 2020, which many believed to be unattainable back in 2008 when it was set by the then Government.  That target had the effect of changing the mindset and delivering a major energy transition on the supply side, a transition that is still under way with the development of solar, offshore wind and further interconnection.<br\/><br\/>The focus now changes to the demand side in transport, industry, the public sector and residential homes, where our decarbonisation efforts have been less successful to date.  This is perhaps not surprising.  Here we are looking for behavioural change and investments at the household and community level at a time when many households are struggling with the impact first of the financial crisis and now the Covid-19 pandemic.  This societal transformation will take leadership, time and collective effort.  Nevertheless, we know from past experience that societal transformations, underpinned by major energy transitions, can and do occur and bring us to a better and more sustainable place.  I mentioned the rural electrification scheme earlier as one example of that.<br\/><br\/>The good news is that momentum is building.  The moral and ethical imperative, as expounded by Pope Francis and Greta Thunberg among others, reinforces our sense that sustainable living is the right thing to do.  Government policy, incentives, regulations and emerging technologies are helping to turn this ecological awareness into behavioural change and sustainable investments at the household, community and business levels.  It is also the right thing to do economically, in terms of the new jobs and business models created and the new and innovative products and services developed and taken to a global market.<br\/><br\/>That brings me to the role of the SEAI.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">We are an agency of government working directly with homeowners, communities and businesses in delivering a cleaner energy future for Ireland.  Over the last decade SEAI has delivered major impacts for Ireland.  We have helped to inform and shape policy, we have provided access to genuine solutions and been the portal for many people and communities to engage with new technology and sustainability.  <\/font>Thanks to SEAI, more than 250,000 homes are warmer and cheaper to run, more than 500 communities have started their sustainable energy transition, thousands of businesses are more competitive and Ireland&rsquo;s public services are exemplars in energy efficiency.<br\/><br\/>To build on this platform and to deliver on the targets set out in the programme for Government and the climate action plan, we in SEAI are now in the process of stepping up a gear.  We are putting in place the leadership team to drive the organisation forward and we are recruiting the people with the necessary skills - technical, communications and community engagement.  We are preparing our next statement of strategy for the period 2021-2025, a key theme of which will be collaboration.  This will include: collaboration with businesses, industry and the public sector and with other State agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland, collaboration with the SME sector, for example, in the establishment of a national climate cluster, collaboration with our energy research and innovation sector, to help develop the technologies and innovative approaches needed and, most importantly, collaboration with all actors in the retrofit sector, with local authorities and primarily with citizens and communities to drive the national retrofit programme forward.<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> Collaboration is at the heart of our work.  We deliver through others.  We in SEAI will be providing the leadership, the expertise, the ambition and the innovation that will drive and inform the change.<\/font><br\/><br\/>In regard to governance, SEAI is entrusted with significant Exchequer funds and we are very conscious of the need to be transparent and accountable in all our spending decisions.  Since 2011, SEAI has maintained SWiFT 3000 corporate governance certification from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.  I assure the committee that the maintenance of this standard certification remains a key objective for me as board chair and for the SEAI board, to ensure that SEAI operates to the highest international standards of corporate governance.<br\/><br\/>I am deeply honoured to be nominated by the Minister to lead the SEAI board at this critical juncture.  I can assure members that I will be giving it my full attention, working closely with the board, the executive team and the fantastic and dedicated staff we have in SEAI.  Through my work in Africa with VITA and other organisations, I have seen the consequences of climate change and ecological degradation on households and communities.  Climate action is for each and every one of us and I am committed to playing my part as chair of SEAI.<br\/><br\/>Again, I thank the Chair for the invitation and I will be pleased to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Byrne for his opening statement.

Few could be better qualified than he is, and in his opening remarks Mr. Byrne displays a real passion for the job.  I am delighted to learn that Mr. Byrne is assembling a new team and a new strategy.  The scale of the challenge is vastly greater than those in which the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has been involved to date.  I believe that the SEAI has done outstanding work in evaluating approaches and there is very good experience there.  The real challenge now is in scaling that up.  I am interested to know what role Mr. Byrne envisages the SEAI taking in scaling up the activity.  Will the SEAI be leading what Europe now calls a \"retrofit wave\", or has that yet been worked out as to how the elements of a strategy that involves finance, motivation, getting boots on the ground in local communities and adopting area-based approaches instead of individual approaches?  How far has the strategy developed on that?<\/p> <p>  My second question is on the extent to which Mr. Byrne believes the public sector is leading by example in the area of sustainable energy.  The sector reports regularly on its energy efficiency but the extent to which public bodies are taking it seriously or are in a position to deliver change seems to me to be very variable.<\/p> <p>  On the SEAI remit, the Act includes the promotion of renewables; research, development and demonstration; tackling pollution; and the co-ordination of the production, supply and use of energy.  It appears to me that the actual remit has been much narrower than the scope outlined in the founding Act.  Is it a part of Mr. Byrne's strategy to take on some of those wider roles such as co-ordination of research and development in the context of the need to see the emergence of hydrogen and other potential replacement fuels?  How far does Mr. Byrne see his role reaching in co-ordinating that sort of work, which I believe will be crucial to achieving our goals in the coming years, if not in the immediate year or two ahead?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#D00200","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>The scaling up and the retrofit wave is one of our biggest challenges.<\/p><p>We are conscious of that and we are gearing up for it.  We have already started the work.  We work closely with the Department on mapping out the targets etc.  We have a target of achieving 500,000 B2 ratings by the end of the decade.  When one looks at the graph showing that target mapped out over ten years, there is a mountain to climb.  We are conscious of that.  <\/p><p> We are putting in place the elements for SEAI being the national retrofit delivery body.  We have that up and running now as a project.  We have already started the work for 2021.  We have an increased budget.  We have two calls out at the moment, one of which is a one-stop-shop call.  The Deputy will know that one of the key issues is the development of a supply chain to deliver this.  That will take some time.  The one-stop-shop call is helping the contractor base and the supply chain to coagulate and come together to create the necessary one-stop-shops that will help us to deliver this.  We also have a community call-out, which is focusing on communities.  They are the first two elements that are off the block.  We are hindered a little by the pandemic, as we were last year, but all going well, once the restrictions are lifted, we hope to be up and running and doing the work for 2021, which is a target of 8,000 but, more important, preparing for the rapid scale-up for 2022 and thereafter.  We have a task force and a project up and running to deliver that.<\/p><p> On the public sector, under the climate action plan the target for the public sector was 33% efficiency by 2020.  It got close to achieving that target.  There are exemplars such as, for example, Dublin City University, An Post and Dublin County Council.  There are good examples of strong leadership in the public sector.  We are working across the public sector to deliver the know-how and technologies that will help.  The targets in the upcoming review of the climate action plan will be more stringent and will require leadership and best practice across all elements of the public sector.<\/p><p> On the remit of SEAI, having chaired the expert group on energy research and development in 2017, what was evident at the time was the lack of co-ordination.  That was one of the main findings of that group.  When I stepped into the chairmanship of SEAI late last year, I was glad to note that it had taken over the role of co-ordinating the research and development activity across the country.  It does that in a number of ways through funding research and development.  We have over 100 projects up and running by various research performing organisations, RPOs.  The national conference we held last October pulled together all of those research organisations to allow researchers to hear what other people are doing.  That type of information exchange is a great way of growing the collaborative effort across all RPOs.  We have additional funding of up to &euro;16 million for 2021.  That will make a difference and is necessary to carry out that work in an effective and efficient way.  I see that being very much of SEAI's remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#E00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I congratulate Mr. Byrne on his appointment.  I am conscious of time so I will get straight into my questions.  Mr. Byrne mentioned he worked with African communities through Vita.  I would be interested in hearing an outline of the plans of the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland around resourcing and training the community energy sector.  For example, the Scottish model provides an enablement grant of &pound;25,000 to help communities carry out feasibility studies and to get them up and running.  Mr. Byrne can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the SEAI has yet to fill the role of community-led energy adviser.<\/p><p>The current situation, where communities who are keen to be part of the energy transition and to get involved, whether they are small businesses, farms or schools, is that they are having to do deal with the CRU and the ESB directly, and they are organisations that are not used to dealing with communities and that do not have the communal capacity to do that.  If we really want communities to be a bigger part of the process, we have to support them in that process.

The first is that it is community-led, for example, the community-led total sanitation projects that we introduced into east Africa and which are now in widespread use.  This means that when our people go into a village, they pull the community together and it becomes a community project rather than an NGO-imposed project.  Out of that, leaders emerge, which is fantastic to watch and to see.  The second principle is that we leave nobody behind.  Once we are in a community, everybody is brought into it and everybody benefits from it, whatever the project is and whether it is latrines, potatoes or otherwise.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the SEAI and communities, we work very closely with communities.  We now have up to 500 sustainable energy communities throughout the country and we support those communities very actively through grants, through helping them to develop skills, and through networking across communities so best practice is shared.  I think what the Senator is referring to is the renewable energy supports scheme and getting communities involved in that.  That is a critical part of engaging citizens and communities in our transition.  We are in the process of appointing the trusted energy co-ordinator, so we are very conscious of that role and we will be working with communities to develop those skills and to make communities better able to engage with the process.

It seems to be the case that many of the schemes are demand-led, so they are open for people to avail of them but they are not necessarily correlated with those areas of greatest need.  Mr. Byrne mentioned SEAI is working closely with the Department around mapping out the work programme for the time ahead.  Will that be informed by socioeconomic status, household income or the R rating, and what will inform that work?  Does Mr. Byrne see a need to prioritise those areas in greatest need?

Regarding the targeting of the schemes to the most at need, our warmer homes scheme is the biggest programme that we have to address fuel poverty.  That is the most substantial chunk of our budget.  It is &euro;109 million in 2021.  Unfortunately, last year, because of the pandemic we were not able to use our budget and there is a backlog.  A key priority for us is to address that backlog.  We can only work within the budgets that we have.  We have the same budget this year.  We are hopeful that we will make significant inroads into that backlog this year with the budget of &euro;109 million, if contractors can get out to do the work.  We have a new panel of contractors appointed and they are ready to go.  As soon as the restrictions are lifted, we hope to see rapid progress in tackling that backlog.<\/p> <p>  On targeting, we work within the eligibility criteria.  They were significantly opened up a couple of years ago with additional categories of people who can apply.  We are heading towards deeper retrofits than previously.  All that has to be factored in.  The Deputy mentioned not revisiting a house that has previously been worked on.  I hope that we will be able to do that in the coming years because we recognise that people are on a journey but we need to first go to the queue already there and the people who have not had anything done, and over time we will get round to delivering the full insulation allowable under the scheme.<\/p> <p>  We have more than 500 SECs now.  It is an active part of our work.  As I said in reply to Senator Boylan, I believe that communities are critical to this.  We are talking about people coming together in a community, including the local GAA club and local shops, with leadership at a local level.  It can bring about a remarkable transformation.  We are hoping to grow that network of communities to 1,500 by the end of the decade, when we will have most of the country covered.  We have a long way to go but communities are critical in getting that momentum.<\/p> <p>  An Post is one of the front runners in forming the one-stop-shop, linking up with other service providers to deliver a full package for consumers.

His latter contribution comes to the point that I want to look at.  He has given some guidance about the one-stop-shop, which would certainly be useful to have.  Notwithstanding the commercial reality that one has to go through in identifying options, we would all like to see our post office being used more appropriately to deliver State services.  I see no better option than SEAI using the services of the post offices in communities to reach out to individuals who want more information.  In the work that we did in the Oireachtas, much of the commentary was about people not knowing where to access the services.  That is fine for those who are proficient online but there are others who want to make a contribution and to access these services or funds, and the post office provides that.<\/p><p> Following on from that, there are people who will not qualify for the schemes or will not have the appropriate amount of personal resources to do the work that is required, particularly on the deep retrofit side of things.  Can Mr. Byrne tell us about any plans that might be in place to assist with that green financing, which was talked about in the past?  What are his views in that regard?  There are certainly people out there who want to do that deep retrofit but do not have the hard cash.

I know credit unions are also active in it.  The credit union movement is such a fantastic community-based movement throughout the country.  A lot of these organisations have a lot of cash because of savings that have built up over the years so it should be possible.  Of course, interest rates are so low at the moment that we should be able to pass some of that competitiveness in interest rates directly to consumers to help them on the journey towards deep retrofits.  It is an expensive item.  SEAI is there to support them in terms of grants so significant grant funding is available but leveraging that with affordable finance is the key thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I congratulate Mr. Byrne on his appointment.

It was interesting to hear about his work in Vita in east Africa.  That shows how interconnected we are at the moment and the global problem we are facing.  He mentioned the pandemic.

We are part of Europe so we can do it as part of a European community.  We can play our part in that.  Within Ireland, we must break the problem down into its component parts.  We must look at electricity, transport and the built environment.  The 2019 climate action plan brought us a long way towards breaking it down with 183 different actions across all sectors of society.  That has to be reviewed now in the context of the programme for Government targets and the net zero by 2050 target.  <\/p><p> More importantly, it is getting the buy-in, the community and leadership at all levels in society that will drive this forward.  If that determination and leadership are there across all sectors and if we apply the right resources, brain power and people to figure out the details of how we are going to get this done, as I said earlier in respect of the 40% target, we can do it.  The 40% target was deemed to be unattainable at the time but once that was set, the likes of ESB, EirGrid, the regulator and all the developers out there rolled up their sleeves and we got there.  These organisations are doing tremendous work in facilitating renewable electricity on the system, which people would have thought was impossible.

When it comes to energy, we know many of the solutions.  Going back to one of the first comments, it is about implementing them and the roll-out.  When we look at other areas when it comes to climate, it is more difficult to know what the solutions are.  As a public representative, I have been contacted by people who, number one, do not know where to go.  I hope that the one-stop-shop will be able to deal with that issue.  The other issue is that they do not believe that the financial incentive is big enough to make the change.  The warmer homes scheme is free for some people because they fall into certain categories but on the ground, when I am contacted by people living in rural parts of my community, the issue is that it needs to be enough of an incentive to make some kind of investment.  There is help to put a financial package around it but there is also that piece involving that change of mind that must happen when someone says that if he or she invests in something, it will save him or her money over time.  A key part of that element of the public is renters.  They do not have the capacity to make that switch themselves.  How does Mr. Byrne see his role in SEAI in moving those two categories along to where we believe they need to be in terms of climate, their own well-being and air quality?<\/p> <p>  My last point concerns schools.  There is a real desire on the part of schools and children to make a switch.  Having tried to help schools in the past, I know they simply do not have the capacity to invest themselves.<\/p><p>Does Mr. Byrne believe that more legislation is required or a change in policy direction from the Department of Education that may aid him and through which a partnership could be developed?

I believe that people like investing in their homes, be it through a new kitchen or whatever else.  People go out of their way to invest money in their homes and seem to benefit from it.  More people are working from home as a result of the pandemic and children are at home.  The benefit of having a warmer home is all the more evident for people who have it and its absence is also more evident to those who do not, in terms of increased bills and a lack of comfort.  Perhaps as a result of having to work and school from home during the pandemic, there will be a desire among people to improve the performance of their homes.  We are there to support that through grants but, more than that, it is about getting a decision made to go to a credit union and borrow money.<\/p> <p>  There is a sense that when such changes start to happen in a neighbourhood, a person can see other people doing it and can visit those homes.  We hope that people who have the work done will allow others into their homes, tell them what they have achieved and that it is fantastic.  If one speaks to people who have had the work done, one will hear how remarkable are the changes in comfort, warmth and well-being that one can get.  All sorts of other benefits, including health benefits, flow from that.  This momentum is going to build and we have a role in helping that to happen through our communications, mass media campaigns and working with communities on the ground.  If somebody is, for example, getting work done on a road, we should have a sign on the road stating, \"This is being supported by SEAI; come in and have a look\".  If we can get to a stage where people are willing to share their experiences, it will be a powerful motivator for others to make the switch.

I am sure we will engage with him again on the new statement of strategy for 2021 to 2025.  He spoke about increased ambition.  We are in a circumstance where we were looking at the recovery and resilience facilities that are coming from Europe, the State being able to take loans and a suspension of the fiscal rules that exist.  In terms of capacity, and if money was no object, how could we increase our ambition above 500,000 B2-rated homes in the next decade?  What could we do in that regard by increasing ambition on the number of B2s, the number of deep retrofits, as opposed to other retrofits, and scaling up on public buildings, including schools, as has been mentioned?  We have 90 public buildings but what would happen if we were to look at the large-scale retrofitting of other public buildings?  I know there are other capacity issues besides funding.  I am hoping to drill down to discover what are the other capacity issues, besides funding.<\/p><p>Will SEAI be looking at the issues of retrofitting and embodied energy?  Embodied energy is often not addressed in buildings.  That is something that needs to be added alongside retrofitting because sometimes buildings are demolished and replaced with more sustainable buildings when the benefits will not accrue for 100 years.  Will SEAI look at that?  Is it engaging with the national development plan and local development plans to look at retrofitting and embodied energy?  Where is the idea of new sustainable capital infrastructure being looked at?  That applies especially under sustainable development goal, SDG, 11 which applies to sustainable communities.  I would not mind hearing about how SDGs in general are being incorporated into the new strategic vision of SEAI.<\/p><p> Is research on energy storage a part of the innovation at which SEAI is looking?  We have heard a lot about carbon capture but I am interested in research on renewable energy storage issues.<\/p><p> I would query the language that Mr. Byrne about a \"split incentive\".  I am concerned about that because it is being used a lot by landlords who are asking what is in it for them when what is not in it for them is more relevant.  If we increase the acceptable energy standards for rental accommodation, does that create an incentive for landlords?  At the moment, there is a narrative that landlords are asking why they should do it when only their renters benefit.<\/p><p> Could there be a better, more positive use of environmental and social impact assessments in the sustainable energy sector?  Energy charter renegotiations are taking place this spring.  We know that RWE has launched a case against the Dutch Government for its plan to shift to renewable energy.  France is asking for the legal, institutional and budgetary modalities of withdrawal from the energy charter to be looked at.  Is that an issue that Mr. Byrne is following or tracking?  Does he have thoughts on the matter?  As well as supply and demand, we also need some of the old models to get out of the way.

I was raised in Monaghan and did my undergraduate studies in history and economics at UCD.  I trained as an accountant with KPMG and then transferred to its Boston office for almost two years.  On returning to Ireland, I worked in a range of roles including audit, technology and risk management.  I retired as managing partner of the firm in 2013.  As managing partner for six years, I led a firm employing almost 3,000 people, serving our clients from offices in Belfast, Cork, Dublin and Galway.<\/p> <p>  I gained many perspectives working with our wide array of clients.  I learned to always appreciate the importance of sound business judgment, ethical business behaviour, focus and the ability to work with and positively influence those with whom I engaged.  Throughout my career I have learned to value the perspectives of, and to work with, all stakeholders, including staff and customers from across the island of Ireland.  Having grown up in a Border county, I was especially aware of the need to be sensitive to all views.  These insights will also help me as chairman of ESB given that the group also embraces Northern Ireland Electricity Networks and has significant generation and supply operations in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Since I retired from KPMG, I have served in various non-executive board roles, including Enterprise Ireland, where I have been chairman since 2013, Rethink Ireland, the Government-supported social innovation fund, the governing authority of Dublin City University and the Dublin Theatre Festival.<\/p> <p>  I have mentioned a selection of the boards on which I have sat to give a sense of the diversity of experiences that I have encountered while carrying out my governance responsibilities.<\/p><p>I am mindful that our stakeholders have placed their trust in me and my fellow board members to ensure the ESB operates to very high standards of corporate governance while supporting the work of its management team.  As chairman designate, I will work to ensure the board's oversight responsibility for strategy, governance, internal controls and risk is resolutely executed.  In this way, the board will support and challenge management, who have the operational responsibility for the ESB. <br\/><br\/>In the context of risk I have been really impressed by the way the ESB responded to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The ESB had the threat of a pandemic on its risk register since the early 2000s and carried out a pandemic rehearsal in 2018.  I understand the learnings from this rehearsal informed the ESB&rsquo;s pandemic preparations in 2020.  This ensured the company smoothly transitioned almost 4,000 office-based staff to home-working with only minor blips in activity levels.<br\/><br\/>The issue of gender diversity and inclusion will also be an important agenda item for me as chairman.  I plan to work with our shareholder in drawing up specifications for board appointments that will bring a wider range of perspectives into the boardroom. <br\/><br\/>As Chairman designate of the ESB, I will work to ensure that foresight, planning, operational excellence and diversity remain core cultural imperatives.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the ESB&rsquo;s purpose, it was established as a commercial State company by a fledgling State to be a key enabler of economic development in Ireland.  I am fully cognisant of my responsibilities and that of the board not only to the Government, as owner, but also to all those families, farms and businesses that rely on the ESB for a safe and secure supply of electricity.<br\/><br\/>I am becoming very well acquainted with the sheer scale of the ESB's business and the Brighter Future strategy that is driving the business.  That strategy at its core sees the ESB leading the transition to a low-carbon economy.  The ESB has almost &euro;13 billion in assets.  We contribute approximately &euro;2 billion every year to the Irish economy in the form of taxes, salaries, purchases and local authority rates.  We paid &euro;1.2 billion in dividends to the State over the past ten years  The ESB has a presence in every townland in the country. <br\/><br\/>In addition to delivering a robust power supply to more than 2 million customers, ESB Networks has a critical role in the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan.  As well as ensuring sufficient renewable generation is connected to the network, ESB Networks must also enable technologies such as electric vehicles, electric heat pumps and micro-generation to contribute to the overall decarbonisation of Ireland.  ESB Networks has almost doubled the amount of renewable electricity connections on the network every three years since 2011.  These major increases have helped Ireland to become a world leader in renewable electricity generation.  Today, almost 40% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity is generated using low-carbon technologies.  In that way, the electricity sector has reduced its share of Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions from around 20% of the total five years ago to around 16% today, even as demand for electricity has increased.  The ESB will work to continue to support Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation journey.  This means continuing to decarbonise the electricity system and using that clean electricity supply to replace fossil fuels in our heat and transport sectors.  That strategy has the potential to address more than half of Ireland&rsquo;s emissions. <br\/><br\/>The ESB&rsquo;s generation and supply businesses also have undergone major transformations from being monopoly activities in the 1990s to operating in a modern, open and competitive marketplace.  Our generation business has decommissioned older plants as we have worked to develop new forms of sustainable electricity generation. <br\/><br\/>Our supply business, Electric Ireland, competes with a wide array of companies for every customer<i>.  <\/i>Even in the face of this competition, I was delighted to see Electric Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to contribute &euro;1 million to support vulnerable customers during the lockdown. This was in addition to its early commitment not to disconnect any customers during the current and previous lockdowns. <br\/><br\/>Many of the members will also be familiar with how ESB International sells Irish engineering excellence to clients all over the world.  <br\/><br\/>During the past five years the ESB has invested about &euro;1 billion a year in developing our businesses.  We raise debt to finance that expenditure on the international financial markets.  It is vitally important that our investors trust the ESB when they lend us money.  The ESB&rsquo;s current debt stands at around &euro;5 billion, which is significant.  I will always be mindful of the board&rsquo;s role in maintaining a financially strong ESB for the benefit of all.  With more significant investment in electricity infrastructure and renewable energy to be made, it is critical the ESB retains its financial strength and credit rating to access the funding necessary to finance the coming transformation. <br\/><br\/>Turning to culture and heritage, I confirm we are a long-term supporter of the arts, cultural and heritage sector in Ireland.  In 2020, the company opened a purpose-built archive in Finglas to preserve and make available more than 90 years of the ESB&rsquo;s records.<\/p><p>In 2017, we opened a visitor centre in Ardnacrusha to explain the role electricity will play in Ireland&rsquo;s low-carbon future.  We are also commissioning a visitor centre for Oweninny Wind Farm in County Mayo with our partners Bord na M&oacute;na.  Those are tangible commitments to Ireland's culture and heritage. <\/p><p> Turning to delivering a sustainable future, this is a fascinating time for the energy industry.  We are all working to decarbonise our economies and address the challenges of climate change.  The ESB will work tirelessly to support the programme for Government&rsquo;s target of an electricity system that is powered by 70% renewables by 2030.  We are seeing every day the impact of the surge towards renewables.  On windy days, Ireland's electricity system can be powered by up to 65% renewables.  However, there are other days particularly in some winter periods of cold, crisp weather when there is no wind when renewable generation can fall away to almost nothing.  On those days, to make sure we keep the lights on, we need power from other sources.  This security of supply conundrum will be one of the great challenges over the coming decade as Ireland grows onshore and offshore renewables, builds more battery storage capacity and continues the transition to a low-carbon energy system while maintaining security of supply.  <\/p><p> Smart technologies such as advanced digital metering are improving the efficiency and operation of the electricity networks.  ESB Networks is ploughing ahead, it having installed almost 240,000 new meters by the end of 2020. <\/p><p> I look forward to supporting the execution of the ESB's Brighter Future strategy whose vision is to lead the transition to a reliable, affordable, low-carbon energy future.  Over the next decade we will completely transform our generation portfolio.  This will cut the carbon intensity of our generation mix by more than two thirds and provide flexible back-up to allow more and more renewables onto the system.  <\/p><p> This is a great time to be nominated as chairman designate of the ESB board.

What is Mr. O'Rourke's view of the ESB's readiness to handle the community and microgeneration element of energy transition?  We know Ireland is way behind in microgeneration compared to other EU member states.  From talking to community groups, they would say part of the problem is getting access to the grid and also the cost of the connection is unknown.  There is considerable enthusiasm among farmers, businesses, schools and communities to be part of this transition.  Does Mr. O'Rourke think the ESB is ready for it?

In 1976, my father shut the small animal feed mill that was water driven in County Monaghan.  He converted it into a microgeneration system.  He sold electricity generated from the water turbines on the River Fane in County Monaghan to the ESB, so I understand exactly this element.  I remember him being a bit frustrated at the time with all the requirements the ESB imposed.  However, he stuck with it and the mill happily generated electricity for many years and he sold it to the ESB.  This is a very important issue.  Many people across Ireland are keen to play their part in decarbonisation; they want to be able to generate revenue for themselves and decarbonise society through microgeneration. The ESB will make a submission to that process.  We are absolutely committed to making connecting microgeneration as safe and as practical as we can.  There is much detail to be worked out, but the Senator can take it the board is fully committed to this.  It is an issue we fully appreciate and we are committed to doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke for his service.  I should say I appointed him to be chair of Enterprise Ireland, where he did a fantastic job.  I just wish to acknowledge that.  I believe he is really well suited to the challenge we are taking on here.<\/p> <p>  I have just a few questions.  We have seen our ambition for renewables on our grid go from 55% to 70% now.  As we enhance our ambition, what will be the challenges of going beyond 70% renewables on our network and how do we prepare for them?<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns the ESB's wider potential role in tackling the climate challenge.  It is the largest State player by a country mile in terms of its scale and reach.  What does the ESB see as its role in leveraging change behaviour on a much wider basis than simply day-to-day responsibilities?  I refer, for example, to encouraging companies to do audits of their carbon impact, and how they could work with the ESB as a provider to reduce that, and to using the roll-out of the ESB's smart meters to help customers and quickly get them thinking about how they can reduce their impact.  It seems to me that the ESB will be a strategic player from the point of view not just of what it is doing from day to day but also of mobilising private capital, whether individual homeowners, companies or whatever else, and indeed the public sector, which is not always exemplary.  I would be interested to hear how the witnesses would see that wider role being developed and whether the ESB's existing legislative remit recognises sufficiently the capacity the company may have for leading change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#Q00100","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I might, in response to the Deputy's second question, take in some of Enterprise Ireland's experience as well because Enterprise Ireland deals with companies that come to it saying they want to spend money on going low carbon and ask whether Enterprise Ireland can help them.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the Deputy's first question about moving from 55% to 70% of electricity generation being renewables and what we can do to get it above 70%, the problem, as we get to more and more renewables, is intermittency of renewables, both onshore and offshore wind.  The greatest potential is probably offshore wind at this stage.  Everybody is looking at that as the main source of getting towards 100% renewable energy.  Offshore wind off the west coast of Ireland is the most likely source of that, but solar and other sources will be important as well as microgeneration.  The intermittency is the thing that is not being tackled yet.  There are solutions in play.  Battery storage is one.  We are now beginning to see large-scale batteries put in place.  Another part of the solution will be blue hydrogen, whereby one can use renewable energy on the very windy, busy days, producing lots of energy, and convert that into green hydrogen, which can then be used on less windy days or to flow out to deal with the intermittency.  There are technological and technical issues to be solved there, but I believe my colleagues are well on top of that.  As we plan not just for 70% but beyond 70%, those are the kinds of things we will look at to deal with those challenges.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the ESB's wider role.  Getting the carbon element of ESB generation or electricity generation down to a low figure is only one part of the battle.  There are issues involved in transport, heating, agriculture and other sectors, including the public sector.  Electric Ireland, our supply business, provides energy supply services, works with companies and can do things such as work with them to finance a conversion to low-carbon operations and then to recoup the savings over a period.  That service is already available from Energy Ireland, and I can see it being ramped up.  As I said, it has been the answer to the question Enterprise Ireland has been asked by companies, that is, whether we can help them on their decarbonisation journey.  As Deputy Bruton will be aware, Enterprise Ireland is given the remit that it should help Irish companies to expand jobs and exports.  However, these are companies that say they will not increase jobs or exports but just want to decarbonise.  That is not clearly within the remit of Enterprise Ireland, so we are now trying to figure out how we can do that.  We understand the companies and want to work with them, but that will probably involve Enterprise Ireland working with companies such as the ESB and involve Enterprise Ireland working probably with the SEAI as well.<\/p><p>Those are things ahead of us.  The ESB has had a very positive impact.  It is present in every townland in Ireland.  Everybody recognises the yellow vans going around the place.<\/p><p> I agree with the Deputy's point about wider responsibility for encouraging changes in behaviour and awareness.  The smart meters he mentioned are probably a very good way of doing it.  People will be offered in their own homes choices as to what kind of electricity they use, when they use it and how they use it, all in such a way as to try to make us more efficient and more effective in our use of electricity and to minimise the carbon impact of energy usage.  We have a broader responsibility, which I think the board fully accepts.  I am not sure we need any change in our remit because our remit is to support the economic and social development of Ireland.  That is part of what the ESB was set up to do.  I, therefore, do not think we need a legislative change.  However, I take on board the point that it is not just the technical, operational aspect of things but the behavioural change and supporting people to help people make the change.  We are committed to that and the committee will see more of that in years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke.

I think 2007 and 2004 are the only years in which the limits have been changed.  At &euro;5 billion at the moment we are coming up close to our &euro;6 billion limit.  It is unclear whether the limit includes joint ventures and subsidiaries.  We applied last year for an increase in the limits.  We will spend about &euro;7 billion over the next five years in capital expenditure.  To allow ourselves to have the financial capacity to do that, we thought it would be better to get out of the &euro;6 billion limit.  We applied for &euro;10 billion.  The proposal at the moment is &euro;12 billion.  That is probably a very good cushion, but who knows what will be required in the next five, ten or 20 years?  Rather than requiring changes in legislation all the time, it is sensible to put in a good headroom limit there because we may be offered opportunities to have joint ventures with other people.  We may have requirements from our shareholder to invest in our business and to create even larger projects.  To enable us to have the flexibility to do all that, we thought it was sensible to seek a borrowing increase at this time.  Our current strategy, which the board endorsed in November, requires &euro;7 billion in capital expenditure for the next five years.  The maximum borrowing in that strategy shows, I think, approximately &euro;7 billion, so we do not intend anywhere at the moment in our current plans to go anywhere near &euro;10 billion or &euro;12 billion.  It is just to allow for optionality.<\/p> <p>  The joint venture with Coillte is a great project because it involves two State-owned bodies, owned by the taxpayers, working together to take the opportunity of using Coillte's land all over the country.  As the land is already used for forestry, it is probably easier than many other locations to change into locations for wind farms.  We are working on a number of sites with Coillte.  It is great to get that joint venture approved through the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  There are a number of conditions in there, but they are ones we think we will be able to fulfil.  We look forward to working with Coillte to develop wind farms in appropriate locations around the country.  I take on board the Deputy's observation on the wind farm guidelines, which need to be updated.  We are very happy to work with the regulator in that regard.  We understand that for the benefit of the whole community we need renewable energy.  Some of that has to be onshore wind, but we understand that creates tensions with local communities.  We will work very hard to make sure that people's concerns are understood and we will do as best we can to accommodate any concerns.  Adhering to updated guidelines will be part of the way we will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke for his presentation and for coming to the committee today.

It is an issue we follow very carefully because of those concerns.  We have historically purchased a very small percentage of the output of that mine.  In the period from 2015 to 2018 we purchased some 2% of the total mine capacity.  We have not used any coal from Cerrej&oacute;n in the time since then and we are not currently using any of its coal.<\/p> <p>  We are conscious of the fact that when we buy coal from around the world we need to understand what the conditions are where the coal comes from.  In 2014 we joined an organisation called Bettercoal.  It had been established shortly before that by a number of large coal buyers.  It is on the buying side and is entirely independent of the mining side.  The mission of the organisation is the continuous improvement in coal mining operations through collective influence.<\/p> <p>  As a 2% purchaser we do not have much influence in the mines, so joining Bettercoal was a way for us to leverage our influence to punch above our weight.  Bettercoal commenced assessment of the Cerrej&oacute;n mine in 2016.  The assessment included research, completion of questionnaires, visits to the site, talking to the local communities, trade unions and NGOs.  The Bettercoal assessment measured the mine's operations against a large number of criteria across ten principles, which included human rights, workers' rights, ethics and community engagement.  The assessment found that Cerrej&oacute;n met, or substantially met, the vast majority of the Bettercoal criteria and the assessment did not record any failures.  Senior managers at ESB have visited the mine on a number of occasions and were very vigilant about this matter.  We understand the concerns people have.  There are people there who are trying to improve the conditions anywhere there are shortfalls.  We continue to keep an eye on it, but we are not buying any coal from them at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Working through the coal and human rights point, has the ESB decided to move away from importing coal from Cerrej&oacute;n entirely?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#S00300","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>The coal that is required to power Moneypoint is a particular type of coal that is only available in a couple of mines around the world.

As we decarbonise transport and heating domestically and industrially, electricity is probably the best way to do that.  If electricity can be generated as safely, as securely and with as low-carbon emissions as possible, it would be the best.  It is not, however, something that can be done overnight.  We believe there will be a requirement for a suitable mix of generation that is increasingly sustainable.  Our target is 70% by 2030, which is in line with the legislation and the Paris Agreement, as I understand it.  If we can do it quicker than that, we will.<\/p> <p>  As I said to Deputy Bruton, one of the issues is the intermittence on renewables such as wind and solar.  The sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow, so one must have other technologies available.  At the moment the best one of those, and the least carbon effective one, is gas.<\/p><p>We use Moneypoint and coal burning very infrequently now.  The heavy fuel such as diesel oil is also hardly used.  We got out of those.  We have moved away from the high carbon fuels used to generate thermal plants.

That will be required for a number of years going forward because of the need to continue to supply electricity for Irish social and economic activity and as we go on the journey towards full-scale renewables.<\/p><p> We will need to deal with some technical issues.

My first question concerns the planning process that Coillte is currently engaging with.  Since the ESB has a relationship with Coillte, I believe it is important that Mr. O'Rourke might address this issue.  I am aware of one very large project in east Clare that is being processed for planning through An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  From my own engagement the community I believe that there has not been the appropriate level of engagement with the community that would be expected.  To some extent this is the result of the Covid crisis and the inability of people to meet in public forums.  It is a fact that people are not circulating, they are not going to the pub or the church, so they are not meeting and are not even aware that the process is under way.  I ask that the ESB and Coillte, because they are involved in projects, would delay the submission of applications until such time as we are out the other end of this, or that they find a more prominent way of engaging with people.  I do not believe it is appropriate to move ahead as they have done on that particular project.<\/p> <p>  We have all signed up to the commitments on renewables by 2030, and rightly so.  I put it to Mr. O'Rourke, however, that the ESB from its early stages was ahead of time in its thinking and was always looking to the next phase of development and the next engineering phase.  With its relationship with Coillte the ESB is really just doubling down on what is now older technology.  Why has the ESB not moved more aggressively towards the generation of electricity offshore?  The opportunity is there.  It is very clear that the future is there.  Large multinationals are looking at that area and advancing it.  Why is the ESB sitting back and effectively doubling down on the onshore technology?  If the ESB was delivering, as Mr. O'Rourke said at the outset, on its mandate for the country, the ESB would be looking at offshore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#T00900","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Dooley for his points on consultation and community engagement, and on the offshore versus onshore.  I take the Senator's point that it is difficult to do community engagement at the moment.  I am aware that the community engagement is an important part of any process of large infrastructure projects to make sure that people have an opportunity to express their concerns, and for making sure we can deal with any concerns as best we can.  We will be working with Coillte and I will make sure to bring that issue back to management to make sure we take on board that the community is not happy with the level of consultation available at the moment, and to see what further we can do.  I understand the importance of that.<\/p><p>A couple of years ago, I led a group in the business community looking at the best way to do community engagement.  We had representatives from the ESB, EirGrid, Bord G&aacute;is and others working out the best way to do that.  I believe it is an important issue and I fully understand the point.<\/p><p> In terms of old versus new technology, offshore wind is technically challenging.  Obviously, the best way will be floating platforms, which is completely new technology.  The ESB is engaged.  Before Christmas, the board approved the purchase of 50% of a wind farm off the coast of Arklow.  We are also engaged in a wind farm off the coast of County Louth and have investments off the coast of Scotland. Neart na Gaoithe is a big wind farm in which we are in joint venture.  The great opportunity to learn the technology is the very point made by the Senator.  We are therefore absolutely committed to finding out and understanding how wind farms work.<\/p><p> What is needed to really advance this in Ireland is some technology proving, which is what we are doing and learning from other people, but also the legislative framework.  There are a whole lot of issues about the seabed and how floating platforms work and all the rest.  The legislative framework to really expand offshore wind is needed now.  Advances need to be made in the connection of the grid to bring electricity from offshore back onto the ground and make sure it can be connected and transmitted through the transmission network.  Therefore, a number of technical issues are to be addressed but they are all on the ESB's agenda.  We will work as fast as we can to do that.<\/p><p> I thank the Deputy for his comment about how the ESB seemed to be ahead of its time in the past and now it does not appear to be.  We are doing a lot of work the Deputy is probably not aware of.  Our engineers, however, are working on some of the best projects in the world in offshore energy at the moment.  We know that is part of the answer for Ireland because we are rich in offshore wind and it is something we can actually export in the future.  In ten, 20 or 30 years' time, we could be a great exporter of energy and electricity from Ireland by using our offshore wind.  The ESB is fully committed to being part of that for the benefit of the taxpayers of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#T01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke.  I want to follow up on a couple of issues that have already been flagged.  A concern I would have is that it the ESB seems to be at a stage in its planning where it is chasing the regulations that might come in rather than anticipating them.  I believe Senator Dooley was making a similar point, that we and the ESB need to be ahead of time.  I am a little bit concerned, therefore, with regard to the investments.  We say, \"neither a borrower not a lender be\", but the fact is that the ESB is borrowing heavily.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that Mr. O'Rourke mentioned the generation portfolio.  What is being promised to those investors in terms of a generation portfolio?  What expectations are being giving to those investors?  We have a rapidly evolving policy landscape.  Are they being given an expectation, for example, that blue hydrogen will definitely be in the mix?  There is a big difference between green and blue hydrogen.  The ESB should anticipate that blue hydrogen will not be in the mix for very long.  The move against it in Europe is strong and the scientific evidence we have heard previously in this committee against that kind of hydrogen is very strong.  Therefore, is the ESB planning, and are its investors aware, that blue hydrogen might not be an aspect or an option in the mix, especially if we scale from &euro;5 billion to &euro;12 billion?  What risk-proofing is there in terms of exposure on expectations in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Is the investment the ESB is making and perhaps anticipates making with the &euro;12 billion in funding it hopes to draw down green investment and is it consistent with the spirit - I know it is not bound by the letter - of the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act 2018, which we passed in the Oireachtas?  I believe those are really important questions.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned by the emphasis Mr. O'Rourke has placed on financial markets as a priority.  They are a priority but I believe energy supply and the environment will also be key priorities for the ESB in the longer term security picture.<\/p> <p>  Could and should environmental impact assessments be used earlier and better in terms of ESB infrastructure?  That is really important.<\/p> <p>  Rather than looking to alternatives in terms of hydrogen, what percentage of this new funding will go into investing in the issue of storage?<\/p><p>That is the crucial issue.  We do not want to hear in six years' time that sometimes the wind does not blow.  That issue really needs to be dealt with and prioritised as an area of innovation.  We hear much more about carbon capture than we hear about renewable energy storage.  The emphasis needs to shift there.<\/p><p> In the previous Oireachtas, the ESB appeared before this committee regarding the unfortunate issue of leaks.  Have Mr. O'Rourke or his colleagues heard, or do they have information, about whether the 75 new and historic leaks have been addressed or whether the decommissioning of the fluid-filled infrastructure cables has happened?<\/p><p> I note a new code of ethics has been introduced.  Could Mr. O'Rourke comment on that because it is a governance code of ethics?  Has there been consultation with the workers, unions and all relevant stakeholders around that new code of ethics for the ESB?<\/p><p> Finally, I note Mr. O'Rourke has a background in history and he spoke about heritage.  I am extremely concerned by the proposed change of No. 29 Fitzwilliam Street from a public museum and amenity.  With great respect, the new heritage measures suggested by Mr. O'Rourke do not replace what was in a way, as I see it, a penance for demolition and ruining of a 1 km-long Georgian street by ESB building works in 1965.  I know that in 2015, the obligation on the ESB to restore it fully was lifted on the understanding that anything that replaced that site would be a public amenity.  Does Mr. O'Rourke not regard that public museum as a key public amenity?  I urge him in his new capacity as chairman to look strongly at reconsidering the removal of one of the few publicly accessible Georgian buildings in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#U00200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins.

The Senator said that we appear to be chasing regulations rather than anticipating them.  I have only been involved with the ESB for the past number of weeks but I have seen that it is well aware of the need to change.  That issue of getting the legislative framework required for offshore wind in place is a matter of ongoing consultation between ourselves and the regulator and ourselves and the Department.<\/p> <p>  The ESB is absolutely involved in anticipating and shaping those regulations and trying to make sure they are the most effective way of getting to do the things we need to do.  I therefore hope we would not be seen as chasing regulations but actually anticipating and helping to shape them.  Our job is to be the experts on the ground and know the right way to make sure the regulations are effective, not only for the operations of the ESB but for the protection and safety of the community.<\/p> <p>  The Senator spoke about the investments and alluded to my reference to the need for the ESB to be financially strong.  That is reality.  The issue is that we need to make a lot of investment now.  There is a big investment, which will be repayable over a long future.  We have a situation where we need to make big investments now and the repayment will be over many years of supply of electricity.  It is something that is entirely suited for borrowing.  The Senator is correct.  We must do that prudently and in such a way that the financial markets are helping it.<\/p> <p>  I should say that I have chaired another sale and investment forum in the last number of years, which is about trying to help our financial investor colleagues to understand the need for transformation in the economy, that is, the need to go to green energy.  We found there was a great and growing interest from financial investors in decarbonisation because they did not want to invest in projects which are not sustainable and do not have a long-term future as we move to a zero-carbon world.  Investors are well aware of this.<\/p> <p>  I am not aware of the detail of the mix.  The Senator made a comment about blue hydrogen.  As I understand it, that would not be a necessary part of the mix.  If any blue hydrogen is involved, it is a matter of transition as we need to go to green hydrogen.  Blue hydrogen is only a stepping stone as we go to green hydrogen.  We will get there eventually.<\/p> <p>  I already mentioned the importance of battery storage and dealing with intermittent wind.  I agree with the Senator.  I do not want whoever is in my chair in ten years' time telling the committee the wind does not blow on certain days.  That is the reality today as we transition, however.  We need to deal with that because we need to keep the lights on, businesses powered and homes warm.  That requires us to use an appropriate mix of generation but that mix is changing over the period in our plan.  We plan to change it to 70% renewable energy by 2030 and earlier if we can, and as soon as possible thereafter with the technology and investment required to get towards zero carbon.  Therefore, it is exactly in our lines to do that and we must do it in a way that ensures we remain financially stable.  There is no point in us borrowing imprudently and not being able to make the investments and provide electricity to the people of Ireland.<\/p><p>We must balance the needs that the Senator, entirely appropriately, raised as a concern, but it is an issue of which we were already aware.<br\/><br\/>The Senator is correct in that, as an historian, I am aware of the importance of showcasing heritage and reminding current and future generations of its importance.  That is why we have initiatives like the archives and the visitor centres in Ardnacrusha and Oweninny.<br\/><br\/>On the museum, my understanding is that there was no planning permission or anything else.  It is something the ESB did voluntarily.  It was not a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>, as we understand it.  The museum comes in two parts, namely, the contents and the building.  The contents have always been owned by the National Museum of Ireland and have always been borrowed from it.  We returned them to the National Museum of Ireland when we started a redevelopment a few years ago.<br\/><br\/>I agree on what was done in the 1960s to the kilometre-long Georgian street.  Nobody would want to endorse or support that now.  I regret it also.  We hope the redevelopment of the new building is more in keeping with the heritage and the streetscape.  I hope members will see that.  It involves two new office buildings to replace the 1916 buildings, one of which has been sold to help to finance the project.  As part of the process, we are refurbishing up to 11 Georgian houses, three of which will be used for ESB's offices and eight of which will be returned to family and residential use.  That is what we are doing.<br\/><br\/>I absolutely agree on the need to showcase the heritage.  My contention is that it does not necessarily have to be in No. 29.  We are going to work with colleagues in Dublin City Council, the OPW and the National Museum of Ireland to examine heritage-related initiatives that could address concerns.  I recognise that point.  I was a visitor to the museum myself even before I was involved in the ESB and I know it very well.  My children visited and they were fascinated by it.  We need to have the heritage available to people.  The uses of buildings change.  If we did not change buildings, the members would be sitting in a building that was the home of the Duke of Leinster or home to the Royal Dublin Society.  We need to have the heritage available to people.  We are going to work with all the stakeholders to make sure it is available, but it does not necessarily have to be at No. 29.  As part of the project, it made sense to do significant refurbishment.  When we sell these houses, we will not be a making profit.  The houses were built a long time ago and need a lot of work in terms of refurbishment of floors and the fixing of windows and roofs.  There is a considerable amount of work to return them to what they were built for, which was to house families.  That is what all the houses are going to be returned to now.  That is what we are about, but we are very conscious of the heritage point and we are going to commit to dealing with that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I apologise for being delayed.

It is lovely to have him here.  I have read his opening statement.<\/p> <p>  On the decarbonisation of the sector and the ESB's contribution to it, I commend Mr. O'Rourke.  I heard a presentation from his public affairs section some weeks ago and it was very informative.  What supports has the ESB given over the past year to both residential and business customers in the face of the pandemic?  While that is slightly off topic, I would like an answer since Mr. O'Rourke is here.<\/p> <p>  On the ESB's Brighter Future strategy, I am aware from D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown, from which I hail, that the council has worked closely with the electricity suppliers to change sodium lights to LED lights.

There should be some museum after the works are completed.  It is imperative.  He also said his own children saw the museum.  As a child, I went to see it.

Obviously, we are aware that the pandemic has hit people in different ways.  Many small businesses, in particular, have been hit.  Many families have also been hit.  Especially in cold times like these, people need their energy but may not have the ability to pay.  We will work with anybody.  We will engage with anybody.  We absolutely made a commitment during the lockdowns not to make any disconnections.  There were no disconnections made during any period of lockdown, and that will continue to be the case.  We have a fund of &euro;1 million with which we are able to help our vulnerable customers.  With it, we are helping to contribute to costs where customers are just unable to pay and cannot see a way forward through deferment or anything like that.  Additionally, we have increased our contributions to organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and bodies working with the homeless at this time.  We are aware of the stress the pandemic has caused in the community, and we are working with all our customers, both business and domestic, to try to ensure they get from us what they need.  Bearing in mind the many problems people have, I understand electricity supply has not been a particular issue, but we recognise it can be a stress factor.  We will work very closely with customers to alleviate their concerns as best we can.<\/p> <p>  On public lighting, I will not be able to tell the Deputy how many sodium lights have been replaced.  Public lighting is a matter for local authorities, which I am sure will be able to answer.  I am happy to work with him to get the information.  It is not information I have and I am not sure the ESB has it.  I believe it is a local authority issue.<\/p> <p>  On the installation of 240,000 new meters, and those to come, these are new digital meters.  Instead of the old wheel that clicked around, the analogue device, there is now a digital meter.  It is connected and will help with microgeneration.  If homeowners wish to have a solar panel and put electricity back into the grid, rather than taking it from it, the new meter will allow that.  It will enable people to work out costs.  There will be different tariffs available at different times of the day.  People may decide to run the washing machine or to engage in heavy electrical usage at certain times, and they will be able to do so much more flexibly with a digital meter.  We will offer different tariffs to people at different times so it will be much more flexible.  It will help customers to decide how much money they are going to spend and when they are going to spend it.  It will help them to contribute towards decarbonisation and to lower energy usage.  The meters are an essential part of this.  They are being rolled out to houses right across the country as we speak.  Almost 250,000 were installed before the end of last year.  While the process was affected a little by Covid, we almost managed to meet our target for last year.<\/p> <p>  Energy supply and security comprise an important issue.  We talked earlier about the need for a generation mix.  The impact of Brexit is not significant at the moment.  The interconnectors are still working.  There is potential for more challenging issues to arise regarding the use of the interconnectors but the interim position when 1 January clicked round was that there was no change in the market.  There is, however, potential for disruption.  The interconnector proposed to connect us to the electricity grid in France is, therefore, an important part of the mix.  We are not sure of the exact framework for how the interconnector with Great Britain will work in the future.  The interconnector is an important part of the energy mix, along with renewables and some remaining gas, which is being phased out.  The interconnector is important and, as I understand it, Brexit just complicates matters.<\/p> <p>  On No. 29 Fitzwilliam Street, we were very happy to work with others who were interested in preserving and showcasing Georgian heritage.  We will play our part in ensuring the kinds of experiences members' children and my children have had will be available to Irish citizens in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I was very happy to hear Mr. O'Rourke mention the Ardnacrusha visitor centre.<\/p><p>It is just a few kilometres upriver from my home.  I have been to the centre, which is fantastic, and I congratulate the ESB on embracing its own industrial heritage.  Indeed the ESB was born in Ardnacrusha and it is something of which people in Limerick and Clare are very proud.  I know Mr. O'Rourke's father was at the microgenerator on the river in Monaghan.  My family was involved in the construction of Ardnacrusha and it is something of which we are quite proud.  At the time, it was a vast engineering project.  One fifth of the national budget was spent on building Ardnacrusha, which was the first of its kind in the world.  Indeed many large-scale hydro projects around the world emulated what was done in Ardnacrusha.<\/p><p> I do not think it is a project we would do now, partly because of the cost but also because of the environmental impact of it.  It is true to say that it did have a huge environmental impact in Limerick and Clare and I believe it continues to do so.

Obviously, some of the things we do have an environmental impact, so our objective is to carry out our main programme in a manner that is as environmentally sensitive and adaptable as possible.  Regarding Ardnacrusha, the safe discharge of floodwater takes precedence over all other matters, including the generation of electricity, so if we have a choice between releasing floodwater or generating electricity, we release floodwater to try to relieve flooding pressures at various points on the Shannon.  The Shannon is obviously a very complex river that is very slow moving and tends to flood along its reaches.  The ESB works with other parties like the Office of Public Works, OPW, the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, Waterways Ireland and the various local authorities.  We will continue to work with them to see if the operation of Ardnacrusha can help in any way to minimise the flooding impact and with regard to things like fisheries and other areas in respect of which we have a remit to make sure that is done as sensitively and effectively as possible.<\/p> <p>  I take the Chairman's point about wind farms.  Offshore wind power is very challenging technically in terms of floating offshore platforms, but in a way it is probably the least environmentally impactful of the various trends we are looking at, and this is why we are very keen to develop our understanding of and plans for that as soon as we can.  The Chairman can take it that we have a subcommittee of the board dealing with environmental issues and the impact of the ESB and its operations to make sure they are environmentally sensitive as well, that we are as low carbon as possible and that, where possible, our vans are fuelled in a way that does not take much fossil fuel.  The environmental impact of all we do is a constant imperative for the company and our board to be cognisant of.<\/p><p>I, therefore, take the Chairman's comments and I will make sure that we continue to be focused on that and try to watch out for that all the time while also trying to provide safe, secure and affordable electricity to the people of Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke for his answer.

Pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, the evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege.  However, if they are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the places in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, to make his opening statement.

The interim report of the committee sets out a number of key observations, including in respect of pre-budget and performance scrutiny.  I will deal with the issues that are relevant to the expenditure side of these processes.<\/p> <p>  I am very appreciative of the efforts and the insights that have gone into the preparation of the interim report.  It is encouraging that the progress that has been made in recent years in improving and strengthening the opportunities for parliamentary engagement in our budgetary process not least through the establishment of this committee, of which I am a former member, but also that it would be kept under review and that opportunities for further enhancement should be identified and implemented, where appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Equally, it is important to acknowledge and to remind ourselves of the progress that has been made and that is under way to support increased parliamentary engagement.  As I have just mentioned, the establishment of this committee is one milestone in this reform agenda, as is the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office.  At the same time, the reforms introduced by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform also support budgetary scrutiny and effective engagement with the budgetary process.  The programme for Government also outlines a number of priorities in the area of reform to the budgetary process, including the development of well-being measures and better budgeting for demographic costs.  These priorities, along with the significant reforms in place, can help to deliver more focused and more informed engagement.  As the committee noted in the interim report, a more effective budgetary framework has the potential to lead to improved outcomes for citizens through better informed policy-making, resource allocation and accountability.  Ultimately, that is an outcome we all want to see delivered.<\/p> <p>  Reforms in recent years with the publication of additional documents such as the summer economic statement and the mid-year expenditure report support better pre-budget scrutiny.  I acknowledge that the pandemic impacted this process last year, with the mid-year expenditure report not being published in July as usual and being replaced by a pre-budget expenditure update published in advance of the budget in October.<\/p> <p>  The exceptional circumstances last year, with a requirement to respond to the evolving situation with the virus, meant that the focus was on implementing measures to support people and businesses experiencing extreme difficulties arising from Covid-19 and to ensure that the health service had the resources to respond to the crisis.  The scale of support provided resulted in overall gross voted expenditure for 2020 coming in at &euro;85.3 billion, an increase of almost &euro;15 billion on the amount set out in the pre-Covid Revised Estimates for Public Services 2020, the REV.  I acknowledge the role of the Oireachtas in considering and approving this significant level of additional expenditure required to implement these support measures.<\/p> <p>  Turning to pre-budget scrutiny, there are a number of processes in place that can support such engagement.<\/p><p>In setting out the departmental expenditure baseline for the medium term, reflecting pre-existing commitments arising from cost pressures such as demographics and outlining the mid-year expenditure position for Departments, the mid-year expenditure report is focused on supporting enhanced pre-budget scrutiny.  I note that the interim report specifically references the cost of standing still for the budget year, including taking account of demographics.  This is an issue that the mid-year report seeks to inform and, as I noted earlier, better budgeting for demographic costs is included in the programme for Government. <\/p><p> Alongside the mid-year expenditure report, my Department publishes the spending review papers.  Among the objectives of the spending review process are the assessment of the effectiveness of public spending in delivering on policy objectives and the development of evidence-informed policy making.  With more than 100 published papers from the spending review process since 2017, this represents a significant evidence base to support policy formulation and development and a year-round approach to the budget process. <\/p><p> I note that the interim report outlines that performance scrutiny should move towards a more structured year-round engagement.  I am supportive of the principle that underlies this recommendation.  Indeed, there are a number of processes and reports in place that can support such engagement.  In this regard, performance budgeting has been a key focus of budgetary reform.  With the change in the budgetary timetable in 2013 and the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, now being published in December each year, this provides an opportunity for earlier engagement by committees with the Estimates during the first quarter of the year.  The REV itself has developed significantly in recent years and now routinely includes details on activities, outputs and context-specific outcome indicators.  <\/p><p> Over the past three or four years in particular, the performance budgeting initiative has been expanded to include indicators relating to equality objectives.  The equality budgeting initiative was first introduced as part of budget 2018 and aims to provide greater information on how budgetary measures are likely to impact upon the various dimensions of equality.  Expanding from an initial pilot, REV 2021 includes equality indicators for a number of Votes across 12 ministerial Vote groups, with additional Departments providing indicators this year including the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Since its introduction, the performance budgeting initiative has been kept under review with a view to enhancing the quality of the information provided.  As we look to develop performance budgeting further the OECD, under the EU&rsquo;s structural reform support programme, is currently engaged in a project to improve the effectiveness of performance budgeting drawing on international best practice.  In its work, the OECD has met with a wide range of stakeholders including members of the committee. <\/p><p> A significant volume of information is published in the REV each year, with information at programme level on financial resources, outputs and public service activities and impact indicators.  Taking into account the ongoing work to enhance performance budgeting, this affords the opportunity to leverage the use of existing reports and processes to support the work of the Oireachtas in scrutinising Estimates.  While the REV deals with planned performance for the year ahead, the public service performance report outlines the key outputs that have been delivered each year.  This report was developed to facilitate meaningful and constructive dialogue on what is being delivered with public funds and is available for use by Oireachtas committees. <\/p><p> As noted earlier, the programme for Government contains a commitment on the development of a well-being framework for our country.  The development of this framework is aligned with the aforementioned reforms.  In developing this framework, I am mindful of the need for Government to consult with key stakeholders as such consultation should ensure buy-in to the framework and ensure its relevance to the work of those charged with designing, implementing and scrutinising public policy. <\/p><p> There are many reports and processes in existence that we can look to utilise as we work together to improve engagement between Government and the Oireachtas on the budgetary process and on scrutiny of performance.  Such an approach can support effective engagement, timely provision of information and the identification of those metrics of performance, equality and well-being that are most useful to parliamentary accountability.  It would also be important that there is a clear sense of the respective roles and responsibilities of the various committees as this clarity can support Departments in their engagement with the Oireachtas.  I look forward to a good discussion and to working with the committee on ways to enhance this area of work in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#B00100","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and now invite the Minister for Finance to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#C00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson and the committee for the opportunity to discuss the current framework for parliamentary engagement in the budgetary process.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the committee's report and look forward to the discussion we will have.<\/p><p>At the outset we can all agree that there has been much progress in our broader approach to the national fiscal framework over recent years and I want to assure the committee that I and my Department will continue to play a constructive role going forward, both formally and informally.  To put this in context, it would be useful to briefly highlight the main reforms to our budgetary framework.<br\/><br\/>I have spoken on many occasions about the importance of our institutions.  Independent, analytically-robust and respected institutions perform an invaluable role in any democracy.  In this regard, perhaps the most important reform to the fiscal framework in recent years has been the establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.  The council provides a crucial input to the budgetary process, providing an independent assessment of my Department&rsquo;s economic and budgetary forecasts, the stance of fiscal policy and compliance with the fiscal rules.  In terms of the economic projections that underpin Government policy, a transparent, rigorous process precedes both the budget and the stability programme update forecasting rounds.  Additionally, the scrutiny of Government policy provided by the council is now firmly embedded within our budgetary architecture.  I know that this committee&rsquo;s deliberations with the council have provided a broader context for my engagement with this committee. <br\/><br\/>Another important reform initiated in recent years is the national economic dialogue.  This is now firmly part of the annual budgetary cycle although, unfortunately, it was interrupted this year.  The dialogue is normally preceded by the publication of the summer economic statement which sets out the main parameters of the budget.  I will say more about this later.  The dialogue provides an opportunity for all stakeholders to participate in an open and inclusive exchange on the competing economic and social priorities facing the Government. <br\/><br\/>Each summer my Department also oversees the circulation of the tax strategy group<i><\/i>papers to the relevant sectoral Oireachtas committees.  This group comprises representatives from various Government Departments, political advisers and politicians in government.  The papers that are published on our website are a stock take of existing tax measures and include issues for discussion and costed options for change.  Finally, the establishment of this committee itself is also an important reform to the budgetary infrastructure<b>.<\/b><br\/><br\/>Turning now to the committee&rsquo;s interim report, many of the issues raised have been covered by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and I will not repeat what he has already said.  As the committee will be aware, the programme for Government outlined the Government&rsquo;s objective of developing better measures of quality of life and well-being.  Connected to this is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to expand equality budgeting.  In this regard, I am engaging with my colleagues, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, on next steps in this area. <br\/><br\/>In terms of the further development of well-being measures, this will be guided by an expert group convened through the Department of the Taoiseach.  My officials have been engaging with their counterparts in the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform in order to further develop the technical aspects of this work.  My Department published a paper entitled Wellbeing and the Measurement of Broader Living Standards in Ireland alongside budget 2021.  The paper examined the development of international approaches to well-being and looked at options for national well-being measurement in Ireland.  The purpose of these measures will be to complement existing economic tools and measures and not to replace them.  It is hoped and anticipated that these new measures can serve over time as a useful reference for a range of policy and budgetary reform initiatives which are currently under way, including performance budgeting, equality budgeting, spending reviews and proofing of policy proposals against environmental and other goals.  On green budgeting, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has already incorporated green budgeting practices into its expenditure analysis in recent years<b>.<\/b><br\/><br\/>I will conclude on the summer economic statement as it concerns one of the recommendations in the interim report.<\/p><p>In a nutshell, the summer economic statement is a vehicle in which the available level of resources for the year ahead is communicated to the Oireachtas and to the general public, taking into account the need to ensure sound budgetary practice.<\/p><p> I am aware of the views of the committee on the fact that it was not possible to produce this document last year.  I wrote to the Chairman outlining the reasons for this.  I believe the SES is an important staging post in advance of the annual budget and I have been in front of the committee on many occasions to discuss it.  I will continue to accommodate the committee in terms of future attendance.  It is my expectation that the SES will be published over the summer.  We will have to engage in government on the format and role of the SES.  I look forward to engaging with the committee at the appropriate time.<\/p><p> Having said that, it is important as we look at the SES to highlight the voluminous amount of economic and fiscal analysis published by my Department over the course of any year.  For example, we recently launched the annual debt report some weeks ago to highlight the many issues, positive and negative, associated with the accumulation of public debt.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I believe it is fair to say that the budgetary processes have evolved significantly in recent years.  Notwithstanding the challenging times we are in, the Government shares the committee's view of ensuring we have an open, transparent and engaged budgetary process.  Sound, counter-cyclical budgetary policy is at the heart of a well-performing economy and a fit-for-purpose budgetary framework is a key part of this.  I remain committed to assisting the committee in its work and look forward to engaging with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#C00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I will now open the floor to members.

That was certainly not the intention of me, as Minister, in appearing before the committee, which, of course, I am happy to do at any point.  As both the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I acknowledged in our opening statements, this was a year like no other in the context of budget 2021.  We have acknowledged that, due to the circumstances of the year, it was not possible to publish a mid-year expenditure report.  That was and has been in recent years an important part of the overall process for the committee in preparing for the budget that will be unveiled the following October.<\/p> <p>  Also, we did not have the summer economic statement, as has been acknowledged.  The truth is that in preparing budget 2021 we were dealing with an extraordinary amount of volatility.  Final decisions on the budget were made following careful consideration over a period at a late stage.  As we know, we constructed the budget against certain key assumptions in terms of Brexit, the pandemic and the issue of a vaccination programme.  We decided on the need for a recovery fund of &euro;3.4 billion and a Covid-19 contingency fund of &euro;2 billion.<\/p><p>All of these issues were very much in play and remained under active consideration until the eve of the budget.  That is the truth because it was a year like no other.  We had many moving parts.

Is this the way the Minister is going to continue in terms of increasing the budget, even with volatility?  The scope of the package of the budget that the Minister relayed to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight five days before the budget was increased by one third.  That is not on.  It is not the relationship we should have with the Executive.  The Minister knew or had a sense of where the parameters would be.  The Minister might not have known the final figure but decided to keep it from us.  It was okay because we learned about it in the Sunday newspapers, as I said to the Minister at the committee.  I said the Committee on Budgetary Oversight will gain more from reading the Sunday newspapers than from questioning the Minister five days before the budget.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance said the expectation - or words to that effect - was that the summer economic statement would be published.  I hope the Minister will clarify that there will be a summer economic statement and there are no \"buts\".  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council criticised the Government and the Department for not doing that last year.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the stability programme update and the spring statement.  Is it the intention that the statement will be published at the end of April?  Will there be medium-term projections?  In the budget documentation last year the Minister said it would contain medium-term projections to set a pathway towards moving the national finances back to a balanced position once the public health situation allows.  Can the Minister explain how far out we are going to look?  Is it a five-year projection?  Is that forthcoming in April?<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister respond to the issue of the fiscal rules and the Stability and Growth Pact?  Does the Minister share my view - more and more people across Europe are saying it - that the pact is now outdated?  I believe that, with the levels of indebtedness chasing the 60% targets, it is not appropriate at this point and we need to look at these rules all over again.<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister, especially in his role as president of the Eurogroup, support the extension of the general escape clause and the work of rewriting the fiscal architecture of the European Union?  The purpose is to replace what I would argue is an obsession with debts and deficits with targets such as full employment and public investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#F00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>There will be a summer economic statement, although I will have to consult within Government regarding the format of the SES.

Anyway, there will be an SES, but I will have to agree the format with Government.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Doherty asked about the timing of the stability programme update.  We will publish a stability programme update at the end of April.  It will contain a multi-annual projection with regard to budget performance and how we will look to move our national finances into a sustainable position.  The programme for Government has a long-term commitment to return our national finances back to a position of health.  Again, that will be outlined in the stability programme update.  I wish to emphasise that there will be considerable uncertainty around this.  It will be a different SPU format from what we have done before because there are still many variables and changes that could have a major impact on our economic performance.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Doherty asked a question with regard to the fiscal rules and architecture.  I should make clear here that I am not speaking as president of the Eurogroup on this issue.

It is a matter for the Government to decide on what our application is going to be and we have to engage with the Commission on that.

When I am dealing with this matter in the context of the recovery and resilience facility or, indeed, any other engagement that I have with the European Commission, I will make reference to the roadmap on corporate tax reform that I published several weeks ago.

At the same time, are we recognising fully the problem that faces the general public?  After experiencing hard times for so long and being crushed for so long, do we need to give them some kind of encouragement or incentive in recognition of the efforts they have made and in view of the fact that we cannot recover all the expenditure in a year or two years but that, with the passage of time and growth, we will recover some of the ground?

It is open until 22 February and we would be delighted to hear from the committee as part of that process.  All Departments have been consulted regarding the preparation of that plan which is currently under way.<\/p> <p>  On the question asked by Deputy Durkan, we are certainly pursuing counter-cyclical policies at this point.  Over the course of 2021, our expenditure ceiling is almost &euro;88 billion.  That encompasses the money that has been allocated to the 45 Votes as well as the &euro;5.4 billion across the recovery fund and, of course, the Covid contingency fund.  We will require that money because the fact is that we are in level 5 restrictions.  We are dealing with a very strong third wave of this virus.  As such, the cost of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the CRSS, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the local authority rates waiver and so on is running at between &euro;1.2 billion and &euro;1.3 billion per month at this stage.  A certain amount of the provision necessary for that was provided for within the Votes allocated but, as the months go by and depending on the length and depth of the restrictions that need to be imposed, the resources we provided for are going to be required.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, given his international experience and overall responsibility in terms of macroeconomic policy, is well placed to comment on the overall budgetary strategy for the coming years.  One thing he and I share is the view that we should be unremarkable in European terms when considered next to our peers.  By that, we mean that we cannot be an outlier on the negative front because the extraordinary support of the European Central Bank, coupled with the strong position from which we went into this crisis, means that the current level of historically low interest rates will not continue indefinitely.  The markets will at some point take a view as to the overall sustainability of each country's public finances.  We are in a good position.  I believe we are managing this well.  We can afford to do what we are doing, but over the next period, and particularly in the stability programme update, we will need to map out a roadmap for the country in terms of the restoration of the public finances onto a sustainable path.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#H00200","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I emphasise and agree with the remarks of the Minister, Deputy McGrath.<\/p><p>We are in a public health emergency and have emergency economic measures in place to help our society and, indeed, Europe deal with this pandemic.

As our public health conditions improve, we will need to begin the journey towards how we can put in place more appropriate budgetary policies that support our country in its recovery but move away from very high levels of support that are needed when many people are not in a position or not able to work. That is the approach we are taking in Ireland and it is paralleled by the approach being taken across the eurozone and the European Union.  For now the measures we have in place are needed.

A debate will begin during this year on the future of fiscal rules, but it is worth noting the fiscal rules have the general escape clause that was triggered which allowed for the measures that are in place in 2021.  The fiscal rules are in some way showing their worth in that, when this pandemic hit Ireland and Europe generally, national finances for the vast majority of countries within Europe were in a position of having a very small deficit, being in balance or having a surplus.  That, in turn, combined with the work of the European Central Bank, has been vital in allowing us to do what we are doing at the moment.<\/p><p>Therefore, fiscal rules play a really important role.  They will be needed.  A debate on this issue will be developing soon, but the rules allow the flexibility currently being used in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#J00500","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I welcome the Ministers.

I welcome some comments in both their scripts on developments and the evolution of processes that emerged from budgetary oversight in the previous term, including equality budgeting.

I look forward to working with him and all his colleagues on this committee.  I  reiterate my officials and my Department generally are available on an ongoing basis to help this committee in the work it is doing.  There have been some really good reforms in recent times and we can build on them.  In respect of many of the recommendations in the committee's interim report, we can develop them on a partnership basis and I look forward to doing that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy touched on a really important issue, namely, the extraordinary level of savings we have witnessed in recent times.  However, we should be careful and put it in context.  When we talk about these things in the aggregate, it is far removed from the reality very many families have faced since last March.  A point the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, regularly makes, and it is one that strikes home with me, is that of the order of 115,000 people currently on the pandemic unemployment payment have been on it since March 2020.  They will be rapidly approaching 12 months of being in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment continuously.  Many of those people are facing great hardship.  We need to be very conscious of that when we touch on what is an important issue in the round.<\/p> <p>  For other people, their incomes are largely unaffected and they have far fewer opportunities to spend money in the hospitality sector, on holidays and on all the things that people might normally like to do.  There is pent-up demand.  The amount of savings across the financial system offers us great hope that, once we can get beyond the necessary restrictions we are having to impose, many people will want to return to the things they always liked to do.  There will be much demand for goods and for services, but it comes down to sentiment and confidence.  For me, in any economy that is the critical intangible, and that is why we have always said that moving out of the health pandemic is inextricably linked to our economic recovery.  Until people have the confidence that we are not heading into deeper restrictions in the future, I do not think they will adjust their behaviours.  For us the key issue is to manage the health pandemic as well as we can to make sure we do not have to deal with a fourth wave and reintroduce further restrictions over the course of 2021.  That will then give people confidence, as they see a level of normality returning in line with the vaccination programme.<\/p><p>Much of that money can undoubtedly represent a stimulus for the Irish economy which is something we would welcome.  It is the job of Government to give people confidence and time to spend that money in the appropriate way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#K00600","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I will just make three points.  The Deputy is correct to call out the fairly significant increase in household savings.  I understand that the last set of figures that were produced by the Central Statistics Office indicated that the level of household savings in the economy for the quarter in which they measured it had increased by nearly one third.  Such a level of increase is a significant economic development.  I very much agree with what the Minister, Deputy McGrath, has said that many in our society are saving more.  Many others in our society are using their savings to live on and to support their businesses at a time of significant strain.  Those savings can mean very different things to different people.<\/p> <p>  As the Minister, Deputy McGrath, said, how that money is released into our economy is also tied into confidence regarding the sustainable opening of our economy in the future.  A key factor that will influence how savings are used is whether those who are saving more believe their income and their employment will it be stable over a longer period of time than it was in 2020.  <\/p> <p>  The consumption mix as those savings are used within our economy is of course critical in being able to understand what effect it will have on our economy.  For example, if that money is spent on exports other countries will benefit from the use of those savings.  That is not necessarily a bad thing because, of course, our exporters can benefit from the spending of savings in other economies and so the two things go hand in hand.  If that money was to be spent over time within our hospitality and services sector, within domestic tourism for example, the release of that level of savings into a part of our economy which is really hurting could have a particularly positive effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#L00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It relates to how Covid has redefined what essential workers mean to an economy and has opened our eyes to the importance of those working in retail right through to nursing and health, etc.  What is Government thinking on that?

It is not clear to me how it would be possible to design a tax that would be fair and would apply only to a particular scale of an online retailer.  Our taxes at the moment, particularly VAT, do not differentiate based on the scale of the retailer.  Using the book example, I would like to see how anybody could come up with a tax that would apply to Amazon but would not apply to Kenny's, Tatalia Books or Books Upstairs.  Irish companies, including Irish retailers, need to increase their online retailing as well as being able to reopen physical retail stores.<\/p><p>While I have heard many float the idea of being able to charge online retailers specifically, I have yet to see how that could be done without disadvantaging small and medium-sized retailers that are using an online presence to grow their business.

This is my first term as a member of this committee.  I am struggling somewhat to understand how we do this oversight.  The information is often produced in a language that suits the members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council but does not suit parliamentarians.  We need to produce more common-language reports so what we can have better understanding of what is going on.<\/p> <p>  I ask both Ministers to consider having engagement with our committee prior to the publication of the summer economic statement so that the committee is better placed to consider that because it is usually over the summer.  If we could have some engagement with the Ministers or their officials in May, it would help us in our work.<\/p> <p>  We talk about the well-being and the measurement of the broader living standards in Ireland.  However, the north and western section of the country has been downgraded in its status to a region in transition, which means that our output and our economic derivative have fallen.  How will that be tackled in budgets in coming years?  This does not come from me but from the EU, which has written to Ireland about this.  There is a significant difference and we should be positively discriminating towards the north and western region.  I ask the Ministers for their comments on that.<\/p> <p>  I often say that the biggest problem we have with budgets is looking at what the outcomes are.  We set the budget and we get reports, but we do not actually see how the budget works.  For instance, I have tried to elicit information from different Departments about how their capital projects are performing and if they are overrunning.  They are struggling to come up with the information.  It beggars belief that we are spending billions of euro on capital projects and we do not have readily to hand how each project performs, and if we have overruns why we have them and whether we should take corrective action.  There are many strategic issues we have not taken into account when we are spending billions of euro.  Nobody, apart from officials from the OPW, has come back to me how they are performing on their capital spend and whether their final accounts are exceeding their tenders.  It is a very simple process.  I ask the Ministers to comment on those matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#M00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I will take this to begin with.  I thank the Deputy for those observations and I agree with much of what he said.<\/p><p>What I will say, however, is that in recent months, in finding my feet in the Department, I have come to the realisation that there are a lot of very good reports written that do not get the attention they deserve.  I would point to the spending review papers, for example.  Since 2017 more than 100 spending reviews, including 25 last year, have been completed and published.  They look to the very point the Deputy raises.  We spend all this money in different areas and do we look back and see how it worked out?  Can we learn lessons?  Did we get the outcomes we were trying to achieve?  I urge this committee and the respective line committees to undertake work with the spending review papers because there is a wealth of information there.  Similarly, the public service performance report is published annually, normally in spring.  Again, there is a huge amount of information there which measures performance.  Ultimately, from my perspective as Minister with responsibility for public spending, it is important we measure outcomes because that should inform better decision-making going forward.  I would really welcome any feedback from the Deputy or the committee on the language, the terminology and the presentation format in the various reports we publish because we need to make them as understandable, meaningful and accessible as possible.<\/p><p> As for the north and the west, we are currently undertaking a review of the national development plan, NDP, as the Deputy will be aware.  That is out for public consultation until 19 February.  One of the objectives is to make sure that the aim of balanced regional development is progressed.  I encourage all stakeholders in the north and the west to engage in that process.  Over the course of the coming months we will finalise essentially the new NDP for the next decade, and there is a fantastic opportunity there to have the voice of the north and the west heard.  If Deputy Canney needs any information on any of the capital spending programmes and is not getting information he believes should be made available, I ask him to contact my Department and we will make sure that whatever information is at our disposal is made available to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#M00300","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Does anybody wish to comment on the summer economic statement and earlier engagement-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#N00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I will come in on that.

We need to challenge ourselves in the language we use to make it as clear as possible.<\/p> <p>  In truth, I think we can work with the committee to explain the principles behind the summer economic statement and its work before decisions are made and how it works, but I do not believe we can engage with the committee on the content of the summer economic statement before we in the Government agree it.  It is a decision by the Government on future budgetary priorities and has to be agreed within the Government before we can take that strategy to the Parliament and to our country.  Yes, there are definite opportunities for us to engage, to explain the process and to make it as clear as possible, but it is appropriate that we engage with the committee on the content of the statement only when it is agreed by the Government.  We have to put enough time into doing that inside the Government.

I see that as an opportunity for the regions to grow their population and create a balance throughout the country.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Ministers would give their thoughts as to how, from a budgetary point of view, the Government might positively discriminate towards such a scenario in which we spread the population from the major centres of population out into the regions to support them.

Many of the changes that have occurred in the past nine or ten months have been forced upon us, and we would not be having this engagement in this format were it not for Covid-19.  The truth is that many people have now realised they do not necessarily need to be at their normal place of work five days a week.  If that enables more people to spend time in their local communities, that offers a lot of opportunity and potential.  I think the truth is that we will be looking at a hybrid.  I think it will take us a while to figure out the appropriate balance.  We also need to have strong cities.  That is important for our country as well.<\/p> <p>  We are working under the umbrella of an overall national planning framework, as the Deputy will be aware, which is to be reviewed in the coming years.  That is the overarching strategy for Project Ireland 2040, with the NDP sitting alongside the national planning framework.  Certainly, from the point of view of the work ongoing in my Department, I anticipate that the issue of remote working and the opportunities it presents for towns and villages across regional Ireland will feature strongly as part of the review of the NDP.  The Deputy will have already seen a number of different Departments invest public money in different initiatives to facilitate people working in their local communities: in remote working hubs, co-working spaces and so on.  There are a whole range of programmes in that regard.  I think we will see much more of that but it will be a hybrid.  I do not think that into the future the current position that pertains during the crisis will be the permanent situation.

This came out particularly from discussions with some counterparts in Austria.  One of the issues that has come to the fore for us is the timing of the mid-year expenditure report and whether it is too late to allow for a proper budgetary oversight review of that document before the budget process is in place.  Linked to this is the treatment of the Finance Bill.  I think we can all agree that the Finance Bill properly belongs in the finance committee, but there was a suggestion that we could support some of that work by looking over the course of a year at things such as tax expenditures in order that we might formulate some kind of position on a hands-free budget.

We would struggle to do an SPU any earlier than we do at the moment because even when we do that update, we only have a single quarter of tax revenue available to analyse.  Our ability to form a projection regarding our economic performance for a year any earlier than April is limited.  If we were trying to produce forecasts for this committee in quarter 1 about the economic outlook for the year, we would only have a month of two worth of data available to us and we would run the risk of sharing forecasts with the committee that would be plain wrong and that could cause difficulty later in the year.<\/p><p> The option for a no policy change budget is, in effect, made available when the White Paper on expenditure and receipts is published but that does not happen, typically, until the Friday night before the budget.

A considerable amount of information is made available about the budgetary process.  The wealth of information contained in, for example, the tax strategy group papers gives a sizeable amount of advice and perspective to the committee.  If the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform manages to repeat the expenditure review process that has happened in other years, a huge volume of data regarding how we spend money within our country is available.

Some thought needs to be given as to the exact demarcation of the responsibilities and roles of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which would perhaps focus on the overall framework.  We should then ask whether we can enhance the work of the sectoral committees when it comes to considering the annual Estimates and Supplementary Estimates which are considered in committee and then come into the D&aacute;il for an actual vote.  That is the current legal framework.  A vote of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann gives us the authority for spending public money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#Q00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The basic point of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight is to ensure the sustainability of the public finances, to oversee the moneys that are allocated, what we get for those moneys as they are allocated in different areas, and whether they are achieving their ends.  I want to put to the Minister something obvious to which he has alluded, that is, all bets are off during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many of the normal signposts or markers for the budgetary cycle have been put off.  The summer economic statement was not produced.  An extra &euro;6 billion had to appear days before the budget.<\/p><p>All of this is happening because of a pandemic, a virus that does not give a hoot about the budgetary cycle, fiscal rules, summer economic statements, projections or anything else.  It seems to me that we are flying blind until we get this virus under control and that all of the chatter about sustainable public finances is borderline meaningless until we get it under control.  I would like the Minister to respond to that point.  In comparison with other countries that have the virus under control, where most of the time most people are living normal lives and they can plan, such as New Zealand, Australia, Vietnam, Taiwan and much of China, we are not doing as well.  We have no idea what is coming down the line.  This week, we had Ministers making statements about arbitrary dates for the reopening of sectors of the economy which seem to bear no relationship to the level of Covid infection.  At the current level of 800, it is four times higher than it was when the Government made the decision to reopen sectors of the economy prior to Christmas, with disastrous effect not only in terms of infection but economically, the full ramifications of which we still do not know.  I put it to both Ministers that if this happens again, maybe two or three times this year, our ability to manage the public finances and be sustainable in our approach to them will be somewhat difficult.  <\/p><p> The budget deficit was &euro;20 billion extra last year and is projected to be &euro;20 billion extra this year.  The debt increased by 10% last year.  I ask the Minister to confirm if that &euro;219 billion will rise by another 10% if his plans come to pass this year.  Would the Minister agree that in the interest of sustainable management of the public finances, we need to get control of the virus.  Will he acknowledge that trying to live alongside a virus that does not want to negotiate with us is not a very good idea and that we need to get control of it by adopting a different strategy?  I am serious in saying that because this has a bearing on everything we and the Minister have to deal with for the next year.  I ask the Minister to respond to that point as well.  It seems to me the current plan is not working and it is costly us a great deal at every level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#Q00800","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I am not sure which Minister would like to take those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#R00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I will begin by offering some thoughts on the debt issues raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Most of the figures he referenced in regard to the debt forecast are correct.  By the end of last year, our debt stood at &euro;219 billion, which is an increase of approximately &euro;15 billion versus what we estimated it would be.  Taking the two year period of last year and this year together, there will be an increase in our national debt of &euro;33 billion.  We are seeing a very considerable increase in our national debt, albeit an increase in the stock of our debt that is in line with what we are seeing happening in other countries.  This is additional debt which we have been able to refinance at a next to zero interest rates due to the manner in which we have managed our public finances and the work of the European Central Bank.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked if we need to take a different approach to Covid.  We have to be open to all debates and points of view in regard to what we are doing and not dismiss each other's point of view out of hand, which Deputy Boyd Barrett rarely does on important issues and I do not propose to do so now.  I will offer three points that matter to me in relation to the points the Deputy made.<\/p><p>First, the Deputy spoke about the need to reduce radically the presence of the disease within our country and its transmission.  That is what we are trying to do.  As a country, we have taken the most extraordinary measures over the past year to do that.  Second, the Deputy seemed to suggest we should go beyond that and have a target of zero Covid.  As I understand it, zero Covid is defined by some people as zero community transmission for 14 days consecutively.  When community transmission was at its lowest level, we did not get to that point.  Third, if we were to set that objective, it would require public health measures that would stretch beyond what we are proposing to do in regard to travel and borders within our country because the origin of much of this disease is community transmission as opposed to travel.  It would require very significant and sustained measures in terms of the contact we have with each other, our society and how we organise movement within our country that would stretch beyond how we manage travel.<\/p><p> I would like to make a further point genuinely to the Deputy who I know is raising this point genuinely.  I have heard him speak eloquently about the personal and social consequences of demanding public health measures.  It is at least implicit, if not likely, in the approach he is suggesting that those public health measures would be of greater severity for longer periods.  That is a factor in evaluating the case the Deputy puts forward.  As demanding as the management of mobility in and out of the country is - the Deputy will know that travel accounts for less than 0.5% of recorded Covid cases over the past number of weeks - far more would be required to deliver zero Covid.  If that is what the Deputy is looking for, even stronger measures will be required in regard to travel.  It is important to outline what those measures are and what effects they would have on our society and the well-being of many people about whom I know the Deputy is concerned, which is why he raised this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#R00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett's time has expired.

We know that the Government is planning to ratify CETA.  As the Ministers are aware, it provides for the investor court system, which is a legal mechanism that will allow large corporations to sue the State for massive sums of money.  This has the potential to have a significant impact on the budgetary position both directly in terms of a reduction in available spend because of legal costs incurred and indirectly in terms of tax foregone because the presence of the investor court system may act as a deterrent to Governments using the tax system to modify corporate behaviour.

I would point to the overall context within which our economy operates and our experience over the last ten or 11 months of living with Covid-19.  The reality is that the role of FDI in Ireland and our position as an open, trading economy has, in many ways, helped us to absorb some of the enormous shock of Covid-19.  This is clear from the number of jobs that have been sustained, the corporation tax paid and the income tax receipts underpinned by employment in the FDI sector.  Ireland's place in the world is as a small, open trading economy with a very strong enterprise sector.  That is why the Cabinet today approved an additional &euro;90 million for Enterprise Ireland for the sustaining enterprises fund.  Many of the businesses that will avail of funding from a scheme like the sustaining enterprises fund will be seeking export opportunities to countries like Canada.  In that regard, from the perspective of the Irish Government, the opportunities of CETA far outweigh the risks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#T00100","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I am absolutely astonished, given our 20-year liability, that a risk assessment has not been done.

Do the Ministers have any thoughts on how they see well-being indicators or budgets being implemented so that they are effective and not just a reporting mechanism?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#V00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I would expect that when we have a more rounded set of indicators regarding how our budgets perform, progress on them will take time and that progress will be year by year and step by step.

Over time, we will see change and if we were to look for some change more quickly, it could be to our benefit to pick a very specific area and make more bigger choices about that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#V00500","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":656,"content":"<p>Can I add a few points because I know the Chairman has a keen interest in this area?  I have always made the point that narrow or traditional economic indicators only tell us so much.  The memorandum that was brought to Cabinet today by the Taoiseach is really important in that respect.  It sets out the approach that will be taken in developing a well-being framework building on the extensive work undertaken in the area, including the recent report prepared by the Department of Finance and the OECD framework for measuring well-being and progress.<\/p><p>A lot of work has been done internationally in this space.  In terms of where we go from here, step one will involve defining what exactly we mean by the concept and taking the 11 dimensions of the OECD framework as a starting point.  Designing the dashboard will involve deciding which indicators to include under each of the agreed domains.  The CSO has indicated a willingness to assist in hosting and updating the dashboard on an ongoing basis.  The work will lead to the production of an initial output by the summer of 2021.  It is proposed that the National Economic and Social Council will provide a vehicle for consultation with stakeholders.

We know a number of schemes are in operation.  Some of them have been tapped out.  Ulster Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland seem to have used all of the resources related to providing the recovery funds.  I am interested to see if there is a view on extending that or increasing the amount of allocation, given that the credit guarantee scheme does not have the same type of appeal to businesses and is not as sought after as the other scheme.<\/p> <p>  In the context of that recommendation, the Minister will be well aware that there is ongoing discussion and increased activity regarding the future of Ulster Bank in this State.  This is potentially a huge blow to consumers, the financial sector here and small and medium enterprises, in respect of which a quarter of lending is done through this institution.  The Governor of the Central Bank has said that a decision to withdraw is likely to push up interest rates, which would be a problem in a jurisdiction which already has the highest interest rates in Europe at double the European average.  At my request, the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has asked that the Minister for Finance formally engage in this process.  I expect that there will be an announcement, probably next week at the latest, in respect of this issue.  There are a number of State-owned banks or banks where the State has a majority shareholding.  The worst option in all of this would be that the loan book would be sold to a vulture fund.  The best option is for Ulster Bank to confirm that it is here to stay and that its footprint, staff and presence in the Irish market is here.  Some of this is outside our control but I would seriously encourage and ask the Minister to explain to the committee whether he has stepped up his engagement not just as Minister for Finance but as the person who holds the shares in AIB and Permanent TSB on behalf of the Irish people in respect of the very clear discussions that are ongoing and that have in my view have moved beyond the exploratory to actionable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#W00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I will deal with each of the Deputy's points in turn.

I am looking at the schemes and their future because how we provide liquidity and credit at this time of strain for so many smaller companies in particular is an important priority of mine.<\/p> <p>  I wish to confirm that there has been no public statement about the withdrawal of Ulster Bank from the Irish banking sector.<\/p><p>The statements that are made about Ulster Bank continue to state that it is engaged in a review of its presence here and of its future.

The scheme is failing on the basis that it is being run centrally by the SEAI.  I suggest that the rolling-out of the scheme by local authorities be looked at.  They could do it in conjunction with the disabled access grants and the housing aid for older people.  The local authorities have the network to carry out the inspections and to allow the work to go ahead.  It seems the SEAI has created another layer of approvals and whatever else and is excluding many local contractors from doing the work.  We are talking about value for money, but I think we would get a hell of a lot more value out of it if we put the additional resources into the local authorities and asked them to run the scheme.  We would deliver quickly to where it is needed to help people in fuel poverty.  It is something that might be considered in the context of how the whole scheme has performed since its introduction.  It has failed many people and there are many people waiting from 18 months to two years to have an inspection, which is totally unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#X00700","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":667,"content":"<p>May I respond briefly or does the Chairman wish to move on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#Y00100","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":668,"content":"<p>If the Minister can respond in about 20 seconds he should go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#Y00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Very briefly, I think the significant delay has been in getting the assessors out to homes.

T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm aon eolas at&aacute; agam a scaipeadh.<\/p> <p>  This is my first appearance before the committee since the trade and co-operation agreement was reached between the EU and the UK.  I will first speak briefly speak on that before I talk about the issue of the protocol, which is obviously of huge concern not only to the committee but to Government as well.<\/p> <p>  The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is the framework for the relationship between the European Union and the UK into the future and complements the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Northern Ireland.  Like any international agreement, it is the product of compromise and give and take.  Neither the European Union nor the UK has got everything it would have wanted but there is much to recommend it.<\/p> <p>  The agreement provides for zero tariff, zero quota trade in goods of EU or UK origin.  This is a major priority of the Government and is vital for sectors such as our agrifood industry in particular which would have been devastated by tariffs.  It provides robust safeguards to ensure there is a level playing field between EU and UK businesses to protect Irish businesses and our future prosperity.  It provides for close co-operation with the UK in the energy and transportation sectors, which are essential to making our economy work.  It allows for close co-operation between the police and judicial authorities in Ireland, which is essential to effective policing on the island of Ireland.  I pay tribute to Mr. Michel Barnier and his team in the European Commission for their tireless work in securing the agreement.<\/p> <p>  Separately, and as the committee will be well aware, the Northern Ireland protocol came into effect on 1 January 2021.  It plays a vital role in protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including a key priority of the Government to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, as well as protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  It ensures that Northern Ireland traders continue to have access not only to Great Britain but also to the EU Single Market of 450 million consumers, access that is unique and vital for all-island supply chains.<\/p> <p>  For Northern Ireland, and indeed for businesses across the island, adapting to the changes is undoubtedly a challenge.  It is important, however, not to lose sight of the overall purpose of the protocol, what it is for and the role it plays in providing as much certainty as possible under the difficult circumstances caused by the UK leaving the European Union.  After four years of painstaking negotiations, it is clear there are no easy alternatives to the protocol.  It is clear that the European Union and the United Kingdom will have to continue to work closely together, particularly in the first weeks of the protocol&rsquo;s operation, as traders adjust to the new rules in place.  Every effort will need be made within the framework of the protocol to iron out any challenges that emerge.<\/p><p> It is very unfortunate that the protocol got caught up in the issue of the European Union vaccine procurement last week.  It is entirely regrettable that the Commission did not consult us in advance of the ostensible decision it contemplated with regard to invoking the protocol's safeguard clause.  The decision was, rightfully, rescinded shortly after the Taoiseach spoke to President von der Leyen on the Friday evening in question.<\/p><p> The European Union has a legitimate aim, on behalf of all of us, of protecting vaccine supplies.  Ireland will continue to work closely with the Commission on this issue.  However, that is entirely separate, and should be entirely separate, from the operation of the protocol.  We will be working with the Commission to review this matter and to continue to ensure that the protocol and its political context are properly understood.  All sides must now redouble their efforts to make the protocol work for Northern Ireland and all its people and businesses.  It is important to take a calm and measured approach based on trust and pragmatism to any issues that arise in regard to its implementation.  <\/p><p> I welcome that a call took place last Wednesday between the Vice-President of the European Commission, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Mr. &Scaron;efovi's opposite number in the UK, and the First Minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, of Northern Ireland.  In a joint afterwards, the EU and the UK described the discussion as a constructive one and stated they had agreed to work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues.  This approach is best managed through the established mechanisms and communication channels to address practical issues around the operation of the protocol, including the specialised committee on the protocol and the withdrawal agreement joint committee.  Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Chancellor Gove agreed to meet again this week in London and to keep in close contact as this work progresses.  EU-UK channels must remain the primary recourse for addressing any issues that arise in the interests of stability, clarity and sustainability.  Unilateral approaches to working through issues are unhelpful, no matter what the source.<\/p><p> The committee will also be aware that certain staff working at border control posts at the ports of Larne and Belfast were advised not to present for work on 2 February owing to concerns arising from intimidation and threats.  I condemn the intimidation of port staff and the menacing threats that have appeared as graffiti in Northern Ireland.  I welcome that the PSNI is actively engaged and taking appropriate measures.  I also welcome the confirmation that Larne council staff have returned to their duties.  All staff should be able to carry out their work safely and political leaders should make every effort to reduce tensions.<\/p><p> The Government is closely engaged with its counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive.  We are also listening carefully to business representatives on this and other issues.  We have been consistent in our position that we want the protocol to work as smoothly as possible for the people of Northern Ireland and people and businesses across the island of Ireland.  Trade volumes between Ireland and Great Britain remain low but they are gradually increasing.  We had 61 inbound movements on 1 and 2 January.  The figure reached its peak so far this year with 1,344 movements on 3 and 4 February.  <\/p><p> The Government understands that new controls have created challenges for many traders.  We will continue to help traders and hauliers to make the adjustment.  The changes are not temporary.  It is important that we all work together to adapt to the new trading environment.  A range of advisory, upskilling and support services remains available.  Over &euro;9.4 million has been allocated under our ready-for-customs grant that provides funding of up to &euro;9,000 per eligible employee.  It is also very important that, in line with its border operating model, the UK will introduce new checks and controls on imports from the EU in April and June.  We are working with our exporters to help them prepare for these changes.<\/p><p> No new controls apply on direct continental routes, which are proving very popular.  Freight volumes on these services are up 100% on last year.  We now have daily direct services to France, which was a key ask of the haulage sector.  In January there were 62 roll-on roll-off freight sailings in a typical week, which is up from about 26 such sailings last year.  We have 36 sailings to northern France per week as well as sailings to Spain, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands.<\/p><p> Brexit means change in the short, medium and long term.  Ireland will need to respond to the challenges and opportunities that this brings by playing a leadership role in shaping and developing our common European Union.  The relationship between Ireland and Britain is always close and special but our home is at the heart of the European Union.  I am very happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#C00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":690,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat Aire St&aacute;it Byrne.

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it as a chuid oibre go dt&iacute; seo.  I have a couple of questions for the Minister of State and a couple of thoughts.  He is right to acknowledge the huge work that has gone into getting us to the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  It was a massive achievement in very difficult circumstances.  The support we as a country have got from the European Commission since the Brexit referendum in 2016 has been immense; it has effectively been hand in glove.  The Minister of State is also right to separate the protocol from the triggering of Article 16.  I will discuss the protocol later.  The support and co-operation from the Commission makes what happened with the triggering of Article 16 on 29 January even more unbelievable and harder to get our heads around.  The triggering apparently happened without our knowledge.  Apparently it happened without the knowledge of the Irish nominee to the Commission.  Given that the European Commission has shown a massive understanding of the sensitives of relationships and of the protocol and the background to it, has the Minister of State learned anything in the intervening period about why it was triggered, who ordered its triggering and why the European Commission saw fit to trigger it without consulting the Irish Government in advance?<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to the meeting with the Commission and the British Government last week.  The meetings were positive.  I understand that there is to be a meeting today between European Commission officials and Irish representatives and that proposals to manage this issue going forward are to be tabled.  When it comes to our neutrality we have a triple lock.  We need some kind of a lock mechanism such that in future Article 16 can never be triggered without the agreement of the Government or without consultation with it.  The Minister of State is closer to this than we are and he has seen at close hand the damage done by the triggering, including the damage done to trust.  It is being reported on RT&Eacute; today that we will get some sort of vague comfort blanket assurances that this will not happen again, that there will be consultation with the Government around legislation and that if there is a problem, it will be put through Commissioner McGuinness's <i>cabinet.  <\/i>Instead, we should have something substantial, an actual formal process that would involve the Government in a formal way rather an <i>ad hoc<\/i>one.  I genuinely think the damage done by this triggering has been so immense that we now need a process to ensure it does not happen again.<\/p><p>On the protocol, I absolutely condemn the violence and threats being issued to people doing their jobs in the last few weeks.  It brings us back to a much darker time.  On the general matter of EU-Britain trade, we are currently running at volumes that are around 50% of what they were this time last year.  Revenue has declared 1.8 million custom declarations in January alone, which is more than the total for 2020.  Who in the Government is co-ordinating the response so that we will be ready when trade returns to full volumes?  Can the Minister of State say we will not have any major difficulties or delays with goods going to Britain and coming in from there when trade is hopefully restored to full volumes?  The lower volumes at the moment are presumably due to Brexit stockpiling before December and to the pandemic.  Who in the Government is going to co-ordinate this to ensure there is no disruption to supplies either between here and Britain or the reverse in terms of the food industry, etc.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#E00200","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Deputy Calleary has asked some very important and fundamental questions on various aspects of this.<\/p><p> On the question of Article 16 being triggered, while we might not be as shocked now two weeks on, the reaction Deputy Calleary shows today is similar to the Government's reaction on the day, namely, one of complete shock and surprise.  It is absolutely the case that we had no knowledge of what was being planned.  We had spent the previous weeks being asked about Article 16 from another perspective, and quite rightly pointed out that this was a pretty standard safeguarding clause in trade agreements and was not designed to eliminate the protocol or be used except in the most extreme circumstances.  It came as a complete surprise to us when we saw that it was invoked.  In my case, I saw it on social media at 4.30 p.m on the Friday while I was out for a walk.  I was a bit shocked.  It went against everything we had been considering and planning for over the previous weeks when this was an issue.  It has caused continued consternation and has been deeply unhelpful.<\/p><p> On the how and the why the article was triggered, these are questions for the European Commission.  Clearly, it should not have happened.  There was a commercial dispute with AstraZeneca.  We stand in solidarity with the Commission on that and on the vaccine purchasing arrangement.  Article 16 should not have come into that at all, however.  As soon as the Taoiseach was informed of this by his chief Sherpa he was immediately on the phone to Ursula von der Leyen.  There was ongoing engagement in the early evening, but the Taoiseach will have to speak for himself on that because he was the one making the calls.  There was subsequent engagement with Boris Johnson.  We continue to engage with the Commission and other member states, at my level, at the Minister for Foreign Affairs' level, at the Taoiseach's level and at ambassadorial level.<\/p><p> The point of concern for the moment, and which Deputy Calleary has hit upon, relates to how will we ensure this does not happen again.  The Government wants an early warning system to be put in place.  Whatever meeting is reported today, there are also ongoing meetings.  I will have a range of meetings with my counterparts too.  There is a view, which is a risky view, that yes the Commission made a mistake and has acknowledged the mistake and that everything has been resolved.  Clearly, that is not the case because the consequences of this matter are continuing.  We must apprise our colleagues around the EU of the lasting consequences of what has happened around the protocol, and that when one action is taken it inevitably provokes an opposite reaction.  Members may have seen press reports where our ambassador gave a full-blooded account of the consequences of invoking Article 16 to other EU ambassadors at a meeting of the Committee of the Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States to the European Union, COREPER, last week.  I have also done this with my colleagues, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the Taoiseach in his interactions.<\/p><p> This has not been good and we want an early warning system.  I am not sure about a formal process, as Deputy Calleary referred to, but engagement is ongoing to make sure that it does work.  Before my time in the role, a great deal of work was done in recent years to keep the Commission and the other member states apprised of the actual situation on the ground in Northern Ireland.  We cannot assume prior knowledge.  We were lucky with Michel Barnier in that he had a long history in the context of the various roles he has held.  He was a Minister for agriculture and for foreign affairs and then he was in the Commission when the PEACE programme funding was first put in place.  Mr. Barnier had a deep knowledge of the situation in Northern Ireland but this may not be the case for everybody else, which would be natural.  That is one of the first points.  We must make sure that people know what the situation is like on the ground, that it is not simply something that can be put in writing between the EU and Britain and that there are many complicated aspects to it.  Whatever meeting is reported today, I will not come here and describe this as a key, crunch meeting.  There is ongoing engagement under way and we may not have a resolution on it today.  It is safe to say that people are fully aware of the significance of what has transpired.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the Deputy's point on trade volumes and the concern about co-ordination.<\/p><p>A group comprised of representatives of all Departments meets on a daily basis to examine all of the issues around trading goods, particularly between Britain and Ireland.  We are also, as I am sure are members, engaging with hauliers and logistics companies and their concerns are being fed into the system.  I compliment officials and Government agencies on taking on board some of the concerns.  People at the coalface and on the front line of importing and logistics need to get things done.  Much of this work is time sensitive.  They have brought many issues to our attention and I encourage them to continue to do that.  The numbers show that some trade has moved from the land bridge to the direct routes.  We can see that by volume.  It is not possible to do an exact comparison but some trade has moved.  Numbers on the Ireland-Britain route are down but they have increased dramatically on the direct continental routes.  <\/p><p> I mentioned in my earlier contribution that Britain has not yet introduced checks to the extent that we have.  Businesses will have to start preparing for this and Government will be trying to help them prepare for it through the various schemes.  Businesses need to be aware that things are going to get more difficult.  It is important to remember that checks are taking place for a reason.  This is our contribution to the European Union Single Market and customs union.  The Single Market was created to avoid red tape and border checks.  Britain decided to leave the Single Market and that has inevitably resulted in checks raising their heads again.  They are not temporary.  This is an obligation we have to take seriously because our economic prosperity and the protection of our public health and safety depend on it.  The Single Market is essential to our economy.  That is an important message.  We do not want these checks but they are essential to our membership of the Single Market.  Revenue has introduced some easements to help the situation and that may continue but these are not exemptions or free passes.  We have to implement the new arrangements in the most practical way possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#E00400","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

There is no point in underscoring our collective reaction to the decision to trigger Article 16.  It went beyond unfortunate and regrettable, but I suppose the Minister of State has to use those words.  I am interested in getting behind the process.  The Minister of State said that is a matter for the Commission, but it is a matter for all of us to know how the Commission operates.  The President of the Commission said this was a decision of the college of Commissioners but we heard from our Irish nominated Commissioner that she was not alerted to it.  Does the Minister of State know how this came about?  It is akin to a Government decision being made without members of the Government being aware of it.  I am sure that happened in the past, but it should not happen.  There is a process.  One would imagine that on something as sensitive as this there is a clear process.  It undermines my confidence in the decision-making processes for the future.  I would like to know how this happened, as I am sure would the Government.  Where was the mistake or is there a structural difficulty in regard to all of this?  In terms of this not happening again, the utterances of the Commission immediately afterwards did not indicate that would be the case.<\/p><p>It basically reserved the right, maybe, to exercise Article 16 again.  As I said, I listened last week at the meeting to the EU ambassador to the UK, and he was less than clear in saying this was an action we should not have taken.  That is the first question.  I want to talk about ports on my second question shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#G00500","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":702,"content":"<p>I have no problem answering that.  The President of the Commission herself has taken full political responsibility for this, and I think that is where accountability lies.  Again, I am not running away from the question because I am as concerned as the Deputy.  However, I cannot answer for the Commission.  It is accountable to the European Parliament and the parliamentarians plan to question Commissioners, and maybe the President as well, and she has already addressed people.  I am not here to defend the Commission in any way but I cannot be accountable for it either.<\/p> <p>  All of us, when we see a decision of the European Commission, are entitled to assume that the Commission has decided to do this in accordance with its powers and the way it does business, and we are entitled to assume that the College of Commissioners, in general, is part of the decision-making.  As to the exact mechanics in this regard, the Commission will have to explain that, and we are in ongoing engagement with the Commission on that.  Obviously, with trade policy, the Commission has the competence and it makes decisions like this, I am told, on an extremely regular basis in terms of safeguarding measures.  Unfortunately, it appears to be the case that while the trade experts crossed every t and dotted every i, and made sure there was no possible theoretical escape route, somebody with a political sensibility in terms of the actual reality of the ground, and the lived lives of people in Northern Ireland, was not in the room making that decision.  That is fundamentally the problem here.<\/p> <p>  It is a decision that I certainly hope will not happen again but Deputy Howlin is right that we need to ensure it does not happen again.  As I said, we have ongoing engagement and that will need to continue.  I strongly encourage members of the committee in their engagement with the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, and with their counterparts not just to say that a mistake was made here but to state that it cannot happen again, because to do otherwise would be to state we are okay when, in fact, we are not okay because we see the ongoing consequences in Northern Ireland.  All of us here on this island, as Europeans, need to let our European colleagues know, in whatever capacity, what the consequences are to ensure more people know what the actual situation is on the ground in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, she has taken political responsibility and will have to be accountable to the European Parliament.  I know the Vice-President of the Commission has been invited before the committee and I sincerely hope he attends and answers its questions.  That would be very useful both in terms of accountability and in making sure that all of our Commissioners, who are our Commissioners, are fully apprised of the situation in Northern Ireland, and that would be a tremendous opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#H00200","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I will leave further exploration of this until we are talking to the Commission.<\/p> <p>  On the operation of the protocol in this jurisdiction, the Revenue has already admitted the IT systems it has in place have failed on numerous occasions.  It says that 80% of vehicular traffic coming in is green-lighted, which means that one in five vehicles is stopped.  That is a very significant volume.  I acknowledge not all of that is within our remit, inasmuch as the preparedness of many of the British authorities and companies was not what it should have been.  However, we have a real problem in regard to that level of stoppages in a situation, first, where there are already derogations from some elements of the protocol for a period and, second, where the volumes were down to 50% in January.  There will be a chaotic build-up if 20% of vehicles are being stopped when it is at full volume.  While it is not entirely within our remit, we need to have flexibility within Revenue if its systems are not working.  I want to know what the Government wants to do about that.<\/p> <p>  Second, I listened to Revenue yesterday stating that, because Britain is now a third country, it is applying the standard checks for third countries, with something like 5% or 6% of vehicles being checked at random.

That is just not possible.  The Single Market was built to avoid this type of bureaucracy, paperwork and checks.  Britain has left the Single Market and some checks are inevitably necessary.  There will always be some checks.  There were checks previously but they were not for customs.

The stops involve paperwork.  Much of that paperwork can be rectified.  That will take some getting used to, with companies getting used to the new procedures and finding it difficult to get customs experts, which is why there is Government support.

Moving on from Article 16, my next concern is twofold.  Does the Minister of State think that the British Government is now in danger of pushing this too far?  We see extra demands and a consistent underlining that it is now prepared to trigger Article 16.  If one looks at the albeit typical British newspapers, they are demanding a renegotiation less than six weeks since the trade deal was agreed.  A British minister on national radio this morning accused the EU of being unreasonable and changing its position.  I am very worried that less than six weeks in, people are damaging the house of cards.<\/p><p> My final question comes back to the protocol which the Minister of State referred to briefly in his intervention.

Are there any opportunities that may be pushed up to Michael Gove and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi when they have meetings?

That is a point I have been making.  Many people said yes, put up their hands and said that a mistake was made and that it has been acknowledged.  Some people said we should move on but obviously we cannot move on when we see the particular situation on the ground in Northern Ireland.  As I said already, it is up to all of us, in whatever interactions we have with our interlocutors in Europe, to make sure the situation and the damage done is if fully appreciated by them.  The solution then is to have this early warning system which will presumably ensure that this could not possible happen again.  Nobody will want this to happen again but the important point it is to make sure that is does not happen again.  With colleagues, I am certainly making it very clear that damage was done and that is continues to be lasting.<\/p> <p>  There is on going contact between Britain and the European Union, in particular between the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and Michael Gove.  In Northern Ireland, there has been much engagement.  By the way, there has been a North-South Ministerial Council since this happened.  There is ongoing political engagement as well in relation to Northern Ireland.  We were getting many calls about Article 16 before all of this happened and, indeed, its invocation was suggested at very high levels in Britain in January.<\/p> <p>  The important point to remember is that the protocol is a legal agreement between Britain and the European Union and its function is basically to make the best possible job out of a bad job, which is Brexit, for the island of Ireland.  Even the attempted invocations of Article 16 a couple of weeks ago, did not eliminate the protocol.  It did damage but it provided for a very limited arrangement there.  That is what Article 16 is there for.  Anyone who is going to invoke Article 16 needs to realise doing so will not eliminate the protocol.  The protocol is there to avoid the hard border on the island, to make sure people and good can move freely, and that Northern Ireland remains part of the Single Market of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  There is very close contact with the British Government at all levels.  Late last year Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Michael Gove, in terms of their plan to implement the protocol, showed their good working relationship and that they are practical people who will get the job done.

It is a bilateral agreement between Britain and the European Union.  However, we are fully part of the implementation committees, the joint committee and the special committee, on the protocol.  Added to that, there is ongoing, significant contact, not only between Ireland and the European Union at all levels, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, the Taoiseach and the President and vice-President of the Commission, but also between Dublin and London.  That is absolutely ongoing.  We have a formal role, as every member state does, and member states will often take our particular line on Northern Ireland issues.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Senator's second question, I have said publicly that whoever did this did not fully appreciate the political situation in Northern Ireland.  There are no two ways about that because they would not have done it had they known.  There are discussions on an ongoing basis to make sure that, not only do we put the hands up and say it cannot happen again, but that it actually cannot happen again.  The Government is involved at all levels in discussions in relation to that.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding President Ursula von der Leyen's statement that she accepts full responsibility, that is an important political declaration.  On whether we insist on knowing who exactly made the decision, I do not know the answer to that.  There certainly have been suggestions made, many of them publicly.  Ultimately, in the first instance the Commission is accountable to the Parliament and I have absolutely no doubt that the Parliament will be demanding, and is entitled to demand, an explication of what exactly happened.  Many of our parliamentarians are already making those particular points.<\/p> <p>  We have ongoing engagements at the General Affairs Council.  We will have discussions and these are questions and points I will be more than happy to put to the General Affairs Council, which will be in two weeks' time.  Our ambassador has been extremely forthright at meetings with his counterparts as have the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney.

What the committee is doing and intends to do at subsequent meetings is to find out what actually happened.  We need to learn the lessons from it.  I know the Minister said that we cannot really move on from it, but we will eventually.  We need to learn the lessons and to move on from it eventually perhaps by, as other speakers said, putting the early warning system in place.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions and a few thoughts.  Problems were always going to arise with the implementation of the protocol for business and consumers in Northern Ireland.  It is fair to say that many businesses in Northern Ireland were simply not prepared for Brexit.<\/p><p>Trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland has been disrupted.  Supermarkets in Northern Ireland have experienced shortages of time-sensitive goods, such as fresh produce and chilled meats.  Many sorts of horror stories are emerging concerning people not being able to bring their pets into Northern Ireland from Great Britain because of issues with vaccination etc.  It is clear in that context that practical and sensible modifications are needed regarding the operation of the protocol in Northern Ireland.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that such practical and sensible modifications can be made to sort out these types of problems?  Do such possibilities exist?  For example, is an extension of the grace period a possibility?<\/p><p> My second question concerns the Northern Ireland peace process, which we are all worried about.  The Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and unionists in general have always seen the creation of a border in the Irish Sea as some sort of step in the direction of Irish unity and the holding of a border poll.  Therefore, the sensitivities involved with this issue are clear to everybody.  The DUP has not had a good Brexit.  The party supported Brexit in the first place and then opposed the deal reached by the former British Prime Minister, Theresa May.  The members of that party are of course going to exaggerate the consequences of the Northern Ireland protocol for political purposes.  We saw the DUP put forward a five-point plan to have the protocol abolished, which of course is not going to happen.  The party is, however, calling on the UK Government to invoke Article 16 and to have the protocol abolished, if possible.<\/p><p> In respect of the threat to relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, I was interested to hear the Minister of State say that there has been a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  The DUP had threatened to cease co-operation with such bodies, and that would be a serious issue.  We all agree with the call to calm things down because of the sensitivities involved in this situation.  I take it that the Minister of State agrees that North-South relations are extremely important, but will he reassure me that things are being done to repair the damage done?  We are obviously not responsible for that damage, but we are seriously concerned about this deterioration in relations.  We must improve those relations and take positive steps to bring that improvement about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#M00400","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":718,"content":"<p>The North-South meeting which took place was one of the formal structures on waterways.  The North-South bodies are limited anyway, and we would like for there to be more of them.  It is important, however, to note that meeting did happen.  I share fully the Deputy's concerns regarding North-South relations.  It is important to keep everything on an even keel in that respect.  This situation has clearly interrupted that endeavour.  There are many other threats to the peace process in Northern Ireland, but what has happened has shown us that if something in this vein occurs, then it can cause immediate harm.<\/p> <p>  When I said we cannot move on from this, my point was that at this particular moment we cannot accept people just putting their hands up and saying everything is now fine.  Clearly, it is not fine right now.  Deputy Haughey is correct, though, that we need to move forward.  People calling for the protocol to be abolished must realise that is not going to happen, and that is a fact.  The protocol is a legal agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union and it is not going to be abolished.  Ultimately, these problems have been caused by Brexit.  The protocol exists and is designed to alleviate the problems of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  Trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is about where it was previously.  It has not gone down.  Some of that is possibly a reflection of trade coming here, and there has definitely been some movement from Dublin to Belfast.  It may seem, therefore, that trade is down.<\/p><p>In actual numbers, however, it is not; it is at a similar level.  It is important to remember that there is a huge amount of trade getting through between Northern Ireland and Britain, as well a lot of people doing works.  Even after the threats last week, which were repulsive and are to be condemned, a great number of checks still were happening because much of this is done on a documentary basis.  There are issues, however, that are causing annoyance.  They can be dealt with within the structures of the protocol that might help the situation but that does not mean that the protocol is going to be changed.  The UK has set out some things it is asking for some of which reflect demands in the North, including businesses there.  Modest extensions of the existing grace periods would definitely help reassure the business sector and moderate voices and Northern society broadly that they are being listened to and that we genuinely want to make the protocol work for every section of the community in Northern Ireland.  That is important to all of us.  <\/p><p> It is not about winners and losers but about trying to make the best possible situation out of what is a very difficult scenario in Northern Ireland at present.  I am convinced that if we can get over the current difficulties, recognising that a great deal of trade is happening and that many goods can come in, we can solve some of the issues the Deputy raised.  I cannot give any commitments on them but I know some can be resolved.  Some cause particular anxiety, such as the issue concerning pets.  The Alliance Party proposed a veterinary agreement between the EU and Britain and that certainly is in the range of possibilities in the medium term.  It is not something that will provide immediate answers but it is something with which we would have no difficulties whatsoever.  We want to make this work and work for everybody.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#N00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I am in agreement with much of what others have said.  The big question in relation to the European Commission is how exactly it happened and in ensuring that it does not happen again.  Whatever meetings in which the Government will be involved will be absolutely necessary.  It is a case of finding out exactly what happened from the perspective of ensuring that there is no room for a move such as this again.  We have all seen its outworkings.  I agree with much of what others said that this is Brexit coming home to roost, unfortunately.  From a unionist perspective, supporting it was absolute madness.  It is the most destabilising thing they could have done from the point of view of the Union.  So be it, that is done.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Government's engagement on the need to retain the protocol.  While we all accept that modifications were necessary and will be carried out, whether it relates to grace periods etc., we need that to be sorted, North and South.  I welcome that the Government is taking on board issues brought to it by people involved in supply chain logistics and so on, as the Minister of State noted.  <\/p> <p>  What I think has happened is that unionist politicians have looked at their polling numbers,know they are under pressure and are using tried and tested methods from the 1880s nearly or from the 1980s.  If we accept that the Irish protocol and the withdrawal agreement are international agreements that are not going anywhere, it could be another case of leading people up the hill, which is not helpful.  Nor is it helpful when one hears about Michael Gove's ultimatum letter or hears Arlene Foster speak of how she has Boris Johnson on side from the point of view of introducing legislation that would negate elements of the Irish protocol, as well as the fact that he might simply invoke Article 16.  I have no doubt that the Government has engaged with the British Government on this issue.  I would like to think the engagement is robust.  I seek an update from the Minister of State on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#O00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":721,"content":"<p>There is a hugely changed political situation in Northern Ireland, and we see from opinion polling that it is changing all the time.  There are many nuances of opinion; it is not one side versus the other.  I think we can all agree now that there are significant nuances and a broad range of the public there who want to live decent lives, have prosperity and be able to move around the place.  The Irish Government will try to ensure the best opportunity for the North.  When these issues are solved, and work is ongoing to solve them, Northern Ireland will have a huge opportunity to be part of the Single Market of the European Union.  If one's perspective is on the unionist side, Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of Britain as well.  There are therefore huge opportunities there for the economy, and it is up to all of us, but particularly leaders in Northern Ireland, to help drive that forward and to make sure those opportunities are seized.<\/p> <p>  I cannot get into what questions officials or others have asked many times.  The Commission as a body signed off on the measure which included Article 16 and political responsibility rests with the Commission.  Ursula von der Leyen has accepted that and there will be accountability to the European Parliament.  I accept that there is a point in trying to find out who did what to make sure that we have the right people there, that this cannot happen again and that somebody knows about the situation.  When I think of our system, however, which is slightly analogous, if a government were to make such a mistake, that government and its Ministers, not individual officials, would be accountable to the D&aacute;il.  The reality is that this was drawn up.  Commissioners, who are in regular contact with their counterparts here and indeed with the British Government, did not see fit to take out this provision or to say to themselves, as I did and, as I am sure, all committee members did when we first saw this on social media at about 4.30 p.m. that Friday, \"What the - ?\" I could not believe it.  I would like to think Commissioners would think in that same political way that this is something that just should not have happened.  That did not happen and, ultimately, there has to be political responsibility.  I know the European Parliament will do its job in that regard, but the lessons are very important too.<\/p> <p>  I will repeat this.  The protocol is there.  It will not go away.  Nobody has the possibility to remove it.  There is no possibility of negating elements of the protocol either.  There is the possibility of all of us working together to make sure it works in the most flexible way possible, consistent with everybody's demands that there be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  This is really important for the economies north and south of the Border, and we cannot lose sight of this when we talk about checks and customs.  It is really important that Ireland protects its place in the Single Market and that no questions are asked about that.  It is absolutely central and essential to our economic policy and our economic growth into the future.  That is very important, and I think everybody recognises that, but sometimes when we talk about difficulties and inconveniences we can perhaps put to one side the fact that the Single Market is so important and so central to us.  The invocation of Article 16 has already happened, almost, and we see the fallout from that, so I think it is very unlikely that that will happen again.  The point is that nobody can invoke Article 16 to eliminate the protocol or to change its terms.  The protocol remains and always will remain, and there are ways of making sure we all work together to work it as effectively and efficiently as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#P00100","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":722,"content":"<p>Due to the efficiency of the Minister of State in his answering, we can facilitate a second round of questions, but does Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; wish to come in with a supplementary question before I open the meeting up to the floor again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#P00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":723,"content":"<p>Yes.

They are absolute necessities.  Unionists are doing whatever unionists are doing, but some of the rhetoric and the likes of the letter of ultimatum from Michael Gove are not especially helpful.

Despite the fact that it is directly between the EU and Britain, we are fully involved.  Those systems were not used in this particular context.  That is part of the problem but there are ongoing engagements between Dublin and London also at a political level, which is very important.  When this matter first arose the Taoiseach was in touch with Commission President Ursula von der Leyen a number of times.  He then took the opportunity to speak to Prime Minister Johnson.  There is still ongoing contact between Michael Gove and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, as well as ongoing contact at official level and on the ground.  I am absolutely satisfied that the contact is good.

I have no doubt he will get a sense from this meeting that this conversation will not finish today.  There is an appetite among committee members to ensure we get accountability and transparency.  I believe that no single person made a decision of such magnitude and impact.  My belief is that a group of individuals came together and that people in the Commission know their identity.  For us to have confidence in the Commission into the future, it is imperative that we find out who made this decision of such magnitude because it had consequences.  For every action there is a reaction.  We only have to think of the time, effort and diligence invested in this by officials in the Commission such as Michel Barnier and his team and the individual countries throughout the European Union which knew of the sensitivity of the Northern Ireland peace process and went out of their way to send ambassadors here.  I met the Danish and the Dutch ambassadors in my county.  Many other ambassadors went to County Louth and different parts of the Border region over the past four and half years to get a sense of the situation.  Individual countries of the European Union understand the importance of the peace process and protecting it.  However, this decision, which was made very quickly by a group of individuals on a Friday evening, had drastic consequences that could have had a deeper impact on Northern Ireland.  It was a very serious decision.  It is very important that we as a nation have confidence in the European Union and have a Commission that is accountable.  It cannot be a powerful entity where individuals can be protected.  The message in that regard is strong.  The Minister of State need not address that again as he covered it to the best of his knowledge.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State may not have an answer to this specific question.  What assurances can he give that the protocols around strict veterinary distribution practices employed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are replicated in Northern Ireland?

I am a GP based in Dublin.  I am joined by Dr. Aisling McMahon, an assistant professor of law at Maynooth University with a special interest in patent and health law.

The global economic cost of Covid-19 has been estimated at $3.4 trillion per year.  Furthermore, Oxfam has calculated that the economic impact of the virus could push 500 million people into poverty and nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost, according to UN estimates.  While the arrival of effective vaccines has brought an expectation that the pandemic can be brought under control, that is threatened by an inadequate supply of vaccines.  Most lower income countries are not expected to be vaccinated until 2023 or later.  Vaccine scarcity and slow roll-out will ensure a prolongation of the pandemic as outbreaks re-emerge due to travel between and within countries.  Even more worrying is the risk that variants of the virus will emerge, which will be more infectious, more dangerous and resistant to current vaccines, as we have seen in South Africa in recent days.<br\/><br\/>Ongoing research into identifying and addressing these problems before they arise is essential.  For these reasons, efficient mechanisms for scientists to collaborate and accelerate research and to achieve faster global roll-out of effective vaccines is essential.  The reality is that the current vaccine scarcity is artificial and can be resolved by increasing production capacity globally.  However, to do so, companies must share their know-how and intellectual property rights to expedite research and enable others to produce vaccines.  Given the extent of the extraordinary health crisis and a significant public investment that has supported the creation of many Covid-19 vaccines, this is not an unreasonable expectation.  As Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe have got to get it together as a society.  Social justice is only a dream if we don't put health justice at the centre ... <\/blockquote> <p>Rapid, equitable, global access to vaccines must be a key priority and to achieve this, we urge the Government to endorse the WHO's C-TAP.  I will hand over to Dr. McMahon who will detail this model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran Harkin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":737,"content":"<p>In May 2020, the WHO initiated the solidarity call to action, launching its support for the C-TAP and urging key actors, including governments, to take action.  Put simply, the C-TAP is a platform to facilitate the sharing of intellectual property rights, data, know-how and cell lines related to Covid-19 technologies, including vaccines.<\/p><p>Its end goal is to increase equitable access.  The C-TAP model is needed because production capacity for vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for Covid can be increased globally but, in order to do this, more companies must license and share intellectual property rights, know-how and technologies to enable others to produce them.  The C-TAP sets up a mechanism to facilitate this.  It is a voluntary model that is subject to the agreement of such companies.  Participation, depending on the context, could include compensation in the form of royalties where appropriate.<br\/><br\/>Countries must learn from the past.  The use of intellectual property rights in a manner which hindered access to medicines has had devastating impacts previously, particularly in the HIV-AIDS crisis, with many millions of lives lost as a result.  We must ensure that in this health crisis, that does not happen again.  In short, supporting the C-TAP provides a way to achieve global equitable access to vaccines.  It would maximise the manufacturing capacity globally by enabling more companies to make vaccines.  It would accelerate the development of new technologies by encouraging the sharing of data and know-how, thereby increasing transparency.  It would facilitate more accessible access.  The C-TAP works in collaboration with the existing UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool, which has extensive experience in pooling intellectual property rights for public health.  Furthermore, support for the C-TAP aligns with the European Commission's recently published intellectual property strategy and the Word Health Assembly's Covid-19 response resolution, both of which encourage voluntary pooling and licensing of intellectual property for Covid-19.  Addressing vaccine inequality in this way also gives us a better opportunity to ensure that the core values and intentions of Irish Aid's policy, A Better World, are put into practice, reaching the furthest behind first and leaving no one behind, which is Ireland's approach to realising the UN sustainable development goals.  It is fully consistent with Ireland's foreign policy goals of openness, global solidarity and a commitment to multilateralism.<br\/><br\/>The C-TAP is also vital if COVAX, the vaccine pillar of the WHO's Access to Covid-19 Tools, ACT, Accelerator is to be a success.  C-TAP and COVAX are complementary to each other.  On 5 February, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus of the WHO, in discussing COVAX's first interim vaccine distribution forecast, cautioned that:<\/p><blockquote>\tCountries are ready to go but the vaccines aren't there...  We encourage all manufacturers to share their data and technology to ensure global equitable access to vaccines. <\/blockquote><p>However, it must be emphasised that the C-TAP will only be a success if more Governments and companies support it.  On the other hand, if voluntary mechanisms like the C-TAP do not achieve sufficient support, then mandatory measures for suspending intellectual property rights under the WTO Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver proposal will be needed, and should be supported, to encourage and achieve change.<br\/><br\/>Access to Medicines Ireland is joined by ActionAid Ireland, the Irish Global Health Network, the INMO, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res Ireland and Oxfam Ireland in calling on the Government to support the C-TAP.  To date, 40 countries worldwide, including five European countries, have endorsed it.  Furthermore, last September, the President, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, indicated his support for the WHO's global solidarity call to action in his speech at the UN General Assembly.  Most recently, on 3 February, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that rich countries had a moral responsibility to help countries unable to access vaccines.  This could include supplementing their own ability to produce vaccines with co-operation from the pharmaceutical companies regarding relaxation of some of the patent situations.<br\/><br\/>The bottom line is that we have got to get the entire world vaccinated.  Global multilateral action is needed and Ireland can and should be a leading voice in this regard.  Access to Medicines Ireland encourages the Government to endorse formally the global solidarity call to action and the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool as soon as possible and to take action at an EU level to encourage greater support for the C-TAP.  Alongside this, we urge the Government to increase financial support for the WHO's ACT Accelerator.

My name is Winnie Byanyima.  I lead the United Nations joint programme on HIV-AIDS.  It is called UNAIDS.  I am grateful for this opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the critical issue of Covid vaccine equity.  I am also happy to let the committee know that I am the proud daughter of Irish missionary sisters of St. Francis.<\/p> <p>  In the early years of the AIDS response, millions of lives, as Dr. McMahon said, were needlessly lost because life-saving treatment remained out of reach for people in poor countries as people in rich countries benefited from antiretroviral treatment and went on to live long, healthy lives.  In poor countries 9 million people died waiting for the prices to come down.  It was a deeply painful lesson that many of us know very personally and one that the world, it seems, is having to learn again.<\/p> <p>  Ten months ago world leaders declared that any Covid-19 vaccine would be a global public good, a people's vaccine, but we now face a situation that the South African Government has called a new global apartheid.  Nine in ten people in the poorest countries are set to go without a vaccine this year.  A small group of rich countries representing just 14% of the global population have bought up most of the supply of the Covid vaccines that are available until the end of 2021.  I am sure the committee is as shocked as I am that pharma companies are charging developing countries more than they are charging rich countries, in some cases more than double.  My country, Uganda, will pay $7 per dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and South Africa will pay just over $5 whereas the European Union will pay just over $2 per dose.<\/p> <p>  The problem is not only one of money or unfair allocation; it is also that not enough vaccines are being made.  Even rich countries face challenges over production quantities in this year.  What the European Union is experiencing now is deeply troubling, and we empathise.  It is a taste of what Africa, Asia and Latin America have been experiencing.  This is why approaching vaccination as a competitive race between countries and regions means that everyone loses out.  What Europe thought was defending Europe was really defending the profits of the owners of big pharmaceutical companies.  The vital decisions of production, supply and price and, therefore, who gets the vaccine and when have been left in the hands of big pharmaceutical companies.  How is that right?  Our best chance of all staying safe from Covid-19 is to have vaccines, tests and treatment available for all, for the whole world.  As the Irish President, Michael Higgins, noted when he and I spoke on the same platform at the UN last year, \"Unless such medical tools are fully accessible to all on an equitable basis, the world remains at risk.\"  Right now, however, big pharma is protecting its monopolies, technology and intellectual property and thus restricting production.  We know how to solve this problem: it is to open up production.<\/p><p>Maximising global production can happen only if all companies that can produce vaccines have access to the vaccine technology, know-how and intellectual property.  Pharma companies will not share unless pressed to do so.  Governments have that leverage and there is a mechanism to enable the sharing that Dr. McMahon described, namely, the WHO's C-TAP.  It is a one-stop-shop for pooling all data, know-how, biological material and intellectual property and then licensing production and technology transfer to other potential producers.  So far, pharma companies have not joined C-TAP and the proposal presented by the Governments of South Africa and India at the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, council for a temporary waiver of certain TRIPS obligations has been blocked by the rich countries that host the pharma companies with a vaccine.<\/p><p> This is not only about access for the poor.  The longer the virus is left to ravage developing countries, the longer people in rich countries will remain at risk.  The virus is mutating, as Dr. Harkin stated.  This threatens the efficacy of vaccines, as we have seen with the so-called South African variant.  Yesterday, the South African Government had to postpone its roll-out of the AstraZeneca vaccine because, having bought millions of doses, it realised that the vaccine did not have efficacy against the variant.  The slow pace of vaccination everywhere means that we risk seeing more dangerous variants developing.  As Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO, a wonderful Irishman, often remarks, no one is safe until everyone is safe.<\/p><p> The economic cost is also great.  New research from the International Chamber of Commerce predicts that delays to vaccine access in poorer countries will cost the global economy an estimated $9 trillion, with nearly half of that being the cost to wealthy countries.  These vaccines were developed with public money and these companies depend on government support.  Whenever we raise the question of leverage over companies, though, we are told by rich countries' governments that there is COVAX.  While support for COVAX is welcome, it cannot solve the supply problem on its own.  Indeed, COVAX can only complement C-TAP.<\/p><p> We need to ensure that constraints on licensing and know-how no longer obstruct mass production of Covid vaccines.  We must make companies take part in C-TAP.  It is their governments that can make that happen.  We also need to speed up agreement on a waiver at the WTO, especially if C-TAP does not work.  I hope that the Irish Government will consider joining C-TAP.  I join Dr. Harkin and Dr. McMahon in urging the committee's parliamentarians to ask their Government to do so.<\/p><p> Like AIDS, Covid is revealing the underlying fissures of inequality, how they hurt all of us and how outdated rules and approaches obstruct us from overcoming them.  Fixing them is a policy choice.  It is a moral, public health and economic imperative to ensure that everyone gets vaccinated in 2021 and that no one is left behind.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Winnie Byanyima","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Byanyima for her presentation and for agreeing to stay with us for our questions and answers session.

As we face into the ongoing commitment for global solidarity and social justice, the contributions are very timely.  Unfortunately, the big pharmaceutical companies continue to profiteer on the backs of people throughout the world.  I believe one of the witnesses said countries are ready to go but the vaccines are not there.  That is the call from throughout the world.  It is very clear that the pandemic can only be ended by protecting all nations.  It is interesting to hear the comment that no one is safe until everyone is safe.  That is the only way we will get on top of this global emergency.  No pharmaceutical company should profit from the pandemic.  We need to ensure widespread availability across all nations.  It is shocking that nearly 70 countries will only be able to vaccinate approximately 10% of their populations next year.<\/p> <p>  Another shocking figure that was given related to the cost of one of the vaccines.  The term \"morally corrupt\" springs to mind when some countries are being charged &euro;7 per vaccine.  South Africa is being charged &euro;5, but some of the better off countries in Europe are only being charged &euro;2 per vaccine.  That clearly shows everything that is wrong with the roll-out of the vaccines.  <\/p> <p>  Wealthy countries will have enough vaccine to protect all their citizens three times over in 2021 and yet some of the poorer underdeveloped countries are struggling to vaccinate their citizens.  Lessons need to be learned from the AIDS crisis.  I believe 9 million people in African countries alone died of AIDS while they were screaming out for access to the medication to help with AIDS.  <\/p> <p>  I believe five European countries, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal and the Netherlands, have signed up to support the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, CTAP, along with 40 countries globally and a list of organisations that were mentioned earlier.  Several Irish experts, including Professor Luke O'Neill, Dr. Sam McConkey and many others, support it.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the programme.<\/p> <p>  We also support another initiative and I might ask for views on this.  I refer to the Right to Cure initiative, a European citizens' initiative that was launched last year, which proposes to put public health before private profit, and to make anti-pandemic vaccines and treatments a global public good, freely accessible to everyone.  As we need 1 million signatures to move that initiative forward, I appeal to anyone who is listening to sign up to support it.  There is significant crossover in the objectives of CTAP and that particular initiative to ensure intellectual property rights and patents do not hamper the accessibility or availability of any future Covid-19 vaccine or treatment, and to ensure that EU legislation on data and market exclusivity does not limit the immediate effectiveness of compulsory licences issued by members.<\/p><p>There are a number of other points there as well.  Is this something our witnesses also support?  I have a question relating to the failure of countries to support C-TAP and the dire consequences of that.  Do we have expectations or analysis of what the impact will be?  We see some of the financial impacts, which are shocking, and how it will affect some poorer countries.  When we speak about people and individuals, how will the failure to introduce C-TAP affect them?  <\/p><p> It is unbelievable that the Irish Government has not signed up to support this.  What engagement, if any, has taken place between Access to Medicines Ireland and the Government?  What do the witnesses feel as organisations, doctors and people about this issue?  What are the largest obstacles blocking C-TAP?  Are there particular interest groups such as shareholders?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#F00100","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":748,"content":"<p>There are a number of questions from Deputy Brady that he has not directed at any one individual but perhaps I might get a brief response from Dr. Harkin, Dr. McMahon and Ms Byanyima.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#G00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":749,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to hear the endorsements from Deputy Brady.

While the UK Government has not formally endorsed C-TAP, it has certainly made a number statements suggesting that it agrees with the principles underlying it and in reality, is not too far away from supporting it.  Every day, it is becoming more and more clear that the current system is failing and that we cannot rely on the pharmaceutical industry to guide us through this pandemic as its eye is clearly directed towards its shareholders rather than public health.

In terms of the Deputy's question about the failure to support C-TAP, we are seeing the consequences of it since the vaccines have been approved, particularly since they have started to be rolled out.  It is fantastic that we have these vaccines but, unfortunately, we do not have enough of them.  That is becoming more and more clear for Ireland and other European countries and all over the world.  C-TAP would facilitate the manufacturing of vaccines and the ability to make more.  There is an artificial scarcity because the rights holders are simply not sharing intellectual property data and know-how.  Know-how, data and intellectual property are needed to make these vaccines.  Rights holders could be willing to come on board, take the opportunity to share and realise that we are in an extraordinary crisis and pandemic and need to bring it under control and that the only way to do that is increase the production of these vaccines.  C-TAP is a direct avenue that would facilitate that.  We support the COVAC scheme but, unfortunately, the target is that they would have enough vaccines for 20% of populations, which is nowhere near the figure we would need to achieve herd immunity or a population-wide spread of vaccination.  The consequences of not supporting C-TAP are that we will at best achieve 20% and that is assuming we even have a supply to achieve that.  C-TAP can deliver more vaccines for the likes of COVAC and facilitate that so it is important to stress that C-TAP would provide a mechanism to deliver more vaccines if it was supported but it needs support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling McMahon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":751,"content":"<p>We have a situation where the rules that regulate business and trade, which have been in place for the past 30 years or so, have had an impact on our minds to the extent that we think that the right to profit is equal to the right to health and the right to life.  We have a mindset that is completely taken over by the notion that profit is as important as health and life.  It is a big problem for all of us that we have developed a mindset that justifies profits coming before life.  The second issue is that the rules themselves, which we should be challenging, are not being challenged.  Why is that?  It is because shareholders in this modern world of trade have become so important in businesses that their voice is more important than that of workers, communities and ordinary people.  We had a form of trade and business 30 years ago that allowed profits to be ploughed back into workers' wages, research and community development.  Shareholders took only 10% of profits in the UK, for example, but today, shareholders take 70% of total profits.  The voice of shareholders is so dominant in the politics of our countries.  Their voice is heard before the voice of ordinary people, including consumers and workers and that is part of the problem.<\/p> <p>  We would like to see countries that do not host the pharmaceutical companies that produce the vaccines joining C-TAP because they do not have anything to lose.  We salute Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Norway for supporting C-TAP, as well as many other developing countries.  Of course, countries like Germany, the USA and the UK oppose C-TAP because the pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders have a powerful voice in those countries.  We would like the countries that do not have a stake in the companies producing the vaccines to come together and insist on fairer rules that allow sharing of the technology.  We urge them to back the WTO waiver that is being requested at the TRIPS Council or to join C-TAP.  These are two avenues that will assist in maximising vaccine production for the world.

Can our guests give us any insights into why other countries have not done so?  I also note what Dr. McMahon said earlier about the fact that we are very fortunate in now having a number of vaccines that seem to be effective.  When the virus emerged initially, there was concern that it might take a very long time to develop vaccines to combat it.<\/p><p>Thankfully, this has happened very quickly within a year.  We are all concerned about the possibility, and the fact, that the virus is mutating and is changing and has the potential to change into something even more deadly.  I note Dr. Nabarro is also online and I welcome him.  Perhaps when he speaks he might comment on questions such as access to non-government controlled areas of Syria.  There is no guaranteed channel for vaccines for people in this area.  There are other areas of conflict in the world such as Tigray, Mozambique, Libya and Rohingya in Bangladesh, and places with many refugees in Uganda and Lebanon.  Will our guests comment on the possibility of these people getting vaccinated?  I am also interested in hearing the views of our guests on whether these areas could become centres for more changes to the virus, leading to deadlier strains, if the people in them are not vaccinated.<\/p><p> It is also quite interesting to note the Government here has not said \"No\" to joining the call for action, but if some of the recent responses from the Minister are to be considered, is examining the situation fairly strongly.

I take on board in particular what has been said by the director of UNAIDS.

In addition, Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has written to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, inquiring as to whether he will support C-TAP.  Our party believes further avenues of international co-operation and assistance in addition to COVAX should be explored and leveraged to maximise equitable access and distribution of vaccines in developing countries now and in the longer term.<\/p> <p>  With respect to international efforts, the fast response of Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO in initiating and leading of the work of COVAX should be applauded.

It is important that Ireland supports this initiative to the greatest extent possible through funding and our knowledge and experience of public health emergencies.  It is also welcome to see the aim of the COVAX initiative is to protect at least 20% of each participating population by the end of the year.

I will start by answering some of the questions raised.  On Deputy Stanton's question on why other countries have not joined the CTAP initiatives, 40 countries worldwide have done so, as was noted, including five European countries.  In terms of why others have not, that is the question we are also asking.  In our minds, CTAP will facilitate more access to vaccines.  I can only speculate as to why countries have not signed up so far.  I wonder if perhaps it is only now that as vaccines have thankfully come on board, we are seeing gaps in terms of access, supply chain issues and that do not have as many vaccines as we initially thought we would.  Now would be an opportune time for people to reflect on that and countries to put themselves behind some of the initiatives such as CTAP which will, if it is supported, facilitate more people being able to make these vaccines.<\/p> <p>  Another important point was raised, which relates to the Chairman's point on the new variants that are arising.  It is a worrying time.  Others are more qualified to speak on those points and I am sure we will hear from Dr. Nabarro later on this.  In terms of the intellectual property perspective, one of the obstacles to having access to vaccines is intellectual property, data and the sharing of know-how, in particular.  This also relates to the point on the safety of the production of vaccines.  We need companies to share their know-how to facilitate and enable others to produce vaccines of the same quality standard.  CTAP would facilitate that.  If we had more vaccines, we could deliver more vaccines.  That would mean more people could be vaccinated and, it is to be hoped, reduce the number of new variants emerging.  I will not speak on that.  I am sure others can speak later on it.<\/p> <p>  On whether there is excess capacity in the system, we have looked at some of the research produced by other groups such as Knowledge Ecology International, KEI.  It suggested that there is untapped potential.  We know there are various different pharmaceutical companies, including in Ireland, who could facilitate and help with the production of vaccines.  In recent times, some pharmaceutical companies have entered into voluntary licensing deals where they have agreed to help in the production of vaccines.  For example, as far as I am aware, Pfizer and BioNTech recently reached an agreement with Sanofi to help to increase its production.  We are calling for more of this. <\/p> <p>  Reference was made to shareholders.  The traditional shareholder model involves a focus on profit.  Some of the work we are now doing suggests that a small group of shareholders see themselves as stewards of resources.  Actions are being taken in other countries, such as the US, where there have been shareholder motions, in particular in a pandemic context, to state that profits should not be the main priority and instead other goals such as delivering global equitable access should be prioritised.<\/p><p>We must consider who the shareholders are, which in some cases are pension fund or investment companies.  There is potential for the public to leverage their voices by saying that in this pandemic we must see a change and the sharing of intellectual property and data to facilitate this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I will reply to some of the questions that were raised.  There was a question about refugees and internally displaced people, whether they will be catered for, and if not, whether the communities of refugees and internally displaced people could turn out hosting new and dangerous variants of the virus.  This is the case but there are some good practices.  For example, in Jordan, one in every four people is a refugee.  It is rolling out its vaccination programme to include refugees and it has the support of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  We also heard from the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies last week, which launched a plan to help vaccinate 500 million people globally.  There is a need to pay attention to those people with weak citizenship rights and have them vaccinated.<\/p> <p>  We have looked carefully at the question of capacity in the People's Vaccine Alliance, estimating that the three biggest vaccine producers - Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford AstraZeneca - are producing enough vaccines for only 1.5% of the global population, which tells us how small is the supply.  We are looking at how much capacity is being used by the other big vaccine producers.  When we started probing, we saw some of the production companies moving very fast to try to conclude agreements with some of the major vaccine producers in Europe and America to license them.  They have really been holding on to their technology and know-how to first try to scoop as much profit as possible before they license others.  That is why we need the pressure.<\/p> <p>  The capacity is there and we will estimate those figures.  This capacity is not only in Europe and North America.; there is also capacity in the emerging economies.  There is huge capacity in India, with some companies licensed to produce the AstraZeneca vaccine, for example.  There are other Indian producers with capacity that is sitting there.  There is also capacity in Indonesia, China, Russia and so on.  There is capacity and we will estimate those figures but we must put pressure on those companies.<\/p> <p>  I also wanted to speak to the question of the pandemic being really more devastating than HIV\/AIDS.  I agree.  In developing countries like ours in Africa, the economic devastation is worse than the health devastation.  For some reason our people have not had as many deaths or even infections as in Europe.  Perhaps it is because the populations are younger or we have suffered many infectious diseases previously but nobody knows yet.  Infection rates are lower and deaths are fewer.  Nevertheless, the economies had to be closed completely so the economic devastation is huge.  People have lost jobs and their income so they have nothing to eat.  It is devastating.  The need to recover is global and this pandemic is more damaging than HIV.  Every life is important.<\/p> <p>  Many countries and governments support CTAP, but they have not yet signed up to the Costa Rica resolution.<\/p><p>I think that has to do with some fear of the pharmaceutical companies because this is now about survival of the fittest and booking supplies with a few companies.  I suspect that some governments did not show up to sign up to the common technology access pool because that would be seen as perhaps \"anti\" the pharmaceutical companies.  I suspect one is seen as in conflict with the other.  While some governments have signed on to the People's Vaccine Alliance and the People's Vaccine Alliance is demanding support for C-TAP, the same governments have not signed up to C-TAP or the Costa Rica resolution.  That tells us they will sign onto the People's Vaccine Alliance, which is campaigning for C-TAP, but they will not go to the WHO pool.  Something there suggests that one is in conflict with the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Winnie Byanyima","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I am going to move on to our fourth guest.

There is a requirement as we go into the evidence process for me to state that, although this is a formal meeting of the committee, my representation of the WHO has to be seen as informal.  It cannot be, we respectfully suggest, an alternative to the formal governance process of the WHO through the UN World Health Assembly or other similar mechanisms.<\/p> <p>  I wish to start by acknowledging the incredible work being done by Dr. Kieran Harkin, Dr. Aisling McMahon and Ms Winnie Byanyima.  I may have got the order wrong but that was the order I was given.  What the committee has been hearing this morning is really important.  I was proud to be able to join and hear Dr. McMahon and Ms Winnie Byanyima talking and explaining their points of view, and I am pleased indeed to be here.<\/p> <p>  I want to talk about three things.  The first is Covid-19 and the pandemic.  The second is the way in which efforts are being made to improve access to vaccine through something called COVAX, which the contributors have been describing.  The third thing I want to talk about is improving access to technologies through initiatives like the People's Vaccine initiative and C-TAP.<\/p> <p>  We will start with the pandemic.  I imagine everyone in Ireland knows but perhaps I will say it again.  This pandemic is nowhere near finished.  This is nowhere near the end.  Some people say there is light at the end of the tunnel but from my point of view, I am not sure how far away that light is.  I have no idea how long it will take to reach the end of the tunnel.  I am prepared to say to committee members that I believe there are some really difficult and rocky periods ahead of the world to get through it.<\/p> <p>  This is a new virus that has appeared and entered into the human ecosystem, just as HIV did some decades ago.  The world needs to adapt to a new virus.  That adaptation process takes time, especially given that the virus will change.  Humanity's response to the virus will change as well.  The adaptation will be continuous.  Right now, we are in a phase where the incidence of reported new cases of Covid-19 in Europe has gone into a decline.<\/p><p>This is in particular since the beginning of January and is super-welcome news.  It has gone into decline because of the extraordinary effort by the people of Europe and, increasingly, the people of North America to take this virus seriously by maintaining physical distancing, wearing face protection, practising incredible hygiene, self-isolating when ill and protecting the most vulnerable.  These are the tried-and-tested measures through which people can reduce their risk.  That has to be accompanied with well functioning public health systems that can detect people with the disease, enable them to isolate in a decent way, trace their contacts and enable those contacts to isolate and, when necessary, deal rapidly and robustly with outbreaks that occur.<\/p><p> These are big shifts happening in humanity.  We are all working out how to come to terms with it.  We have had various moments when we have been able to learn: the first acceleration in March and April of last year; the second acceleration at the end of the summer months of last year; and the dramatic third acceleration towards the end of last year and over the new year period.  We have been learning such a great deal, perhaps most importantly that the virus is the adversary and people are the solution.  There is a requirement to enable people to be strong, connected and empowered to fight the virus despite the fact that this entails massive social and economic dislocation.  It hits poor people the worst and it often hits people who have different ethnicity from the dominant ethnicity in western European countries the worst.  Dealing with Covid in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe means empowering people to respond and enabling those most affected, particularly the poorest and those with least access to resources, to be strong.<\/p><p> Having said that, there are ways in which it is possible to help people.  The ways to help include all those I have mentioned and now we can add vaccines.  Who should be receiving vaccines now?  In our view, it is clear that it should be the people who are at risk: older people and people with simultaneous illnesses; and those who are most exposed to the virus, namely, people dealing with Covid in their professional work all the time, particularly in healthcare, residential care, dentistry or other professions where one is in contact with the exhalations of people with the virus.  If the vaccine is helpful in protecting people, there is one priority for the world, as stated clearly by the Director-General of the WHO and the Secretary-General of the UN.  That priority is to make sure everybody in need of the vaccine can access it on the basis of need first, not on the basis of geographical location or nationality.  Right now, the people who must be a priority for any vaccine are health workers, older people and people with concomitant illness, wherever they live.<\/p><p> That is why at the request of the different member states of the WHO, the COVAX scheme was set up as part of the access to Covid-19 tools, ACT, accelerator.  COVAX is a scheme to enable the pooled purchase of vaccines at a negotiated price, ideally a low price.  The vaccines can then be made available to countries to purchase with their own funds or, if their GDP is low, to purchase with aid funds.  It is an advance purchase scheme like what we have used for other vaccines around the world to enable everybody to get the lowest possible price.  By negotiating with the producers, we are able through COVAX to get the price low.  In order for that to work, there has to be vaccine in the system and there is not enough for COVAX to work right now.<\/p><p>Anybody who criticises COVAX needs to be clear about what he or she is criticising.  Is it that it does not have enough vaccine coming through or is it because it has design flaws?  At the moment, the people who run COVAX tell me they want more vaccine in, which means, first, expediting the regulatory approval of existing vaccines that are currently on the edge of COVAX but not in it because COVAX can distribute only vaccines that have an emergency use licence from the WHO advisory committee on vaccination.  Second, we have to get some of the new vaccines properly into the COVAX portfolio, that is, the ones that use messenger RNA.  These are very exciting vaccines.  At the moment, they have to be kept super cold, which makes them a real challenge to use, but the technology will improve and we have to get them in.<\/p><p> Third, countries that have purchased their own vaccine through bilateral deals and have some to spare should give it to COVAX immediately.  It should become a movement everywhere that whenever there is some spare, it is given over.  The key question is what is spare.  My colleagues and I are asking whether, given the current availability of vaccines, any country should be planning to vaccinate all its adults against Covid or whether they should carry out vaccination of the at-risk groups and then share the rest with COVAX so that it can go to other countries where it is needed.  Moreover, COVAX needs to take on new products and new vaccine production needs to come in.<\/p><p> Another key question is what is the hold-up.  What could allow there to be more vaccines?  I certainly agree that the resolution produced by Costa Rica before last year's World Health Assembly, which led to the C-TAP proposal and the associated medicines patent pool being set up, is very important.  It is a mechanism that has worked for voluntary licensing for vaccines and treatments for other products, and it is surely the right way to go in the long term.  In the meantime, let us try at least to get existing schemes working as effectively as possible while, at the same time, exploring possibilities for upgrading the C-TAP system.  To get vaccines moving now, we need not only more vaccines coming in but also to scale up the potential of different manufacturers working to the full.  When that happens, each scale-up has to be individually licensed by the WHO system.  That is absolutely essential for quality assurance, safety and efficacy.  Let us ensure that all the approval processes happen quickly.<\/p><p> It will not be possible to get vaccines into the arms of people everywhere without an enormous global support programme for vaccine administration throughout the world.  Without that, we might end in the embarrassing scenario of vaccines becoming available more and more, particularly during 2021, with the inability to implement them.  For polio, we have had to have a global immunisation programme, while for measles and other childhood illnesses, there are strong global programmes.  There will need to be the global support of countries so that they can implement the vaccines.<\/p><p> Some of that is available through COVAX but, frankly, I know from experience that the world will have to get behind poorer countries to help them carry out their immunisation programmes.  That is where we will need continued commitment from the G7, the G20, the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly and other global bodies to ensure that the money moves.  That is absolutely the key.  Colleagues have made that point and I endorse it.  COVAX will work if it gets the support it needs from rich countries; it will fail if countries go round the back, do not give it enough money or discredit it.  Let us work together to make COVAX a success.  In the longer term, let us use the C-TAP system and other medicine patent pools to increase the availability of supplies in poor countries where they are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Nabarro","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":766,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Nabarro for his contribution.

It is important.  I also congratulate Ms Byanyima.  It was great to hear from Dr. Nabarro as well.<\/p> <p>  As I stated at a previous committee meeting, it is interesting that we have a case where self-interest and the morally correct thing to do coincide.  They often do not coincide, but in this instance they do.  As Dr. Mike Ryan would say, no one is safe until everyone is safe.  It is very scary that 2.3 million people have died globally.  Dr. Nabarro's interpretation of the future is also frightening.  The economic cost of &euro;3.4 trillion per year is shocking.  Basically, we need the global south, the developing world and all other parts of the world to be on board.  As the world is now a global village, one cannot assume that because what are, from our perspective, isolated areas are not covered, we are safe.  As a result of the prevalence of travel, we are not safe.  The issue of variants then arises.<\/p> <p>  I refer to two stark and frightening figures.  The first is that it will be 2023 before several countries are looked after.  The other figure, if I picked it up correctly - I may be corrected if I did not - is that only 1.5% of the global population would be covered by the existing supply of vaccines.  Those are stark figures.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Stanton, raised the issue of capacity.  We should have reassurance in that regard.  I intuitively think there would be far more capacity available if there was a will to use it, but I would like to hear more on the issue.  Ireland now has a particular role in the context of the UN.  The Government must join and sign up to the international statements on this issue and use our position in the EU and the UN.  <\/p> <p>  I recently had a discussion with the Palestinian ambassador to Ireland.  She explained that the Palestinian people have particular difficulties with access.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.  Of course, that links to the issue of refugees.  It is obvious that where there is a density of people, such as in refugee settlements, etc., and indeed in places such as Gaza, there is a greater spread.  I would like the comments of the panel on that but I think it is a pretty basic point.  One assumes the spread is more difficult to halt in the normal ways.  <\/p> <p>  I ask Dr. Nabarro to address the issue of the Russian vaccines and what is happening there.  I have been told that the Russian vaccine is very effective.  We in this western part of Europe do not know much about it.  I ask him to comment on that issue and how the vaccine is being used internationally.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the issue of capacity and the Palestinian question specifically.<\/p> <p>  I was here all day yesterday, when there was a full Seanad sitting at which many important issues were discussed.  I am sure many important issues were also discussed in the D&aacute;il in recent days.  However, without being ridiculous or melodramatic, I believe this is probably the most important meeting that has been held in these buildings for many months.  The issue we are discussing is the most serious in terms of morality, expediency, the economy of the world and the lives of people.  This is of mammoth importance.  I am certainly unequivocal in my support of what our guests are doing.

They have our full attention in Dublin this morning.<\/p><p> I have three questions.  First, while the case the witnesses made is compelling, is there any way we can strengthen it further.  For the benefit of the committee, maybe one or two of the panel could outline diseases for which the patents on vaccines or medications have been waived in the past.  If there was a list of diseases for which medicine patents had been waived in the past, it would certainly strengthen their case because precedents are important.  Second, have the three pharmaceutical companies that make Covid vaccines formally declined to become involved or are we still awaiting a response?<\/p><p> My third question is perhaps a technical one to which the witnesses may not have an answer.  When countries in the EU signed up to this new mechanism, the C-TAP, that has been described, did their minister for health sign off on it or was there a motion on the floor of parliament?  What technical mechanism was used?  Is there a document to sign or does one merely have a press conference and make a formal pledge across the airwaves?<\/p><p> I will summarise my questions.

Canada, a high-income country, currently has enough vaccines to vaccinate its population several times over, yet it is hoarding some of its vaccines.  It still intends to secure 1.9 million vaccines through the COVAX system.  Will the witnesses comment on wealthier nations hoarding vaccines?  What can we do to stop that practice and what will be the outcome if it persists?<\/p> <p>  As part of the COVAX initiative, pharmaceutical companies have pledged that no country will receive vaccines for more than 20% of the population until every country has enough supply to vaccinate 20% of its population.  Currently, we are well off target, with 16% of the world's population having received 60% of the vaccine supply.  Pfizer has only supplied 2% of its vaccines to COVAX.  I ask Ms Byanyima or Dr. Nabarro what steps are being taken to ensure that pharmaceutical companies fulfil their pledges to the COVAX initiative.<\/p> <p>  Many international NGOs, including M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, have called for a relaxation of intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines and technologies to ensure the scaling up of production and access in the global south.

While the mRNA vaccine is a very sophisticated vaccine, some of the advantages are that it can be produced quite quickly and the manufacturing set-up can be done in a relatively short time, within three months.  It is interesting that Knowledge Ecology International, KEI, an international organisation, has identified more than 100 plants capable of producing Covid vaccine.  Six of those are in Ireland, four from Merck, which had attempted to develop its own vaccine which failed recently.  Two of the plants are in Cork, one in Carlow and one in Swords. <\/p><p> On what Ireland should do on the waiver on the national stage, our priority would be for Ireland to support CETA but we would also suggest that the waiver or the suspension of intellectual property rights in relation to Covid-19 products as proposed by the Indian and South African governments also warrants support.<\/p><p> On when a patent has been suspended and used from before, it has happened a number of times.  It is what brought an end to the HIV epidemic in Africa when the pharmaceutical industry and the governments which support them caved in under pressure and relented and allowed HIV drugs to be produced and manufactured generically.  Notable times this happened was when the US Government was threatened by anthrax and overnight brought in a law lifting patents on ciprofloxacin, the only antibiotic that would have been effective.  There are other examples which I do not have to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran Harkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":776,"content":"<p>This is a situation where the self-interested, pragmatic, and moral things to do are the same.  Unless we get more vaccines to more people globally and equitably, it is not in anyone's interest.  It is correct to emphasise that.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. Harkin, spoke on the capacity issues.  We also know there is capacity because we see the pipeline of vaccines.  We see other companies are working on vaccines, both mRNA and other vaccines.  Thankfully, there is a great number of them, which indicates capacity.<\/p> <p>  Given that there has not been voluntary sharing or co-operation, there is a need to share intellectual property.  To get that, some countries propose that there would be a waiver or a suspension of intellectual property.  The preference would be for companies simply to share but if that is not achieved, there has to be support for mechanisms such as the waiver.<\/p> <p>  The AIDS HIV crisis is one example of where intellectual property has been relaxed.  There was ongoing petitioning from civil society organisations and developing countries for years.  Several years were lost while that petitioning was going on because it simply was not being heard.  Eventually it led to an announcement and a declaration under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, which is the overarching laws on intellectual property, that public health would also have to be prioritised and that intellectual property would have to be used in a way that was compatible.  There are certain measures within that framework that allow, for example, for compulsory licences for a certain period of time which would allow a third party to make a drug without the intellectual property holder's permission.  That is perfectly legal and provided for within TRIPS under certain circumstances.  It was one of the key mechanisms during the HIV AIDS crisis that facilitated access.  It was 7 February 2001, so 20 years ago nearly to the day, that Cipla, the Indian generic company, made the announcement, and it was such a striking announcement, that it could produce HIV-AIDS antiretrovirals for less than $1 a day.<\/p><p>That was a game changer in this context.<\/p><p> Since then, the Medicines Patent Pool, which is the body that works with C-TAP, has produced generic products for more than 141 countries worldwide.  On top of this, some of the statistics from the Medicines Patent Pool suggest that those generic products have facilitated 38.75 million patient years of treatment.  Those generic products are being facilitated through the pooling of IP and they work for HIV-AIDS but also hepatitis C, TB and various other diseases.  The pooling of intellectual property rights is a system that has worked before.  C-TAP in particular is, in our view, a key mechanism.  Not only does it share IP, but in the vaccine context it shares know-how and know-how is particularly crucial for producing these vaccines.  We call on companies and governments to support this.<\/p><p> On the question regarding whether companies have refused to sign up to C-TAP, I cannot answer that.  It is not my knowledge that they have refused.  I do not have that information to hand.

The WHO has had a number of exchanges with the manufacturers of the Russian vaccine, the Gamaleya company, and it is continuing to seek from the very co-operative Russian manufacturers all the data that are needed for an emergency use authorisation.  It is complex.  For this process to go through, first one has to look at the vaccine and the results of the phase 1, 2 and 3 trials of the vaccine.  Second, under the WHO rules that have been approved and requested by the national Governments of the member states of the WHO, a certificate of good manufacturing practice is requested from the manufacturer.  All of these issues are being looked at.  In regard to other vaccines that are going through this system, I cannot tell the committee when the effort will be completed.  In regard to Gamaleya and Sputnik V, this is a work in progress that is being done with the greatest possible speed while at the same time maintaining the requirements for quality assurance, safety and efficacy.<\/p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly asked about ensuring access for refugees and other disadvantaged people.  It is important to stress that the COVAX scheme has been designed such that it includes capacity to ensure that when vaccines are available they get to disadvantaged and refugee communities.  Deputy Berry asked about the situation where patents have been waived, to which I think Dr. McMahon gave a pretty good answer.  I do not want to add to it.  In 2002, I was working with the director general WHO and the Secretary General of the UN.  The key issue is that company CEOs came to us.  As a result of an environment which created some pressure, they came to us and I recall that eight of them said they were going to find a way to reduce their prices and to deal with the various concerns raised previously around doing so.  The rest is history.  What a transformative change.<\/p> <p>  On the question regarding whether pharma companies have agreed to voluntary licensing in regard to Covid vaccines, the answer is that they have.  The agreement between AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India or between Sanofi and BioNTech are examples of where this is happening.  The key question that we all need to ask is what can be done to speed up things and make sure that the right amount of vaccines are available.<\/p><p> That brings me to Deputy Gannon's questions.  He asked if wealthy countries were hoarding vaccines.  I checked that with people who have the answers when I was getting briefed for today's meeting.  It is not that wealthy countries have got a lot of vaccine.  In fact, each of the wealthy countries that has a mass vaccination programme under way, including the United Kingdom and countries in the European Union, are short of vaccine.  They are worried about supplies because they have made advance purchase commitments, which means they got an option on vaccine with the manufacturers but there is such competition for supplies among governments that have made pledges to vaccinate large proportions of their population as well as those who have made pledges to support COVAX.  There is a terrible competition under way and I cannot underestimate the severity of this competition.  One just has to look at newspapers in European countries right now to see, for example, the frustration being expressed towards European leaders that there is not more vaccine becoming available.  That is creating a competition with COVAX.  Quite simply, that is what is happening now.  It is because the countries that are committed to vaccinating all their populations for the very good reason that they see this as the best way out of the pandemic are putting such huge pressure on the very limited supply that availability of COVAX is always in question.  That is our difficulty.<\/p><p> Deputy Gannon brought up this point by asking if wealthy countries are hoarding.  I do not want to use the term \"hoarding\" but they are certainly putting immense demands on the manufacturers in the current vaccine shortage to take vaccines away from COVAX so that they can fulfil pledges they have made to their citizens for widespread vaccination.  This situation is very difficult.  If a political leader has said his or her people will be vaccinated and after they have done the people most at risk - the health workers - they will go to teachers, then first-line responders like ambulance workers and then essential personnel like security guards, who have a lot of contact with people and we know have a higher incidence, it can be seen that the political pressure in Europe is huge, yet at the same time here are we, with COVAX, saying, as we have heard even in what has been going on here today, that the situation for health workers in poor countries is desperate.  Thousands of health workers have died as a result of Covid-19 in the past year.  Yes, we want to protect these health workers but there is this terrible conundrum, and I believe everybody sees it.  Unfortunately, increasing the licensing and using the Medicines Patent Pool and C-TAP will not deal with the acute problem right now.  The problem right now is that there is limited capacity.  We are in a shortage situation.  It should get better in the coming weeks and months but the competition for this small amount of vaccine right now is huge.<\/p><p> Deputy Gannon's question, and I do not want to answer it exactly as written, was how to get Pfizer to fulfil its responsibilities to COVAX.  Pfizer has got responsibilities to a number of different groups which have made advance purchase agreements.  It has also got shortages of production because, when vaccines are being produced, things do not work smoothly.  Batches go wrong.  Whole batches have to be thrown away.  Pfizer has licensed the Serum Institute of India, a Korean company.  It has also got its own plants in Europe and they are not all able to produce what is needed.  Given the demand that is coming, often backed by lawyers from European governments and from the European Union as well as from the UK and, I am sure, from other countries in the world, and it is building up, it is super hard to understand precisely what is going on.<\/p><p>One concern is that COVAX works if there is transparency about pricing, delivery dates and to what degree the company is able to say that it did its best but could not deliver.  Right now, we do not have full transparency, which makes life difficult.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Gannon, the lack of transparency makes this difficult.  What steps should the Government take to support the matters we are talking about?  Everything that has been said in the chamber is right.  This requires political action, not just within the nation but also across Europe and through the UN Security Council.  There is a core question that comes back to members here, representing the Irish people, which is what the Irish people want.  My colleague, Dr. Mike Ryan, who is the greatest Irishman working on infectious diseases, works as head of emergencies at the WHO.  He talked to me last weekend as I was preparing and said that it is difficult because politicians believe that it is their job to always fight for the interests of their constituents, which, right now, is for as many people as possible to be vaccinated with a safe, effective and functional vaccine as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> Is there any way that we can get a message to politicians that perhaps the population of Ireland is prepared to look at an alternative proposition, which is for high-risk people in Ireland to be vaccinated now with whatever spare vaccines are available being shared with other countries in the world so that they can vaccinate their high-risk population?  Once we have all high-risk populations vaccinated, then we can complete the vaccination of the adult population.  This is a political dilemma.  I do not know how one gets to know the mood of the population but there surely needs to be a test of what the people of Ireland and other European countries want right now, whether it is fairness for the world or trying to get as much vaccine as possible for people in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Nabarro","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":782,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Nabarro.

I find it morally reprehensible for any pharmaceutical company to engage in extortion of poorer countries by price gouging.  I cannot think of a worse action by any company at a time like this.  Dr. Nabarro is correct that people are the solution, but we will only be the solution if we are willing to take on the role of being global champions and ensuring equal and proper access to all vaccines and treatments used to save the lives of those affected by Covid.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue that has not been touched on.  EU member states, like other countries, have contributed billions of euro and dollars to the pharmaceutical companies over past years, through taxpayer funds, research and development funds or other tax breaks.<\/p><p>This is not the time for anybody to be getting into a bickering match over intellectual property rights; it is the time to simply step up, stick on the big girl pants and do the right thing.<\/p><p> My questions are quite simple.  One concerns C-TAP and COVAX.  In the opening statement, 2023 was given as the year when people in some poorer countries will be vaccinated.  Is there a tipping point whereby that target could be moved out further or brought closer depending on the level of buy-in to C-TAP?  Other contributors have spoken about manufacturers refusing to engage.  Have manufacturers been asked to engage?  Have potential producers in other countries being directly asked to sign up to and support the programme?<\/p><p> On the companies based in Ireland that could manufacture the vaccine, do we know whether there is a relatively available supply of what they would need to facilitate their doing so?  I believe there are half a dozen such companies.  What engagement has taken place with them to determine whether they would come on board to engage in manufacturing if the conditions were right?<\/p><p> I understand certain countries have either overbought or over-ordered based on their populations.  I stand to be corrected but I believe New Zealand either over-ordered or overbought not for its own population but for neighbouring territories that may not have been best placed to order for themselves.  Is this a global trend?  Is there more evidence of this solidarity or is New Zealand very much an isolated case?  Of the countries that have over-ordered or overbought, how many have made an offer under the COVAX system?<\/p><p> We have touched on conflict zones, refugee movement and the vital job the Red Cross is doing.  Regarding occupied territories, who is present to ensure people were most vulnerable are vaccinated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#U00300","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  It strikes me that the appalling mix of the animal instincts of capitalism is meeting up with competitive races.  The competitive race is not just that towards vaccination as it concerns individuals themselves.  As an individual sitting here, I watch every day to see how close my age group is to the next stage of vaccine roll-out in Ireland.  That is human nature.  All of us want to be vaccinated.  We want all the vaccines to be shared equally, but not just now.  It is a case of saying, \"I am all for it.  As soon as I have been vaccinated, let us get the rest of the world vaccinated.\"  That is a human response.  The animal instincts of capitalism are driven by the ownership of the intellectual property rights.  When we talk about declaring something a global public good, we are saying to the shareholders of the drugs companies and manufacturers that we do not want them to have super-normal profits, which is what they normally earn from the development of a drug of one type or another.  There are two ways of dealing with that.  One is that national governments would tax the shareholders to take the super-normal profits off them in order that the drug could be redistributed globally along the global network, but that is highly unlikely to happen because we are politicians and we ultimately answer to our local constituencies.  The other solution, therefore, is that we cough up and pay the super-normal profits to the manufacturers to have a free licence throughout the world to get manufacturing done.  I would be interested in the panel&rsquo;s view on that.<\/p> <p>  We have heard about occupied territories and war-torn areas around the world such as Syria and Yemen.<\/p><p>Where a totalitarian government is in place, do the witnesses believe, or is there any evidence to suggest, the denial of access to a vaccine may become another form of human rights abuse?<\/p><p> The other terrible term I heard this morning, which is quite frightening and I believe is happening in the United States, is \"vaccine chasing\".  People are moving from one geographical area to another because the roll-out of the vaccine is faster in the second area.  I am quite concerned about that.<\/p><p> I must ask this question today with respect to Covid-19.  Part of the argument or solution is vaccination, the other part is in testing.  There is a reluctance in Ireland to use antigen testing, which many European countries have taken up and are using to see schools and manufacturing plants open up.  What is the panel's view on the antigen roll-out?<\/p><p> The final question goes back to the issue of interpersonal competition for vaccine.  My colleague, Deputy Berry, referred to Defence Forces personnel who are going into extremely testing conditions.  Under normal circumstances, they are exposed to all sorts of infections, but in this particular instance they are exposed to Covid-19 on top of everything else.  I fully support what Deputy Berry is talking about.  Yesterday, however, we had a debate in this Chamber on special education.  The question arose as to whether those who are on the front line and will have to visit five or six houses a week now qualify as front-line workers.  The quite natural instinct is to stretch out the definition in order that we can bring more groups under the term \"front-line workers\".  I would love to hear from the panel as to how we might tie down what in fact constitutes a front-line worker and then work to that definition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#V00200","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I have a specific question.  Having discussed it with my Seanad colleague, Senator Higgins, I know she would have intended to ask this question if she could were it not for the Covid-19 restrictions.  She understands and appreciates that.<\/p> <p>  Building on Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s question to our panel, there are public health concerns internationally, specifically around Israel's unequal distribution of vaccines and access to vaccines for Palestinians in the occupied territories.  As our panel will know, the Palestinian human rights group, Al-Haq, joined by more than 100 Palestinian human rights and civil society organisations, called Israel's vaccine policy discriminatory and unlawful due to its complete disregard for its obligations toward Palestinian healthcare.  I believe one of our earlier contributors spoke to global apartheid with regard to the vaccines.  Article 56 of the Fourth Geneva Convention stipulates that the occupier has a duty to ensure the application of necessary preventive measures to combat the spread of diseases and epidemics.<\/p> <p>  So far, more than 172,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories have tested positive for Covid-19 and there have been more than 1,900 deaths.  As other members have said, I note the Government is contributing to COVAX.  In keeping with the Chairman's advice, however, I have a specific question.  Not least in the context of Ireland's often-cited and often-lauded soft power on the global stage, whether that is in the context the of the EU, UN, the Security Council or our historic and long-standing links with North America, will the panel give us their views on what more could be done specifically by Ireland and this State to support Palestinian equitable access to vaccinations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#W00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":788,"content":"<p>Before I go back to the panel, I want to ask about the immediate way forward.

If my recollection serves me right, it was put forward by countries in October and it has been discussed since then.  There were informal discussions again, I think, last week, and as far as I am aware there will be further discussions.  In March, there will be more discussions within the formal meeting context on the TRIPS situation, so it is still ongoing.<\/p> <p>  In response to some of the other questions, the C-TAP initiative is a voluntary system.  It does not suspend and instead encourages companies to share their intellectual property rights.  They retain those rights.  It is also a non-exclusive system so they would still be able to have licensing agreements.  That is the key difference between the two.  The other difference is that C-TAP encourages the sharing of know-how, which is crucial within the vaccine context.  Both of those measures are ongoing and, as we have said, both are ones that we support.<\/p> <p>  On the first question that Deputy Clarke asked about the figures that we mentioned earlier of nine out of ten people not being able to get vaccines, and some of those figures are for Oxfam and other groups, our hope is that is based on projections around the current vaccine situation.  We hope that with agreements like C-TAP or, indeed, if more companies are willing to engage in voluntary licensing, that would either increase the capacity, because we are going to have more and more manufacturers producing these vaccines, or it would build capacity.  It would mean new manufacturers coming on board to produce those vaccines.  Our hope is that that would then increase the numbers available and bring the figures down, thus making sure we have a more equitable spread because, essentially, the aim is to produce more and have more manufacturers doing more.<\/p> <p>  In terms of IP, that currently is tricky.  If companies have intellectual property and if they are not sharing the know-how, then other manufacturers cannot come on board because it would be in breach of intellectual property rights, but also they may not have the know-how to do that.  They need the know-how and the sharing.<\/p> <p>  On who else supports or whether any pharmaceutical companies support the C-TAP measure, there is news that 18 generic companies, that is, 18 companies that could produce generic products, have come on board and are supportive of the C-TAP arrangement.  As I have said, I am not aware of the current picture and to what extent they are coming on board, although I am sure they are, and there are negotiations between the WHO and the pharmaceutical companies that have some of the rights at the moment.  Certainly, generic companies are coming on board, and the latest figure is that there are 18 companies that are generic producers and that are willing to do that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Senator Craughwell's questions, one was very important as it mentioned the idea of human rights.  This is something we have touched on briefly.  It has to be said and must be emphasised, however, that there is a human right to life and there is also a human right to health protected both under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and under international agreements such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  All countries that are party to those would have obligations to protect and promote human rights, and not just a legal obligation, although clearly there is one, but also a moral obligation in terms of these issues.<\/p> <p>  I know, given the time, we may not get the opportunity to say more on the following, so we would like to thank the committee again today, but one of the things that I would ask for is that there would be consideration given to or discussion of formal endorsement of C-TAP.  It is very important.  Others have mentioned Ireland's place on the international stage.  It is not enough just to support C-TAP.  We certainly support that and hope that the Government would do that, but also, if possible and ideally, the Government should be advocating for C-TAP and other mechanisms at an international level, particularly at the  EU level but also, given its role internationally in terms of the UN Security Council, being an advocate and being a part of that.<\/p><p>The other thing is to encourage other pharmaceutical companies to join.  Some companies, it must be said, have already engaged in and entered into voluntary licensing deals and I know this has been mentioned.  These include Pfizer and BioNTech with Sanofi, AstraZeneca with the Serum Institute of India.  More of that needs to happen and C-TAP, if they supported it, could facilitate that at a larger scale.  The idea of whether a D&aacute;il motion might be something that would be possible was also mentioned earlier.  We would particularly welcome a D&aacute;il motion or Seanad motion tabling these types of issues if it was something Members were willing to consider, particularly an endorsement of the C-TAP initiative, but also the other initiatives such as the waiver or other proposals to facilitate equitable global access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#X00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McMahon.

Speaking as a public health professional, as well as an envoy for the WHO, the tipping point is now.  There is no time down the road.  We are watching extraordinary and dramatic damage occurring to the fabric of human society everywhere as a result of Covid.  It is very active now; there are a lot of issues all over the world, including deepening inequities and real frustration and anxiety on the part of millions of people.  Now is the time when the leaders in the rich world must take the initiative and must focus on equity.  All that has been said by Dr. McMahon, Dr. Harkin and Ms Byanyima is so right.  I say do not wait.<\/p> <p>  The second point is how many countries are doing what New Zealand has done in terms of actually taking advantage of their skills in dealing with Covid and postponing an option they have got on a vaccine?  I have not heard of any others and it is time we had a vaccine solidarity challenge where heads of government, through their legislators, are invited to indicate what are the circumstances under which they will be ready to share.  Of course, they will all say they are worried about variants but the whole world is worried about variants.  Variants can affect poor countries just as badly as they can affect rich ones.  The key thing is to protect those who are most at risk.  The responsibilities of occupiers, as was brought out by Deputy Clarke, and the responsibilities of governments are well set out.  Dr. McMahon is much better qualified than me to talk about it but again, as a public health professional, I am really concerned when groups of people inside a national border are denied, for some reason or other, an opportunity to access a vaccine and I am sure that those who have occupational responsibilities will do everything possible to be transparent about how they are dealing with it.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell raised many points and I got five of them down.  I feel I have the responsibility to deal with the third question, on vaccine sharing.  I stress that one of the things we all must work on at the moment is vaccine hesitancy.  There are people who are not quite sure about whether they want to take the vaccine.  It is really important that in all societies they are given a second, third or fourth chance if they are uncertain when first asked.  Thus I am kind of advocating for a really tolerant approach and for offering people, as I said, a chance to think about things and not requiring them to make a decision now on the basis that otherwise they will not get a chance.<\/p><p>On testing, I stress that while there are concerns about the reliability and positive predictive value of some of the antigen tests available, the committee should watch this space.  I believe that more reliable rapid tests will come on stream.  That will make such a difference.  We do not talk so much about testing.  I believe that access to rapid and reliable tests is absolutely key to an equitable response.<\/p><p> On the question of the definition of \"front-line personnel\", countries could really take advantage of the opportunities they have in the international system through the UN to debate these things.<\/p><p> The Chairman said something that is very important about the money that is needed.  The Chairman asked where the impetus will come from for a real initiative in this regard.  There have been calls for a vaccine summit involving the new US Administration and perhaps involving the G7.  It is very important that we go beyond just saying there needs to be a summit.  World leaders have got to come together in a constant format to deal with this crisis as a global crisis now.  It cannot be dealt with by individual national leaders working on their own, which is bound to cause terrible problems.  The kinds of issues we are discussing today need solidarity in the responses.  The WHO and the UN Secretary-General are constantly asking for greater and more joined-up leadership by leaders.  I propose not just a summit but a global Covid response programme that deals with all of the issues such as access to tests, access to treatment, access to vaccines, travel issues, the problems of obligations of occupiers and all the other problems we are talking about.  This needs ongoing attention now because we do not know what a failure to deal with Covid in a joined-up way worldwide will lead to.  We do know that 2020 was a year like no other.  Who knows what will happen in 2021 and 2022 if we do not deal with this as the global emergency that it is?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Nabarro","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":799,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Nabarro.
