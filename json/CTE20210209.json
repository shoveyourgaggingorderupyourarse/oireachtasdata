Following events surrounding the Northern Ireland protocol, the committee welcomes the opportunity to engage and ask questions about the sequence of events that ultimately led to the European Commission triggering Article 16 before it made a U-turn on that decision.<\/p> <p>  As members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, we feel we have a twofold responsibility in this regard: first, to ask questions at a Government level as to what happened and how it happened and, second, we must have accountability at a Commission level.  We want to ensure what happened does not happen again and that we can have public trust and confidence in the protocol's procedure in the future.  We look forward to the engagement today.  The Minister of State will get a feeling and a sense from the members as to where they are on this issue.  Last week, however, there was a certain anxiety and obvious desire to deal with this issue.  We appreciate the Minister of State being with us today.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask that all members confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contribution to the meeting.  For anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only the Chairman and the necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everyone bear with us should any technical issues arise.<\/p> <p>  I now call the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#C00100","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus le baill an choiste as an gcuireadh chun teacht anseo inniu.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm aon eolas at&aacute; agam a scaipeadh.<\/p> <p>  This is my first appearance before the committee since the trade and co-operation agreement was reached between the EU and the UK.  I will first speak briefly speak on that before I talk about the issue of the protocol, which is obviously of huge concern not only to the committee but to Government as well.<\/p> <p>  The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is the framework for the relationship between the European Union and the UK into the future and complements the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Northern Ireland.  Like any international agreement, it is the product of compromise and give and take.  Neither the European Union nor the UK has got everything it would have wanted but there is much to recommend it.<\/p> <p>  The agreement provides for zero tariff, zero quota trade in goods of EU or UK origin.  This is a major priority of the Government and is vital for sectors such as our agrifood industry in particular which would have been devastated by tariffs.  It provides robust safeguards to ensure there is a level playing field between EU and UK businesses to protect Irish businesses and our future prosperity.  It provides for close co-operation with the UK in the energy and transportation sectors, which are essential to making our economy work.  It allows for close co-operation between the police and judicial authorities in Ireland, which is essential to effective policing on the island of Ireland.  I pay tribute to Mr. Michel Barnier and his team in the European Commission for their tireless work in securing the agreement.<\/p> <p>  Separately, and as the committee will be well aware, the Northern Ireland protocol came into effect on 1 January 2021.  It plays a vital role in protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including a key priority of the Government to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, as well as protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  It ensures that Northern Ireland traders continue to have access not only to Great Britain but also to the EU Single Market of 450 million consumers, access that is unique and vital for all-island supply chains.<\/p> <p>  For Northern Ireland, and indeed for businesses across the island, adapting to the changes is undoubtedly a challenge.  It is important, however, not to lose sight of the overall purpose of the protocol, what it is for and the role it plays in providing as much certainty as possible under the difficult circumstances caused by the UK leaving the European Union.  After four years of painstaking negotiations, it is clear there are no easy alternatives to the protocol.  It is clear that the European Union and the United Kingdom will have to continue to work closely together, particularly in the first weeks of the protocol&rsquo;s operation, as traders adjust to the new rules in place.  Every effort will need be made within the framework of the protocol to iron out any challenges that emerge.<\/p><p> It is very unfortunate that the protocol got caught up in the issue of the European Union vaccine procurement last week.  It is entirely regrettable that the Commission did not consult us in advance of the ostensible decision it contemplated with regard to invoking the protocol's safeguard clause.  The decision was, rightfully, rescinded shortly after the Taoiseach spoke to President von der Leyen on the Friday evening in question.<\/p><p> The European Union has a legitimate aim, on behalf of all of us, of protecting vaccine supplies.  Ireland will continue to work closely with the Commission on this issue.  However, that is entirely separate, and should be entirely separate, from the operation of the protocol.  We will be working with the Commission to review this matter and to continue to ensure that the protocol and its political context are properly understood.  All sides must now redouble their efforts to make the protocol work for Northern Ireland and all its people and businesses.  It is important to take a calm and measured approach based on trust and pragmatism to any issues that arise in regard to its implementation.  <\/p><p> I welcome that a call took place last Wednesday between the Vice-President of the European Commission, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Mr. &Scaron;efovi's opposite number in the UK, and the First Minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, of Northern Ireland.  In a joint afterwards, the EU and the UK described the discussion as a constructive one and stated they had agreed to work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues.  This approach is best managed through the established mechanisms and communication channels to address practical issues around the operation of the protocol, including the specialised committee on the protocol and the withdrawal agreement joint committee.  Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Chancellor Gove agreed to meet again this week in London and to keep in close contact as this work progresses.  EU-UK channels must remain the primary recourse for addressing any issues that arise in the interests of stability, clarity and sustainability.  Unilateral approaches to working through issues are unhelpful, no matter what the source.<\/p><p> The committee will also be aware that certain staff working at border control posts at the ports of Larne and Belfast were advised not to present for work on 2 February owing to concerns arising from intimidation and threats.  I condemn the intimidation of port staff and the menacing threats that have appeared as graffiti in Northern Ireland.  I welcome that the PSNI is actively engaged and taking appropriate measures.  I also welcome the confirmation that Larne council staff have returned to their duties.  All staff should be able to carry out their work safely and political leaders should make every effort to reduce tensions.<\/p><p> The Government is closely engaged with its counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive.  We are also listening carefully to business representatives on this and other issues.  We have been consistent in our position that we want the protocol to work as smoothly as possible for the people of Northern Ireland and people and businesses across the island of Ireland.  Trade volumes between Ireland and Great Britain remain low but they are gradually increasing.  We had 61 inbound movements on 1 and 2 January.  The figure reached its peak so far this year with 1,344 movements on 3 and 4 February.  <\/p><p> The Government understands that new controls have created challenges for many traders.  We will continue to help traders and hauliers to make the adjustment.  The changes are not temporary.  It is important that we all work together to adapt to the new trading environment.  A range of advisory, upskilling and support services remains available.  Over &euro;9.4 million has been allocated under our ready-for-customs grant that provides funding of up to &euro;9,000 per eligible employee.  It is also very important that, in line with its border operating model, the UK will introduce new checks and controls on imports from the EU in April and June.  We are working with our exporters to help them prepare for these changes.<\/p><p> No new controls apply on direct continental routes, which are proving very popular.  Freight volumes on these services are up 100% on last year.  We now have daily direct services to France, which was a key ask of the haulage sector.  In January there were 62 roll-on roll-off freight sailings in a typical week, which is up from about 26 such sailings last year.  We have 36 sailings to northern France per week as well as sailings to Spain, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands.<\/p><p> Brexit means change in the short, medium and long term.  Ireland will need to respond to the challenges and opportunities that this brings by playing a leadership role in shaping and developing our common European Union.  The relationship between Ireland and Britain is always close and special but our home is at the heart of the European Union.  I am very happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#C00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat Aire St&aacute;it Byrne.

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it as a chuid oibre go dt&iacute; seo.  I have a couple of questions for the Minister of State and a couple of thoughts.  He is right to acknowledge the huge work that has gone into getting us to the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  It was a massive achievement in very difficult circumstances.  The support we as a country have got from the European Commission since the Brexit referendum in 2016 has been immense; it has effectively been hand in glove.  The Minister of State is also right to separate the protocol from the triggering of Article 16.  I will discuss the protocol later.  The support and co-operation from the Commission makes what happened with the triggering of Article 16 on 29 January even more unbelievable and harder to get our heads around.  The triggering apparently happened without our knowledge.  Apparently it happened without the knowledge of the Irish nominee to the Commission.  Given that the European Commission has shown a massive understanding of the sensitives of relationships and of the protocol and the background to it, has the Minister of State learned anything in the intervening period about why it was triggered, who ordered its triggering and why the European Commission saw fit to trigger it without consulting the Irish Government in advance?<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to the meeting with the Commission and the British Government last week.  The meetings were positive.  I understand that there is to be a meeting today between European Commission officials and Irish representatives and that proposals to manage this issue going forward are to be tabled.  When it comes to our neutrality we have a triple lock.  We need some kind of a lock mechanism such that in future Article 16 can never be triggered without the agreement of the Government or without consultation with it.  The Minister of State is closer to this than we are and he has seen at close hand the damage done by the triggering, including the damage done to trust.  It is being reported on RT&Eacute; today that we will get some sort of vague comfort blanket assurances that this will not happen again, that there will be consultation with the Government around legislation and that if there is a problem, it will be put through Commissioner McGuinness's <i>cabinet.  <\/i>Instead, we should have something substantial, an actual formal process that would involve the Government in a formal way rather an <i>ad hoc<\/i>one.  I genuinely think the damage done by this triggering has been so immense that we now need a process to ensure it does not happen again.<\/p><p>On the protocol, I absolutely condemn the violence and threats being issued to people doing their jobs in the last few weeks.  It brings us back to a much darker time.  On the general matter of EU-Britain trade, we are currently running at volumes that are around 50% of what they were this time last year.  Revenue has declared 1.8 million custom declarations in January alone, which is more than the total for 2020.  Who in the Government is co-ordinating the response so that we will be ready when trade returns to full volumes?  Can the Minister of State say we will not have any major difficulties or delays with goods going to Britain and coming in from there when trade is hopefully restored to full volumes?  The lower volumes at the moment are presumably due to Brexit stockpiling before December and to the pandemic.  Who in the Government is going to co-ordinate this to ensure there is no disruption to supplies either between here and Britain or the reverse in terms of the food industry, etc.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#E00200","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I therefore ask for his indulgence in relation to replying specifically to the questions.  That will potentially allow for members to come in a second time as well.  The Minister of State may now reply and Deputy Howlin will follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#E00300","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>That is probably a better approach.  Deputy Calleary has asked some very important and fundamental questions on various aspects of this.<\/p><p> On the question of Article 16 being triggered, while we might not be as shocked now two weeks on, the reaction Deputy Calleary shows today is similar to the Government's reaction on the day, namely, one of complete shock and surprise.  It is absolutely the case that we had no knowledge of what was being planned.  We had spent the previous weeks being asked about Article 16 from another perspective, and quite rightly pointed out that this was a pretty standard safeguarding clause in trade agreements and was not designed to eliminate the protocol or be used except in the most extreme circumstances.  It came as a complete surprise to us when we saw that it was invoked.  In my case, I saw it on social media at 4.30 p.m on the Friday while I was out for a walk.  I was a bit shocked.  It went against everything we had been considering and planning for over the previous weeks when this was an issue.  It has caused continued consternation and has been deeply unhelpful.<\/p><p> On the how and the why the article was triggered, these are questions for the European Commission.  Clearly, it should not have happened.  There was a commercial dispute with AstraZeneca.  We stand in solidarity with the Commission on that and on the vaccine purchasing arrangement.  Article 16 should not have come into that at all, however.  As soon as the Taoiseach was informed of this by his chief Sherpa he was immediately on the phone to Ursula von der Leyen.  There was ongoing engagement in the early evening, but the Taoiseach will have to speak for himself on that because he was the one making the calls.  There was subsequent engagement with Boris Johnson.  We continue to engage with the Commission and other member states, at my level, at the Minister for Foreign Affairs' level, at the Taoiseach's level and at ambassadorial level.<\/p><p> The point of concern for the moment, and which Deputy Calleary has hit upon, relates to how will we ensure this does not happen again.  The Government wants an early warning system to be put in place.  Whatever meeting is reported today, there are also ongoing meetings.  I will have a range of meetings with my counterparts too.  There is a view, which is a risky view, that yes the Commission made a mistake and has acknowledged the mistake and that everything has been resolved.  Clearly, that is not the case because the consequences of this matter are continuing.  We must apprise our colleagues around the EU of the lasting consequences of what has happened around the protocol, and that when one action is taken it inevitably provokes an opposite reaction.  Members may have seen press reports where our ambassador gave a full-blooded account of the consequences of invoking Article 16 to other EU ambassadors at a meeting of the Committee of the Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States to the European Union, COREPER, last week.  I have also done this with my colleagues, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the Taoiseach in his interactions.<\/p><p> This has not been good and we want an early warning system.  I am not sure about a formal process, as Deputy Calleary referred to, but engagement is ongoing to make sure that it does work.  Before my time in the role, a great deal of work was done in recent years to keep the Commission and the other member states apprised of the actual situation on the ground in Northern Ireland.  We cannot assume prior knowledge.  We were lucky with Michel Barnier in that he had a long history in the context of the various roles he has held.  He was a Minister for agriculture and for foreign affairs and then he was in the Commission when the PEACE programme funding was first put in place.  Mr. Barnier had a deep knowledge of the situation in Northern Ireland but this may not be the case for everybody else, which would be natural.  That is one of the first points.  We must make sure that people know what the situation is like on the ground, that it is not simply something that can be put in writing between the EU and Britain and that there are many complicated aspects to it.  Whatever meeting is reported today, I will not come here and describe this as a key, crunch meeting.  There is ongoing engagement under way and we may not have a resolution on it today.  It is safe to say that people are fully aware of the significance of what has transpired.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the Deputy's point on trade volumes and the concern about co-ordination.<\/p><p>A group comprised of representatives of all Departments meets on a daily basis to examine all of the issues around trading goods, particularly between Britain and Ireland.  We are also, as I am sure are members, engaging with hauliers and logistics companies and their concerns are being fed into the system.  I compliment officials and Government agencies on taking on board some of the concerns.  People at the coalface and on the front line of importing and logistics need to get things done.  Much of this work is time sensitive.  They have brought many issues to our attention and I encourage them to continue to do that.  The numbers show that some trade has moved from the land bridge to the direct routes.  We can see that by volume.  It is not possible to do an exact comparison but some trade has moved.  Numbers on the Ireland-Britain route are down but they have increased dramatically on the direct continental routes.  <\/p><p> I mentioned in my earlier contribution that Britain has not yet introduced checks to the extent that we have.  Businesses will have to start preparing for this and Government will be trying to help them prepare for it through the various schemes.  Businesses need to be aware that things are going to get more difficult.  It is important to remember that checks are taking place for a reason.  This is our contribution to the European Union Single Market and customs union.  The Single Market was created to avoid red tape and border checks.  Britain decided to leave the Single Market and that has inevitably resulted in checks raising their heads again.  They are not temporary.  This is an obligation we have to take seriously because our economic prosperity and the protection of our public health and safety depend on it.  The Single Market is essential to our economy.  That is an important message.  We do not want these checks but they are essential to our membership of the Single Market.  Revenue has introduced some easements to help the situation and that may continue but these are not exemptions or free passes.  We have to implement the new arrangements in the most practical way possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#E00400","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

There is no point in underscoring our collective reaction to the decision to trigger Article 16.  It went beyond unfortunate and regrettable, but I suppose the Minister of State has to use those words.  I am interested in getting behind the process.  The Minister of State said that is a matter for the Commission, but it is a matter for all of us to know how the Commission operates.  The President of the Commission said this was a decision of the college of Commissioners but we heard from our Irish nominated Commissioner that she was not alerted to it.  Does the Minister of State know how this came about?  It is akin to a Government decision being made without members of the Government being aware of it.  I am sure that happened in the past, but it should not happen.  There is a process.  One would imagine that on something as sensitive as this there is a clear process.  It undermines my confidence in the decision-making processes for the future.  I would like to know how this happened, as I am sure would the Government.  Where was the mistake or is there a structural difficulty in regard to all of this?  In terms of this not happening again, the utterances of the Commission immediately afterwards did not indicate that would be the case.<\/p><p>It basically reserved the right, maybe, to exercise Article 16 again.  As I said, I listened last week at the meeting to the EU ambassador to the UK, and he was less than clear in saying this was an action we should not have taken.  That is the first question.  I want to talk about ports on my second question shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#G00500","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I have no problem answering that.  The President of the Commission herself has taken full political responsibility for this, and I think that is where accountability lies.  Again, I am not running away from the question because I am as concerned as the Deputy.  However, I cannot answer for the Commission.  It is accountable to the European Parliament and the parliamentarians plan to question Commissioners, and maybe the President as well, and she has already addressed people.  I am not here to defend the Commission in any way but I cannot be accountable for it either.<\/p> <p>  All of us, when we see a decision of the European Commission, are entitled to assume that the Commission has decided to do this in accordance with its powers and the way it does business, and we are entitled to assume that the College of Commissioners, in general, is part of the decision-making.  As to the exact mechanics in this regard, the Commission will have to explain that, and we are in ongoing engagement with the Commission on that.  Obviously, with trade policy, the Commission has the competence and it makes decisions like this, I am told, on an extremely regular basis in terms of safeguarding measures.  Unfortunately, it appears to be the case that while the trade experts crossed every t and dotted every i, and made sure there was no possible theoretical escape route, somebody with a political sensibility in terms of the actual reality of the ground, and the lived lives of people in Northern Ireland, was not in the room making that decision.  That is fundamentally the problem here.<\/p> <p>  It is a decision that I certainly hope will not happen again but Deputy Howlin is right that we need to ensure it does not happen again.  As I said, we have ongoing engagement and that will need to continue.  I strongly encourage members of the committee in their engagement with the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, and with their counterparts not just to say that a mistake was made here but to state that it cannot happen again, because to do otherwise would be to state we are okay when, in fact, we are not okay because we see the ongoing consequences in Northern Ireland.  All of us here on this island, as Europeans, need to let our European colleagues know, in whatever capacity, what the consequences are to ensure more people know what the actual situation is on the ground in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, she has taken political responsibility and will have to be accountable to the European Parliament.  I know the Vice-President of the Commission has been invited before the committee and I sincerely hope he attends and answers its questions.

It says that 80% of vehicular traffic coming in is green-lighted, which means that one in five vehicles is stopped.  That is a very significant volume.  I acknowledge not all of that is within our remit, inasmuch as the preparedness of many of the British authorities and companies was not what it should have been.  However, we have a real problem in regard to that level of stoppages in a situation, first, where there are already derogations from some elements of the protocol for a period and, second, where the volumes were down to 50% in January.  There will be a chaotic build-up if 20% of vehicles are being stopped when it is at full volume.

That is just not possible.  The Single Market was built to avoid this type of bureaucracy, paperwork and checks.  Britain has left the Single Market and some checks are inevitably necessary.  There will always be some checks.  There were checks previously but they were not for customs.

There are undoubtedly issues with Revenue's computer system.  I understand that it has been rectified.  Traders bring these matters to my attention.  I am not in Revenue or a Minister for it, but in fairness to it, it responds to these issues, which arise regularly.  That caused difficulty and there are no two ways about it.

The stops involve paperwork.  Much of that paperwork can be rectified.  That will take some getting used to, with companies getting used to the new procedures and finding it difficult to get customs experts, which is why there is Government support.

In the days after this happened, people leapt at the opportunity.<\/p><p>Everybody makes mistakes but how one learns from them is the most important thing.  Moving on from Article 16, my next concern is twofold.  Does the Minister of State think that the British Government is now in danger of pushing this too far?  We see extra demands and a consistent underlining that it is now prepared to trigger Article 16.  If one looks at the albeit typical British newspapers, they are demanding a renegotiation less than six weeks since the trade deal was agreed.  A British minister on national radio this morning accused the EU of being unreasonable and changing its position.  I am very worried that less than six weeks in, people are damaging the house of cards.<\/p><p> My final question comes back to the protocol which the Minister of State referred to briefly in his intervention.  To what extent is engagement taking place between the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive in relation to the operation of the protocol?  Are there any opportunities that may be pushed up to Michael Gove and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi when they have meetings?

That is a point I have been making.  Many people said yes, put up their hands and said that a mistake was made and that it has been acknowledged.  Some people said we should move on but obviously we cannot move on when we see the particular situation on the ground in Northern Ireland.  As I said already, it is up to all of us, in whatever interactions we have with our interlocutors in Europe, to make sure the situation and the damage done is if fully appreciated by them.  The solution then is to have this early warning system which will presumably ensure that this could not possible happen again.  Nobody will want this to happen again but the important point it is to make sure that is does not happen again.  With colleagues, I am certainly making it very clear that damage was done and that is continues to be lasting.<\/p> <p>  There is on going contact between Britain and the European Union, in particular between the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and Michael Gove.  In Northern Ireland, there has been much engagement.  By the way, there has been a North-South Ministerial Council since this happened.  There is ongoing political engagement as well in relation to Northern Ireland.  We were getting many calls about Article 16 before all of this happened and, indeed, its invocation was suggested at very high levels in Britain in January.<\/p> <p>  The important point to remember is that the protocol is a legal agreement between Britain and the European Union and its function is basically to make the best possible job out of a bad job, which is Brexit, for the island of Ireland.  Even the attempted invocations of Article 16 a couple of weeks ago, did not eliminate the protocol.  It did damage but it provided for a very limited arrangement there.  That is what Article 16 is there for.  Anyone who is going to invoke Article 16 needs to realise doing so will not eliminate the protocol.  The protocol is there to avoid the hard border on the island, to make sure people and good can move freely, and that Northern Ireland remains part of the Single Market of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  There is very close contact with the British Government at all levels.  Late last year Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Michael Gove, in terms of their plan to implement the protocol, showed their good working relationship and that they are practical people who will get the job done.  They need to be given time to agree flexibilities that will help the protocol to work more effectively for all people of Northern Ireland.  It is not about Article 16.  It is not about getting rid of the protocol or replacing it.<\/p><p>The protocol is there and will remain, but it is about working to make sure it is as flexible as possible within its terms.  I am confident we can do that.  It will not make everybody happy but we do not have a winner takes all system in Northern Ireland.  It is a complicated system where we try to make the best possible arrangements to make sure that each community can benefit to the fullest extent from the arrangements entered into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#K00300","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions about the statement by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, that she takes full responsibility for what happened.

If one considers Article 16 and the seventh annex to the protocol, it is very clear it had no application.  As the Minister of State's statement says, it is a separate matter.  It had no application to an attempt to stop vaccine being exported through Ireland.  Is it the case that whoever made this decision did not read and did not understand the extent of the protocol?  If that is the case, we are left in a situation not merely in which damage was done but the operation of protocol is in the hands of people who do not understand it.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on that.<\/p><p>I appreciate the Irish Government's position is that negotiations on the protocol between the UK and the EU is a bilateral process.  It is not a multilateral process in which we step in or out.  However, it seems that since we have a very clear national interest in this matter, we should have a <i>de facto <\/i>presence in the process of negotiation between the vice-president with responsibility for trade and the UK Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, and their officials, so we can see for ourselves that what is being negotiated is reasonable and not damaging to us.<\/p><p>There should be transparency and that the Irish public and the European Parliament are entitled to know what happened.  There must be some mechanism so that people who are in charge of any process involving the Irish protocol understand when it cannot, legally, be deployed.  If the same people who invoked Article 16 are conducting the trade negotiations, Ireland needs the maximum transparency for the Irish Government, either with a <i>de facto<\/i>presence or some form of immediate consultation on the process of negotiations to make the movement of goods between the UK and Northern Ireland as transparent as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#L00200","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Senator McDowell raised important questions and some of them can be answered relatively straightforwardly.

That is absolutely ongoing.

I know the Minister said that we cannot really move on from it, but we will eventually.  We need to learn the lessons and to move on from it eventually perhaps by, as other speakers said, putting the early warning system in place.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions and a few thoughts.  Problems were always going to arise with the implementation of the protocol for business and consumers in Northern Ireland.  It is fair to say that many businesses in Northern Ireland were simply not prepared for Brexit.<\/p><p>Trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland has been disrupted.  Supermarkets in Northern Ireland have experienced shortages of time-sensitive goods, such as fresh produce and chilled meats.  Many sorts of horror stories are emerging concerning people not being able to bring their pets into Northern Ireland from Great Britain because of issues with vaccination etc.  It is clear in that context that practical and sensible modifications are needed regarding the operation of the protocol in Northern Ireland.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that such practical and sensible modifications can be made to sort out these types of problems?  Do such possibilities exist?  For example, is an extension of the grace period a possibility?<\/p><p> My second question concerns the Northern Ireland peace process, which we are all worried about.  The Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and unionists in general have always seen the creation of a border in the Irish Sea as some sort of step in the direction of Irish unity and the holding of a border poll.  Therefore, the sensitivities involved with this issue are clear to everybody.  The DUP has not had a good Brexit.  The party supported Brexit in the first place and then opposed the deal reached by the former British Prime Minister, Theresa May.  The members of that party are of course going to exaggerate the consequences of the Northern Ireland protocol for political purposes.  We saw the DUP put forward a five-point plan to have the protocol abolished, which of course is not going to happen.  The party is, however, calling on the UK Government to invoke Article 16 and to have the protocol abolished, if possible.<\/p><p> In respect of the threat to relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, I was interested to hear the Minister of State say that there has been a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  The DUP had threatened to cease co-operation with such bodies, and that would be a serious issue.  We all agree with the call to calm things down because of the sensitivities involved in this situation.  I take it that the Minister of State agrees that North-South relations are extremely important, but will he reassure me that things are being done to repair the damage done?  We are obviously not responsible for that damage, but we are seriously concerned about this deterioration in relations.  We must improve those relations and take positive steps to bring that improvement about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#M00400","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>The North-South meeting which took place was one of the formal structures on waterways.  The North-South bodies are limited anyway, and we would like for there to be more of them.  It is important, however, to note that meeting did happen.  I share fully the Deputy's concerns regarding North-South relations.  It is important to keep everything on an even keel in that respect.  This situation has clearly interrupted that endeavour.  There are many other threats to the peace process in Northern Ireland, but what has happened has shown us that if something in this vein occurs, then it can cause immediate harm.<\/p> <p>  When I said we cannot move on from this, my point was that at this particular moment we cannot accept people just putting their hands up and saying everything is now fine.  Clearly, it is not fine right now.  Deputy Haughey is correct, though, that we need to move forward.  People calling for the protocol to be abolished must realise that is not going to happen, and that is a fact.  The protocol is a legal agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union and it is not going to be abolished.  Ultimately, these problems have been caused by Brexit.  The protocol exists and is designed to alleviate the problems of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  Trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is about where it was previously.  It has not gone down.  Some of that is possibly a reflection of trade coming here, and there has definitely been some movement from Dublin to Belfast.  It may seem, therefore, that trade is down.<\/p><p>In actual numbers, however, it is not; it is at a similar level.  It is important to remember that there is a huge amount of trade getting through between Northern Ireland and Britain, as well a lot of people doing works.  Even after the threats last week, which were repulsive and are to be condemned, a great number of checks still were happening because much of this is done on a documentary basis.  There are issues, however, that are causing annoyance.  They can be dealt with within the structures of the protocol that might help the situation but that does not mean that the protocol is going to be changed.  The UK has set out some things it is asking for some of which reflect demands in the North, including businesses there.  Modest extensions of the existing grace periods would definitely help reassure the business sector and moderate voices and Northern society broadly that they are being listened to and that we genuinely want to make the protocol work for every section of the community in Northern Ireland.  That is important to all of us.  <\/p><p> It is not about winners and losers but about trying to make the best possible situation out of what is a very difficult scenario in Northern Ireland at present.  I am convinced that if we can get over the current difficulties, recognising that a great deal of trade is happening and that many goods can come in, we can solve some of the issues the Deputy raised.  I cannot give any commitments on them but I know some can be resolved.  Some cause particular anxiety, such as the issue concerning pets.  The Alliance Party proposed a veterinary agreement between the EU and Britain and that certainly is in the range of possibilities in the medium term.  It is not something that will provide immediate answers but it is something with which we would have no difficulties whatsoever.  We want to make this work and work for everybody.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#N00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I am in agreement with much of what others have said.  The big question in relation to the European Commission is how exactly it happened and in ensuring that it does not happen again.  Whatever meetings in which the Government will be involved will be absolutely necessary.  It is a case of finding out exactly what happened from the perspective of ensuring that there is no room for a move such as this again.  We have all seen its outworkings.  I agree with much of what others said that this is Brexit coming home to roost, unfortunately.  From a unionist perspective, supporting it was absolute madness.  It is the most destabilising thing they could have done from the point of view of the Union.  So be it, that is done.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Government's engagement on the need to retain the protocol.  While we all accept that modifications were necessary and will be carried out, whether it relates to grace periods etc., we need that to be sorted, North and South.  I welcome that the Government is taking on board issues brought to it by people involved in supply chain logistics and so on, as the Minister of State noted.  <\/p> <p>  What I think has happened is that unionist politicians have looked at their polling numbers,know they are under pressure and are using tried and tested methods from the 1880s nearly or from the 1980s.  If we accept that the Irish protocol and the withdrawal agreement are international agreements that are not going anywhere, it could be another case of leading people up the hill, which is not helpful.  Nor is it helpful when one hears about Michael Gove's ultimatum letter or hears Arlene Foster speak of how she has Boris Johnson on side from the point of view of introducing legislation that would negate elements of the Irish protocol, as well as the fact that he might simply invoke Article 16.  I have no doubt that the Government has engaged with the British Government on this issue.  I would like to think the engagement is robust.  I seek an update from the Minister of State on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#O00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>There is a hugely changed political situation in Northern Ireland, and we see from opinion polling that it is changing all the time.  There are many nuances of opinion; it is not one side versus the other.  I think we can all agree now that there are significant nuances and a broad range of the public there who want to live decent lives, have prosperity and be able to move around the place.  The Irish Government will try to ensure the best opportunity for the North.  When these issues are solved, and work is ongoing to solve them, Northern Ireland will have a huge opportunity to be part of the Single Market of the European Union.  If one's perspective is on the unionist side, Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of Britain as well.  There are therefore huge opportunities there for the economy, and it is up to all of us, but particularly leaders in Northern Ireland, to help drive that forward and to make sure those opportunities are seized.<\/p> <p>  I cannot get into what questions officials or others have asked many times.  The Commission as a body signed off on the measure which included Article 16 and political responsibility rests with the Commission.  Ursula von der Leyen has accepted that and there will be accountability to the European Parliament.  I accept that there is a point in trying to find out who did what to make sure that we have the right people there, that this cannot happen again and that somebody knows about the situation.  When I think of our system, however, which is slightly analogous, if a government were to make such a mistake, that government and its Ministers, not individual officials, would be accountable to the D&aacute;il.  The reality is that this was drawn up.  Commissioners, who are in regular contact with their counterparts here and indeed with the British Government, did not see fit to take out this provision or to say to themselves, as I did and, as I am sure, all committee members did when we first saw this on social media at about 4.30 p.m. that Friday, \"What the - ?\" I could not believe it.  I would like to think Commissioners would think in that same political way that this is something that just should not have happened.  That did not happen and, ultimately, there has to be political responsibility.  I know the European Parliament will do its job in that regard, but the lessons are very important too.<\/p> <p>  I will repeat this.  The protocol is there.  It will not go away.  Nobody has the possibility to remove it.  There is no possibility of negating elements of the protocol either.  There is the possibility of all of us working together to make sure it works in the most flexible way possible, consistent with everybody's demands that there be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  This is really important for the economies north and south of the Border, and we cannot lose sight of this when we talk about checks and customs.  It is really important that Ireland protects its place in the Single Market and that no questions are asked about that.  It is absolutely central and essential to our economic policy and our economic growth into the future.  That is very important, and I think everybody recognises that, but sometimes when we talk about difficulties and inconveniences we can perhaps put to one side the fact that the Single Market is so important and so central to us.  The invocation of Article 16 has already happened, almost, and we see the fallout from that, so I think it is very unlikely that that will happen again.  The point is that nobody can invoke Article 16 to eliminate the protocol or to change its terms.  The protocol remains and always will remain, and there are ways of making sure we all work together to work it as effectively and efficiently as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#P00100","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Due to the efficiency of the Minister of State in his answering, we can facilitate a second round of questions, but does Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; wish to come in with a supplementary question before I open the meeting up to the floor again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#P00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Yes.

For us to have confidence in the Commission into the future, it is imperative that we find out who made this decision of such magnitude because it had consequences.  For every action there is a reaction.  We only have to think of the time, effort and diligence invested in this by officials in the Commission such as Michel Barnier and his team and the individual countries throughout the European Union which knew of the sensitivity of the Northern Ireland peace process and went out of their way to send ambassadors here.

However, this decision, which was made very quickly by a group of individuals on a Friday evening, had drastic consequences that could have had a deeper impact on Northern Ireland.  It was a very serious decision.  It is very important that we as a nation have confidence in the European Union and have a Commission that is accountable.  It cannot be a powerful entity where individuals can be protected.  The message in that regard is strong.  The Minister of State need not address that again as he covered it to the best of his knowledge.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State may not have an answer to this specific question.  What assurances can he give that the protocols around strict veterinary distribution practices employed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are replicated in Northern Ireland?  I have a concern that protocols similar to the very strict regime we have in place, through the Department, for ensuring traceability and quality of produce are not replicated in Northern Ireland.  The Minister of State might ask his officials to follow up on that and revert directly to my officials in this committee.<\/p> <p>  I thank members.<\/p><p>Ba mhaith liom m'aitheantas agus mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il chuig an Aire St&aacute;it f&aacute; choinne na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta inniu.

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Kieran Harkin and Dr. Aisling McMahon who represent Access to Medicines Ireland, and Ms Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS.  We will be joined later in the meeting by Dr. David Nabarro, the special envoy on Covid-19 for the World Health Organization, WHO.  They are welcome to our engagement.<\/p> <p>  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as in any way damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that compliance with any direction be observed.  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations in respect of parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  In this regard, witnesses who are participating in this committee meeting from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised also that they should be especially mindful of the domestic law in the jurisdiction from which they speak and how it may apply to the evidence that may be given.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded, and I thank the witnesses for their forbearance, of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable.

We would like to explain why we believe that Ireland should formally endorse the World Health Organization's, WHO's, Covid-19 technology access pool, C-TAP, without delay.  I am a GP based in Dublin.  I am joined by Dr. Aisling McMahon, an assistant professor of law at Maynooth University with a special interest in patent and health law.  Access to Medicines Ireland is a membership group, an organisation of relevant workers.  We are honoured to be joined by Ms Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS, UNAIDS, and a leading advocate of the People's Vaccine Alliance.<br\/><br\/>To date, more than 3,600 people have died from Covid-19 in Ireland, and more than 2.3 million people have died globally.  The global economic cost of Covid-19 has been estimated at $3.4 trillion per year.  Furthermore, Oxfam has calculated that the economic impact of the virus could push 500 million people into poverty and nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost, according to UN estimates.  While the arrival of effective vaccines has brought an expectation that the pandemic can be brought under control, that is threatened by an inadequate supply of vaccines.  Most lower income countries are not expected to be vaccinated until 2023 or later.  Vaccine scarcity and slow roll-out will ensure a prolongation of the pandemic as outbreaks re-emerge due to travel between and within countries.  Even more worrying is the risk that variants of the virus will emerge, which will be more infectious, more dangerous and resistant to current vaccines, as we have seen in South Africa in recent days.<br\/><br\/>Ongoing research into identifying and addressing these problems before they arise is essential.  For these reasons, efficient mechanisms for scientists to collaborate and accelerate research and to achieve faster global roll-out of effective vaccines is essential.  The reality is that the current vaccine scarcity is artificial and can be resolved by increasing production capacity globally.  However, to do so, companies must share their know-how and intellectual property rights to expedite research and enable others to produce vaccines.  Given the extent of the extraordinary health crisis and a significant public investment that has supported the creation of many Covid-19 vaccines, this is not an unreasonable expectation.  As Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe have got to get it together as a society.  Social justice is only a dream if we don't put health justice at the centre ... <\/blockquote> <p>Rapid, equitable, global access to vaccines must be a key priority and to achieve this, we urge the Government to endorse the WHO's C-TAP.  I will hand over to Dr. McMahon who will detail this model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran Harkin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>In May 2020, the WHO initiated the solidarity call to action, launching its support for the C-TAP and urging key actors, including governments, to take action.  Put simply, the C-TAP is a platform to facilitate the sharing of intellectual property rights, data, know-how and cell lines related to Covid-19 technologies, including vaccines.<\/p><p>Its end goal is to increase equitable access.  The C-TAP model is needed because production capacity for vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for Covid can be increased globally but, in order to do this, more companies must license and share intellectual property rights, know-how and technologies to enable others to produce them.  The C-TAP sets up a mechanism to facilitate this.  It is a voluntary model that is subject to the agreement of such companies.  Participation, depending on the context, could include compensation in the form of royalties where appropriate.<br\/><br\/>Countries must learn from the past.  The use of intellectual property rights in a manner which hindered access to medicines has had devastating impacts previously, particularly in the HIV-AIDS crisis, with many millions of lives lost as a result.  We must ensure that in this health crisis, that does not happen again.  In short, supporting the C-TAP provides a way to achieve global equitable access to vaccines.  It would maximise the manufacturing capacity globally by enabling more companies to make vaccines.  It would accelerate the development of new technologies by encouraging the sharing of data and know-how, thereby increasing transparency.  It would facilitate more accessible access.  The C-TAP works in collaboration with the existing UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool, which has extensive experience in pooling intellectual property rights for public health.  Furthermore, support for the C-TAP aligns with the European Commission's recently published intellectual property strategy and the Word Health Assembly's Covid-19 response resolution, both of which encourage voluntary pooling and licensing of intellectual property for Covid-19.  Addressing vaccine inequality in this way also gives us a better opportunity to ensure that the core values and intentions of Irish Aid's policy, A Better World, are put into practice, reaching the furthest behind first and leaving no one behind, which is Ireland's approach to realising the UN sustainable development goals.  It is fully consistent with Ireland's foreign policy goals of openness, global solidarity and a commitment to multilateralism.<br\/><br\/>The C-TAP is also vital if COVAX, the vaccine pillar of the WHO's Access to Covid-19 Tools, ACT, Accelerator is to be a success.  C-TAP and COVAX are complementary to each other.  On 5 February, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus of the WHO, in discussing COVAX's first interim vaccine distribution forecast, cautioned that:<\/p><blockquote>\tCountries are ready to go but the vaccines aren't there...  We encourage all manufacturers to share their data and technology to ensure global equitable access to vaccines. <\/blockquote><p>However, it must be emphasised that the C-TAP will only be a success if more Governments and companies support it.  On the other hand, if voluntary mechanisms like the C-TAP do not achieve sufficient support, then mandatory measures for suspending intellectual property rights under the WTO Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver proposal will be needed, and should be supported, to encourage and achieve change.<br\/><br\/>Access to Medicines Ireland is joined by ActionAid Ireland, the Irish Global Health Network, the INMO, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res Ireland and Oxfam Ireland in calling on the Government to support the C-TAP.  To date, 40 countries worldwide, including five European countries, have endorsed it.  Furthermore, last September, the President, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, indicated his support for the WHO's global solidarity call to action in his speech at the UN General Assembly.  Most recently, on 3 February, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that rich countries had a moral responsibility to help countries unable to access vaccines.  This could include supplementing their own ability to produce vaccines with co-operation from the pharmaceutical companies regarding relaxation of some of the patent situations.<br\/><br\/>The bottom line is that we have got to get the entire world vaccinated.  Global multilateral action is needed and Ireland can and should be a leading voice in this regard.  Access to Medicines Ireland encourages the Government to endorse formally the global solidarity call to action and the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool as soon as possible and to take action at an EU level to encourage greater support for the C-TAP.  Alongside this, we urge the Government to increase financial support for the WHO's ACT Accelerator.

My name is Winnie Byanyima.  I lead the United Nations joint programme on HIV-AIDS.  It is called UNAIDS.  I am grateful for this opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the critical issue of Covid vaccine equity.  I am also happy to let the committee know that I am the proud daughter of Irish missionary sisters of St. Francis.<\/p> <p>  In the early years of the AIDS response, millions of lives, as Dr. McMahon said, were needlessly lost because life-saving treatment remained out of reach for people in poor countries as people in rich countries benefited from antiretroviral treatment and went on to live long, healthy lives.  In poor countries 9 million people died waiting for the prices to come down.  It was a deeply painful lesson that many of us know very personally and one that the world, it seems, is having to learn again.<\/p> <p>  Ten months ago world leaders declared that any Covid-19 vaccine would be a global public good, a people's vaccine, but we now face a situation that the South African Government has called a new global apartheid.  Nine in ten people in the poorest countries are set to go without a vaccine this year.  A small group of rich countries representing just 14% of the global population have bought up most of the supply of the Covid vaccines that are available until the end of 2021.  I am sure the committee is as shocked as I am that pharma companies are charging developing countries more than they are charging rich countries, in some cases more than double.  My country, Uganda, will pay $7 per dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and South Africa will pay just over $5 whereas the European Union will pay just over $2 per dose.<\/p> <p>  The problem is not only one of money or unfair allocation; it is also that not enough vaccines are being made.  Even rich countries face challenges over production quantities in this year.  What the European Union is experiencing now is deeply troubling, and we empathise.  It is a taste of what Africa, Asia and Latin America have been experiencing.  This is why approaching vaccination as a competitive race between countries and regions means that everyone loses out.  What Europe thought was defending Europe was really defending the profits of the owners of big pharmaceutical companies.  The vital decisions of production, supply and price and, therefore, who gets the vaccine and when have been left in the hands of big pharmaceutical companies.  How is that right?  Our best chance of all staying safe from Covid-19 is to have vaccines, tests and treatment available for all, for the whole world.  As the Irish President, Michael Higgins, noted when he and I spoke on the same platform at the UN last year, \"Unless such medical tools are fully accessible to all on an equitable basis, the world remains at risk.\"  Right now, however, big pharma is protecting its monopolies, technology and intellectual property and thus restricting production.  We know how to solve this problem: it is to open up production.<\/p><p>Maximising global production can happen only if all companies that can produce vaccines have access to the vaccine technology, know-how and intellectual property.  Pharma companies will not share unless pressed to do so.  Governments have that leverage and there is a mechanism to enable the sharing that Dr. McMahon described, namely, the WHO's C-TAP.  It is a one-stop-shop for pooling all data, know-how, biological material and intellectual property and then licensing production and technology transfer to other potential producers.  So far, pharma companies have not joined C-TAP and the proposal presented by the Governments of South Africa and India at the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, council for a temporary waiver of certain TRIPS obligations has been blocked by the rich countries that host the pharma companies with a vaccine.<\/p><p> This is not only about access for the poor.  The longer the virus is left to ravage developing countries, the longer people in rich countries will remain at risk.  The virus is mutating, as Dr. Harkin stated.  This threatens the efficacy of vaccines, as we have seen with the so-called South African variant.  Yesterday, the South African Government had to postpone its roll-out of the AstraZeneca vaccine because, having bought millions of doses, it realised that the vaccine did not have efficacy against the variant.  The slow pace of vaccination everywhere means that we risk seeing more dangerous variants developing.  As Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO, a wonderful Irishman, often remarks, no one is safe until everyone is safe.<\/p><p> The economic cost is also great.  New research from the International Chamber of Commerce predicts that delays to vaccine access in poorer countries will cost the global economy an estimated $9 trillion, with nearly half of that being the cost to wealthy countries.  These vaccines were developed with public money and these companies depend on government support.  Whenever we raise the question of leverage over companies, though, we are told by rich countries' governments that there is COVAX.  While support for COVAX is welcome, it cannot solve the supply problem on its own.  Indeed, COVAX can only complement C-TAP.<\/p><p> We need to ensure that constraints on licensing and know-how no longer obstruct mass production of Covid vaccines.  We must make companies take part in C-TAP.  It is their governments that can make that happen.  We also need to speed up agreement on a waiver at the WTO, especially if C-TAP does not work.  I hope that the Irish Government will consider joining C-TAP.  I join Dr. Harkin and Dr. McMahon in urging the committee's parliamentarians to ask their Government to do so.<\/p><p> Like AIDS, Covid is revealing the underlying fissures of inequality, how they hurt all of us and how outdated rules and approaches obstruct us from overcoming them.  Fixing them is a policy choice.  It is a moral, public health and economic imperative to ensure that everyone gets vaccinated in 2021 and that no one is left behind.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Winnie Byanyima","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Byanyima for her presentation and for agreeing to stay with us for our questions and answers session.

As we face into the ongoing commitment for global solidarity and social justice, the contributions are very timely.  Unfortunately, the big pharmaceutical companies continue to profiteer on the backs of people throughout the world.  I believe one of the witnesses said countries are ready to go but the vaccines are not there.  That is the call from throughout the world.  It is very clear that the pandemic can only be ended by protecting all nations.  It is interesting to hear the comment that no one is safe until everyone is safe.  That is the only way we will get on top of this global emergency.  No pharmaceutical company should profit from the pandemic.  We need to ensure widespread availability across all nations.  It is shocking that nearly 70 countries will only be able to vaccinate approximately 10% of their populations next year.<\/p> <p>  Another shocking figure that was given related to the cost of one of the vaccines.  The term \"morally corrupt\" springs to mind when some countries are being charged &euro;7 per vaccine.  South Africa is being charged &euro;5, but some of the better off countries in Europe are only being charged &euro;2 per vaccine.  That clearly shows everything that is wrong with the roll-out of the vaccines.  <\/p> <p>  Wealthy countries will have enough vaccine to protect all their citizens three times over in 2021 and yet some of the poorer underdeveloped countries are struggling to vaccinate their citizens.  Lessons need to be learned from the AIDS crisis.  I believe 9 million people in African countries alone died of AIDS while they were screaming out for access to the medication to help with AIDS.  <\/p> <p>  I believe five European countries, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal and the Netherlands, have signed up to support the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, CTAP, along with 40 countries globally and a list of organisations that were mentioned earlier.  Several Irish experts, including Professor Luke O'Neill, Dr. Sam McConkey and many others, support it.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the programme.<\/p> <p>  We also support another initiative and I might ask for views on this.  I refer to the Right to Cure initiative, a European citizens' initiative that was launched last year, which proposes to put public health before private profit, and to make anti-pandemic vaccines and treatments a global public good, freely accessible to everyone.  As we need 1 million signatures to move that initiative forward, I appeal to anyone who is listening to sign up to support it.  There is significant crossover in the objectives of CTAP and that particular initiative to ensure intellectual property rights and patents do not hamper the accessibility or availability of any future Covid-19 vaccine or treatment, and to ensure that EU legislation on data and market exclusivity does not limit the immediate effectiveness of compulsory licences issued by members.<\/p><p>There are a number of other points there as well.  Is this something our witnesses also support?  I have a question relating to the failure of countries to support C-TAP and the dire consequences of that.  Do we have expectations or analysis of what the impact will be?  We see some of the financial impacts, which are shocking, and how it will affect some poorer countries.  When we speak about people and individuals, how will the failure to introduce C-TAP affect them?  <\/p><p> It is unbelievable that the Irish Government has not signed up to support this.  What engagement, if any, has taken place between Access to Medicines Ireland and the Government?  What do the witnesses feel as organisations, doctors and people about this issue?  What are the largest obstacles blocking C-TAP?  Are there particular interest groups such as shareholders?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#F00100","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>There are a number of questions from Deputy Brady that he has not directed at any one individual but perhaps I might get a brief response from Dr. Harkin, Dr. McMahon and Ms Byanyima.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#G00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to hear the endorsements from Deputy Brady.  We have been disappointed in some sense that no more than four EU countries have supported it to date.  There will probably be much greater interest now that the US Administration has been led and encouraged by Dr. Fauci to take an interest in it and move in the direction of supporting C-TAP.  While the UK Government has not formally endorsed C-TAP, it has certainly made a number statements suggesting that it agrees with the principles underlying it and in reality, is not too far away from supporting it.  Every day, it is becoming more and more clear that the current system is failing and that we cannot rely on the pharmaceutical industry to guide us through this pandemic as its eye is clearly directed towards its shareholders rather than public health.

In terms of the Deputy's question about the failure to support C-TAP, we are seeing the consequences of it since the vaccines have been approved, particularly since they have started to be rolled out.  It is fantastic that we have these vaccines but, unfortunately, we do not have enough of them.  That is becoming more and more clear for Ireland and other European countries and all over the world.  C-TAP would facilitate the manufacturing of vaccines and the ability to make more.  There is an artificial scarcity because the rights holders are simply not sharing intellectual property data and know-how.  Know-how, data and intellectual property are needed to make these vaccines.  Rights holders could be willing to come on board, take the opportunity to share and realise that we are in an extraordinary crisis and pandemic and need to bring it under control and that the only way to do that is increase the production of these vaccines.  C-TAP is a direct avenue that would facilitate that.  We support the COVAC scheme but, unfortunately, the target is that they would have enough vaccines for 20% of populations, which is nowhere near the figure we would need to achieve herd immunity or a population-wide spread of vaccination.  The consequences of not supporting C-TAP are that we will at best achieve 20% and that is assuming we even have a supply to achieve that.  C-TAP can deliver more vaccines for the likes of COVAC and facilitate that so it is important to stress that C-TAP would provide a mechanism to deliver more vaccines if it was supported but it needs support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling McMahon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>We have a situation where the rules that regulate business and trade, which have been in place for the past 30 years or so, have had an impact on our minds to the extent that we think that the right to profit is equal to the right to health and the right to life.

It is because shareholders in this modern world of trade have become so important in businesses that their voice is more important than that of workers, communities and ordinary people.  We had a form of trade and business 30 years ago that allowed profits to be ploughed back into workers' wages, research and community development.  Shareholders took only 10% of profits in the UK, for example, but today, shareholders take 70% of total profits.  The voice of shareholders is so dominant in the politics of our countries.  Their voice is heard before the voice of ordinary people, including consumers and workers and that is part of the problem.<\/p> <p>  We would like to see countries that do not host the pharmaceutical companies that produce the vaccines joining C-TAP because they do not have anything to lose.  We salute Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Norway for supporting C-TAP, as well as many other developing countries.  Of course, countries like Germany, the USA and the UK oppose C-TAP because the pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders have a powerful voice in those countries.  We would like the countries that do not have a stake in the companies producing the vaccines to come together and insist on fairer rules that allow sharing of the technology.  We urge them to back the WTO waiver that is being requested at the TRIPS Council or to join C-TAP.  These are two avenues that will assist in maximising vaccine production for the world.  The interests of big companies and their shareholders are blocking progress towards justice and equity in access to vaccines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Winnie Byanyima"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>We are joined by Dr. Nabarro from the WHO, who is welcome.

Approximately 40 countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Norway in Europe, have supported the WHO's solidarity call to action and C-TAP.  Can our guests give us any insights into why other countries have not done so?  I also note what Dr. McMahon said earlier about the fact that we are very fortunate in now having a number of vaccines that seem to be effective.  When the virus emerged initially, there was concern that it might take a very long time to develop vaccines to combat it.<\/p><p>Thankfully, this has happened very quickly within a year.  We are all concerned about the possibility, and the fact, that the virus is mutating and is changing and has the potential to change into something even more deadly.  I note Dr. Nabarro is also online and I welcome him.  Perhaps when he speaks he might comment on questions such as access to non-government controlled areas of Syria.  There is no guaranteed channel for vaccines for people in this area.  There are other areas of conflict in the world such as Tigray, Mozambique, Libya and Rohingya in Bangladesh, and places with many refugees in Uganda and Lebanon.  Will our guests comment on the possibility of these people getting vaccinated?  I am also interested in hearing the views of our guests on whether these areas could become centres for more changes to the virus, leading to deadlier strains, if the people in them are not vaccinated.<\/p><p> It is also quite interesting to note the Government here has not said \"No\" to joining the call for action, but if some of the recent responses from the Minister are to be considered, is examining the situation fairly strongly.  I hope we will be in a position to do so before too long.  This time last year, this issue was just starting so things have moved very quickly.<\/p><p> The AIDS epidemic was absolutely catastrophic.  I take on board in particular what has been said by the director of UNAIDS.  This pandemic is even more deadly because it is even more transferable and has the potential to really and truly cause devastation throughout the world.  The Government here should sign the solidarity call to action as soon as possible.  I note a number of other European countries have done so.<\/p><p> Throughout the world, is there a lot more capacity to produce the vaccines to the standard required?

My Green Party colleague has written to the Department of Foreign Affairs, which provides the lion's share of Ireland's overseas development assistance, to request that Ireland uses its seat on the UN Security Council to advocate on behalf of the countries worst affected and least capable of overcoming the pandemic.  In addition, Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has written to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, inquiring as to whether he will support C-TAP.  Our party believes further avenues of international co-operation and assistance in addition to COVAX should be explored and leveraged to maximise equitable access and distribution of vaccines in developing countries now and in the longer term.<\/p> <p>  With respect to international efforts, the fast response of Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO in initiating and leading of the work of COVAX should be applauded.  It is an important demonstration of collaboration and solidarity to support vulnerable developing countries as they work to overcome Covid-19.  It is important that Ireland supports this initiative to the greatest extent possible through funding and our knowledge and experience of public health emergencies.  It is also welcome to see the aim of the COVAX initiative is to protect at least 20% of each participating population by the end of the year.  Given the task at hand, this is no small feat but the efforts of COVAX will not be sufficient to fully address the challenge and its various aspects.<\/p><p>Some issues and questions that come to mind are technical, operational and political.  Could the witnesses address whether health services will be sufficiently staffed and trained to administer vaccines in a timely manner and how we can ensure the safety of access in countries that are politically fragile?

I will start by answering some of the questions raised.  On Deputy Stanton's question on why other countries have not joined the CTAP initiatives, 40 countries worldwide have done so, as was noted, including five European countries.  In terms of why others have not, that is the question we are also asking.  In our minds, CTAP will facilitate more access to vaccines.  I can only speculate as to why countries have not signed up so far.  I wonder if perhaps it is only now that as vaccines have thankfully come on board, we are seeing gaps in terms of access, supply chain issues and that do not have as many vaccines as we initially thought we would.  Now would be an opportune time for people to reflect on that and countries to put themselves behind some of the initiatives such as CTAP which will, if it is supported, facilitate more people being able to make these vaccines.<\/p> <p>  Another important point was raised, which relates to the Chairman's point on the new variants that are arising.  It is a worrying time.  Others are more qualified to speak on those points and I am sure we will hear from Dr. Nabarro later on this.  In terms of the intellectual property perspective, one of the obstacles to having access to vaccines is intellectual property, data and the sharing of know-how, in particular.  This also relates to the point on the safety of the production of vaccines.  We need companies to share their know-how to facilitate and enable others to produce vaccines of the same quality standard.  CTAP would facilitate that.  If we had more vaccines, we could deliver more vaccines.  That would mean more people could be vaccinated and, it is to be hoped, reduce the number of new variants emerging.  I will not speak on that.  I am sure others can speak later on it.<\/p> <p>  On whether there is excess capacity in the system, we have looked at some of the research produced by other groups such as Knowledge Ecology International, KEI.  It suggested that there is untapped potential.  We know there are various different pharmaceutical companies, including in Ireland, who could facilitate and help with the production of vaccines.  In recent times, some pharmaceutical companies have entered into voluntary licensing deals where they have agreed to help in the production of vaccines.  For example, as far as I am aware, Pfizer and BioNTech recently reached an agreement with Sanofi to help to increase its production.  We are calling for more of this. <\/p> <p>  Reference was made to shareholders.  The traditional shareholder model involves a focus on profit.  Some of the work we are now doing suggests that a small group of shareholders see themselves as stewards of resources.  Actions are being taken in other countries, such as the US, where there have been shareholder motions, in particular in a pandemic context, to state that profits should not be the main priority and instead other goals such as delivering global equitable access should be prioritised.<\/p><p>We must consider who the shareholders are, which in some cases are pension fund or investment companies.  There is potential for the public to leverage their voices by saying that in this pandemic we must see a change and the sharing of intellectual property and data to facilitate this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I will reply to some of the questions that were raised.  There was a question about refugees and internally displaced people, whether they will be catered for, and if not, whether the communities of refugees and internally displaced people could turn out hosting new and dangerous variants of the virus.  This is the case but there are some good practices.  For example, in Jordan, one in every four people is a refugee.  It is rolling out its vaccination programme to include refugees and it has the support of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  We also heard from the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies last week, which launched a plan to help vaccinate 500 million people globally.  There is a need to pay attention to those people with weak citizenship rights and have them vaccinated.<\/p> <p>  We have looked carefully at the question of capacity in the People's Vaccine Alliance, estimating that the three biggest vaccine producers - Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford AstraZeneca - are producing enough vaccines for only 1.5% of the global population, which tells us how small is the supply.  We are looking at how much capacity is being used by the other big vaccine producers.  When we started probing, we saw some of the production companies moving very fast to try to conclude agreements with some of the major vaccine producers in Europe and America to license them.  They have really been holding on to their technology and know-how to first try to scoop as much profit as possible before they license others.  That is why we need the pressure.<\/p> <p>  The capacity is there and we will estimate those figures.  This capacity is not only in Europe and North America.; there is also capacity in the emerging economies.  There is huge capacity in India, with some companies licensed to produce the AstraZeneca vaccine, for example.  There are other Indian producers with capacity that is sitting there.  There is also capacity in Indonesia, China, Russia and so on.  There is capacity and we will estimate those figures but we must put pressure on those companies.<\/p> <p>  I also wanted to speak to the question of the pandemic being really more devastating than HIV\/AIDS.  I agree.  In developing countries like ours in Africa, the economic devastation is worse than the health devastation.  For some reason our people have not had as many deaths or even infections as in Europe.  Perhaps it is because the populations are younger or we have suffered many infectious diseases previously but nobody knows yet.  Infection rates are lower and deaths are fewer.  Nevertheless, the economies had to be closed completely so the economic devastation is huge.  People have lost jobs and their income so they have nothing to eat.  It is devastating.  The need to recover is global and this pandemic is more damaging than HIV.  Every life is important.<\/p> <p>  Many countries and governments support CTAP, but they have not yet signed up to the Costa Rica resolution.<\/p><p>I think that has to do with some fear of the pharmaceutical companies because this is now about survival of the fittest and booking supplies with a few companies.  I suspect that some governments did not show up to sign up to the common technology access pool because that would be seen as perhaps \"anti\" the pharmaceutical companies.  I suspect one is seen as in conflict with the other.  While some governments have signed on to the People's Vaccine Alliance and the People's Vaccine Alliance is demanding support for C-TAP, the same governments have not signed up to C-TAP or the Costa Rica resolution.  That tells us they will sign onto the People's Vaccine Alliance, which is campaigning for C-TAP, but they will not go to the WHO pool.  Something there suggests that one is in conflict with the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Winnie Byanyima","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I am going to move on to our fourth guest.

There is a requirement as we go into the evidence process for me to state that, although this is a formal meeting of the committee, my representation of the WHO has to be seen as informal.  It cannot be, we respectfully suggest, an alternative to the formal governance process of the WHO through the UN World Health Assembly or other similar mechanisms.<\/p> <p>  I wish to start by acknowledging the incredible work being done by Dr. Kieran Harkin, Dr. Aisling McMahon and Ms Winnie Byanyima.  I may have got the order wrong but that was the order I was given.  What the committee has been hearing this morning is really important.  I was proud to be able to join and hear Dr. McMahon and Ms Winnie Byanyima talking and explaining their points of view, and I am pleased indeed to be here.<\/p> <p>  I want to talk about three things.  The first is Covid-19 and the pandemic.  The second is the way in which efforts are being made to improve access to vaccine through something called COVAX, which the contributors have been describing.  The third thing I want to talk about is improving access to technologies through initiatives like the People's Vaccine initiative and C-TAP.<\/p> <p>  We will start with the pandemic.  I imagine everyone in Ireland knows but perhaps I will say it again.  This pandemic is nowhere near finished.  This is nowhere near the end.  Some people say there is light at the end of the tunnel but from my point of view, I am not sure how far away that light is.  I have no idea how long it will take to reach the end of the tunnel.  I am prepared to say to committee members that I believe there are some really difficult and rocky periods ahead of the world to get through it.<\/p> <p>  This is a new virus that has appeared and entered into the human ecosystem, just as HIV did some decades ago.  The world needs to adapt to a new virus.  That adaptation process takes time, especially given that the virus will change.  Humanity's response to the virus will change as well.  The adaptation will be continuous.  Right now, we are in a phase where the incidence of reported new cases of Covid-19 in Europe has gone into a decline.<\/p><p>This is in particular since the beginning of January and is super-welcome news.  It has gone into decline because of the extraordinary effort by the people of Europe and, increasingly, the people of North America to take this virus seriously by maintaining physical distancing, wearing face protection, practising incredible hygiene, self-isolating when ill and protecting the most vulnerable.  These are the tried-and-tested measures through which people can reduce their risk.  That has to be accompanied with well functioning public health systems that can detect people with the disease, enable them to isolate in a decent way, trace their contacts and enable those contacts to isolate and, when necessary, deal rapidly and robustly with outbreaks that occur.<\/p><p> These are big shifts happening in humanity.  We are all working out how to come to terms with it.  We have had various moments when we have been able to learn: the first acceleration in March and April of last year; the second acceleration at the end of the summer months of last year; and the dramatic third acceleration towards the end of last year and over the new year period.  We have been learning such a great deal, perhaps most importantly that the virus is the adversary and people are the solution.  There is a requirement to enable people to be strong, connected and empowered to fight the virus despite the fact that this entails massive social and economic dislocation.  It hits poor people the worst and it often hits people who have different ethnicity from the dominant ethnicity in western European countries the worst.  Dealing with Covid in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe means empowering people to respond and enabling those most affected, particularly the poorest and those with least access to resources, to be strong.<\/p><p> Having said that, there are ways in which it is possible to help people.  The ways to help include all those I have mentioned and now we can add vaccines.  Who should be receiving vaccines now?  In our view, it is clear that it should be the people who are at risk: older people and people with simultaneous illnesses; and those who are most exposed to the virus, namely, people dealing with Covid in their professional work all the time, particularly in healthcare, residential care, dentistry or other professions where one is in contact with the exhalations of people with the virus.  If the vaccine is helpful in protecting people, there is one priority for the world, as stated clearly by the Director-General of the WHO and the Secretary-General of the UN.  That priority is to make sure everybody in need of the vaccine can access it on the basis of need first, not on the basis of geographical location or nationality.  Right now, the people who must be a priority for any vaccine are health workers, older people and people with concomitant illness, wherever they live.<\/p><p> That is why at the request of the different member states of the WHO, the COVAX scheme was set up as part of the access to Covid-19 tools, ACT, accelerator.  COVAX is a scheme to enable the pooled purchase of vaccines at a negotiated price, ideally a low price.  The vaccines can then be made available to countries to purchase with their own funds or, if their GDP is low, to purchase with aid funds.  It is an advance purchase scheme like what we have used for other vaccines around the world to enable everybody to get the lowest possible price.  By negotiating with the producers, we are able through COVAX to get the price low.  In order for that to work, there has to be vaccine in the system and there is not enough for COVAX to work right now.<\/p><p>Anybody who criticises COVAX needs to be clear about what he or she is criticising.  Is it that it does not have enough vaccine coming through or is it because it has design flaws?  At the moment, the people who run COVAX tell me they want more vaccine in, which means, first, expediting the regulatory approval of existing vaccines that are currently on the edge of COVAX but not in it because COVAX can distribute only vaccines that have an emergency use licence from the WHO advisory committee on vaccination.  Second, we have to get some of the new vaccines properly into the COVAX portfolio, that is, the ones that use messenger RNA.  These are very exciting vaccines.  At the moment, they have to be kept super cold, which makes them a real challenge to use, but the technology will improve and we have to get them in.<\/p><p> Third, countries that have purchased their own vaccine through bilateral deals and have some to spare should give it to COVAX immediately.  It should become a movement everywhere that whenever there is some spare, it is given over.  The key question is what is spare.  My colleagues and I are asking whether, given the current availability of vaccines, any country should be planning to vaccinate all its adults against Covid or whether they should carry out vaccination of the at-risk groups and then share the rest with COVAX so that it can go to other countries where it is needed.  Moreover, COVAX needs to take on new products and new vaccine production needs to come in.<\/p><p> Another key question is what is the hold-up.  What could allow there to be more vaccines?  I certainly agree that the resolution produced by Costa Rica before last year's World Health Assembly, which led to the C-TAP proposal and the associated medicines patent pool being set up, is very important.  It is a mechanism that has worked for voluntary licensing for vaccines and treatments for other products, and it is surely the right way to go in the long term.  In the meantime, let us try at least to get existing schemes working as effectively as possible while, at the same time, exploring possibilities for upgrading the C-TAP system.  To get vaccines moving now, we need not only more vaccines coming in but also to scale up the potential of different manufacturers working to the full.  When that happens, each scale-up has to be individually licensed by the WHO system.  That is absolutely essential for quality assurance, safety and efficacy.  Let us ensure that all the approval processes happen quickly.<\/p><p> It will not be possible to get vaccines into the arms of people everywhere without an enormous global support programme for vaccine administration throughout the world.  Without that, we might end in the embarrassing scenario of vaccines becoming available more and more, particularly during 2021, with the inability to implement them.  For polio, we have had to have a global immunisation programme, while for measles and other childhood illnesses, there are strong global programmes.  There will need to be the global support of countries so that they can implement the vaccines.<\/p><p> Some of that is available through COVAX but, frankly, I know from experience that the world will have to get behind poorer countries to help them carry out their immunisation programmes.  That is where we will need continued commitment from the G7, the G20, the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly and other global bodies to ensure that the money moves.  That is absolutely the key.  Colleagues have made that point and I endorse it.  COVAX will work if it gets the support it needs from rich countries; it will fail if countries go round the back, do not give it enough money or discredit it.  Let us work together to make COVAX a success.  In the longer term, let us use the C-TAP system and other medicine patent pools to increase the availability of supplies in poor countries where they are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Nabarro","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Nabarro for his contribution.

It was great to hear from Dr. Nabarro as well.<\/p> <p>  As I stated at a previous committee meeting, it is interesting that we have a case where self-interest and the morally correct thing to do coincide.  They often do not coincide, but in this instance they do.  As Dr. Mike Ryan would say, no one is safe until everyone is safe.  It is very scary that 2.3 million people have died globally.  Dr. Nabarro's interpretation of the future is also frightening.  The economic cost of &euro;3.4 trillion per year is shocking.  Basically, we need the global south, the developing world and all other parts of the world to be on board.  As the world is now a global village, one cannot assume that because what are, from our perspective, isolated areas are not covered, we are safe.  As a result of the prevalence of travel, we are not safe.  The issue of variants then arises.<\/p> <p>  I refer to two stark and frightening figures.  The first is that it will be 2023 before several countries are looked after.

Those are stark figures.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Stanton, raised the issue of capacity.  We should have reassurance in that regard.  I intuitively think there would be far more capacity available if there was a will to use it, but I would like to hear more on the issue.  Ireland now has a particular role in the context of the UN.  The Government must join and sign up to the international statements on this issue and use our position in the EU and the UN.  <\/p> <p>  I recently had a discussion with the Palestinian ambassador to Ireland.  She explained that the Palestinian people have particular difficulties with access.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.  Of course, that links to the issue of refugees.  It is obvious that where there is a density of people, such as in refugee settlements, etc., and indeed in places such as Gaza, there is a greater spread.  I would like the comments of the panel on that but I think it is a pretty basic point.  One assumes the spread is more difficult to halt in the normal ways.  <\/p> <p>  I ask Dr. Nabarro to address the issue of the Russian vaccines and what is happening there.  I have been told that the Russian vaccine is very effective.  We in this western part of Europe do not know much about it.  I ask him to comment on that issue and how the vaccine is being used internationally.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the issue of capacity and the Palestinian question specifically.<\/p> <p>  I was here all day yesterday, when there was a full Seanad sitting at which many important issues were discussed.  I am sure many important issues were also discussed in the D&aacute;il in recent days.  However, without being ridiculous or melodramatic, I believe this is probably the most important meeting that has been held in these buildings for many months.  The issue we are discussing is the most serious in terms of morality, expediency, the economy of the world and the lives of people.  This is of mammoth importance.

Canada, a high-income country, currently has enough vaccines to vaccinate its population several times over, yet it is hoarding some of its vaccines.  It still intends to secure 1.9 million vaccines through the COVAX system.  Will the witnesses comment on wealthier nations hoarding vaccines?  What can we do to stop that practice and what will be the outcome if it persists?<\/p> <p>  As part of the COVAX initiative, pharmaceutical companies have pledged that no country will receive vaccines for more than 20% of the population until every country has enough supply to vaccinate 20% of its population.  Currently, we are well off target, with 16% of the world's population having received 60% of the vaccine supply.  Pfizer has only supplied 2% of its vaccines to COVAX.  I ask Ms Byanyima or Dr. Nabarro what steps are being taken to ensure that pharmaceutical companies fulfil their pledges to the COVAX initiative.<\/p> <p>  Many international NGOs, including M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, have called for a relaxation of intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines and technologies to ensure the scaling up of production and access in the global south.  What steps should the Government be taking, be that independently, as part of the EU or through our role on the UN Security Council, to press pharmaceutical companies to open up intellectual property or support initiatives such as the C-TAP?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#Q00300","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Perhaps we will start with Dr. Harkin, who has not contributed for some time.

While the mRNA vaccine is a very sophisticated vaccine, some of the advantages are that it can be produced quite quickly and the manufacturing set-up can be done in a relatively short time, within three months.  It is interesting that Knowledge Ecology International, KEI, an international organisation, has identified more than 100 plants capable of producing Covid vaccine.  Six of those are in Ireland, four from Merck, which had attempted to develop its own vaccine which failed recently.  Two of the plants are in Cork, one in Carlow and one in Swords. <\/p><p> On what Ireland should do on the waiver on the national stage, our priority would be for Ireland to support CETA but we would also suggest that the waiver or the suspension of intellectual property rights in relation to Covid-19 products as proposed by the Indian and South African governments also warrants support.<\/p><p> On when a patent has been suspended and used from before, it has happened a number of times.  It is what brought an end to the HIV epidemic in Africa when the pharmaceutical industry and the governments which support them caved in under pressure and relented and allowed HIV drugs to be produced and manufactured generically.  Notable times this happened was when the US Government was threatened by anthrax and overnight brought in a law lifting patents on ciprofloxacin, the only antibiotic that would have been effective.  There are other examples which I do not have to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran Harkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>This is a situation where the self-interested, pragmatic, and moral things to do are the same.  Unless we get more vaccines to more people globally and equitably, it is not in anyone's interest.  It is correct to emphasise that.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. Harkin, spoke on the capacity issues.  We also know there is capacity because we see the pipeline of vaccines.  We see other companies are working on vaccines, both mRNA and other vaccines.  Thankfully, there is a great number of them, which indicates capacity.<\/p> <p>  Given that there has not been voluntary sharing or co-operation, there is a need to share intellectual property.  To get that, some countries propose that there would be a waiver or a suspension of intellectual property.  The preference would be for companies simply to share but if that is not achieved, there has to be support for mechanisms such as the waiver.<\/p> <p>  The AIDS HIV crisis is one example of where intellectual property has been relaxed.  There was ongoing petitioning from civil society organisations and developing countries for years.  Several years were lost while that petitioning was going on because it simply was not being heard.  Eventually it led to an announcement and a declaration under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, which is the overarching laws on intellectual property, that public health would also have to be prioritised and that intellectual property would have to be used in a way that was compatible.  There are certain measures within that framework that allow, for example, for compulsory licences for a certain period of time which would allow a third party to make a drug without the intellectual property holder's permission.  That is perfectly legal and provided for within TRIPS under certain circumstances.  It was one of the key mechanisms during the HIV AIDS crisis that facilitated access.  It was 7 February 2001, so 20 years ago nearly to the day, that Cipla, the Indian generic company, made the announcement, and it was such a striking announcement, that it could produce HIV-AIDS antiretrovirals for less than $1 a day.<\/p><p>That was a game changer in this context.<\/p><p> Since then, the Medicines Patent Pool, which is the body that works with C-TAP, has produced generic products for more than 141 countries worldwide.  On top of this, some of the statistics from the Medicines Patent Pool suggest that those generic products have facilitated 38.75 million patient years of treatment.  Those generic products are being facilitated through the pooling of IP and they work for HIV-AIDS but also hepatitis C, TB and various other diseases.  The pooling of intellectual property rights is a system that has worked before.  C-TAP in particular is, in our view, a key mechanism.  Not only does it share IP, but in the vaccine context it shares know-how and know-how is particularly crucial for producing these vaccines.  We call on companies and governments to support this.<\/p><p> On the question regarding whether companies have refused to sign up to C-TAP, I cannot answer that.  It is not my knowledge that they have refused.  I do not have that information to hand.  I would encourage companies to consider supporting this and countries to encourage companies to support these initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I invite Dr. Nabarro to respond to the remaining questions, with particular reference to Senator Joe O'Reilly's question on the Russian vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#S00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I will answer as best I can.  The WHO has had a number of exchanges with the manufacturers of the Russian vaccine, the Gamaleya company, and it is continuing to seek from the very co-operative Russian manufacturers all the data that are needed for an emergency use authorisation.  It is complex.  For this process to go through, first one has to look at the vaccine and the results of the phase 1, 2 and 3 trials of the vaccine.  Second, under the WHO rules that have been approved and requested by the national Governments of the member states of the WHO, a certificate of good manufacturing practice is requested from the manufacturer.  All of these issues are being looked at.  In regard to other vaccines that are going through this system, I cannot tell the committee when the effort will be completed.  In regard to Gamaleya and Sputnik V, this is a work in progress that is being done with the greatest possible speed while at the same time maintaining the requirements for quality assurance, safety and efficacy.<\/p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly asked about ensuring access for refugees and other disadvantaged people.  It is important to stress that the COVAX scheme has been designed such that it includes capacity to ensure that when vaccines are available they get to disadvantaged and refugee communities.  Deputy Berry asked about the situation where patents have been waived, to which I think Dr. McMahon gave a pretty good answer.  I do not want to add to it.  In 2002, I was working with the director general WHO and the Secretary General of the UN.  The key issue is that company CEOs came to us.  As a result of an environment which created some pressure, they came to us and I recall that eight of them said they were going to find a way to reduce their prices and to deal with the various concerns raised previously around doing so.  The rest is history.  What a transformative change.<\/p> <p>  On the question regarding whether pharma companies have agreed to voluntary licensing in regard to Covid vaccines, the answer is that they have.  The agreement between AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India or between Sanofi and BioNTech are examples of where this is happening.  The key question that we all need to ask is what can be done to speed up things and make sure that the right amount of vaccines are available.<\/p><p> That brings me to Deputy Gannon's questions.  He asked if wealthy countries were hoarding vaccines.  I checked that with people who have the answers when I was getting briefed for today's meeting.  It is not that wealthy countries have got a lot of vaccine.  In fact, each of the wealthy countries that has a mass vaccination programme under way, including the United Kingdom and countries in the European Union, are short of vaccine.  They are worried about supplies because they have made advance purchase commitments, which means they got an option on vaccine with the manufacturers but there is such competition for supplies among governments that have made pledges to vaccinate large proportions of their population as well as those who have made pledges to support COVAX.  There is a terrible competition under way and I cannot underestimate the severity of this competition.  One just has to look at newspapers in European countries right now to see, for example, the frustration being expressed towards European leaders that there is not more vaccine becoming available.  That is creating a competition with COVAX.  Quite simply, that is what is happening now.  It is because the countries that are committed to vaccinating all their populations for the very good reason that they see this as the best way out of the pandemic are putting such huge pressure on the very limited supply that availability of COVAX is always in question.  That is our difficulty.<\/p><p> Deputy Gannon brought up this point by asking if wealthy countries are hoarding.  I do not want to use the term \"hoarding\" but they are certainly putting immense demands on the manufacturers in the current vaccine shortage to take vaccines away from COVAX so that they can fulfil pledges they have made to their citizens for widespread vaccination.  This situation is very difficult.  If a political leader has said his or her people will be vaccinated and after they have done the people most at risk - the health workers - they will go to teachers, then first-line responders like ambulance workers and then essential personnel like security guards, who have a lot of contact with people and we know have a higher incidence, it can be seen that the political pressure in Europe is huge, yet at the same time here are we, with COVAX, saying, as we have heard even in what has been going on here today, that the situation for health workers in poor countries is desperate.  Thousands of health workers have died as a result of Covid-19 in the past year.  Yes, we want to protect these health workers but there is this terrible conundrum, and I believe everybody sees it.  Unfortunately, increasing the licensing and using the Medicines Patent Pool and C-TAP will not deal with the acute problem right now.  The problem right now is that there is limited capacity.  We are in a shortage situation.  It should get better in the coming weeks and months but the competition for this small amount of vaccine right now is huge.<\/p><p> Deputy Gannon's question, and I do not want to answer it exactly as written, was how to get Pfizer to fulfil its responsibilities to COVAX.  Pfizer has got responsibilities to a number of different groups which have made advance purchase agreements.  It has also got shortages of production because, when vaccines are being produced, things do not work smoothly.  Batches go wrong.  Whole batches have to be thrown away.  Pfizer has licensed the Serum Institute of India, a Korean company.  It has also got its own plants in Europe and they are not all able to produce what is needed.  Given the demand that is coming, often backed by lawyers from European governments and from the European Union as well as from the UK and, I am sure, from other countries in the world, and it is building up, it is super hard to understand precisely what is going on.<\/p><p>One concern is that COVAX works if there is transparency about pricing, delivery dates and to what degree the company is able to say that it did its best but could not deliver.  Right now, we do not have full transparency, which makes life difficult.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Gannon, the lack of transparency makes this difficult.  What steps should the Government take to support the matters we are talking about?  Everything that has been said in the chamber is right.  This requires political action, not just within the nation but also across Europe and through the UN Security Council.  There is a core question that comes back to members here, representing the Irish people, which is what the Irish people want.  My colleague, Dr. Mike Ryan, who is the greatest Irishman working on infectious diseases, works as head of emergencies at the WHO.  He talked to me last weekend as I was preparing and said that it is difficult because politicians believe that it is their job to always fight for the interests of their constituents, which, right now, is for as many people as possible to be vaccinated with a safe, effective and functional vaccine as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> Is there any way that we can get a message to politicians that perhaps the population of Ireland is prepared to look at an alternative proposition, which is for high-risk people in Ireland to be vaccinated now with whatever spare vaccines are available being shared with other countries in the world so that they can vaccinate their high-risk population?  Once we have all high-risk populations vaccinated, then we can complete the vaccination of the adult population.  This is a political dilemma.  I do not know how one gets to know the mood of the population but there surely needs to be a test of what the people of Ireland and other European countries want right now, whether it is fairness for the world or trying to get as much vaccine as possible for people in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Nabarro","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Nabarro.

I find it morally reprehensible for any pharmaceutical company to engage in extortion of poorer countries by price gouging.  I cannot think of a worse action by any company at a time like this.  Dr. Nabarro is correct that people are the solution, but we will only be the solution if we are willing to take on the role of being global champions and ensuring equal and proper access to all vaccines and treatments used to save the lives of those affected by Covid.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue that has not been touched on.  EU member states, like other countries, have contributed billions of euro and dollars to the pharmaceutical companies over past years, through taxpayer funds, research and development funds or other tax breaks.<\/p><p>This is not the time for anybody to be getting into a bickering match over intellectual property rights; it is the time to simply step up, stick on the big girl pants and do the right thing.<\/p><p> My questions are quite simple.  One concerns C-TAP and COVAX.  In the opening statement, 2023 was given as the year when people in some poorer countries will be vaccinated.  Is there a tipping point whereby that target could be moved out further or brought closer depending on the level of buy-in to C-TAP?  Other contributors have spoken about manufacturers refusing to engage.  Have manufacturers been asked to engage?  Have potential producers in other countries being directly asked to sign up to and support the programme?<\/p><p> On the companies based in Ireland that could manufacture the vaccine, do we know whether there is a relatively available supply of what they would need to facilitate their doing so?  I believe there are half a dozen such companies.  What engagement has taken place with them to determine whether they would come on board to engage in manufacturing if the conditions were right?<\/p><p> I understand certain countries have either overbought or over-ordered based on their populations.  I stand to be corrected but I believe New Zealand either over-ordered or overbought not for its own population but for neighbouring territories that may not have been best placed to order for themselves.  Is this a global trend?  Is there more evidence of this solidarity or is New Zealand very much an isolated case?  Of the countries that have over-ordered or overbought, how many have made an offer under the COVAX system?<\/p><p> We have touched on conflict zones, refugee movement and the vital job the Red Cross is doing.

It strikes me that the appalling mix of the animal instincts of capitalism is meeting up with competitive races.  The competitive race is not just that towards vaccination as it concerns individuals themselves.  As an individual sitting here, I watch every day to see how close my age group is to the next stage of vaccine roll-out in Ireland.  That is human nature.  All of us want to be vaccinated.  We want all the vaccines to be shared equally, but not just now.  It is a case of saying, \"I am all for it.  As soon as I have been vaccinated, let us get the rest of the world vaccinated.\"  That is a human response.  The animal instincts of capitalism are driven by the ownership of the intellectual property rights.  When we talk about declaring something a global public good, we are saying to the shareholders of the drugs companies and manufacturers that we do not want them to have super-normal profits, which is what they normally earn from the development of a drug of one type or another.  There are two ways of dealing with that.  One is that national governments would tax the shareholders to take the super-normal profits off them in order that the drug could be redistributed globally along the global network, but that is highly unlikely to happen because we are politicians and we ultimately answer to our local constituencies.  The other solution, therefore, is that we cough up and pay the super-normal profits to the manufacturers to have a free licence throughout the world to get manufacturing done.  I would be interested in the panel&rsquo;s view on that.<\/p> <p>  We have heard about occupied territories and war-torn areas around the world such as Syria and Yemen.<\/p><p>Where a totalitarian government is in place, do the witnesses believe, or is there any evidence to suggest, the denial of access to a vaccine may become another form of human rights abuse?<\/p><p> The other terrible term I heard this morning, which is quite frightening and I believe is happening in the United States, is \"vaccine chasing\".  People are moving from one geographical area to another because the roll-out of the vaccine is faster in the second area.  I am quite concerned about that.<\/p><p> I must ask this question today with respect to Covid-19.  Part of the argument or solution is vaccination, the other part is in testing.  There is a reluctance in Ireland to use antigen testing, which many European countries have taken up and are using to see schools and manufacturing plants open up.  What is the panel's view on the antigen roll-out?<\/p><p> The final question goes back to the issue of interpersonal competition for vaccine.  My colleague, Deputy Berry, referred to Defence Forces personnel who are going into extremely testing conditions.  Under normal circumstances, they are exposed to all sorts of infections, but in this particular instance they are exposed to Covid-19 on top of everything else.  I fully support what Deputy Berry is talking about.  Yesterday, however, we had a debate in this Chamber on special education.  The question arose as to whether those who are on the front line and will have to visit five or six houses a week now qualify as front-line workers.  The quite natural instinct is to stretch out the definition in order that we can bring more groups under the term \"front-line workers\".  I would love to hear from the panel as to how we might tie down what in fact constitutes a front-line worker and then work to that definition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#V00200","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I have a specific question.

She understands and appreciates that.<\/p> <p>  Building on Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s question to our panel, there are public health concerns internationally, specifically around Israel's unequal distribution of vaccines and access to vaccines for Palestinians in the occupied territories.  As our panel will know, the Palestinian human rights group, Al-Haq, joined by more than 100 Palestinian human rights and civil society organisations, called Israel's vaccine policy discriminatory and unlawful due to its complete disregard for its obligations toward Palestinian healthcare.

If my recollection serves me right, it was put forward by countries in October and it has been discussed since then.  There were informal discussions again, I think, last week, and as far as I am aware there will be further discussions.  In March, there will be more discussions within the formal meeting context on the TRIPS situation, so it is still ongoing.<\/p> <p>  In response to some of the other questions, the C-TAP initiative is a voluntary system.  It does not suspend and instead encourages companies to share their intellectual property rights.  They retain those rights.  It is also a non-exclusive system so they would still be able to have licensing agreements.  That is the key difference between the two.  The other difference is that C-TAP encourages the sharing of know-how, which is crucial within the vaccine context.  Both of those measures are ongoing and, as we have said, both are ones that we support.<\/p> <p>  On the first question that Deputy Clarke asked about the figures that we mentioned earlier of nine out of ten people not being able to get vaccines, and some of those figures are for Oxfam and other groups, our hope is that is based on projections around the current vaccine situation.  We hope that with agreements like C-TAP or, indeed, if more companies are willing to engage in voluntary licensing, that would either increase the capacity, because we are going to have more and more manufacturers producing these vaccines, or it would build capacity.  It would mean new manufacturers coming on board to produce those vaccines.  Our hope is that that would then increase the numbers available and bring the figures down, thus making sure we have a more equitable spread because, essentially, the aim is to produce more and have more manufacturers doing more.<\/p> <p>  In terms of IP, that currently is tricky.  If companies have intellectual property and if they are not sharing the know-how, then other manufacturers cannot come on board because it would be in breach of intellectual property rights, but also they may not have the know-how to do that.  They need the know-how and the sharing.<\/p> <p>  On who else supports or whether any pharmaceutical companies support the C-TAP measure, there is news that 18 generic companies, that is, 18 companies that could produce generic products, have come on board and are supportive of the C-TAP arrangement.  As I have said, I am not aware of the current picture and to what extent they are coming on board, although I am sure they are, and there are negotiations between the WHO and the pharmaceutical companies that have some of the rights at the moment.  Certainly, generic companies are coming on board, and the latest figure is that there are 18 companies that are generic producers and that are willing to do that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Senator Craughwell's questions, one was very important as it mentioned the idea of human rights.  This is something we have touched on briefly.  It has to be said and must be emphasised, however, that there is a human right to life and there is also a human right to health protected both under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and under international agreements such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  All countries that are party to those would have obligations to protect and promote human rights, and not just a legal obligation, although clearly there is one, but also a moral obligation in terms of these issues.<\/p> <p>  I know, given the time, we may not get the opportunity to say more on the following, so we would like to thank the committee again today, but one of the things that I would ask for is that there would be consideration given to or discussion of formal endorsement of C-TAP.  It is very important.  Others have mentioned Ireland's place on the international stage.  It is not enough just to support C-TAP.  We certainly support that and hope that the Government would do that, but also, if possible and ideally, the Government should be advocating for C-TAP and other mechanisms at an international level, particularly at the  EU level but also, given its role internationally in terms of the UN Security Council, being an advocate and being a part of that.<\/p><p>The other thing is to encourage other pharmaceutical companies to join.  Some companies, it must be said, have already engaged in and entered into voluntary licensing deals and I know this has been mentioned.  These include Pfizer and BioNTech with Sanofi, AstraZeneca with the Serum Institute of India.  More of that needs to happen and C-TAP, if they supported it, could facilitate that at a larger scale.  The idea of whether a D&aacute;il motion might be something that would be possible was also mentioned earlier.  We would particularly welcome a D&aacute;il motion or Seanad motion tabling these types of issues if it was something Members were willing to consider, particularly an endorsement of the C-TAP initiative, but also the other initiatives such as the waiver or other proposals to facilitate equitable global access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#X00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McMahon.

Speaking as a public health professional, as well as an envoy for the WHO, the tipping point is now.  There is no time down the road.  We are watching extraordinary and dramatic damage occurring to the fabric of human society everywhere as a result of Covid.  It is very active now; there are a lot of issues all over the world, including deepening inequities and real frustration and anxiety on the part of millions of people.  Now is the time when the leaders in the rich world must take the initiative and must focus on equity.  All that has been said by Dr. McMahon, Dr. Harkin and Ms Byanyima is so right.  I say do not wait.<\/p> <p>  The second point is how many countries are doing what New Zealand has done in terms of actually taking advantage of their skills in dealing with Covid and postponing an option they have got on a vaccine?  I have not heard of any others and it is time we had a vaccine solidarity challenge where heads of government, through their legislators, are invited to indicate what are the circumstances under which they will be ready to share.  Of course, they will all say they are worried about variants but the whole world is worried about variants.  Variants can affect poor countries just as badly as they can affect rich ones.  The key thing is to protect those who are most at risk.  The responsibilities of occupiers, as was brought out by Deputy Clarke, and the responsibilities of governments are well set out.  Dr. McMahon is much better qualified than me to talk about it but again, as a public health professional, I am really concerned when groups of people inside a national border are denied, for some reason or other, an opportunity to access a vaccine and I am sure that those who have occupational responsibilities will do everything possible to be transparent about how they are dealing with it.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell raised many points and I got five of them down.  I feel I have the responsibility to deal with the third question, on vaccine sharing.  I stress that one of the things we all must work on at the moment is vaccine hesitancy.  There are people who are not quite sure about whether they want to take the vaccine.  It is really important that in all societies they are given a second, third or fourth chance if they are uncertain when first asked.  Thus I am kind of advocating for a really tolerant approach and for offering people, as I said, a chance to think about things and not requiring them to make a decision now on the basis that otherwise they will not get a chance.<\/p><p>On testing, I stress that while there are concerns about the reliability and positive predictive value of some of the antigen tests available, the committee should watch this space.  I believe that more reliable rapid tests will come on stream.  That will make such a difference.  We do not talk so much about testing.  I believe that access to rapid and reliable tests is absolutely key to an equitable response.<\/p><p> On the question of the definition of \"front-line personnel\", countries could really take advantage of the opportunities they have in the international system through the UN to debate these things.<\/p><p> The Chairman said something that is very important about the money that is needed.  The Chairman asked where the impetus will come from for a real initiative in this regard.  There have been calls for a vaccine summit involving the new US Administration and perhaps involving the G7.  It is very important that we go beyond just saying there needs to be a summit.  World leaders have got to come together in a constant format to deal with this crisis as a global crisis now.  It cannot be dealt with by individual national leaders working on their own, which is bound to cause terrible problems.  The kinds of issues we are discussing today need solidarity in the responses.  The WHO and the UN Secretary-General are constantly asking for greater and more joined-up leadership by leaders.  I propose not just a summit but a global Covid response programme that deals with all of the issues such as access to tests, access to treatment, access to vaccines, travel issues, the problems of obligations of occupiers and all the other problems we are talking about.  This needs ongoing attention now because we do not know what a failure to deal with Covid in a joined-up way worldwide will lead to.  We do know that 2020 was a year like no other.  Who knows what will happen in 2021 and 2022 if we do not deal with this as the global emergency that it is?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Nabarro","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Nabarro.

As members are aware, the IHCA represents more than 3,200 hospital consultants, around 95% of the total number in the country.  First, I will address the current staffing situation, including the level of absenteeism.  There is a severe shortage of hospital consultants in our public health service.  We have the lowest number of medical specialists on a population basis in the EU.  We are 41% below the EU average.  We have a serious recruitment and retention crisis, with more than 700 permanent hospital consultant posts vacant or not filled as needed.  This in large part has been caused by a flawed Government decision in 2012 to cut the pay of newly appointed consultants.  Our younger consultants, who are being discriminated against, have been front and centre in providing care in the ongoing Covid crisis.  They have carried an extremely heavy burden of work during this period and will continue to do so.<\/p> <p>  The leaders of all the parties have agreed that ending the discrimination against consultants appointed since 2012 is essential to attract and retain the number of consultants we need.  The Government's failure to address the recruitment crisis and restore pay parity is bordering on negligence and only serves to exacerbate the extremely challenging task in dealing post Covid with the massive backlogs and waiting lists that are accumulating across all specialties.<\/p> <p>  In a survey of members last week, more than half said there are moderate or high staff absentee levels that are having an adverse impact on service delivery.  Of the medical and dental staff, we had an absence rate of just 2.3%, around a quarter of the rate of other staff categories.  However, more than half of the absences were due to Covid, which is the largest proportion for any staff category.  The closure of schools is impacting on the availability for work of healthcare workers and it is increasing workloads and stress levels for those at work.<\/p> <p>  I will move on quickly to Covid transmission within hospitals.  In the survey, around half of all respondents confirmed that improvements are needed to increase the number of single-occupancy rooms and beds in dedicated isolation wards.  Our members also expressed concerns about the lack of regular testing and screening of staff.  In the nine weeks to the end of January, more than 12,000 healthcare workers had been infected with the virus, including more than 560 doctors.<\/p><p>A total of over 1,400 confirmed cases were linked with hospital outbreaks in the same period.  Four in ten of those infected in the hospital outbreaks were healthcare workers.  Of the 1,400 cases linked with the hospitals, 30 were admitted to the intensive care unit, ICU, and, sadly, 124 died.  When community transmission rates are at such high levels, it is almost inevitable that there will be outbreaks in hospitals.  However, more must be done to prevent Covid infections being acquired in hospital settings.  It is clear for infection control purposes that our pre-Covid bed occupancy rate of around 95% needs to be reduced to between 80% and 85%.  To put that in perspective, this requires approximately 2,000 additional hospital beds to maintain current service levels.<\/p><p> In terms of long Covid, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association is concerned about the effects of long Covid and believes a HSE policy on long Covid is required for healthcare workers.  Regarding the availability of protective equipment, IHCA members in our survey reported high levels of availability of personal protective equipment, PPE, of an appropriate grade, albeit there are some small glitches at individual sites.  As regards the mental well-being of staff arising from the Covid crisis, a large majority of consultants in our survey said that Covid-19 has had a moderate or severe impact on their workload, general well-being and mental health.  More than one-fifth of respondents are experiencing symptoms of burnout and work-related stress.  Two in five doctors in Ireland now say their mental well-being is worse compared with what it was at the start of the pandemic.  Worryingly, there is a high risk that when the pandemic eases there will be increased mental health issues impacting on our health staff.  Returning to the stressful overstretched business-as-usual model is not an option if we are to avoid an even worse workforce crisis than was the case before Covid-19.<\/p><p> Regarding additional staffing requirements to deal with the non-Covid backlog, over 70% of our respondents confirmed that low numbers of consultants available to deliver care will have a moderate or severe adverse impact on the capacity to deal with the backlog in non-Covid care.  More than 840,000 people are on some form of hospital waiting list.  With over 700 permanent consultant posts vacant, our acute hospitals are very poorly positioned to provide timely care to patients.  While the Government has committed record funding levels for health in 2021, until this money is channelled effectively and speedily to where it will make the most difference for patients, through the recruitment of additional consultants with supporting teams and infrastructure, public hospitals will continue to have record waiting lists and struggle to address the backlog of treatment due to Covid-19.<\/p><p> The Government can no longer ignore the fundamental requirement that essential treatment is delivered by consultants and that no amount of investment in hospital services will reduce waiting lists unless we recruit and retain the necessary number of hospital consultants to deliver timely care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Robert Landers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Owens to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#B00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>There can be no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on our already overstretched front-line health service staff.  In a recent survey that was carried out among the thousands of members of the IMO we sought to determine the exact impact.  The three main impacts cited were preexisting staffing shortages exacerbated by Covid illnesses and requirements to self-isolate; the growing backlog of waiting patients; and the impact on doctors' personal health and wellbeing.  However, we should be under no illusion, as these issues existed long before the pandemic struck.  What is deplorable is that it is now almost one year since the first case of Covid-19 was diagnosed in Ireland, yet no substantial and systemic action has been taken to date to address the crises in recruitment and retention of medical expertise across our health system.<\/p><p>As a consequence, waiting lists have grown and stress and burnout are prevalent among the medical workforce.  In an as yet unpublished IMO survey, 80% of doctors across all grades cited feelings of depression, anxiety and stress, particularly emotional stress.<\/p><p> Although public health medicine is the first line of defence we have against Covid-19, we have 60 public health specialists compared to 180 in Scotland and New Zealand where the population is of a similar size and is similarly dispersed.  Public health specialists have the expertise and training to carry out risk assessments and manage and control outbreaks of infection in our healthcare settings and in the wider community and yet public health specialists have still not been provided with a consultant contract and the resources necessary to allow them to carry out their statutory duties.  It beggars belief and should be a cause of considerable shame that these doctors, who are our front line in this battle, had to ballot for industrial action in the midst of a pandemic to have their long-running grievances considered in a serious fashion.<\/p><p> In the past year, hospital waiting lists have grown by approximately 70,000 or 9% and now stand at 838,000, yet the number of vacant consultant posts or posts filled on a temporary or non-substantive basis has risen to 730, more or less.  The supply of medical specialists simply fails to meet demand.  The HSE itself estimates that we require a minimum of 1,600 additional hospital consultants to meet the needs of our current population.  If we include psychiatry and public health specialists, and we should, the shortfall is closer to 2,000.  Still, however, no concrete measures have been taken to address the twotier pay structure among hospital consultants, which is the major factor contributing to the consultant recruitment and retention crisis.<\/p><p> There is no doubt that staffing shortages are impacting significantly on the mental health of our medical workforce and we have surveyed to establish that.  Long working hours, excessive workloads, redeployment, requirements to cover for absent colleagues, the inability to get proper rest and take proper breaks and difficulties in accessing childcare are all contributing to high rates of stress and burnout among doctors.  This is particularly evident among non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, or doctors in training, who are seeing their training eroded by Covid-19.  It is also the case among public health specialists where morale is at an all-time low.<\/p><p> General practice is not without its capacity issues.  Some 600 GPs are due to retire over the next five years while the HSE's national doctors training and planning unit estimates that up to 1,660 additional GPs will be required by 2028.  GPs are encountering difficulties in recruiting additional practice staff and accessing locum cover.  Young GPs are finding it prohibitively expensive to establish themselves and build their own practices.<\/p><p> What can we do to address these matters?  We must urgently strengthen public health medicine services through the immediate awarding of a consultant contract to  specialists in public health medicine, as recommended by the Crowe Horwath report, the Scally report and the report of the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel.  We must ensure that adequate risk assessments are carried out across all healthcare settings.  We must complete the vaccination of all front-line healthcare workers as a matter of absolute national priority.  We must ensure that adequate supplies of quality personal protective equipment, PPE, for all front-line healthcare workers are available for hospital and community staff.  We must encourage continued adherence to National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, guidelines through public education campaigns.  All healthcare workers should have access to appropriately resourced and consultant-led occupational health services, including necessary mental health supports.  In addition, all healthcare workers should be aware of their occupational rights and entitlements during this pandemic.  This is not the time for fighting employers; this is the time to be on the same side.<\/p><p> We cannot hope to address the backlog of nonCovid patients on waiting lists, running at nearly 850,000, without addressing the recruitment and retention crisis as it affects hospital consultants.  This is a longstanding issue that now requires an urgent solution.  The Government needs to urgently address the twotier consultant pay issue.  The HSE is not an employer of choice as the Public Service Pay Commission, among others, has found.  Health service leaders know that to be the case and we suspect that many of our politicians also recognise that fact.<\/p><p> In the meantime, all higher specialist trainees, SpRs, who have finished training should be offered a temporary consultant locum post to get us through this crisis.  We must also ensure a sufficient number of intern posts and training posts for those who wish to come into the service and contribute at this time.  Once we get them in, it absolutely behoves the service to ensure that the working hours of our exhausted non-consultant hospital doctors comply with the European working time directive and the Organisation of Working Time Act.  We know that they do not.<\/p><p> Finally, we need to provide additional support for established GPs to allow them to recruit the staff they will need.  We also need to provide supports for newly establishing GPs to allow them to get through the difficult first few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Anthony Owens","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Owens.

We set out in our submission to cover the matters that we were asked to deal with, namely, issues to do with Covid infections and healthcare workers.  The first issue to which we draw attention is the rate of infections among healthcare workers.  This week, the International Council of Nurses confirmed that the rate of infection among Ireland's healthcare worker population, at 12%, is the highest it has recorded.  This is a worrying trend which we have raised previously with the committee.  We believe that the delay in the introduction of protection for workers by ensuring that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, has a role to play in examining workplaces has certainly contributed to this high rate of infections.  The INMO and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, sought for the HSA to amend regulations and that the Government would insist that they be regulated from the time that the pandemic was declared on 11 March last year.  Unfortunately, that did not happen until the biological hazard directive was introduced by the European Union on 24 November.  That interim period led to a lack of focus on the principle of preventing infections among healthcare workers.  These workers are in the eye of the storm.  The settings in which they work are workplaces and the HSA must conduct inspections where we know there are continuing clusters of Covid-19 infections in workplaces.<\/p> <p>  The data show that the prevalence of infection among females is highest in the health service because the number of female worker is higher than in other sectors.  The reports from the HSA confirm that if one is a woman working in the health service, one is at the highest risk of contracting Covid-19.  The issue is huge for us because a large portion of our members are women.  Stress levels and mental health issues surrounding the provision of childcare and the difficulties in attempting to secure childcare, when decisions have been made, for example, to close schools, are combined with the difficulties of going to work in a high-risk environment and fighting to have personal protective equipment, PPE, provided that is adequate.  That equipment is continually being assessed for its efficacy.  We had to do so again in January, unfortunately, having previously, last April, sought a policy change to allow all healthcare workers to wear surgical masks.  We had to repeat that process and seek the upgrade of those masks as what we know about the virus showed there was a higher risk.  We were tracking the numbers of infections rates and this demonstrated that the new variant was far more infectious than existing variants.  It took almost three weeks for the HSE policy to change to allow healthcare workers the right to wear the higher-grade mask.<\/p> <p>  Many other issues in our submission point to the fact of the precautionary principle and healthcare worker protection not being to the forefront.  We are and have been very critical of this.  It is a real issue for our members, who are putting themselves at risk on a daily basis in moving past all the obstacles to get to work, including incurring additional personal costs for the provision of childcare, in order to provide a service.  We believe that their health and safety has not been protected to the level that it should and must be.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the vaccine roll-out, we point out in our submission that the trajectory and statistics we have from the HSE show that some counties, including, for example, the Border counties of Louth, Donegal, Cavan and Sligo, had very high population incidences, yet vaccine administration was not concentrated in, and prioritised for, those areas.<\/p><p>Our members in those areas were absolutely devastated when they were not prioritised for the vaccine roll-out.  Today the HSE portal to allow healthcare workers register for vaccination opened and we are very worried that the same thing might happen again.  We hope it will not.  We have worked hard with the HSE on a sequencing document, which was issued on 19 January, to ensure that front-line, patient-facing healthcare workers are prioritised for the vaccine that is available because clearly this is their line of defence.<\/p><p> The long-term Covid effects are another issue on which we believe the committee must comment.  The long-term Covid effects are real.  Many of our members report to us that they have not recovered, that they continue to fight Covid at home, that they have long-term fatigue or long-term neurological or cardiac presentations post infection at work.  There is simply no fast-tracking or clinical pathway for them, despite numerous requests for same.  We believe that, as an employer, the health service has to do better and that there must be real precautionary and preventative measures in place.  There must also be very real measures now to deal with the long Covid effects.<\/p><p> In addition, we know from all the studies we have done or which other health services across the globe have looked at that the mental health effects post pandemic will be of huge significance.  More than 80% of our members have said their mental health has been affected by working in these conditions.  Now we have to prepare for that and make sure we are putting in place supports to allow recuperation and to allow the healthcare workers who have been working at 120%, 140% and 150% to recuperate when, it is to be hoped, the vaccine is fully rolled out and we have a reprieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha.

I will start by thanking all healthcare workers for their diligent and compassionate work and care for people during this pandemic, the likes of which none of us have seen on this scale before.  Obviously, top of that queue are nurses, consultants and GPs but also all healthcare staff - cleaning staff, cooks, catering staff, maintenance staff, secretarial staff, administrative staff, porters, nursing assistants, managers, social workers, chaplains, pharmacists and physiotherapists - who have had front-line roles.  The importance of caring has been recognised more now than ever before.<\/p> <p>  I recognise that resources are not endless and that spending more in one sector always means spending less in another.  Perhaps all witnesses could comment on the &euro;21 billion budget, which is the highest ever, with an additional &euro;4 billion this year.  That is certainly very welcome.  I think Professor Landers has stated that that money is not being spent effectively.  Perhaps he could advise how it should be spent, whether more should be spent or what he suggests we should not spend money on within the health sector.  That is important.  As I said, money is not endless.<\/p><p> What percentage of members of the witnesses' organisations have not been vaccinated?  They should have been.  That was, and should still be, the priority.  What are the reasons for them not being vaccinated?  Some were missed because, when their hospitals, HSE nursing homes or whatever were vaccinating, they were out, isolating or had Covid and that caused a delay.  What is the relationship in that regard?  Front-line workers must be the first priority.<\/p><p> Professor Landers and Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha made reference to the benefits of single-occupancy rooms.  Will they expand on that?  How do single-occupancy en suite rooms protect patients and staff?  The new 75-bed unit in Galway is an example.<\/p><p> There are consultancy posts being advertised that are not being taken up.  Does that suggest it is just about pay or are there also certain hospitals that are not as attractive as others, if I can say that, because of their size, location or so on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#E00300","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I will answer some of the Senator's direct questions.  This year's money is being spent in an emergency situation and with little in the way of planning.  That has been necessary, but we now need to plan into the future.  As I alluded to in my presentation, we need at least 2,000 additional beds.  We also need to examine the infrastructure.  In other words, the majority of facilities need to be single-room accommodation, which would bring us into line with the modern, developed world.  Any new hospital being built these days is all single-room accommodation.  The virus will spread in any congregated setting, be that a two-bed, three-bed, five-bed or six-bed ward.  Single-room accommodation greatly cuts down the virus's ability to spread.<\/p> <p>  Consultancy post vacancies exist across all model 2, 3 and 4 hospitals.  It is true that some consultant posts are not as attractive as others depending on someone's interests, but there are vacancies across all specialties and hospitals.  This issue needs to be sorted out and we need to make consultant posts more attractive so that we can attract and retain consultants.  We do not have a hope of matching the demand for post-Covid care until we sort that out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Robert Landers"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":143,"content":"<p>If I might answer Senator Kyne's question in respect of healthcare workers-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1612828800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha is on mute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#F00500","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Okay.  The number in question is 49,500 healthcare workers, but we do not have a breakdown by grade.  There is a long way to go, given that people must have a first and then a second vaccination.  There are nurses and midwives working in ICUs and emergency departments today who have not had their first vaccinations.  They must be prioritised.<\/p> <p>  We worked hard to get the sequencing document, which has been in place since 12 January and was reiterated on 19 January.  It is key.  Those who are patient-facing, front-line healthcare workers have to be prioritised for a vaccine.  It is a health and safety measure to ensure that their risk is mitigated.  In our view, the State, through the HSA must have an involvement in ensuring that happens.  Under the European directive, the HSA has a legal imperative to ensure that workplaces are safe.  To date, we have been critical of the lack of focus on that imperative in respect of healthcare workers.  Just because they are working in the health service does not mean their environment is safe.  In fact, it is the opposite.  We know that the rate of infection among workers in the health service is very high.<\/p><p>Those working on the front line of the health service, particularly women, are at higher risk.  This is very problematic, and we must find out why it is.  We cannot just look at it as we have been doing with the trolley count for years, nod our heads and say, \"Yes, isn't it terrible?\"  This is very real.  It is high risk.  The after-effects of contracting Covid will be with us for a long time.<\/p><p> In respect of the service plan, we have had an agreement since 2016 that the HSE would sign off the service plan with the union in respect of the funded workforce plan for nursing and midwifery every November.  It happened once in 2017.  This year we still do not have a service plan for the health service, a funded workforce plan or otherwise, signed by the Minister.  Today is 9 February.  It is imperative to focus on how we staff the health service, what is funded and how we recruit, particularly now in a pandemic when we know that more than 6,000 staff are unable to come to work because of being affected themselves.  It is a matter this committee should raise with the Minister for Health.

I thank the Senator for his questions.  He asked about vacant consultant posts in certain sites.  I would overlay that because we have many vacant consultant posts in certain specialties.  Right now, we need emergency medicine consultants and ICU consultants where we have many vacant posts.  We also need mental health consultants, psychiatrists, and they will be particularly needed when, touch wood, we get out of this.  We also have many vacant posts there.  Therefore, it is sites and specialties.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also mentioned the vaccine roll-out.  Many of our non-consultant hospital doctors came to us with a particular issue.  As he knows, non-consultant hospital doctors have a rotational pattern and quite a few will rotate from one location to another in January every year.  This year we had a particular problem.  Many of them who were leaving site A to go to site B were told in site A to hang on and get the vaccine in site B and others were told when they got to site B to go back to site A to get their second dose.  There are issues which affect numbers of doctors.  In the great scheme of things, it might seem relatively small but the fact of the matter is a vaccination campaign, which is our way out of this, should not make our doctors anxious and should not give them concerns or pause for thought.  It should not give us reasons to approach the HSE and ask, \"Would you please vaccinate front-line healthcare workers?\"  That should just be happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Anthony Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I believe Dr. Colleran has indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#G00400","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Senator Kyne asked about the empty posts.  We currently have 728 consultant posts that are not filled on a permanent basis, which is 20% of our current consultant numbers.  The national doctors training programme estimates that we need to increase the number of acute hospital consultants by 51% by 2028.  It is critical that we not only fill those posts, but then recruit another 50%.  Those calculations are all pre-pandemic and, as we all know, the 840,000 people waiting for care is only growing.  The Senator asked what would help to fix it.  The reality is that for many of my peers, with whom I have considerable contact in my role, the 2012 decision makes working abroad more attractive.  It is simple as that.  As long as we are paying two people differently for doing the same work, people who are away will not come home.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee, as public representatives, need to see that there is value for money and that people are delivering the care.  That is something we are doing every day.  If we look to what we have shown in the past year, the leadership, the innovation, the agility, the commitment shown by our members, we have shown what is possible and how we can turn around how we deliver care during a pandemic.  Where people previously thought that the health service could not change and could not be agile, that has all been turned on its head.  It has been down to the local teams and the local services, the doctors, nurses, the health and social care professionals, and the porters.  All of us working together have delivered for patients.<\/p> <p>  As long as we have the 2012 cut and a 30% pay differential, we will continue to have trouble filling those 728 or 1,100 or 650 posts.  The Senator is right; it is not just pay but also conditions.  People have too much call and too much workload.  They are filling the gap for the consultants who are not in post.  It all fills in together and ultimately it is our patients, particularly our poorest and most disadvantaged patients, who are affected most.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabrielle Colleran"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I welcome all our witnesses and pass on my best wishes to all of those operating on the front line in very difficult and challenging circumstances.  I will make a few points and then put a few questions to a number of witnesses.  All of the opening statements made for very difficult listening and should be for all of us but there is a very clear relationship between the burnout facing front-line staff and low morale on the one hand and the lack of capacity across the system, the failure to deal with the two-tier pay inequality issues that have been in play for a long time and the lack of supports in terms of occupational health on the other.  If we do not sort out these problems, we will lose more nurses, doctors, consultants and front-line staff.  It is as simple as that.  Student nurses and midwives have been campaigning for the past number of months - years in fact.  The public health specialists have pay demands, as do hospital consultants operating on lower two-tier contracts, so we need to sort out all of these issues.<\/p> <p>  I will make a number of points about occupational health.  It is outrageous to learn from the opening statements that there is no serial testing for front-line staff in hospitals.  If there is any place to use testing to hunt down the virus, it should be the front line in hospitals.  I cannot believe that serial testing is not being done or is only being done when there is an outbreak.  The fact that the roll-out of the vaccine has been haphazard and did not follow the infection rates is deeply troubling, as is the fact that there have been very few inspections by the Health and Safety Authority.  I make all of these points because staff are exhausted and facing burnout, their morale is low, they want us to fix these problems and they are facing into what, in my view, will be a tsunami of missed care that must be caught up with in the time ahead.  We cannot expect all of those people who have been through very difficult circumstances with all of the challenges they faced over the past year to face into all of that catch-up care if we do not support them.  <\/p> <p>  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha stated that the lack of routine testing and monitoring for exposed nurses, midwives and other front-line workers had exposed them to a greater risk of infection.  She said that, put simply, if we cannot see a problem, we cannot deal with it.  What was the response of the HSE when told by the INMO that serial testing was not happening?  We should bear in mind that over 50% of front-line staff who have been infected with Covid have been nurses and healthcare assistants, mostly women.  What was the response of the HSE when the INMO raised issues relating to testing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#H00100","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>The HSE has consistently said it will test only where there are outbreaks.  There is serial testing in long-term care but there is none in the acute hospital system or in the community outside long-term care.  The study undertaken in Tallaght and Galway demonstrates that this means we do not pick up asymptomatic presentation and 34% of the asymptomatic presentation was not picked up.  According to that study, this means that people were going to work with Covid-19 but without any symptoms.  We have been very critical of that.  Our members have sought serial testing.  To date, the HSE has been unable to give us a satisfactory answer.  It is now saying that antigen testing may be introduced.  Again, there is a lot of information around the efficacy and accuracy of antigen testing.  We believe that until the vaccine is rolled out completely with both doses, it is imperative that we know the status of healthcare workers when they are at work and this requires a routine testing regime to be in place.  We believe this is the role of the Health and Safety Authority.  It must look at the staff and the areas with the highest level of infection and where outbreaks continue to occur.  We know from staff that the acute hospital system continues to have a very high infection rate.<\/p><p>Evidence suggests that some policies of the HSE such as the derogation for staff who were close contacts to return to work did not assist in reducing infection levels and may have actually increased the infection rate.  Those policies must be tested from the point of view of the safety of the worker.  <\/p><p> In terms of staffing, I agree with my consultant colleagues on the issue of the two-tier system and I am glad the Deputy raised the issue of student nurses because not only are student nurses going into the eye of the storm, they are not being paid at all.  They are on zero salary and this committee must make a stand on this.  We met the Minister last evening and he is still standing by the position that that is okay.

The Collins report looked at the period between September and December and concluded that if the situation in the health service changed, it was open to the Minister to revert to the situation that was put in place by his predecessor last March.  We asked the Minister last night if he was going to do that but his answer was \"No\".  Nobody can argue that the situation has not changed.  Since January the situation has been, by any examination, much worse than it was last March.  Many students had three weeks of their placements suspended but fourth years have not had their placements suspended.  The Department of Health has advised that student nurses in first, second and third year will gradually return to clinical placement but it is extraordinarily haphazard.  The higher education institutes cannot tell us if those students will have to redo the placements that they could not do because their training was suspended.

The winter of 2019 was very busy.  We had a lot of overcrowding and our members were very tired coming into February and March 2020 when the pandemic struck.  When we hear the account by the HSE of changing capacity and surge capacity, what does it mean?  It means nurses and midwives in the main changed their roles.  Many of them moved from the areas where they practised and worked and went to work in intensive care surge capacity areas and changed their shifts and their attendance.  They worked extra shifts and continued long after their shifts ended to make sure the patients were cared for.  That is the reality.<\/p> <p>  Now, in the third surge, it has been more difficult because the requirement to provide high-level intensive care outside of intensive care units, with a total of 13 intensivists in the country, has put an enormous strain on the expertise of ICU nurses, who are in short supply, and on those who have assisted in recovery rooms and theatres.  There are also Covid wards with very high dependency patients.  Again, there is a high level of skill required.  It is the perfect storm of very low staffing to begin with, high levels of sickness and the requirement for the same pool to provide continuously the extraordinary work they have been providing.

Is there anybody at any level in any Department who is focusing on the crisis being faced by the health service from a recruitment perspective?

Deputy Shortall asked about childcare.  The unions collectively wrote to the Ministers for Education, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Health, Deputies Foley, O'Gorman and Stephen Donnelly, respectively, on that issue.  We have had no response from the Department of Education.  We asked that schools consider opening for healthcare workers to allow them to continue to go to work.  A nurse in Cavan does not have that facility but a nurse in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, does because they have kept the schools open for healthcare workers in that jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's specific asks, the unions have asked that if healthcare workers secure childcare within their bubble or anywhere else and there is a cost associated with that, the cost would be reimbursed to them in order to allow them to go to work, care for their patients and have the security that childcare costs will be covered, particularly as the day is much longer now that the schools are closed.

I thank the witnesses.  It is humbling to hear about the superhuman sacrifices our healthcare workers have made.  That rings hollow because we could spend half a year clapping them and then spend the next year and a half insulting them with the sort of letter they got yesterday stating that childcare was their own business and the Department would not do anything about it.  That is quite shocking.  We should published the letter and show how disrespectful the Department of Health is to all front-line workers in the healthcare service.  It is outrageous.<\/p> <p>  There are some things which jump out at me that have not been asked.  One relates to the Be on Call for Ireland initiative.  All of us remember that last year something of the order of 73,000 people responded to that initiative and that only 7,000 were interviewed.  Of those, only a few hundred have started work.  Has that been frustrating for the witnesses?  Do they believe the matter was handled badly?<\/p> <p>  References were made, I think by the INMO, to the way recruitment takes place to the effect that it is cumbersome, that it is a burden and that it should be changed.  I would like to tease that matter out, if possible, because it is shocking to see the number of vacancies that exist, including the 728 relating to consultant posts.  Our public health system just does not function.  I think it was the CMO who replied to a question last week by stating that the public health system would not be able to handle this surge we have in the virus.  If it is not able to handle it, then serious questions need to be asked of those who administer our health services.  Will the consultants comment on what is required for a decent public health system that can control the virus, administer vaccines and give control and power to the consultants to lead on these matters?<\/p><p> My final question is for Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha from the INMO.  In light of her comments on long Covid, the psychological impact on nurses of having worked through three surges in our health system and the numbers out sick, should we still recognise Covid as an occupational disease, particularly given the impact it has had on nurses and midwives, including student nurses and midwives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#O00600","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I am happy to address the consultant question.  It comes down to capacity and is about having enough beds and staff.  We have the lowest number of specialists in Europe, with 728 unfilled posts and significant unmet need.  We are asking for there to be enough colleagues for management workloads and safe call rosters, that is, just the basics so that we can do our jobs.  As for the infrastructure, what we have seen in terms of nosocomial infections is that our hospitals are just not fit for modern infection control, so we need rapidly to replace many of the acute beds in our system with single-room hospitals, that is, modern hospitals for modern infection control.  We know from history that it takes too long to provide public beds in the Irish system.  It takes seven to eight years, while it is turned around much faster in the private sector.  Some of that is tied up with tendering and processes.  We have a great deal of public land and we need to get new beds into the system that are built for modern infection control.<br\/><br\/>The 30% pay cut is the big barrier; we know that from talking to consultants who are on fellowship abroad.  Fairness is important in every aspect of life.  If two people are being treated differently and one is being paid 30% more than the other, it is not a recruitment and retention strategy.  That is the biggest barrier.  If that is addressed and more staff come in, people will be able to get through the work.  I cannot describe to the committee what it is like when one sees the impact on a child or adult who has been waiting so long on a list that he or she has a worse outcome.  There is a moral injury with that and it damages doctors, nurses and health professionals.  We need to remove it from our systems because when trainees who grow up in the system go away to Australia, New Zealand or America, as I did, and they work in systems where they can consistently feel proud and they do not have that moral injury and damage, they do not want to feel it again.  That is part of why they stay away.  If we fix the system so that it works for patients, and if we have capacity to meet need, that is when we will attract and retain people because of that feeling of being part of something excellent.<br\/><br\/>In many pockets of our health service, people are very satisfied with the care when they get in because we have excellent teams.  We saw that in the way that our healthcare workers responded to this crisis and stepped up, but too many people wait too long for access to scheduled care.  &quot;Elective&quot; care makes it sound as if it is not urgent, but if an elderly person cannot walk to the shops or to mass because he or she has hip pain, or if he or she cannot drive because he or she has not had a cataract operation, that elective care is essential.  We have to get the capacity into our system.  The belief that, somehow, our public health system cannot be fixed has to be tackled.<br\/><br\/>While I have this opportunity, I must talk about psychiatry.  There is a critical lack of beds in the psychiatric system.  When psychiatric consultants are on call, they do not have beds even for people who are suicidal.  They ring around trying to beg and borrow beds for people who acutely need admission with suicidal ideation or psychotic episodes.  We are discriminating against psychiatric patients and people with mental health issues.  We allocate 6% of the total health budget to mental health, whereas it is 12% in the UK and it still has issues.  There is an urgent need for parity of esteem for mental health in this country.  We are letting down a generation of Irish people.  We are seeing the impact of the pandemic on our children.  There has been an increase in the number of presentations with mental health issues to our paediatric emergency departments.  We really have to address this issue.<br\/><br\/>When I look to the trainees coming behind me, I want to fix the system so that they see a future leading and innovating in it and so that they will want to stay in the system.  As soon as the world opens back up, we will see an exodus because of the trauma of what has happened during this pandemic to our trainees and because of what they are seeing in terms of how our healthcare workers are being treated.  As Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha so eloquently articulated, we were abandoned when the schools were closed, with no plan for us.  In Northern Ireland and Britain, children of healthcare workers are going to school, whereas my children and my colleagues' children are being traumatised.  They are falling behind and we are too tired and burned out to help them with homeschooling when we get home.  I got home at 9.15 p.m. on Monday last and my seven-year-old was sitting there with her <i>Abair Liom<\/i>on the table, waiting to do her Irish homework with me.<\/p><p>I burst into tears.  I had nothing left to give.  She is stressed because she is falling behind.  The anxiety is through the roof.  We are not working from home, so we are not there to support our children.  We feel we have been abandoned by the State at exactly the time when we have all stepped up.  We went into work every day before we were vaccinated, putting our own lives on the line, seeing colleagues getting sick, seeing colleagues being out with long Covid and not coming back, knowing that we were at risk of that ourselves, but there was no plan for us.  The schools just shut and there was nothing to help us, but it was our problem and our cost to absorb.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabrielle Colleran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I do not have time to call Dr. Colleran's colleagues.

The Senator might recall that the ambulances were backing up at the time in Letterkenny General Hospital.  Nurses and doctors were going into the ambulances and they had not been vaccinated.

I have been in this job for less than a year, and I am already becoming weary of the constant conversations about how the system was not able to deal with things before the onset of Covid-19.  Given the way things are now, and considering I am already weary of it, I can only imagine how utterly wearying and draining it is to be working in the system.<\/p> <p>  I cannot get over the stark situation regarding the low numbers of staff and their low morale.  As everyone has remarked, the information we have and which we are discussing is all from before Covid-19 struck.  We now have this explosion of chaos, if I can put it so delicately.  Not only were the numbers short before this, we now have appalling treatment, if I could be so bold as to put it that way, of the staff in the system.  We have as a result the double whammy of trying to keep people in the system, while also trying to recruit people into the same system.  Arguably, people would have to be mad to come into a system like this one.  It seems incredibly bleak.  I commend wholeheartedly, therefore, all the work being done by staff.  <\/p> <p>  It is fair to say that the conditions in which work is being undertaken by these staff include being overworked, underpaid, stressed and burnt out in respect of mental health.  In respect of several articles and studies having been published on this aspect, I also think it is fair to say that many people will exit the system at the other side of this crisis.  People here have referred to that prospect already.  We not only have a problem, therefore, with getting people into a system which is already drastically understaffed, but we are also going to have people scarpering out the door as soon as it is reasonably safe to do so.  I think that would be a fair enough assessment.  <\/p> <p>  Is the answer to addressing this situation an extremely aggressive recruitment strategy, involving elements such as pay parity and improvements in conditions?  It seems to me that the solution on paper is quite simple, namely, better conditions, better pay and getting going pretty lively in recruiting people into the system before other people head out the door when it is safe to travel again.  How do we get all of that happening, though?  It seems these committees have Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha coming in repeatedly to lay out the details of these bleak situations, but we are not moving anywhere in addressing them.  We are not going anywhere with getting solutions to these problems.  I do not know what to do as a public representative in order to bring these solutions about.  I am at my wits' end, and I am only here a few months.  What is it that needs to happen?  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of student nurses, which is my favourite topic to talk about, some 93% of student nurses in 2014 said that they were considering emigrating.  I would not be surprised if 100% of student nurses were now considering emigrating.  Again, here we have another problem coming down the line.  It seems that we are constantly talking about this problem coming down the line, but that we have already jumped over it because we have now been landed with Covid-19.  I am so flabbergasted as to how we are supposed to deal with this issue.<\/p><p>I am astonished by the patience of those presenting today and their ability to keep their decorum, as it were, when this situation is so ridiculous.  Many here have spoken about student nurses.  The Labour Party has published a Bill to pay student nurses and midwives.  I am really excited to see the appearance of the cross-party support that would be needed to get it over the line.  It seems to me that everyone nods and agrees that student nurses need to be paid and the situation is not good enough, but people are not willing to put their money where their mouths are and support changes in the legislation to do that.<\/p><p> Those are observations that Dr. Colleran or Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha might respond to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#S00500","speaker":"1663","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":233,"content":"<p>The Senator has hit the nail on the head.

Sometimes we come here and speak but we do not feel heard when we do not see action.  We have to see engagement and action and that is what is missing.  Those of us on the consultant front just want to have enough colleagues for safe manageable workloads, for call rosters that are safe to be able to provide the care for all the patients that need to see us.  I just want for anyone who needs to see a consultant to see them within six weeks so that no patient has a worse outcome because of the wait.  These are basic things.

That is what we are doing.  She is right that we do need a recruitment strategy, but at the moment we have something more like a removal strategy.  The safest and surest way to build up the consultant capacity that we need is to train our own consultants.  We are not doing that.  We do not have enough training places and we are not bringing people through who could get into those consultant posts.  This is something that will become very real.  We took in the biggest ever intern cohort last year and the system has not put training places in place to get those people going through the system to be trained to be consultants.  We are going to lose many of them.  That is a removal strategy; they are going to go.<\/p> <p>  When people come to a consultant post, if they have had experience abroad, as Dr. Colleran said, they will not come back to work here for 30% less than their colleagues.

That needs to be addressed and reversed.  There are 728 consultant posts vacant or not filled substantively.  That is incredible.  These posts used to be like Olympic gold medals.  We are not doing that properly.<\/p> <p>  I have referred numerous times today to the fact that public health medicine is our insurance policy.  We have one third the number of the public health specialists who should be consultants as there are in Scotland, which has a similar population size and similar geographic dispersal of population.  By virtue of the age profile, we will also lose a lot of people there and we will not be able to replace them.  The next time this happens, if it happens again, we will not get away with it.

The first thing it can do is make sure that there is a policy decision that the moratorium on recruitment, if and when it is reintroduced, can never apply to nursing and midwifery, as it has in each of the moratoriums that have happened since 2008.   It has not applied to consultants but it has applied to nurses and midwives.<\/p><p>We have, therefore, been constantly running to try and undo the damage done by the moratorium.  One should remember that we are still very reliant on overseas recruitment from non-EU countries.  That is a major issue right now, because we have a lot more evidence that this pandemic affects communities from the black, Asian and ethnic minority groupings to a greater extent.  We have to look at that and put specific protections in place because we are very reliant on that community of healthcare workers in Ireland and that will continue into the future because there is a global shortage of nurses and midwives.  The first ask, therefore, is policy to ensure that moratoriums cannot apply.  Thankfully, we now have a scientific tool as part of Government policy to determine how many nurses we need but that must be funded and rolled out across the health service.  We cannot just decide how many nurses and midwives we need based on the available resources.  There will be science behind it and it will be based on the patient dependency.  The framework on nursing and midwifery staffing is accepted as Government policy, but it has to be funded to be rolled out.  If one wants to open one ICU bed, seven ICU nurses are needed.  That is not possible to do overnight, so one has to pre-plan and put a lot of planning in place.<\/p><p> The health and well-being of all front-line health workers who have been battling this pandemic will be severely compromised.  We have lodged a claim to have respite for them, hopefully when the number of admissions to hospitals and community care areas reduces, the workload reduces and the vaccines take hold and reduce infection rates.  That must be addressed.  The committee should promote that.  We should do what other countries have done.  We should show appreciation for the extra give in response to the ask.  Compensation must be afforded to the health service workforce for that.  Senator Hoey is very familiar with the student nurse issue.  I have heard her speak on it previously but this committee must comment on it.  It cannot be silent on it because it is exploitation.  This is 2021 and we are in a pandemic and there is no excuse for trying to portray what student nurses have contributed as not being work.

We are certainly not out of the woods and yet there is some cause for hope with the roll-out of the vaccine, albeit it at a slower pace than everyone in the country would like, but it is progressing nonetheless.  The situation should improve.  As the witnesses have articulated, staff on the front line are still exposed to the ferocity of the situation and the risk involved every day.

The first relates to the vaccination of mental health staff.  We continue to see real difficulties in the mid-west region.  A fortnight or three weeks ago I put a number of questions to the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>He advised me there has been a devolved function in terms of vaccination roll-out for front-line staff, that each hospital group has received a certain number of batches of the vaccine and, using the disbursal criteria, the groups are ensuring their staff are vaccinated.  In the mid-west and particularly in Ennis General Hospital the mental health nurses have been passed over.  The front-line medical nurses have all been vaccinated and vaccination has moved down through other elements of the staff, including administrative staff, ground staff and people who during their working day, even though they are in a risk environment, have some mitigation measures around them such as perspex and the like.  However, the mental health nurses continue to circulate and go into homes without the benefit of vaccination.  Is the INMO aware of that?  It is not to blame, of course, but is it aware that some of its members continue to be outliers and have been passed over in the chain on command?<\/p><p> I saw with great interest about two weeks ago that Bantry General Hospital in west Cork was a poster boy for vaccination.  It had gone through all its staff and had started calling in the local GPs.  The mid-west does not appear to be at that point.  Will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha comment on that?

Many doctors have been in contact with me and told me about the early days when the portal opened in which they had to register for vaccination.  Many of them went through the first and second pages of inputting data, but then the system crashed several times.  Some of them did not get around to it a second time because of the immense workload they take on each day, or when they did, a week had elapsed.  Some of them tried a second time, but again the same technical glitches were encountered.  Basically, they did not get to register properly and by the time they did, they are of the view that it set them back in the roll-out calendar, as it were.  They have fallen further back.  I note that Dr. Colleran has her hand up, so perhaps one of the witnesses can deal with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#V00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I will comment on it.  Absolutely, there was a design flaw in the roll-out of the vaccine.  The sequencing document is the document that ought to be followed, but I am not entirely clear that it was interfacing with the portal on which one would go and register one's interest in getting the vaccine.  We are told that it has been fixed, that the sequencing document has been brought up to date and it is now fixed with the portal.  There are still issues in terms of getting registered for vaccination.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to mental health.  I will say a few words on mental health, which is important.  We have been contacted by doctors, both NCHDs and consultants, who are mental health doctors, psychiatrists and trainee psychiatrists and are employed by one arm of the HSE but who work in the acute hospitals.  They have experienced difficulties in getting their names put on a list in an acute hospital by virtue of the fact that their payroll is somewhere else.  Those are the types of issues we are still trying to iron out.  They have damaged the confidence we can have in this vaccination campaign.  Hopefully, we are approaching the end of such problems.  We need to be because the psychiatrists I mentioned have unscheduled care commitments and see patients who present through emergency departments and wards.  They absolutely need to be vaccinated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#V00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Anthony Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Owens.  Dr. Colleran might intervene in a moment, but I wish to make a final point and she can respond to the points generally.  My last point relates to long Covid, which a number of people have mentioned today.  Typically, in a work environment if one is out for a long period, one is referred to Medmark Occupational Healthcare and there could be certain screening barriers to somebody returning to work or remaining out of work.  Are front-line staff encountering any of those barriers?  Is it accepted that one may not present with antibodies but one still has the symptoms of long Covid?  Is that generally accepted across all strata of the health service or are people being referred to Medmark Occupational healthcare, being scrutinised and having those barriers put before them?<\/p><p>The final thing I will say is that the vaccination of healthcare staff, across all spectrums, is important.  There are ancillary or therapeutic staff who enable children with learning and physical difficulties to attend education as best they can.  I was teacher until the general election.  There are still many services, such as the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, that are not engaging with children online or face to face.  It is not for our guests to solve but, as some of those staff are members of some of our guests' unions, we need to see those people out there and offering supports to children at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#V00500","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":244,"content":"<p>There are very high levels of Covid-19 among mental health workers and consultants.  Services are under extreme pressure because of the number of acute presentations and the lack of beds.  It is essential that they are prioritised.<\/p> <p>  I want to take this opportunity to emphasise something that is key for us to talk about, that is, our public health specialists and infrastructure.  People sometimes get confused between the acute public hospitals and the public health infrastructure and the staff who provide it.  As the IHCA does not represent public health specialists, I cannot be accused of having a vested interest in this matter, other than the same vested interest that we should all have in having a public health system that works.  We do not give consultant status to public health specialists in this country.  We are an outlier in that regard and it massively impacts our ability to manage pandemics and to plan healthcare.  It is essential for that to be addressed and all of the outbreak management and contact tracing falls under the auspices of, and is led by, public health consultants.<\/p> <p>  The elephant in the room is that vaccine roll-out is hampered by the fact that we do not have a universal health identifier for people.  We do not have public health IT that is fit for purpose, compared with the UK and other countries.  Those other countries are well able to prioritise people and have back-up lists because they have a universal health identifier and the required IT infrastructure.  We have the specialists.  Public health specialists are trained to consultant level in public health.  If we actually pay them properly, give them the tools that consultants have in terms of teams and software resources, they will optimise our response and we will reap those benefits, societally and economically.  It is incredible to me, as an individual watching this, that 11 months into the pandemic, there are only 60 public health specialists in the country, as Mr. Owens earlier outlined.  In Scotland, which has a similar population, there are 180.  That we have not addressed that and upped the numbers of public health trainees, given them proleptic appointments with consultant status at the end of it, is incredible and must be addressed.  This is not the last pandemic.  We may not even be experiencing the last surge of this one.  Until we tackle climate change, we are going to have more and more pandemics and our ability to respond to them without locking down our society is dependent on having the public health infrastructure, including the people, IT and structures.  If this committee takes just one lesson from this meeting, that is it.  It is essential.  It is what has hampered us and is a part of why we are rolling from one lockdown to another.  We do not have the public health capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabrielle Colleran"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I will direct my first question to everybody.  Has a deadline been set for the roll-out of vaccines for all front-line staff who are in contact with patients or potential patients?  If not, why not?<\/p> <p>  My second point relates to student nurses.  Has the emergency nature of the call to student nurses to work in extraordinary circumstances in which they would not normally have to work been established?  They are putting their health and lives at risk to a large extent.  Has the emergency nature of the need to respond been conveyed to the HSE and the Minister?  If not, why not?<\/p> <p>  How should the concerns raised today be relayed through the system to the appropriate authorities?  Delays have taken place and I understand why all of the people concerned are upset and annoyed at the delay that follows the need for action in any particular area.

We, as a committee, need to know how best we can deal with that in order to bring it to the attention of the powers that be.<\/p><p> Have any of the witnesses been told the reason for the delay in the service plan?

We have been meeting with the HSE on a weekly basis on this matter.  As it stands, only 49,000 are fully vaccinated.  I know figures are thrown out about so many doses, so many vaccines etc., but that is the reality.  The figure I gave refers to those who have received their first and second doses.<\/p> <p>  It is nearly by chance that healthcare workers are getting the vaccines this week.  If the decision had not made regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine, healthcare workers' access to vaccines would probably be delayed until next week or the week after.  When the decision was made in regard to the over-65s and over-70s, it meant that the vaccines in question were available to healthcare workers this week.  We understand the portal is open and live today.  We understand that front-line healthcare workers began to be vaccinated yesterday and are being vaccinated today.  That refers to first doses; they will have to get a second dose in 21 to 28 days and, in the case of AstraZeneca, after a longer timeframe.  It is going to be a significant period down the line, into March and April, before those healthcare workers are fully vaccinated.  The understanding from the HSE at the moment is that by the end of February, all of those staff will have got their first doses and some of them will start getting their second doses.<\/p> <p>  I know my colleagues would like to respond on the other matters raised by Deputy Durkan but I have a couple of other points to make.  We have said all along that the vaccination portal, which is only working today, or at least we hope it is working today, was meant to be in operation from 28 December last.  Six weeks later, it has only begun working from today.  That has been a major failing on the part of the HSE in terms of its IT infrastructure.  The portal was meant to be up and running when the vaccinations were up and running.  It is clear that healthcare workers have delivered.  Nurses and doctors on the front line administering the vaccines have delivered.  They have done so across seven-day weeks and covering long hours.  Some of them have gone in voluntarily in their own time to get the vaccines rolled out.  Front-line healthcare workers have rolled up their sleeves and really delivered in that regard as well as trying to provide a Covid service and a normal healthcare service.<\/p> <p>  In regard to student nurses, the dithering that has gone on by the Minister and the Department of Health is completely unacceptable.  I am not making any political points here, because I am completely apolitical, but when the situation was bad last March and April, the former Minister made a clear decision to utilise the student nurses to allow the health service to respond to the crisis.  No one can doubt that January this year was much worse than the scenario that existed last March and April.  Why the dithering?  The Government must make the decision to utilise these valuable, skilled individuals to allow the health service to respond in a situation where we have had 7,000 to 8,000 people absent from work.<\/p> <p>  An issue that we have not focused on at all is the situation in long-term care facilities.  The reality is that we talk about the numbers in ICU and in our acute hospitals but many patients with Covid-19 are in our long-term care facilities.  Many of them are not even going to acute hospitals.  Many of them are on syringes and are receiving a high level of care at a time when staffing is decimated in those services.  We have had staff from across the public service redeploy into our long-term care facilities in order to care for those patients.  That situation has been overlooked.  It is time to start publishing the figures for Covid-19 patients in our 582 long-term care facilities as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar Gilligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan mentioned costs to the system.

They went way beyond the call of duty.  I know this full well because members of my family were involved in the healthcare sector in a number of different areas.<\/p> <p>  I will start by asking just three or four questions.  The first is to Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha.  She spoke at the very start about the failure to respond quickly enough to the demands of the nursing staff.  Nursing staff are on the front line.  They know sooner than anyone else when change is required.  I was looking at the HR report from the HSE.  There are 7,800 nurse managers.  Nurses, obviously, will go to the nurse managers.  Is it the case that nurse managers are not getting the response quickly enough from the administrative level of the HSE to make the changes that are required?<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns nurses who have retired from the system and now want to get back in.  I understand that the Nursing and Midwifery Board is looking for a fee of &euro;350 for such nurses to re-register.  Has the INMO engaged with the Nursing and Midwifery Board on this issue?  It sounds like an extremely high charge to impose on people who want to come back in and give assistance at present, when there are huge demands.<\/p> <p>  My third question concerns consultants.  We have seen the figures for the number of GPs who are due to retire over the next few years.  There are around 600.  Have we any idea of the number of medical consultants who are to retire over the next three to five years?  Are there particular areas where we do not even have people in training to fill those vacancies?  The second issue I wish to ask the consultants about concerns the number of specialist registrars who are in training at present.  What is the total number per annum across all areas who are in training?  What kind of increase do we need to put in place in order that we have an adequate number of people to take on the vacancies as they arise?<\/p> <p>  Finally-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#Y00400","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Deputy Burke has less than three minutes left and he has asked a number of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#Y00500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>All right.

There is not at present.  The WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, for example, were advocating that we look at the wearing of FFP2 masks for greater protection in early January.  We had to lobby the HSE and wait for a national circular from it before the practice was allowed to change across the health service.  Nurse managers gave a testimony to us that they went and sought these masks and their release to staff when they asked and they were refused.  In one location staff were threatened with disciplinary sanction if they continued to ask for those masks.  Eventually, we got a letter from the HSE which opened the door and allowed the policy change in respect of what was appropriate to wear during the third wave and, obviously, with the higher contagion of the new variant.<\/p><p>I hope that answers the Deputy's question.  It illustrates how bureaucratic the system is.  There is a significant amount of national control.<\/p><p> Health and safety measures have to be put in place much more quickly.  It cannot be a case of always waiting for an incident to occur.  Preventative measures have to be in place and thought about because this pandemic is changing all the time.  With new variants, we will need agile and quick responses to protect workers.  That is simply what is missing.<\/p><p> On the issue of the availability of staff etc., I refer to the whole area of Sl&aacute;intecare and the fact that 82% of care of older persons services are privatised.  There are many waiting lists etc., but there is 30% availability of private hospitals.  Surely the committee can comment on that, considering that there is bed capacity of 1,900 beds, a large proportion of which are single rooms, in the private sector.

We anticipate there will be an exodus of younger consultants abroad as a result of the working conditions they are being offered here unless we sort that issue out.  In addition, workforce planning indicates that we need an increase of 51% in the number of consultants.  That equates to approximately 1,600 extra consultants needed in the system to match the current demand.

Currently, Bus &Eacute;ireann provides more than 220 State-supported, or public service obligation, PSO, routes nationwide.  We also have a fully commercial intercity service, Expressway, and we operate the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department of Education.  In the 2019-2020 school year more than 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to schools throughout the country as part of this scheme.  This is unparalleled in its scale throughout Europe.<\/p> <p>  We are in our 35th year. While the last year has been one of the most challenging in our history because of the impact of Covid-19, we are delighted last year to have introduced the single most significant enhancement of public service obligation services, PSOs, with the support of funding from the National Transport Authority through the July stimulus.  The link between investment, improved services, higher levels of customer satisfaction, which leads to increased usage is very clear.  This type of initiative demonstrates a commitment to maintaining growth in public transport, notwithstanding the current challenges we face during Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  Our 2,700 employees have been at work throughout this pandemic.  They have ensured that essential services continued to be delivered for those who depend on them most.  I would like to pay tribute to the dedication of all the employees and many who deliver services on our behalf.  These people were very steadfast right throughout the crisis in demonstrating a very strong public service ethos associated with Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>  The board and management are very thankful for the ongoing support from the Department of Transport and the Department of Education, the National Transport Authority, NTA and CI&Eacute; and for the very constructive engagements we have with the trade unions which represent many of our staff to ensure safety continues to be at the forefront of everything we do.<\/p> <p>  In 2019 Bus &Eacute;ireann carried 89.4 million passenger journeys.  It was our highest level since 2008.  The company  saw a return to profit for the first time in five years.  However, in 2020, Covid-19 related drops in passenger demand and public transport capacity restrictions created financial challenges for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It forced us to take some very difficult decisions on a number of our commercial services.  We had to do that to protect the remaining network in the longer term and continue serving more than 150 communities which rely on our Expressway services.<\/p> <p>  Our commercial services are currently relying on temporary support for the next three months under the commercial bus operator direct award contract but every route needs to be sustainable in the longer term.  If there are any issues of connectivity, we liaise very closely with the National Transport Authority, NTA, as it has the ultimate responsibility to assess demand and provide connectivity if it is needed.<\/p> <p>  We believe Bus &Eacute;ireann has a central role to play in many of the ten strategic outcomes outlined in the national development plan, so for the convenience of committee members I will make my comments under some of the headings outlined in the plan.  The first is compact growth, strengthening rural economies and communities and enhancing regional accessibility.  What we would say in that regard is that while the National Transport Authority is responsible for overall connectivity nationwide, we work closely with it to ensure integration of services across our nationwide network.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has the reach and transport skills to participate in any plan which connects Ireland and to support sustainable urban and rural development, efficiently and effectively.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, we have experienced significant growth in regional cities and towns.  In particular, when we have investment that goes in by way of additional fleet and increased frequency.  Some examples I cite are that in 2019, we grew city passenger numbers by 50% in Waterford, by 70% on route 220 in Cork and by 60% in Drogheda with a doubling in frequency.<\/p> <p>  Having the right infrastructure in place for buses to operate efficiently and on time, such as bus priority measures, real time information and ongoing investment in regional roads and motorways is key to incentivising people to make the shift from car to bus.  Where infrastructure is in place, the impact is clear.  We look forward to planned BusConnects projects sitting under this plan.  We see it as a key in transforming bus transport in our cities.<\/p> <p>  It is essential that sustainable funding is in place for all routes that have a public service obligation and that supply and demand is carefully considered and balanced for routes which require a commercial licence to ensure that these services can become sustainable again when the recovery begins.<\/p> <p>  We also provide services to more than 1 million people through our free travel scheme.  As our population continues to age and grow more generally, demand for our services will increase again.  The demand-led school transport scheme we operate on behalf of the Department of Education continues to grow.<\/p><p>We look forward to actively participating in the Department of Education review of the needs of the scheme, including the sustainable transport plans for schools for the future over the coming months.<\/p><p> Under the headings of sustainable mobility and a transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society that are called out under the national development plan, this year we have confirmed orders for 204 new vehicles and we are making considerable improvements in the transition of our fleet to greener, cleaner, more accessible vehicles.  We will not be introducing any diesel-only buses to our city and town fleets.  We are beginning the process of switching to hybrid vehicles in our city and town services very soon and that will start in Galway over the next couple of months.  For longer routes, we are exploring hydrogen fuel cell power and investing in Euro VI diesel vehicles.<\/p><p> In 2020, we were the first transport company to operate Ireland&rsquo;s first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle in a unique trial between Dublin and Meath.  That was led by Hydrogen Mobility Ireland and we plan to add three hydrogen buses on route 103 in Meath in quarter 2 of this year.  We are also leading on a project to roll out the electrification of Athlone town services in partnership with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and our company car and van fleet will all be fully electric by 2025.  By 2030, half of our fleet will be zero emissions and all diesel vehicles will be at least of Euro VI engine emission standard, which have up to 90% lower emissions than some of our current diesel fleet.  We need multi-annual funding commitments to continue.  We see them as being critical in ensuring we can deliver on these targets.<\/p><p> In summary, we believe bus and coach transport is highly flexible, safe and demand responsive.  It produces much less carbon dioxide per passenger kilometre than the private car, and can increase passenger numbers more rapidly than any other public transport solution.  It can do that within a year to 18 months of investment approval.  The current national development plan includes very ambitious plans to grow and to green public transport nationally.  Both will help to deliver economic recovery post Covid-19.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is looking forward to the opportunities presented by both the growth and the greening of public transport.

He will be aware that Bus &Eacute;ireann has delivered new services to areas like Kilkenny.  The NTA has been working on a proposal for a long time.  Has Mr. Kent held discussions on the provision of a town bus service for Ennis?  It is incorporated in a document called Ennis 2040, which will shortly be published by Clare County Council.  Similar services are being rolled out in towns the size of Ennis.  I would like to hear his views on that.<\/p> <p>  We have had different results over the last number of weeks in relation to some services being delivered by Bus &Eacute;ireann in County Clare.  I welcome the fact a service, around which there was a question mark and which delivered people from Broadford to Limerick city, has been reinstated.  I received calls from people living along the estuary in a village called Labasheeda in west Clare.  Basically, their service has been discontinued but the slack has been taken up by Local Link, which is very welcome.  Funding has been provided to do that through the job stimulus and I welcome that.<\/p> <p>  This leads on to my next question.

We do not operate the Kilkenny town service.  That service was put out to tender and is operated by another operator.  The Navan town service, for example, is one that has been significantly enhanced most recently, in respect of frequency and buses that were added in to the service.  I am not aware of any direct conversations with the NTA to date in respect of the town of Ennis.  Obviously, much of what we have put into operation over the last number of weeks has resulted in a significant enhancement both for Limerick city and connections for west and east Clare.  However, on the actual specifics of the town service, we would be very interested in discussing potential movements with the NTA, if it were to be considered.  All activities and the plans going forward as part of this, typically go out to consultation.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct to state that Local Link has been used very effectively as a service by the NTA to integrate with services that are included in the direct award contract that we have.  We operate 220 routes within that.  Typically, those routes are integrated for connectivity with other services that might include Local Link or, indeed, other operators, commercial or rail services.  That is typically where it has happened.  If demand is not currently at a certain level, or if it is more efficient for the State to deploy funding in a way to provide more of a feeder service onto the main arteries, that has been typically the approach that has been developed.  Other than that, in respect of the development of the main arteries, all of the main issues can be seen in the national development plan to address capacity.  If capacity is required, we deploy it.  Speed of service and the ability to go from A to B are things Bus &Eacute;ireann and the NTA are continuously trying to address, so that we can get the right levels of frequency and coverage in places like some of the towns.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy said, particularly as the Covid pandemic unfolds, it is possible that many more people may decide not to live in Dublin and to settle elsewhere.  We have watched the news like everybody else.  That is going to be an interesting part of how things will develop in the future.  The aspects of interchange, directness of service, having the right levels of capacity and deploying it efficiently, dictate the way things are happening.  If there is demand for a service, then it will have to be considered in that context.  If there is a possibility to provide that service, we will be very willing to engage in relation to that.  That is all I would say.  Typically, where services have been redeployed into Local Link, it is because it is more efficient to do so.  On the main services that we are deploying, we are trying to make sure that we are deploying them with the right levels of capacity, speed and frequency, and to do that in unison with the other operators if they are involved.  That is what is happening at this particular point.  This has been the approach since 2019 and there is a broader project in relation to connecting Ireland under way.  That is all I can say in response to the Deputy.  If the question needs to go further, we can probably bring it to and discuss it directly with the NTA, because ultimately it has the responsibility for connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>There is a route between Ennis and Shannon.

I guess we were right, in advance of the onset of Covid-19, in giving some consideration to providing enhanced infrastructure, such as bus stops, and achieving a better understanding of some of the shift pattern movements.  Some of those changes were certainly in train before Covid-19 struck.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that those changes are still encompassed in many of the plans being considered.  An example is route 343, in respect of enhancing that service with better buses and ensuring they will be more accessible.  I can tell Deputy Carey that I would be very happy to engage in what he has just suggested.  It would be subject to funding, however.  Providing the additional frequency of services and redeploying the buses required is something we would depend on the NTA to do.  To be fair, there is no lack of willingness on its side.  We are all reliant to a great extent on funding coming through so we can provide that better service and bring in the improvements of which the Deputy spoke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#F00300","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kent and all the staff of Bus &Eacute;ireann for their hard work on the front line during the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#F00400","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>On the scale of State support needed during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic and in respect of the projected plans for Bus &Eacute;ireann's future expansion, what level of investment is being sought from the Government?<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of unmet needs, many people would agree with the point made by Mr. Kent regarding investment leading to improved services and a higher level of customer satisfaction, and that those aspects are self-fulfilling.  There are significant levels of unmet needs across the country.  I am thinking of areas and new communities in my constituency which have no bus services.  Some 4,000 people live in Stamullen and hundreds of people live in Kentstown.  I could list all these areas.  It is the same with the school bus transport scheme and the situation with concessionary and non-concessionary tickets.  The unmet need this year was unprecedented.  Is this a matter entirely for the NTA?  I ask that because surely Bus &Eacute;ireann's drivers know these areas and the communities which are growing very well.  What upward pressure is coming from Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of the NTA and delivering services in those areas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#F00600","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I will take the last question first.  We have regular weekly interaction with the NTA regarding planning teams.  We have a network planning team and the NTA has a similar team, which is looking at all those issues.  The Deputy is right about small villages like Stamullen.  There are many such towns and villages that, typically, we would be looking at.  All these aspects again come back to the fact that within the direct award, as granted to us, there are still 220 routes.  Several of those routes could possibly be changed and extended, as that is allowed under the direct award contract.  Those changes allowed can involve alterations to scale and frequency and additional permeation.  We know society is always changing, so the NTA addresses those aspects when it is possible to do so and it works on that process with us.<\/p> <p>  Turning to additional villages that may come on stream, the Deputy might be aware of an example of that happening just before Christmas when the small village of Portroe got a bus service for the first time and was connected to Limerick city.<\/p><p>That was certainly a part of the consultation with the NTA.  However, it is the NTA that would make that decision and then we deploy the services to do that.  Therefore, we are entirely reliant on funding being made available to pay for driver hours, to pay for the fuel, to pay for the maintenance and to pay for the vehicle.  If that funding has been available, we have been providing it.  As I said, we had a unique opportunity at Christmas.  There were 112 jobs created in this business here and 26 additional vehicles deployed for a fleet, but that was all part of the Government stimulus that was created to connect all those additional frequency services in towns that went in.  It came with an additional price tag.  From the NTA's point of view, it was an investment by the State of an additional &euro;10 million.  That is what went in to deliver those levels of service.  As I said, it is probably, certainly in my tenure here since 2013, the largest investment I have seen.  We believe it is the largest, maybe, in 15 years.  It was part of a Government stimulus package and I think that we will see the results of that.  It is very encouraging if we can bring those in and connect them but, as I said, it still has to be the subject of an effectiveness and efficiency review.  If a smaller village is not best suited by us, it may be addressed by Local Link or by another operator.  That is typically the way it may end up happening because all of the PSO services are supplemented by commercial services.<\/p><p> Returning to Deputy O'Rourke's question on the State support, we have been very thankful during Covid because there has been a huge amount of additional funding provided for services, in particular, on the PSO side.  We are currently recovering many of our costs, including lost revenue.  During parts of Covid, we lost up to 80% of revenue and, in one extreme, 90%, which was at the very beginning.  That, obviously, oscillated through the summer as reopenings occurred.  The revenue deficit has been made good and the costs have effectively been recovered for the NTA during that period, including, as I would say here for the benefit of the public, a large amount of the additional investment in all of the sanitisation regimes and everything that we could deploy to make the service as safe as possible.  I am glad to see, even at this point, that we have not had any Covid-related-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I need Mr. Kent to conclude.

Hopefully, Mr. Kent can address that.<\/p> <p>  I will also address the issue of the service that was discontinued from my own part of the county, from Whitegate, through Scarriff, Tulla, Broadford and onwards, to Limerick.  I thank Mr. Kent for his engagement and for reversing that decision.  Unfortunately, it should not have happened.  When Bus &Eacute;ireann is offering some good news, we all get the press release.  It is important, too, that Bus &Eacute;ireann engages with us when it intends to change a service.  As others have said, it is appropriate that some of the routes are handled by Local Link rather than through Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Kent probably needs to engage the NTA and Local Link a little more to ensure that we do not have that drop in service as was talked about there.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carey referred rightly to west Clare.  That is being resolved through Local Link.  There was a conversation with Local Link, probably, a month or six weeks in advance, which meant that there would be no discontinuation of a service.  That is the way to go when Bus &Eacute;ireann is changing its services and I recommend that.<\/p> <p>  I also want to recognise Bus &Eacute;ireann's staff and Mr. Kent for what they have done for us through the pandemic.  That has been really helpful to consumers.<\/p> <p>  I am glad Mr. Kent raised the issue of the Portroe to Limerick service.  It is just across the water in County Tipperary but it has potential positive implications for County Clare.  Mr. Kent may be familiar with the twin towns of Ballina and Killaloe and I would hope that he could see some possibility in that service taking in Killaloe.  As the service transverses from Portroe to Limerick, a loop into Killaloe would enhance the service greatly, would give many more people an opportunity to avail of the service and would see greater passenger uptake.<\/p><p>Quite some time ago, Bus &Eacute;ireann had a plan to introduce bus rapid transit in and around Limerick and onwards to Shannon.

There is no lack of willingness to participate positively in all those initiatives.

That is very much appreciated.<\/p> <p>  The provision of bus stops and bus shelters is the responsibility of the NTA in conjunction with ourselves.  Consultation is a part of that.  Obviously, we have some liaison with councils.  Typically, all of those inputs are made.  There has been great progress in recent years, particularly with shelters and trying to ensure bus stops are made more accessible in cities.  A lot of that work is continuing.  That is a steady state investment plan that is rolled out.  The NTA is at an advanced stage of procurement for bus stop infrastructure, which it has been trying to put in place for a number of years.  We are on the other side - we serve just short of 10,000 bus stops around the country, some of which probably need reinvestment.<\/p><p>Where shelters are put in place, that is typically by way of consultation with the city council to make sure that can be provided for and that footways, clearance areas and so on are all there.  I will take back the point the Senator has made.  He mentioned Maryborough Hill so I will ask what our input has been to that.  That might progress it on the Senator's side and if he keeps pushing on the council side, maybe it will come together.<\/p><p> The Senator asked about Expressway routes.  It was a difficult decision.  We are very reliant on Expressway, which is integrated in the business.  We have a large number of drivers, mechanics and staff that continue to work and deliver those services.  They are commercial in nature and, outside of what we have with Covid at the moment, they are completely reliant on the cost recovery that is happening.  Most commercial services out there are low-margin businesses.  That is just a fact.  For every route we operate, that is important, particularly when we are not in receipt of State money.  We do not get subvention for those routes other than what we are getting currently.  We were not getting a subvention in the period until July, so we ran many of those routes at a loss.  Revenue loss went to 90% and even at the height of it during the summer, we operated at about 50% of revenue.  One cannot operate a low-margin service with such extreme revenue loss.  In that period, we ended up having to look at the routes individually, which was done with detailed consultation with the Department and discussions with the NTA.  We had to take a view on the projections as to whether some of these routes would come back.  Our view on some of the routes was that their long-term viability could threaten the long-term viability of the other routes we are doing.  We took a decision on the 18 routes we operate to effectively come out of four.  As members saw last week, we came out on the Limerick route on 29 January, we came out on the Belfast route and, currently, in relation to the Senator's area of Cork, the X8 services and connectivity have been reduced but the long-term plan will be to come out of that.  That will be in consultation with the NTA so connectivity solutions can be identified in advance of any further decision.  It is pure economics.   We have to make sure a route can generate money to pay wages, to pay for investment in a new fleet because one cannot continue running old fleet and to pay for maintenance.  It is as simple as that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":290,"content":"<p>How does Bus &Eacute;ireann promote connectivity and how do people who have no access to a service get such access, if that is the model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#J00200","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":291,"content":"<p>We operate services by licence.

We say that openly as a company but there is only so far we can do it.  To do that, we have been reliant on funding from the NTA.  Where it is in place, we have stood up and been able to deliver and deploy that.  However, on other routes, where there is no possibility of revenue covering our costs, we get to a place where, as a commercial semi-State company, we have to make sure we can keep it all operating and we did not want to endanger the other routes that have a greater chance of coming back.

While I acknowledge that schools are not open at the moment, a large volume of students this year have not yet been able to reconcile the difficulties they have had with Bus &Eacute;ireann with regard to school transport.  It remains a big issue and I am glad a national review is under way, into which Bus &Eacute;ireann will have significant input.  Its staff have probably been pulled 100 ways by the public and public representatives.<\/p> <p>  As an example, Corofin in north Clare is a typical Irish village.  Mr. Kent may or may not know it.  It is quite close to the Burren.  As one leaves the village, one can see the typical typography that is around any village, such as streams, dykes and ditches, and they form the parish boundaries.  They are the very parish boundaries that become the hard cut-off point between a student qualifying or not for a ticket; it is totally illogical.  This probably worked in the 1940s and 1950s, when buses started to be seen going down rural roads.  They would pass people going to the local creamery and the parish boundary was a drain or a stream.<\/p> <p>  It is totally illogical in 2021.  It forces some people to go three miles one way to a primary school, while the cr&egrave;che or childminder might be six miles across the Burren, and then they have to drive to Ennistymon school afterwards.  It is illogical that large numbers of people pass one another unnecessarily on the road each morning, and that is just one example, although it could probably be applied to every village in Ireland.  The case of Corofin is replicated throughout Clare and Ireland.  The new model for school bus transport has to be based on supply and demand.  If there are five or six kids in a community, that should logically dictate that there be a stop.  It should not come down to streams, drains and ditches; that does not work.  I would like to hear Mr. Kent's views on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the overall bus service, I accept that Bus &Eacute;ireann is constantly seeking to enhance its offering to villages and communities.  I recently made a number of submissions to the company, particularly regarding the south Clare area, such as Parteen, Meelick, Ardnacrusha, Clonlara and Cratloe.  They are in the south of the county, a stone's throw from Limerick city, but they do not enjoy the fabulous city bus service that operates into the north suburbs of the city.  As Bus &Eacute;ireann examines rolling out an improvement in the service, it might also factor in these villages.  The two most recent censuses identified this corner of Clare as the largest population growth area.<\/p><p>I would like to hear the views of Mr. Kent in respect of the prospects for an orbital bus service around Ennis town, as raised by other members.  It is the largest town in Munster that does not have city status and is home to 18,500 people.  There is a significant hunger and demand for a bus service there.  Just last week, Ms Anne Graham of the NTA gave some positive vibes when I asked her about this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#K00500","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>On the issue of school transport, while it is evident that the scheme has been expanding, the difficulty is that, as was stated, it has always been subject to iteration.  In this particular case, eligibility criteria apply.  We do not have any discretion in that regard, but we will participate in the process and we will look at the issues raised by the Deputy with regard to particular locations.  More than &euro;200 million has been spent by the State to try to deliver school transport services.  In fact, coming into Covid, additional moneys were deployed so that we could do that in a socially distanced way for post-primary children.  On the issue raised by the Deputy, there are definitely opportunities within the scheme but it is always subject to review.  There has been massive growth in the scheme.  As I stated, whatever about 2019 when there was demand for 120,000 seats and that was growing towards 125,000, even during Covid there was still demand in September for 114,000 seats.  There was a very small fall-off in demand.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to places such as Corofin.  I understand that the school transport scheme is critical for rural villages around Ireland.  That is absolutely intrinsic to the scheme.  Bus &Eacute;ireann understands that better than anybody at the moment.  The company has been carrying out planning and making the effort currently being made in this area for more than 50 years.  However, our planning and effort are subject to the eligibility criteria, which are specified and agreed by the Department and signed off by the Government.  Whatever way it is done, it has to be all done as part of a wider review.  From our perspective, we stand ready.  We will do what we can do to deploy the services.  That is all we wish to do at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Forgive me for interrupting.

As such, Bus &Eacute;ireann would be like any other organisation and would have to participate in a process.  I cannot prejudice anything that is in the thinking of the NTA in respect of those services other than to state that I understand the way the Deputy is thinking.  There are several towns around Ireland of which I have been made aware that fall under the review of the NTA.

I reiterate the remarks of my colleagues in terms of the thanks we wish to pass on to the staff of Bus &Eacute;ireann for keeping services going, especially for those who depend on public transport and do not have access to a car to get them through these difficult times.  It is much appreciated and acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  I wish to elaborate on the last point made by Mr. Kent.  I believe we need to shift the focus a little from investment in roads to investment in public transport, both bus and rail.  The national planning framework seeks to ensure balanced regional development.  The NDP is up for review.  I believe there has to be significantly higher investment in public transport to meet not just the objective of balanced development, but also to ensure that when we seek to build houses, it is transport-orientated development.<\/p><p>We cannot be building houses everywhere depending on car transport.  When Mr. Kent looks at how Bus &Eacute;ireann can deliver balanced development, and he said that he knows rural transport as well as anybody else having been at it for so long, is the organisation limited in its fleet numbers?  Obviously it is limited in its fleet numbers to the service.  Is there a service static steady State view of public transport so that if Bus &Eacute;ireann had more fleet and higher ambition that was supported it could supply a lot more rural bus transport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#L00500","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments about staff.<\/p> <p>  To answer the question, there are two aspects.  One aspect is the infrastructure that the Deputy has talked about.  As he can see, under the consultations that we will have on the city, there is massive change required for a number of those cities.  There is just 30 km of bus prioritisation available outside Dublin, which is a radically low number.  If one looks at the consultation that is put in place for Limerick, for instance, where it proposes to get up to about 84 km in the city alone from its current 12 km.  Places like that, and putting that level of prioritisation in, will ensure confidence in the service and reliability regarding all of those issues that the Deputy talked about.  There is massive infrastructural development required in the regional cities to get bus prioritisation measures in place.  They need to be supported, with all of the things that he mentioned, bus gateways and all of those things that would allow buses to come in to closures and to give them prioritisation.  Nobody likes to be here, on my side of a table, ever having to apologise for the fact that the service has run late.  In fact, everything that we are trying to do every single day is to work on punctuality and service improvements.  So we are doing that in a measured way but to make the step change one needs the infrastructural change that the Deputy talked about and that investment needs to come.<\/p> <p>  The second part is vehicle investment.  Currently, we operate with a fleet of 1,100 vehicles and a lot of those are mixed age vehicles.  I am delighted to say that we had tranches of investment that came in in 2008 but then there was nothing until 2012 and another burst in 2015.  One needs steady State investment for a fleet and all of those things will get addressed now.  That is why I am delighted, under the national development plan, NDP, because it will provide capacity needs.  I must say that in the last of couple of years there has been huge investment by the National Transport Authority, NTA, to move from single decks to double decks so one will see, in regional cities, that a lot of those have come in in the last couple of years.  Now there are better energy efficient vehicles and everything is targeted at trying to move to having low to zero emissions.  So having the investment for those reasons alone is worthwhile.<\/p> <p>  On schools, it has been a very difficult part because we operate less than 10% of the services directly, under school transport, and a lot of those are reliant on vehicles that are cascaded old to new.  We have not secured investment at the levels required for school transport at this point and that is the subject of analysis with the Department.  To answer the Deputy's question, we need investment for school transport because I do not believe that children should be treated any differently.  In fact, a greener cleaner school fleet turning up at schools is such a positive message.<\/p> <p>  On the NTA, it has made great strides with investment in vehicles.  The NTA has funded double decker hybrids and hydrogen buses.  The only issue that we have, for instance on the Expressway routes, is that there is not currently anything outside of Euro 6 diesel engines for longer intercity routes but there are trials under way and we hope that things like hydrogen technology might come to bear to make them better.  On investment, particularly in commercial, people want toileted buses.  They want a relatively good standard of buses for their journeys and we need to be able to make sure that we give them that relative to the power.  We used to promote Expressway with the line \"like the car, only better\", and that is exactly how I feel.  It is what people get out of it.  As members will know, three out of four journeys in this country are by car.  That is a lot and we have to change that mindset.  So what I see in the NDP is investment in infrastructure, quality of service and fleet, and all of those things combined will move us a long way on the green agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I will be quick given that the time is approaching 11 a.m.<\/p><p>I refer to the good news on the fleet transferring to hybrid models.

For a company the size of Bus &Eacute;ireann to show some leadership on how carbon emissions can be reduced and to have that quantified would be very useful for other states and also private actors.

On the carbon emissions, as I have said, the biggest contributor to energy emissions we have at the moment is fuel and diesel types.  When one adds it all together, 97% of what we contributed goes out in fuel type.  As I said, when we start transitioning to modes such as hybrid that will provide around a 30% fuel saving on the current level.  Moving to electric will obviously have a huge additional benefit as we will effectively go to zero emissions at that point, and then there is hydrogen.  I have mentioned some of the other developments, whereby even where we have to settle for a Euro 6 versus what we used to have back in 2006 or 2008, it will deliver major savings in emissions.  We are tracking this.  To give the Deputy more confidence, our board has set up a sustainability committee which will commence in the company in March.  We are developing a full sustainability plan that will tie into many of the goals that will be set out across the whole business on everything we have to do to achieve the climate action plan.  We have started a lot of energy and climate action projects.  We will do that in consultation with the people who supply us with goods.  While it is a small step, last week we even had a vendor coming in who planted trees on our behalf in and around some of the places.<\/p> <p>  All of these are small measures but, collectively, the big issue we must address is the transition into more energy-efficient fuel alternatives.  That is the path we are taking.  I have no problem providing the Deputy with information on our current carbon emissions.  We can measure those and return with them.

Mindful of the short time available to us today, this opening statement is short and focused on one or two key issues identified by IALPA members as significant for the continued survival of the aviation sector in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>We refer to recent news coverage and reported comments from the T&aacute;naiste in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>on 26 January that &quot;international travel was unlikely to reopen until sometime in the future, but certainly not for the summer&quot;.  It appears that there is now a prevailing narrative that international travel is preventing Ireland from becoming a Covid-free island like New Zealand.  Clearly, the Government shares this view and is preparing to close Ireland to international travel further for the foreseeable future.<br\/><br\/>Regardless of whether an international travel ban will suppress virus transmission in Ireland, we are fully supportive of any measure aimed at protecting public health and reducing the prevalence of this virus.  However, Irish airlines rely on summer bookings to make enough money to tide them over the loss-making winter season.  The loss of a second consecutive summer season after an entire year of practically zero revenue will prove fatal for airlines that have already depleted their cash reserves.<\/p><p> The &euro;80 million support package for the aviation sector announced in November was essentially a grant for Ireland's airports, the majority of which are State owned.  The funds left over for the airlines may have, at best, covered a few days' worth of losses.  Our airlines are intrinsic to the success of an island nation like Ireland, and they supply economic lifeblood, bringing, among other things, foreign direct investment and an estimated &euro;10 billion into the Irish economy annually.  Every aircraft that leaves Ireland will represent lost jobs and lost GDP.  It is an economic fact that if our airlines are allowed to go out of business, the consequences for the Irish economy will be devastating.<\/p><p> Most governments have recognised such dangers and have accepted that if they are to intervene to prevent airlines operating for the sake of virus suppression, they must ensure those airlines do not go out of business as a result.  New Zealand, so often our favoured Covid comparator, moved quickly to extend supports worth $900 million to Air New Zealand.  Much closer to home, the list includes &euro;10 billion for Lufthansa, &euro;7 billion for Air France, &euro;2.5 billion for British Airways, and &euro;1.2 billion for TAP Air Portugal.  The UK Government provided a loan worth &euro;670 million to Ryanair, an Irish airline, such was the value it placed on its contribution to the UK economy.  We have provided the committee with a copy of recent media coverage detailing the state aid approved by the European Commission for dozens of European airlines from their respective governments.  Why does Ireland remain an outlier as the only European country not to provide meaningful financial aid to its indigenous airlines?<\/p><p> The window remaining for decisive action is fast closing.  Airlines plan and budget for their vital summer schedules at this time of year and they will soon have to make hard decisions based on expected market conditions.  Our Government needs to understand that creditors and airline owners will not allow for yet another lost summer.  They will cut their losses and move their money and assets to other countries that support aviation.  The market will not save Ireland's airlines.<\/p><p> If international travel must be suppressed into the future, significant financial aid for Irish airlines is the only option available to avert sectoral collapse.  If the Government acts to suppress travel, the Government must also act to save our airlines from the destruction that such interventions cause.  They cannot have it both ways.  We implore the committee to lobby the Government to provide meaningful financial aid to Ireland's airlines before it is too late.<\/p><p> Over the weekend it was reported that Aer Lingus accessed that &euro;150 million loan facility.  We understand that was to address a problem it had last year.  It will not do anything for the problem that has now been created because the Government has cancelled the summer of 2021.  In our submission we also include an IATA document on the importance of air transport to Ireland.  We also provide detailed information on the dozens of airlines across Europe that have received direct government aid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Cullen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>F&oacute;rsa represents over 80,000 members, including around 5,000 workers in airlines, airports, air navigation bases, aviation regulatory bodies and air traffic control.  Eleven months of pay cuts, lay-offs, redundancies and job insecurity along with continued uncertainty about the future have put aviation workers and their families under significant strain.  For many, mortgage and other debt incurred during this period will be a burden for years to come.  It is not sustainable for these members to continue to endure this hardship.  With no early end to travel restrictions in sight, thousands of jobs will remain at risk unless the State acts now.<\/p> <p>  While the industry and its staff have benefited from State wage supports, Ireland continues to lack a European-style joined-up Government approach to underpin jobs in the sector, protect aviation infrastructure and ensure the survival of a viable post-pandemic industry.  This runs the risk that Irish aviation will be left behind when the rest of the world moves on, with potentially devastating implications for the national economy and employment in the aviation sector, and the sectors and communities that depend on it.<\/p><p>It is highly likely - if not certain - that aviation will be among the last industries to emerge from this crisis yet the Government has been slow to engage fully with stakeholders.  Recommendations from the task force for aviation and this committee have been largely ignored.  This inaction is placing an entire industry at risk along with the jobs and connectivity it supports.<\/p><p> F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s written submission to this committee gives a detailed assessment of the impact of the crisis across the industry and contains a range of recommendations both for the sector as a whole and for specific companies.  I will draw particular attention to three industry-wide requirements.  First, we make recommendations regarding income supports that acknowledge their contribution to the sector and its staff while highlighting the need for a flexible, industry-specific approach for this phase of the aviation crisis.  There is a strong risk that the employee wage subsidy scheme, as currently constructed, will lack the flexibility required to underpin employment relationships in the sector, which is essential if we are to position the industry to bounce back post Covid.  F&oacute;rsa is proposing an aviation income support scheme similar to that in place in Germany, which enables employers to reduce hours rather than laying staff off, with Government income support for the time employees cannot work.  Second, we emphasise the need for Government-led social dialogue with employers and unions to underpin a sustainable and thriving aviation industry as we emerge from the pandemic.  Third, F&oacute;rsa is calling for the Central Bank to adopt European Banking Authority, EBA, guidelines for the extension of mortgage payment breaks in 2021.  The European guidelines do not currently apply in Ireland, where the application process is slow and onerous.  After 11 months of income reductions and no early sight of recovery, this is placing avoidable strain on our workers.<\/p><p> Ireland went into this crisis as a major force in global aviation and our connectivity to the rest of the world plays a crucial role in supporting economic activity and attracting inward investment.  It is, therefore, crucial that we act collectively to ensure that the industry not only survives the impact of this current crisis but is fit to perform robustly as and when safe international travel resumes.  F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s approach has been to work closely with aviation employers to maximise job protection but this approach cannot succeed without significant and continuing Government support and intervention.  The union continues to call for any such support to be contingent on the avoidance of compulsory redundancies and the offshoring of Irish aviation jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ashley Connelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I will not take as long because most of the points have been made and I do not want to repeat them.  To summarise, since we last met in November, the situation for our members has continued to deteriorate and has got much worse.  Connect not only represents members in the airlines and the airports but also those working in production areas.  At the moment, those workers are also experiencing significant lay-offs and redundancies and an inability, particularly among younger workers, to obtain mortgages, etc., because of reduced circumstances.  We have seen situations where workers have had agreements for pay, etc., deferred.  There are deep concerns about health and safety, particularly the roll-out of vaccines for workers in airports.  If people are to be ready for the upsurge, they must be protected for when that comes.  We all know about the downturn in figures and the impact of that on numbers.  We echo what has been said about increased Government support for the industry similar to what we have seen across Europe.  We are calling for some very precise issues that we feel have been missed to be addressed.<\/p><p>No worker should be subject to compulsory redundancy while his or her employer is benefiting from any Government subsidy during the pandemic.  The legislation on redundancy means that workers who are currently laid off or on reduced hours cannot avail of voluntary redundancy, yet that time is not counted as service.  If we are denying workers the right to voluntary redundancy, that time should be counted as service.  This is a serious issue for our members.  We would support a system similar to the German kurzarbeitergeld system or even that of Sweden, where workers who continue to work during the pandemic are supported through better terms.  In that context, we are concerned about a future skills shortage in maintenance and specialist roles because people are leaving the sector.  When the upturn comes, there will be a skills shortage.  Our members have particular and precise specialist skills in certain areas and we are concerned that when the upturn comes, which it will, there will be a shortage of skills.  In that context, we are asking the State to see this as an opportunity to subsidise the industry for specialist upgrading or maintenance works that could be done to get the airports and airlines ready for the upsurge when it comes.  Basically, we support everything else that has been said here.  <\/p><p> Approximately one third of our union members are in construction.  While construction has been badly hit, we understand that the sector will resume much more rapidly than aviation.  Aviation will not be where it was pre-pandemic until 2024 or 2025 according to the latest estimates.  Workers in the aviation sector will suffer the longest hit and they must be taken care of with some sort of scheme to ensure that while they remain in the industry, their earnings are protected. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kavanagh and now invite Mr. McGowan from SIPTU to make a four-minute presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#T00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to make a presentation.  The Covid pandemic has had a devastating impact on the aviation industry, which continues to worsen by the day.  All workers in aviation have suffered a significant drop in income due to the pandemic.  Those that have remained in work have suffered drops in working hours and pay, thousands have faced lay off and many more have lost their jobs on a permanent basis.  Flights and passenger numbers have collapsed and the industry has been brought to its knees.  The outlook for aviation in the short- to medium-term is bleak and workers face into 2021 with real uncertainty and fear for their jobs.<\/p> <p>  Despite a dramatic drop in earnings, workers in aviation continued to work throughout the pandemic.  This has allowed essential medical supplies, PPE and most recently, vaccines, to continue to arrive in the country.  While State supports through wage subsidies and financial support for the regional airports are welcome, they simply do not go far enough given the depth and breadth of the crisis.  <\/p> <p>  To ensure that we have an aviation industry post-Covid, a number of actions need to be taken immediately by the Government.  SIPTU recommends the extension and amendment of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, for the aviation sector to ensure that employment is maintained in the industry.  The scheme should be tailored for the aviation industry so it becomes a genuine short-time working scheme based on the German model that pays 85% of pre-Covid earnings.  It must be made conditional on several binding commitments from employers, including that no worker be made redundant on a compulsory basis and that no worker suffers a permanent reduction in any terms and conditions of employment, unless by collective agreement, while the employer is benefiting from the EWSS.  SIPTU recommends that Shannon Airport be returned to the same management group as Dublin and Cork airports.  The separation of Shannon Airport has not been a success and the Covid crisis has brought into question the airport's long-term viability.  Given the airport's absolute importance to the region's economy, SIPTU believes it must be brought back into the same management group as the other State airports.  SIPTU recommends the introduction of free and rapid testing for all airport workers and that aviation workers be given the vaccine at the appropriate time.  Any financial support by the State directly to airports or airlines must be accompanied by conditionality that prohibits compulsory redundancies or a reduction in terms and conditions.  We believe that such support is required at levels well above what we have seen to date.<\/p><p>In the absence of the Government taking meaningful action, we simply will not have a functioning aviation sector in this country.  Given we are an open island economy, the country will not recover to the full extent without a functioning aviation sector.  The thousands of people who depend on aviation directly and the hundreds of thousands in the wider economy who need a functioning aviation industry need the Government to act now through the tailored supports for which our union is calling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Things were bad when we spoke to the committee in October and they have got much worse.  There was no reopening date for travel back then and we assumed it would resume in the second quarter of 2021.  This has now been pushed out to the first quarter of 2022 with no prospect of international travel in 2021.  Last Thursday on \"Prime Time\", the Taoiseach said that travel had totally collapsed and that some of the measures are a deterrent to travel and will have an impact.  On 1 February at the daily NPHET briefing, the Chief Medical Officer said it is not realistic to expect people can fly to Europe or other destinations for summer holidays and the only beach they are likely to travel to is their local one.  We now have the &euro;500 fine for anyone travelling for nonessential reasons.  There is clearly no doubt that travel agents cannot trade.<\/p> <p>  We, as an industry, are responsible and customer focused.  We have always and will continue to follow public health guidelines.  However, if NPHET and the Government want to close down international travel for a year, they need to put in place the appropriate level of support if they want an Irish travel industry when international travel can safely resume.  We are a unique sector in that we have had to remain open to clients to facilitate refunds with practically zero income for almost two years.  The travel sector needs a bespoke response with a specific support as a consequence of being closed on public health grounds linked to international travel.<\/p> <p>  Let me summarise the supports in place.  The travel industry is accessing the EWSS similar to other sectors.  The scheme is available when turnover is down at least 30%.  We are more than 90% down and for 2021 we could be 100% down.  We also have no visibility on wage supports after 31 March.  Most of the travel industry is accessing the Covid restriction support scheme, CRSS.  This is designed to assist with nonpayroll costs.  To qualify, a business must be 75% down on turnover compared to 2019 and it applies from level 3 and above.  The travel industry has been told the scheme only applies to it at levels 4 and 5.  This is an advanced tax credit; it is not a grant.  The maximum threshold of &euro;5,000 per week seems reasonable provided turnover is &euro;4 million per year or less but for any travel company above this level the support simply does not cover non-payroll costs to any material extent.  This is a retail-focused assistance and does not cover all Irish licensed travel companies.  The CRSS does not support a downturn in business and is directly linked to the levels in the Covid framework but, clearly, travel agents are prevented from trading irrespective of the levels, and have been since March 2020.<\/p> <p>  The Government introduced the refund credit note scheme in summer 2020.  This is a cash flow mechanism to assist with delayed supplier refunds.  We need to be clear that the refund credit note is not a grant, a subsidy or a support.  It is a pure cash flow mechanism introduced with a nine-month delay on the assumption that the industry would be back trading.  Clearly this is not the case and we need a solution to this issue similar to the approaches adopted with EU approval in Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal, Bulgaria and others.<\/p> <p>  This brings us to the issue of airlines refunds or the lack thereof.  When we spoke to the committee last October, we outlined the potential reason for the delay on the part of one particular airline being down to a conflict over two EU directives that impact the travel industry.  This has turned out to be the case and we can go into more detail in the question-and-answer session.  The fact is that a significant number of refunds to customers for cancelled flights are outstanding.  Given the current talk of no international travel for 2021, we need to discuss the issue of consumer protection and refunds when flights operate contrary to Government advice on travel.  These are known as \"ghost flights\" and the ultimate loser is the consumer.<\/p> <p>  Committee members may also recall that the ITAA called for pre-departure airport testing when we addressed the committee back in October 2020.  The aviation recovery task force, the airports and airlines also called for predeparture airport testing.  What ensued was a debate with the medics over which test should be used and none was introduced.  Subsequently, we have been dealing with the issue of variants of Covid that arrived into Ireland in late 2020.  Was predeparture airport testing a missed opportunity?<\/p> <p>  When we addressed the committee in October, there was no talk of vaccines.  The State is spending &euro;1 billion a week in supports and related costs and we are being told there is a vaccine supply issue.  There does not appear to be a supply issue for some countries and given this is a life-saving opportunity, it appears that we are lagging well behind in getting the vaccine into the arms of our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hackett"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hackett. <\/p> <p>  We have about 21 minutes remaining and eight members can have 2.5 minutes each.

It was in a closed period until a couple of weeks ago.  Aer Lingus is part of IAG and is in a closed period.  It will announce its results at the end of February or in early March.  During these periods, the airlines cannot talk to anybody about their financial state.  Other airlines have indicated to us that they asked for assistance from the Government.  If we are to believe those executives, they said none was forthcoming.  We understand however that there has been some discussion with the Government.  That is all confidential, based on market sensitive rules on share prices and so on.<\/p> <p>  There are aviation economists in IALPA whom we use for various negotiations.  The airlines need assistance in the form of direct State aid.  They cannot take on any more loans on their balance sheets.  It is important to note that when we last spoke, there was a reference in the committee's report to green shoots for 2021.  It came as an enormous surprise to us in January when the Government effectively closed international travel for the summer of 2021.  Every assumption we built into our plans was that we would get to a space of at least 70% of the 2019 production in 2021.<\/p> <p>  That has now been scuppered.  We will be lucky if in 2021 we get to 10% of the 2019 level of production.  Therein lies the problem.  We will also go into 2021 without the cash we had in 2020.  A lot of bookings were made in early 2020 for the summer of 2020.  That booking cash is no longer available and we are going into a zero revenue 2021.  Problem after problem is being heaped on us.  All the assumptions for getting out of this crisis have now proved to be false.  It looks like there will be a recovery in quarter 1 or 2 of 2022, if there are any airlines to take on that recovery.  That problem is massive and cannot be dealt with through loans from ISIF.  It has to be dealt with through direct financial State aid.  That is now the only way out of this. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I apologise for the time constraints but we have no choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#V00400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>In regard to the scheme are making reference to, it is the short-time work benefit scheme, kurzarbeit.

I was also involved in restructuring negotiations following the economic crisis in 2008 and 2009.  This is, by a multiplier of ten, far more serious.  All those crises had certainty about their ending and about what needed to be done to fix the problems.  The uncertainty created by this crisis is extraordinary.  In the context of having an entire summer cancelled after the previous one being cancelled, no airline in the world structured its finances around being able to go for two years without revenue and still pay its obligations to the aircraft lessors.  That is where the big cash drain lies.  Aircraft are extraordinarily expensive.  When they are not in operation and making money, they are very expensive indeed.  Paying those leases is what will pull us down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Cullen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. Cullen's assessment.  Aviation is an industry that has been through many crises in recent decades.  Yet, the depth and breadth of this crisis is almost impossible to articulate in terms of the impact it has had on the industry.  I do not believe any of us could ever have imagined that we would be looking at a situation where almost two years' worth of activity is likely to be lost.  It is almost impossible to articulate the depth and breadth of the crisis.
