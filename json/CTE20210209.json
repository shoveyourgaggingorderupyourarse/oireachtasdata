Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate if he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and he is also attending remotely.<\/p> <p>  Today, we are engaging with officials from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to discuss its 2019 financial statement.  To assist us we are joined remotely by the following officials from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board: Mr. David Gunning, chief officer; Mr. Phelim Devine, project director;Mr. Jim Farragher, finance manager; Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director; and from the Department of Health by Mr. Greg Dempsey, deputy secretary general.  I welcome you all to the meeting.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their computers when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  I also ask that contributors use the button to raise their hand when they wish to contribute and that they remove their masks when speaking to ensure they can be heard properly.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile telephones are on silent mode or switched off.  When they finish speaking they should take down their hand signal.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  However, a number of today&rsquo;s witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask members, where possible, to direct their questions to a specific witness.  If a witness has not been referred to, I ask the witness to state his or her name before responding. <\/p> <p>  Before I ask for the witnesses&rsquo; opening statements, I must make members aware that on Friday I received correspondence from the interim Secretary General of the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt, concerning the difficulty in discussing cost and timelines for completion of the hospital until the board and the Department finalise an analysis of these matters, which is currently ongoing.  I responded that the matters raised by the interim Secretary General could be addressed as part of today&rsquo;s opening statement.  The correspondence will come before the committee on Thursday.<\/p> <p>  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021020900002#B00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612875600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is a special purpose public body established in 2007.  It is responsible for the planning, design, construction and fit-out of a new children's hospital located at the St. James's Hospital campus in Dublin and of two new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres based at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.<\/p><p>Following completion, the hospital and the units will be operated by a separate agency, Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, which was formally established on 1 January 2019.   <\/p><p>It is noteworthy that the new outpatient and urgent care centre located at Connolly Hospital has been commissioned and became operational in mid-2019.<\/p><p> The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is funded by State grants provided by the Health Service Executive.  In 2019, such funding amounted to just under &euro;200 million.  The board&rsquo;s statement of financial position indicates that, as at the end of 2019, the cumulative value of the assets under construction was &euro;422 million, inclusive of VAT.  This was the position after transfers valued at &euro;34.9 million and &euro;2 million to the HSE and Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, respectively.  These relate to the transfer to the HSE of the newly-constructed building housing the outpatient and urgent care centre, located at the HSE&rsquo;s Connolly Hospital, and the transfer of specialist equipment in the Connolly unit to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland.<\/p><p> The 2019 financial statements were certified by me on 17 June 2020.  The financial statements were qualified on the basis that, following the directions of the Minister for Health, the hospital development board accounts for pension liabilities only as they become payable.  This does not comply with the requirements of the financial reporting standard, which requires that financial statements recognise the full costs of retirement benefit entitlements earned in the period and the accrued liability at the reporting date.  Other than the pension accounting, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the board&rsquo;s financial position at the year end, and of the transactions during 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021020900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612875600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and now ask Mr. Gunning, on behalf of the board, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021020900002#C00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612875600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for their invitation to discuss the 2019 accounts.  I am joined by Mr. Phelim Devine, Mr. Jim Farragher, finance officer, and Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, all of whom are on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.<\/p> <p>  The board was appointed to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital on a campus shared with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin 8 and the outpatient and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown and Tallaght University Hospital.  In December 2018, the Government approved an investment decision of &euro;1.433 billion for the project.  As has been stated since the outset of the project, there are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainty for them and nor can there be for the duration of the project.  These include construction inflation, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes and the employment order.  From August 2019, in accordance with the contract, the contractor has recovered the cost of national construction inflation in excess of 4%.  The inflation payment to the main contractor for the period of August to December 2019 was &euro;1.6 million including VAT, paid in July 2020.<\/p> <p>  The board's 2019 accounts were audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 12 June 2020.  The expenditure as of 31 December 2019 for that year on the design and build of the hospital was &euro;199,622,610.  This spend was against budgeted spend of approximately &euro;262 million.  This underspend in 2019 is primarily due to the fact that the main contractor did not advance the construction of the build against the planned original programme.  This lack of advancement of programme is primarily due to underresourcing of the project by the main contractor, a situation that has been in place since the beginning and which continues.  By way of an example, at the end of December 2019, the year in question, the contractor had progressed 8.5% of the works by value when it should have progressed 22% of the works by value and this delay has continued to grow month on month.<\/p><p>An analysis of the expenditure to December is set out in the table in the document provided to the committee.  I do not propose to read out the numbers as I presume members have them in front of them.<\/p><p> Moving on to the programme timeline, the construction contracts for the project were awarded in August 2017 and the construction\u00a0completion date for the new children's hospital set out under the terms of the contract was\u00a0August 2022.  When the construction is completed, the hospital will then be handed over to Children's Health Ireland for a period of commissioning ahead of opening.  When we last presented to the Committee of Public Accounts in November 2019 and to the Joint Committee on Health in 2020, we informed both that the project was behind schedule.  Since then,\u00a0the delay has been exacerbated as a result of the Covid-19 crisis and ongoing issues with resourcing\u00a0on the site.<\/p><p> The outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown was completed in May 2019 and successfully handed over to and opened by Children's Health Ireland in July 2019.  The\u00a04,600 sq. m paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Tallaght University Hospital was\u00a0contractually scheduled to be completed this month.  However, the contractor has advised us that construction will not complete before September.  The\u00a0 building will then be handed over to Children's Health Ireland in order that it can open the facility after an eight-week period\u00a0of operational commissioning and equipping.<\/p><p> The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board tracks progress and performance on a weekly and monthly basis and continues to engage with the contractor in an attempt to make up lost time.  The contractor\u00a0 is contractually obliged to provide the development board with a compliant programme of works which\u00a0sets out its approach to delivering the new children's hospital in accordance with the\u00a0contract.  However, since the agreement of the programme as part of the phase B instruction,\u00a0the programme updates provided by the contractor have not been compliant with the\u00a0contract.  As a result, the development board is currently withholding 15% of monthly certified payments until\u00a0such time as a compliant programme is submitted.  This is one of the levers permitted to the board under the contract to incentivise the contractor to deliver on its contractual obligations.<\/p><p> While the contractor has been underperforming as regards project execution, it has been\u00a0extremely assertive as regards claims, as has been indicated at previous meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and the Committee of Public Accounts.  Since the commencement\u00a0of this project, there has been a significant number of claims of a very substantial value.\u00a0 There is an agreed dispute management process in place under the contract.  As matters stand, claims are active at all levels of the dispute management process,\u00a0which involves the employer's representative, the project board, conciliation and adjudication.  One of the cases has reached the High Court.  We have also been involved in a number of adjudications.  The board is defending each claim robustly in\u00a0order to manage the cost of the project and defend the public purse.  However, the sheer\u00a0volume and nature of claims on the project is consuming a significant amount of executive\u00a0and project team time and incurring significant costs.<\/p><p> Updates on timeline challenges and the associated impact on cost have been shared with all\u00a0key stakeholders through the established reporting and governance structures, primarily the\u00a0children's hospital project and programme steering group and the children's hospital project and programme board, which has members from\u00a0the Department of Health, the HSE and Children's Health Ireland.\u00a0 In addition to the regular reporting, the development board has undertaken a detailed review of progress on the project.  The objective of this report is to provide as much clarity as possible to all stakeholders on the implications of any delay, both in terms of the ultimate\u00a0delivery date of the hospital and the forecasted impact on cost.<\/p><p>The development board's analysis has been submitted to the Department of Health and we continue to work closely with our colleagues in both the Department and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, as the analysis submitted is now subject to a robust, independent review and scrutiny.  We look forward to returning to the committee in due course to discuss the final details of this report upon its completion.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the fact that there are delays to the programme, the building is taking shape, as committee members will see from the images distributed in the briefing pack.  Over 90% of all concrete has been placed and we have been advised by the contractor that the concrete frame will be complete by the end of this quarter.  The stone and glazed facade to the south fingers, the south elevation and part of the east elevation is well advanced, with the first finger block at the Rialto bridge now completed.  The main mechanical and electrical plant at basement level is nearing completion, with the primary distribution under construction up through the building.  The fit-out of the south fingers comprising outpatients, cardiology wards, therapies, etc., is progressing well and the fit-out of the hot block, which comprises the emergency department, critical care and theatres, has already commenced.<\/p><p> The development board is aware of how badly needed the new children's hospital is and of the impact that further delay will have on the children and young people, their families and the staff who are waiting for it to open and indeed on the residents who live close to the site.  Everyone working on the project is focused on making the new children's hospital a reality as soon as possible.  I look forward to answering any questions the committee might have on the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021020900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612875600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gunning.

My name is Greg Dempsey.  I am the deputy secretary responsible for the governance and performance division in the Department of Health.  This includes the newly created strategic capital investment directorate, which has responsibility for major capital investments, including the new children's hospital.<\/p> <p>  The national paediatric hospital project is the most significant capital investment project ever undertaken in Ireland's healthcare system.  The development of the new children's hospital is a Government priority project and will bring together the services currently provided at three children's hospitals into a modern, custom-designed, world-class, digital hospital to deliver the best care and treatment for Ireland's sickest children.  As well as playing a central role in the provision of excellent paediatric healthcare services, it will be the primary centre for paediatric education, training and research in Ireland.  The project comprises the new children's hospital at St. James's Hospital as well as outpatient and urgent care centres located at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown, and Tallaght University Hospital.  The construction project forms one of three interrelated elements of the new children's hospital programme for the delivery of a new paediatric model of care in Ireland, the others being the ICT infrastructure and the operational integration of the three existing children's hospitals.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, or the development board, is established under a 2007 ministerial order and has statutory responsibility for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital and the two satellite centres.<\/p> <p>  Under that same order, the development board is charged with keeping all proper and usual accounts and all special accounts as the Minister may from time to time require and, additionally, to submit an annual financial statement to the Comptroller and Auditor General for an audit report to be carried out in accordance with the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  The board's annual financial statements for 2019 were submitted to the Department on 11 August 2020, following the completion of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit.  They were then laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 August, pursuant to section 11 of the 1993 Act.<\/p><p> The board receives its capital funding for the project from the HSE as the sanctioning body for the new children's hospital programme.  As set out in the 2019 financial statements, costs of &euro;199.6 million were incurred by the board in 2019.  I am satisfied by the Comptroller and Auditor General's note as to the completeness and accuracy of the accounts and by my Department's internal review of same.<\/p><p> I will take this opportunity to thank the board for the work it has conducted since it was last before this committee with the Department, including the completion of the additional governance systems and increased resourcing and expertise recommended by the 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report.  This puts the board in a strong position to deliver the project to completion.<\/p><p> I will also take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the outgoing chair of the board, Mr. Fred Barry, for the work he has done in the past few years leading the board and this project.  I must not forget the sterling work of the other members of the board.  For the Department of Health, finding a replacement for Mr. Barry is an immediate priority and officials have already initiated the process to seek to appoint a new chair through the Public Appointments Service.  This may take time but it is considered important that we cast the net wide to find the right candidate for this challenging role.  In the meantime, and to ensure continuity and leadership, the Minister is likely to seek an interim chair for the board.<\/p><p> I note the significant progress that has made to date on the St. James's Hospital campus despite the challenges that Covid-19 has imposed on us all.  The board advises that it has already submitted a progress update to the committee illustrating the activity to date and it is welcome to us all that the distinctive design of the building is now beginning to take shape.<\/p><p> I am aware from the invitation to today's meeting that, in addition to the task of examining the 2019 annual financial statements, committee members have expressed an interest in the timeline and projected costs for the completion of the hospital.  The Department acknowledges the responsibilities and duties of the committee and the interest of members in such matters.<\/p><p> A thorough analysis of the project was sought by the Minister in the summer of 2020 and the Department and other stakeholders have been working closely with the development board in the intervening period.  The development board and the Department are nearing finalisation of this long and detailed analysis, which includes a determination of potential updates to the timeline and costs of the project.  A submission was recently received by the Department and is now subject to review by departmental officials, together with a robust and thorough independent analysis and scrutiny.  This is an important quality assurance step to be able to provide assurance as to the validity of the modelling used by the development board to the Government and other stakeholders, including this committee.  This detailed analysis is nearing finalisation.  Following its completion and submission to the Minister for Health, who commissioned it, an update on the position will be provided to the relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p> It is anticipated to have a final determination before the end of February or in early March.  The Department and the development board would be pleased to return to appear before this committee early next month to address the areas of interest to it and will be in a much better informed position at that stage to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021020900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612875600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dempsey.

Those particular numbers are a key part of the submission we made to the Department, which will be shared with the committee in the not too distant future.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the PwC report, eight particular recommendations applied to the development board and a number applied to the HSE and the Department of Health.  For the eight recommendations, there were in the order of 45 specific action items.  The development board formed a board subcommittee to supervise the implementation of those actions.  Again, I can confirm to the committee everyone of those actions were discharged and the remediation plans were put in place.

If I may, I will begin by briefly summarising my career before setting out my vision and priorities for the authority.<\/p> <p>  I joined the ESB as a graduate engineer in 1973.  As members will know, this was at the tail end of the rural electrification scheme that underpinned one of the greatest societal transformations that this country has seen in terms of its impact on people's lives.  One of my last assignments in the ESB was to head up the newly formed ESB Networks directorate and, in that capacity, to revisit and upgrade the rural electricity networks to make them fit for service in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>  In 2005, I was appointed as the CEO of the newly formed EirGrid.  Over the following years, we assumed responsibility for the all-island electricity market.  We also built the east-west interconnector, which was a &euro;600 million project that we brought in on time and within budget.  I am particularly proud of the work we did in setting EirGrid on a path to be a world leader in integrating wind energy in the power system.<\/p> <p>  Since retiring in 2012, I have been active in a number of energy-related activities.  On behalf of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, I chaired an expert group to develop an energy research strategy to support the transition to a low-carbon energy future.<\/p> <p>  For the past six years, I have chaired Vita, an Irish development agency that works in east Africa with a mission to reduce poverty, hunger, and inequality among rural households through knowledge backed, community-led initiatives leading to sustainable livelihoods.  Climate action, both mitigation and adaptation, is a core element of our work with these African communities who are on the front line of the climate crisis.<\/p> <p>  As president of Engineers Ireland in 2016 and 2017, I witnessed and worked with a community of professionals who are determined to play their part and lead on climate action, and, critically, to inspire the next generation to take on the technological and societal challenges that we face.<\/p> <p>  The reality of the existential threat posed by climate change is, I believe, beyond question.  The science is very clear.  The Paris Agreement sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2&deg;C and closer to 1.5&deg;C.  The Government is committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, a halving over the decade, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  We saw last week in the joint report by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, that emissions last year reduced by 6% on the previous year, and that was largely due to the impact of the pandemic.  We know the size of the challenge we face in the next ten, 20 and 30 years.<\/p><p>However, having a clear goal to aim for, one we all subscribe to, is extremely powerful as a means of unlocking the energy and creativity of all sectors of society to deliver that goal.  A good example was the target of 40% renewables in the electricity sector by 2020, which many believed to be unattainable back in 2008 when it was set by the then Government.  That target had the effect of changing the mindset and delivering a major energy transition on the supply side, a transition that is still under way with the development of solar, offshore wind and further interconnection.<br\/><br\/>The focus now changes to the demand side in transport, industry, the public sector and residential homes, where our decarbonisation efforts have been less successful to date.  This is perhaps not surprising.  Here we are looking for behavioural change and investments at the household and community level at a time when many households are struggling with the impact first of the financial crisis and now the Covid-19 pandemic.  This societal transformation will take leadership, time and collective effort.  Nevertheless, we know from past experience that societal transformations, underpinned by major energy transitions, can and do occur and bring us to a better and more sustainable place.  I mentioned the rural electrification scheme earlier as one example of that.<br\/><br\/>The good news is that momentum is building.  The moral and ethical imperative, as expounded by Pope Francis and Greta Thunberg among others, reinforces our sense that sustainable living is the right thing to do.  Government policy, incentives, regulations and emerging technologies are helping to turn this ecological awareness into behavioural change and sustainable investments at the household, community and business levels.  It is also the right thing to do economically, in terms of the new jobs and business models created and the new and innovative products and services developed and taken to a global market.<br\/><br\/>That brings me to the role of the SEAI.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">We are an agency of government working directly with homeowners, communities and businesses in delivering a cleaner energy future for Ireland.  Over the last decade SEAI has delivered major impacts for Ireland.  We have helped to inform and shape policy, we have provided access to genuine solutions and been the portal for many people and communities to engage with new technology and sustainability.  <\/font>Thanks to SEAI, more than 250,000 homes are warmer and cheaper to run, more than 500 communities have started their sustainable energy transition, thousands of businesses are more competitive and Ireland&rsquo;s public services are exemplars in energy efficiency.<br\/><br\/>To build on this platform and to deliver on the targets set out in the programme for Government and the climate action plan, we in SEAI are now in the process of stepping up a gear.  We are putting in place the leadership team to drive the organisation forward and we are recruiting the people with the necessary skills - technical, communications and community engagement.  We are preparing our next statement of strategy for the period 2021-2025, a key theme of which will be collaboration.  This will include: collaboration with businesses, industry and the public sector and with other State agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland, collaboration with the SME sector, for example, in the establishment of a national climate cluster, collaboration with our energy research and innovation sector, to help develop the technologies and innovative approaches needed and, most importantly, collaboration with all actors in the retrofit sector, with local authorities and primarily with citizens and communities to drive the national retrofit programme forward.<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> Collaboration is at the heart of our work.  We deliver through others.  We in SEAI will be providing the leadership, the expertise, the ambition and the innovation that will drive and inform the change.<\/font><br\/><br\/>In regard to governance, SEAI is entrusted with significant Exchequer funds and we are very conscious of the need to be transparent and accountable in all our spending decisions.  Since 2011, SEAI has maintained SWiFT 3000 corporate governance certification from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.  I assure the committee that the maintenance of this standard certification remains a key objective for me as board chair and for the SEAI board, to ensure that SEAI operates to the highest international standards of corporate governance.<br\/><br\/>I am deeply honoured to be nominated by the Minister to lead the SEAI board at this critical juncture.  I can assure members that I will be giving it my full attention, working closely with the board, the executive team and the fantastic and dedicated staff we have in SEAI.  Through my work in Africa with VITA and other organisations, I have seen the consequences of climate change and ecological degradation on households and communities.  Climate action is for each and every one of us and I am committed to playing my part as chair of SEAI.<br\/><br\/>Again, I thank the Chair for the invitation and I will be pleased to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Byrne for his opening statement.

Few could be better qualified than he is, and in his opening remarks Mr. Byrne displays a real passion for the job.  I am delighted to learn that Mr. Byrne is assembling a new team and a new strategy.  The scale of the challenge is vastly greater than those in which the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has been involved to date.  I believe that the SEAI has done outstanding work in evaluating approaches and there is very good experience there.  The real challenge now is in scaling that up.  I am interested to know what role Mr. Byrne envisages the SEAI taking in scaling up the activity.  Will the SEAI be leading what Europe now calls a \"retrofit wave\", or has that yet been worked out as to how the elements of a strategy that involves finance, motivation, getting boots on the ground in local communities and adopting area-based approaches instead of individual approaches?  How far has the strategy developed on that?<\/p> <p>  My second question is on the extent to which Mr. Byrne believes the public sector is leading by example in the area of sustainable energy.  The sector reports regularly on its energy efficiency but the extent to which public bodies are taking it seriously or are in a position to deliver change seems to me to be very variable.<\/p> <p>  On the SEAI remit, the Act includes the promotion of renewables; research, development and demonstration; tackling pollution; and the co-ordination of the production, supply and use of energy.  It appears to me that the actual remit has been much narrower than the scope outlined in the founding Act.  Is it a part of Mr. Byrne's strategy to take on some of those wider roles such as co-ordination of research and development in the context of the need to see the emergence of hydrogen and other potential replacement fuels?  How far does Mr. Byrne see his role reaching in co-ordinating that sort of work, which I believe will be crucial to achieving our goals in the coming years, if not in the immediate year or two ahead?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#D00200","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>The scaling up and the retrofit wave is one of our biggest challenges.<\/p><p>We are conscious of that and we are gearing up for it.  We have already started the work.  We work closely with the Department on mapping out the targets etc.  We have a target of achieving 500,000 B2 ratings by the end of the decade.  When one looks at the graph showing that target mapped out over ten years, there is a mountain to climb.  We are conscious of that.  <\/p><p> We are putting in place the elements for SEAI being the national retrofit delivery body.  We have that up and running now as a project.  We have already started the work for 2021.  We have an increased budget.  We have two calls out at the moment, one of which is a one-stop-shop call.  The Deputy will know that one of the key issues is the development of a supply chain to deliver this.  That will take some time.  The one-stop-shop call is helping the contractor base and the supply chain to coagulate and come together to create the necessary one-stop-shops that will help us to deliver this.  We also have a community call-out, which is focusing on communities.  They are the first two elements that are off the block.  We are hindered a little by the pandemic, as we were last year, but all going well, once the restrictions are lifted, we hope to be up and running and doing the work for 2021, which is a target of 8,000 but, more important, preparing for the rapid scale-up for 2022 and thereafter.  We have a task force and a project up and running to deliver that.<\/p><p> On the public sector, under the climate action plan the target for the public sector was 33% efficiency by 2020.  It got close to achieving that target.  There are exemplars such as, for example, Dublin City University, An Post and Dublin County Council.  There are good examples of strong leadership in the public sector.  We are working across the public sector to deliver the know-how and technologies that will help.  The targets in the upcoming review of the climate action plan will be more stringent and will require leadership and best practice across all elements of the public sector.<\/p><p> On the remit of SEAI, having chaired the expert group on energy research and development in 2017, what was evident at the time was the lack of co-ordination.  That was one of the main findings of that group.  When I stepped into the chairmanship of SEAI late last year, I was glad to note that it had taken over the role of co-ordinating the research and development activity across the country.  It does that in a number of ways through funding research and development.  We have over 100 projects up and running by various research performing organisations, RPOs.  The national conference we held last October pulled together all of those research organisations to allow researchers to hear what other people are doing.  That type of information exchange is a great way of growing the collaborative effort across all RPOs.  We have additional funding of up to &euro;16 million for 2021.  That will make a difference and is necessary to carry out that work in an effective and efficient way.  I see that being very much of SEAI's remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#E00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I congratulate Mr. Byrne on his appointment.

I would be interested in hearing an outline of the plans of the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland around resourcing and training the community energy sector.  For example, the Scottish model provides an enablement grant of &pound;25,000 to help communities carry out feasibility studies and to get them up and running.  Mr. Byrne can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the SEAI has yet to fill the role of community-led energy adviser.<\/p><p>The current situation, where communities who are keen to be part of the energy transition and to get involved, whether they are small businesses, farms or schools, is that they are having to do deal with the CRU and the ESB directly, and they are organisations that are not used to dealing with communities and that do not have the communal capacity to do that.  If we really want communities to be a bigger part of the process, we have to support them in that process.

The first is that it is community-led, for example, the community-led total sanitation projects that we introduced into east Africa and which are now in widespread use.

Out of that, leaders emerge, which is fantastic to watch and to see.  The second principle is that we leave nobody behind.  Once we are in a community, everybody is brought into it and everybody benefits from it, whatever the project is and whether it is latrines, potatoes or otherwise.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the SEAI and communities, we work very closely with communities.  We now have up to 500 sustainable energy communities throughout the country and we support those communities very actively through grants, through helping them to develop skills, and through networking across communities so best practice is shared.  I think what the Senator is referring to is the renewable energy supports scheme and getting communities involved in that.  That is a critical part of engaging citizens and communities in our transition.  We are in the process of appointing the trusted energy co-ordinator, so we are very conscious of that role and we will be working with communities to develop those skills and to make communities better able to engage with the process.

It seems to be the case that many of the schemes are demand-led, so they are open for people to avail of them but they are not necessarily correlated with those areas of greatest need.  Mr. Byrne mentioned SEAI is working closely with the Department around mapping out the work programme for the time ahead.

Regarding the targeting of the schemes to the most at need, our warmer homes scheme is the biggest programme that we have to address fuel poverty.  That is the most substantial chunk of our budget.  It is &euro;109 million in 2021.  Unfortunately, last year, because of the pandemic we were not able to use our budget and there is a backlog.  A key priority for us is to address that backlog.  We can only work within the budgets that we have.  We have the same budget this year.  We are hopeful that we will make significant inroads into that backlog this year with the budget of &euro;109 million, if contractors can get out to do the work.  We have a new panel of contractors appointed and they are ready to go.  As soon as the restrictions are lifted, we hope to see rapid progress in tackling that backlog.<\/p> <p>  On targeting, we work within the eligibility criteria.  They were significantly opened up a couple of years ago with additional categories of people who can apply.  We are heading towards deeper retrofits than previously.  All that has to be factored in.  The Deputy mentioned not revisiting a house that has previously been worked on.  I hope that we will be able to do that in the coming years because we recognise that people are on a journey but we need to first go to the queue already there and the people who have not had anything done, and over time we will get round to delivering the full insulation allowable under the scheme.<\/p> <p>  We have more than 500 SECs now.  It is an active part of our work.  As I said in reply to Senator Boylan, I believe that communities are critical to this.  We are talking about people coming together in a community, including the local GAA club and local shops, with leadership at a local level.  It can bring about a remarkable transformation.  We are hoping to grow that network of communities to 1,500 by the end of the decade, when we will have most of the country covered.

Notwithstanding the commercial reality that one has to go through in identifying options, we would all like to see our post office being used more appropriately to deliver State services.  I see no better option than SEAI using the services of the post offices in communities to reach out to individuals who want more information.  In the work that we did in the Oireachtas, much of the commentary was about people not knowing where to access the services.

When it comes to energy, we know many of the solutions.  Going back to one of the first comments, it is about implementing them and the roll-out.  When we look at other areas when it comes to climate, it is more difficult to know what the solutions are.  As a public representative, I have been contacted by people who, number one, do not know where to go.  I hope that the one-stop-shop will be able to deal with that issue.  The other issue is that they do not believe that the financial incentive is big enough to make the change.  The warmer homes scheme is free for some people because they fall into certain categories but on the ground, when I am contacted by people living in rural parts of my community, the issue is that it needs to be enough of an incentive to make some kind of investment.  There is help to put a financial package around it but there is also that piece involving that change of mind that must happen when someone says that if he or she invests in something, it will save him or her money over time.  A key part of that element of the public is renters.  They do not have the capacity to make that switch themselves.

The benefit of having a warmer home is all the more evident for people who have it and its absence is also more evident to those who do not, in terms of increased bills and a lack of comfort.  Perhaps as a result of having to work and school from home during the pandemic, there will be a desire among people to improve the performance of their homes.  We are there to support that through grants but, more than that, it is about getting a decision made to go to a credit union and borrow money.<\/p> <p>  There is a sense that when such changes start to happen in a neighbourhood, a person can see other people doing it and can visit those homes.  We hope that people who have the work done will allow others into their homes, tell them what they have achieved and that it is fantastic.  If one speaks to people who have had the work done, one will hear how remarkable are the changes in comfort, warmth and well-being that one can get.  All sorts of other benefits, including health benefits, flow from that.  This momentum is going to build and we have a role in helping that to happen through our communications, mass media campaigns and working with communities on the ground.

I am sure we will engage with him again on the new statement of strategy for 2021 to 2025.  He spoke about increased ambition.  We are in a circumstance where we were looking at the recovery and resilience facilities that are coming from Europe, the State being able to take loans and a suspension of the fiscal rules that exist.  In terms of capacity, and if money was no object, how could we increase our ambition above 500,000 B2-rated homes in the next decade?  What could we do in that regard by increasing ambition on the number of B2s, the number of deep retrofits, as opposed to other retrofits, and scaling up on public buildings, including schools, as has been mentioned?  We have 90 public buildings but what would happen if we were to look at the large-scale retrofitting of other public buildings?  I know there are other capacity issues besides funding.  I am hoping to drill down to discover what are the other capacity issues, besides funding.<\/p><p>Will SEAI be looking at the issues of retrofitting and embodied energy?  Embodied energy is often not addressed in buildings.  That is something that needs to be added alongside retrofitting because sometimes buildings are demolished and replaced with more sustainable buildings when the benefits will not accrue for 100 years.  Will SEAI look at that?  Is it engaging with the national development plan and local development plans to look at retrofitting and embodied energy?  Where is the idea of new sustainable capital infrastructure being looked at?  That applies especially under sustainable development goal, SDG, 11 which applies to sustainable communities.  I would not mind hearing about how SDGs in general are being incorporated into the new strategic vision of SEAI.<\/p><p> Is research on energy storage a part of the innovation at which SEAI is looking?  We have heard a lot about carbon capture but I am interested in research on renewable energy storage issues.<\/p><p> I would query the language that Mr. Byrne about a \"split incentive\".  I am concerned about that because it is being used a lot by landlords who are asking what is in it for them when what is not in it for them is more relevant.  If we increase the acceptable energy standards for rental accommodation, does that create an incentive for landlords?  At the moment, there is a narrative that landlords are asking why they should do it when only their renters benefit.<\/p><p> Could there be a better, more positive use of environmental and social impact assessments in the sustainable energy sector?  Energy charter renegotiations are taking place this spring.  We know that RWE has launched a case against the Dutch Government for its plan to shift to renewable energy.  France is asking for the legal, institutional and budgetary modalities of withdrawal from the energy charter to be looked at.  Is that an issue that Mr. Byrne is following or tracking?  Does he have thoughts on the matter?  As well as supply and demand, we also need some of the old models to get out of the way.

I was raised in Monaghan and did my undergraduate studies in history and economics at UCD.  I trained as an accountant with KPMG and then transferred to its Boston office for almost two years.  On returning to Ireland, I worked in a range of roles including audit, technology and risk management.  I retired as managing partner of the firm in 2013.  As managing partner for six years, I led a firm employing almost 3,000 people, serving our clients from offices in Belfast, Cork, Dublin and Galway.<\/p> <p>  I gained many perspectives working with our wide array of clients.  I learned to always appreciate the importance of sound business judgment, ethical business behaviour, focus and the ability to work with and positively influence those with whom I engaged.  Throughout my career I have learned to value the perspectives of, and to work with, all stakeholders, including staff and customers from across the island of Ireland.  Having grown up in a Border county, I was especially aware of the need to be sensitive to all views.  These insights will also help me as chairman of ESB given that the group also embraces Northern Ireland Electricity Networks and has significant generation and supply operations in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Since I retired from KPMG, I have served in various non-executive board roles, including Enterprise Ireland, where I have been chairman since 2013, Rethink Ireland, the Government-supported social innovation fund, the governing authority of Dublin City University and the Dublin Theatre Festival.<\/p> <p>  I have mentioned a selection of the boards on which I have sat to give a sense of the diversity of experiences that I have encountered while carrying out my governance responsibilities.<\/p><p>I am mindful that our stakeholders have placed their trust in me and my fellow board members to ensure the ESB operates to very high standards of corporate governance while supporting the work of its management team.  As chairman designate, I will work to ensure the board's oversight responsibility for strategy, governance, internal controls and risk is resolutely executed.  In this way, the board will support and challenge management, who have the operational responsibility for the ESB. <br\/><br\/>In the context of risk I have been really impressed by the way the ESB responded to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The ESB had the threat of a pandemic on its risk register since the early 2000s and carried out a pandemic rehearsal in 2018.  I understand the learnings from this rehearsal informed the ESB&rsquo;s pandemic preparations in 2020.  This ensured the company smoothly transitioned almost 4,000 office-based staff to home-working with only minor blips in activity levels.<br\/><br\/>The issue of gender diversity and inclusion will also be an important agenda item for me as chairman.  I plan to work with our shareholder in drawing up specifications for board appointments that will bring a wider range of perspectives into the boardroom. <br\/><br\/>As Chairman designate of the ESB, I will work to ensure that foresight, planning, operational excellence and diversity remain core cultural imperatives.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the ESB&rsquo;s purpose, it was established as a commercial State company by a fledgling State to be a key enabler of economic development in Ireland.  I am fully cognisant of my responsibilities and that of the board not only to the Government, as owner, but also to all those families, farms and businesses that rely on the ESB for a safe and secure supply of electricity.<br\/><br\/>I am becoming very well acquainted with the sheer scale of the ESB's business and the Brighter Future strategy that is driving the business.  That strategy at its core sees the ESB leading the transition to a low-carbon economy.  The ESB has almost &euro;13 billion in assets.  We contribute approximately &euro;2 billion every year to the Irish economy in the form of taxes, salaries, purchases and local authority rates.  We paid &euro;1.2 billion in dividends to the State over the past ten years  The ESB has a presence in every townland in the country. <br\/><br\/>In addition to delivering a robust power supply to more than 2 million customers, ESB Networks has a critical role in the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan.  As well as ensuring sufficient renewable generation is connected to the network, ESB Networks must also enable technologies such as electric vehicles, electric heat pumps and micro-generation to contribute to the overall decarbonisation of Ireland.  ESB Networks has almost doubled the amount of renewable electricity connections on the network every three years since 2011.  These major increases have helped Ireland to become a world leader in renewable electricity generation.  Today, almost 40% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity is generated using low-carbon technologies.  In that way, the electricity sector has reduced its share of Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions from around 20% of the total five years ago to around 16% today, even as demand for electricity has increased.  The ESB will work to continue to support Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation journey.  This means continuing to decarbonise the electricity system and using that clean electricity supply to replace fossil fuels in our heat and transport sectors.  That strategy has the potential to address more than half of Ireland&rsquo;s emissions. <br\/><br\/>The ESB&rsquo;s generation and supply businesses also have undergone major transformations from being monopoly activities in the 1990s to operating in a modern, open and competitive marketplace.  Our generation business has decommissioned older plants as we have worked to develop new forms of sustainable electricity generation. <br\/><br\/>Our supply business, Electric Ireland, competes with a wide array of companies for every customer<i>.  <\/i>Even in the face of this competition, I was delighted to see Electric Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to contribute &euro;1 million to support vulnerable customers during the lockdown. This was in addition to its early commitment not to disconnect any customers during the current and previous lockdowns. <br\/><br\/>Many of the members will also be familiar with how ESB International sells Irish engineering excellence to clients all over the world.  <br\/><br\/>During the past five years the ESB has invested about &euro;1 billion a year in developing our businesses.  We raise debt to finance that expenditure on the international financial markets.  It is vitally important that our investors trust the ESB when they lend us money.  The ESB&rsquo;s current debt stands at around &euro;5 billion, which is significant.  I will always be mindful of the board&rsquo;s role in maintaining a financially strong ESB for the benefit of all.  With more significant investment in electricity infrastructure and renewable energy to be made, it is critical the ESB retains its financial strength and credit rating to access the funding necessary to finance the coming transformation. <br\/><br\/>Turning to culture and heritage, I confirm we are a long-term supporter of the arts, cultural and heritage sector in Ireland.  In 2020, the company opened a purpose-built archive in Finglas to preserve and make available more than 90 years of the ESB&rsquo;s records.<\/p><p>In 2017, we opened a visitor centre in Ardnacrusha to explain the role electricity will play in Ireland&rsquo;s low-carbon future.  We are also commissioning a visitor centre for Oweninny Wind Farm in County Mayo with our partners Bord na M&oacute;na.  Those are tangible commitments to Ireland's culture and heritage. <\/p><p> Turning to delivering a sustainable future, this is a fascinating time for the energy industry.  We are all working to decarbonise our economies and address the challenges of climate change.  The ESB will work tirelessly to support the programme for Government&rsquo;s target of an electricity system that is powered by 70% renewables by 2030.  We are seeing every day the impact of the surge towards renewables.  On windy days, Ireland's electricity system can be powered by up to 65% renewables.  However, there are other days particularly in some winter periods of cold, crisp weather when there is no wind when renewable generation can fall away to almost nothing.  On those days, to make sure we keep the lights on, we need power from other sources.  This security of supply conundrum will be one of the great challenges over the coming decade as Ireland grows onshore and offshore renewables, builds more battery storage capacity and continues the transition to a low-carbon energy system while maintaining security of supply.  <\/p><p> Smart technologies such as advanced digital metering are improving the efficiency and operation of the electricity networks.  ESB Networks is ploughing ahead, it having installed almost 240,000 new meters by the end of 2020. <\/p><p> I look forward to supporting the execution of the ESB's Brighter Future strategy whose vision is to lead the transition to a reliable, affordable, low-carbon energy future.  Over the next decade we will completely transform our generation portfolio.  This will cut the carbon intensity of our generation mix by more than two thirds and provide flexible back-up to allow more and more renewables onto the system.  <\/p><p> This is a great time to be nominated as chairman designate of the ESB board.  I look forward to helping to ensure the ESB remains a vital enabler of the economic and social development of Ireland.  I acknowledge and recognise the service of distinguished chairmen in the past, including, most recently, Ellvena Graham.  I look forward to taking the members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke for his opening statement.

We know Ireland is way behind in microgeneration compared to other EU member states.  From talking to community groups, they would say part of the problem is getting access to the grid and also the cost of the connection is unknown.  There is considerable enthusiasm among farmers, businesses, schools and communities to be part of this transition.  Does Mr. O'Rourke think the ESB is ready for it?

In 1976, my father shut the small animal feed mill that was water driven in County Monaghan.  He converted it into a microgeneration system.  He sold electricity generated from the water turbines on the River Fane in County Monaghan to the ESB, so I understand exactly this element.  I remember him being a bit frustrated at the time with all the requirements the ESB imposed.  However, he stuck with it and the mill happily generated electricity for many years and he sold it to the ESB.  This is a very important issue.  Many people across Ireland are keen to play their part in decarbonisation; they want to be able to generate revenue for themselves and decarbonise society through microgeneration. The ESB will make a submission to that process.  We are absolutely committed to making connecting microgeneration as safe and as practical as we can.  There is much detail to be worked out, but the Senator can take it the board is fully committed to this.  It is an issue we fully appreciate and we are committed to doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke for his service.  I should say I appointed him to be chair of Enterprise Ireland, where he did a fantastic job.  I just wish to acknowledge that.  I believe he is really well suited to the challenge we are taking on here.<\/p> <p>  I have just a few questions.  We have seen our ambition for renewables on our grid go from 55% to 70% now.  As we enhance our ambition, what will be the challenges of going beyond 70% renewables on our network and how do we prepare for them?<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns the ESB's wider potential role in tackling the climate challenge.  It is the largest State player by a country mile in terms of its scale and reach.  What does the ESB see as its role in leveraging change behaviour on a much wider basis than simply day-to-day responsibilities?  I refer, for example, to encouraging companies to do audits of their carbon impact, and how they could work with the ESB as a provider to reduce that, and to using the roll-out of the ESB's smart meters to help customers and quickly get them thinking about how they can reduce their impact.  It seems to me that the ESB will be a strategic player from the point of view not just of what it is doing from day to day but also of mobilising private capital, whether individual homeowners, companies or whatever else, and indeed the public sector, which is not always exemplary.  I would be interested to hear how the witnesses would see that wider role being developed and whether the ESB's existing legislative remit recognises sufficiently the capacity the company may have for leading change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#Q00100","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I might, in response to the Deputy's second question, take in some of Enterprise Ireland's experience as well because Enterprise Ireland deals with companies that come to it saying they want to spend money on going low carbon and ask whether Enterprise Ireland can help them.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the Deputy's first question about moving from 55% to 70% of electricity generation being renewables and what we can do to get it above 70%, the problem, as we get to more and more renewables, is intermittency of renewables, both onshore and offshore wind.  The greatest potential is probably offshore wind at this stage.  Everybody is looking at that as the main source of getting towards 100% renewable energy.  Offshore wind off the west coast of Ireland is the most likely source of that, but solar and other sources will be important as well as microgeneration.  The intermittency is the thing that is not being tackled yet.  There are solutions in play.  Battery storage is one.  We are now beginning to see large-scale batteries put in place.  Another part of the solution will be blue hydrogen, whereby one can use renewable energy on the very windy, busy days, producing lots of energy, and convert that into green hydrogen, which can then be used on less windy days or to flow out to deal with the intermittency.  There are technological and technical issues to be solved there, but I believe my colleagues are well on top of that.  As we plan not just for 70% but beyond 70%, those are the kinds of things we will look at to deal with those challenges.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the ESB's wider role.  Getting the carbon element of ESB generation or electricity generation down to a low figure is only one part of the battle.  There are issues involved in transport, heating, agriculture and other sectors, including the public sector.  Electric Ireland, our supply business, provides energy supply services, works with companies and can do things such as work with them to finance a conversion to low-carbon operations and then to recoup the savings over a period.  That service is already available from Energy Ireland, and I can see it being ramped up.  As I said, it has been the answer to the question Enterprise Ireland has been asked by companies, that is, whether we can help them on their decarbonisation journey.  As Deputy Bruton will be aware, Enterprise Ireland is given the remit that it should help Irish companies to expand jobs and exports.  However, these are companies that say they will not increase jobs or exports but just want to decarbonise.  That is not clearly within the remit of Enterprise Ireland, so we are now trying to figure out how we can do that.  We understand the companies and want to work with them, but that will probably involve Enterprise Ireland working with companies such as the ESB and involve Enterprise Ireland working probably with the SEAI as well.<\/p><p>Those are things ahead of us.  The ESB has had a very positive impact.  It is present in every townland in Ireland.  Everybody recognises the yellow vans going around the place.<\/p><p> I agree with the Deputy's point about wider responsibility for encouraging changes in behaviour and awareness.  The smart meters he mentioned are probably a very good way of doing it.  People will be offered in their own homes choices as to what kind of electricity they use, when they use it and how they use it, all in such a way as to try to make us more efficient and more effective in our use of electricity and to minimise the carbon impact of energy usage.  We have a broader responsibility, which I think the board fully accepts.  I am not sure we need any change in our remit because our remit is to support the economic and social development of Ireland.  That is part of what the ESB was set up to do.  I, therefore, do not think we need a legislative change.  However, I take on board the point that it is not just the technical, operational aspect of things but the behavioural change and supporting people to help people make the change.  We are committed to that and the committee will see more of that in years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke.  I have just a couple of questions.  There was news related to the ESB in the newspapers at the weekend regarding borrowing limits and the joint venture with Coillte.  Could he outline the significance of this and what it facilitates the ESB to do in terms of its renewables ambition and its significance in Ireland in the future?  Is it onshore or offshore?  What will it look like?  Is it wind or solar?  There are challenges around wind development onshore.  I am thinking particularly of the ongoing call for the wind farm guidelines to be updated in some way to manage the tensions between developers and communities.

I think 2007 and 2004 are the only years in which the limits have been changed.  At &euro;5 billion at the moment we are coming up close to our &euro;6 billion limit.  It is unclear whether the limit includes joint ventures and subsidiaries.  We applied last year for an increase in the limits.  We will spend about &euro;7 billion over the next five years in capital expenditure.  To allow ourselves to have the financial capacity to do that, we thought it would be better to get out of the &euro;6 billion limit.  We applied for &euro;10 billion.  The proposal at the moment is &euro;12 billion.  That is probably a very good cushion, but who knows what will be required in the next five, ten or 20 years?  Rather than requiring changes in legislation all the time, it is sensible to put in a good headroom limit there because we may be offered opportunities to have joint ventures with other people.  We may have requirements from our shareholder to invest in our business and to create even larger projects.  To enable us to have the flexibility to do all that, we thought it was sensible to seek a borrowing increase at this time.  Our current strategy, which the board endorsed in November, requires &euro;7 billion in capital expenditure for the next five years.  The maximum borrowing in that strategy shows, I think, approximately &euro;7 billion, so we do not intend anywhere at the moment in our current plans to go anywhere near &euro;10 billion or &euro;12 billion.  It is just to allow for optionality.<\/p> <p>  The joint venture with Coillte is a great project because it involves two State-owned bodies, owned by the taxpayers, working together to take the opportunity of using Coillte's land all over the country.  As the land is already used for forestry, it is probably easier than many other locations to change into locations for wind farms.  We are working on a number of sites with Coillte.  It is great to get that joint venture approved through the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  There are a number of conditions in there, but they are ones we think we will be able to fulfil.  We look forward to working with Coillte to develop wind farms in appropriate locations around the country.  I take on board the Deputy's observation on the wind farm guidelines, which need to be updated.  We are very happy to work with the regulator in that regard.  We understand that for the benefit of the whole community we need renewable energy.  Some of that has to be onshore wind, but we understand that creates tensions with local communities.  We will work very hard to make sure that people's concerns are understood and we will do as best we can to accommodate any concerns.  Adhering to updated guidelines will be part of the way we will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke for his presentation and for coming to the committee today.

It is an issue we follow very carefully because of those concerns.  We have historically purchased a very small percentage of the output of that mine.  In the period from 2015 to 2018 we purchased some 2% of the total mine capacity.  We have not used any coal from Cerrej&oacute;n in the time since then and we are not currently using any of its coal.<\/p> <p>  We are conscious of the fact that when we buy coal from around the world we need to understand what the conditions are where the coal comes from.  In 2014 we joined an organisation called Bettercoal.  It had been established shortly before that by a number of large coal buyers.  It is on the buying side and is entirely independent of the mining side.  The mission of the organisation is the continuous improvement in coal mining operations through collective influence.<\/p> <p>  As a 2% purchaser we do not have much influence in the mines, so joining Bettercoal was a way for us to leverage our influence to punch above our weight.  Bettercoal commenced assessment of the Cerrej&oacute;n mine in 2016.  The assessment included research, completion of questionnaires, visits to the site, talking to the local communities, trade unions and NGOs.  The Bettercoal assessment measured the mine's operations against a large number of criteria across ten principles, which included human rights, workers' rights, ethics and community engagement.  The assessment found that Cerrej&oacute;n met, or substantially met, the vast majority of the Bettercoal criteria and the assessment did not record any failures.  Senior managers at ESB have visited the mine on a number of occasions and were very vigilant about this matter.  We understand the concerns people have.  There are people there who are trying to improve the conditions anywhere there are shortfalls.  We continue to keep an eye on it, but we are not buying any coal from them at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":396,"content":"<p>Working through the coal and human rights point, has the ESB decided to move away from importing coal from Cerrej&oacute;n entirely?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#S00300","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":397,"content":"<p>The coal that is required to power Moneypoint is a particular type of coal that is only available in a couple of mines around the world.

The ESB will be committed to playing its part in the decarbonisation of the Irish economy.  We also have the commitment to make sure that we continue to have electricity available.  As we decarbonise transport and heating domestically and industrially, electricity is probably the best way to do that.  If electricity can be generated as safely, as securely and with as low-carbon emissions as possible, it would be the best.  It is not, however, something that can be done overnight.  We believe there will be a requirement for a suitable mix of generation that is increasingly sustainable.  Our target is 70% by 2030, which is in line with the legislation and the Paris Agreement, as I understand it.  If we can do it quicker than that, we will.<\/p> <p>  As I said to Deputy Bruton, one of the issues is the intermittence on renewables such as wind and solar.  The sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow, so one must have other technologies available.  At the moment the best one of those, and the least carbon effective one, is gas.<\/p><p>We use Moneypoint and coal burning very infrequently now.  The heavy fuel such as diesel oil is also hardly used.  We got out of those.  We have moved away from the high carbon fuels used to generate thermal plants.  We now use gas as the last piece of the thermal plant.  That will be required for a number of years going forward because of the need to continue to supply electricity for Irish social and economic activity and as we go on the journey towards full-scale renewables.<\/p><p> We will need to deal with some technical issues.  It takes a long time to develop offshore wind, for example off the west coast of Ireland, which is a major part of that.  There will be more solar, there will be microgeneration, and a number of components in the transition in line with the Paris Agreement and the climate change legislation.  Gas will be an important part of making sure we have security of supply as we go on that journey over the next decade or so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#S00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>If we are to try to achieve a target of 70% renewables by 2030, that is nine years away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#T00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>And Mr. O'Rourke also thinks that we are going to have to rely on a supply of gas for that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#T00400","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>During that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":407,"content":"<p>With some 15 years left in the Corrib field, does Mr. O'Rourke think it is necessary for the State to allow the drilling for more gas off Barryroe, for example?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#T00600","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>The ESB has no views on where the gas comes from.

My first question concerns the planning process that Coillte is currently engaging with.  Since the ESB has a relationship with Coillte, I believe it is important that Mr. O'Rourke might address this issue.  I am aware of one very large project in east Clare that is being processed for planning through An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  From my own engagement the community I believe that there has not been the appropriate level of engagement with the community that would be expected.  To some extent this is the result of the Covid crisis and the inability of people to meet in public forums.  It is a fact that people are not circulating, they are not going to the pub or the church, so they are not meeting and are not even aware that the process is under way.  I ask that the ESB and Coillte, because they are involved in projects, would delay the submission of applications until such time as we are out the other end of this, or that they find a more prominent way of engaging with people.  I do not believe it is appropriate to move ahead as they have done on that particular project.<\/p> <p>  We have all signed up to the commitments on renewables by 2030, and rightly so.  I put it to Mr. O'Rourke, however, that the ESB from its early stages was ahead of time in its thinking and was always looking to the next phase of development and the next engineering phase.  With its relationship with Coillte the ESB is really just doubling down on what is now older technology.  Why has the ESB not moved more aggressively towards the generation of electricity offshore?  The opportunity is there.  It is very clear that the future is there.  Large multinationals are looking at that area and advancing it.  Why is the ESB sitting back and effectively doubling down on the onshore technology?  If the ESB was delivering, as Mr. O'Rourke said at the outset, on its mandate for the country, the ESB would be looking at offshore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#T00900","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Dooley for his points on consultation and community engagement, and on the offshore versus onshore.  I take the Senator's point that it is difficult to do community engagement at the moment.  I am aware that the community engagement is an important part of any process of large infrastructure projects to make sure that people have an opportunity to express their concerns, and for making sure we can deal with any concerns as best we can.  We will be working with Coillte and I will make sure to bring that issue back to management to make sure we take on board that the community is not happy with the level of consultation available at the moment, and to see what further we can do.  I understand the importance of that.<\/p><p>A couple of years ago, I led a group in the business community looking at the best way to do community engagement.  We had representatives from the ESB, EirGrid, Bord G&aacute;is and others working out the best way to do that.  I believe it is an important issue and I fully understand the point.<\/p><p> In terms of old versus new technology, offshore wind is technically challenging.  Obviously, the best way will be floating platforms, which is completely new technology.  The ESB is engaged.  Before Christmas, the board approved the purchase of 50% of a wind farm off the coast of Arklow.  We are also engaged in a wind farm off the coast of County Louth and have investments off the coast of Scotland. Neart na Gaoithe is a big wind farm in which we are in joint venture.  The great opportunity to learn the technology is the very point made by the Senator.  We are therefore absolutely committed to finding out and understanding how wind farms work.<\/p><p> What is needed to really advance this in Ireland is some technology proving, which is what we are doing and learning from other people, but also the legislative framework.  There are a whole lot of issues about the seabed and how floating platforms work and all the rest.  The legislative framework to really expand offshore wind is needed now.  Advances need to be made in the connection of the grid to bring electricity from offshore back onto the ground and make sure it can be connected and transmitted through the transmission network.  Therefore, a number of technical issues are to be addressed but they are all on the ESB's agenda.  We will work as fast as we can to do that.<\/p><p> I thank the Deputy for his comment about how the ESB seemed to be ahead of its time in the past and now it does not appear to be.  We are doing a lot of work the Deputy is probably not aware of.  Our engineers, however, are working on some of the best projects in the world in offshore energy at the moment.  We know that is part of the answer for Ireland because we are rich in offshore wind and it is something we can actually export in the future.  In ten, 20 or 30 years' time, we could be a great exporter of energy and electricity from Ireland by using our offshore wind.  The ESB is fully committed to being part of that for the benefit of the taxpayers of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#T01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke.  I want to follow up on a couple of issues that have already been flagged.  A concern I would have is that it the ESB seems to be at a stage in its planning where it is chasing the regulations that might come in rather than anticipating them.  I believe Senator Dooley was making a similar point, that we and the ESB need to be ahead of time.  I am a little bit concerned, therefore, with regard to the investments.  We say, \"neither a borrower not a lender be\", but the fact is that the ESB is borrowing heavily.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that Mr. O'Rourke mentioned the generation portfolio.  What is being promised to those investors in terms of a generation portfolio?  What expectations are being giving to those investors?  We have a rapidly evolving policy landscape.  Are they being given an expectation, for example, that blue hydrogen will definitely be in the mix?  There is a big difference between green and blue hydrogen.  The ESB should anticipate that blue hydrogen will not be in the mix for very long.  The move against it in Europe is strong and the scientific evidence we have heard previously in this committee against that kind of hydrogen is very strong.  Therefore, is the ESB planning, and are its investors aware, that blue hydrogen might not be an aspect or an option in the mix, especially if we scale from &euro;5 billion to &euro;12 billion?  What risk-proofing is there in terms of exposure on expectations in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Is the investment the ESB is making and perhaps anticipates making with the &euro;12 billion in funding it hopes to draw down green investment and is it consistent with the spirit - I know it is not bound by the letter - of the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act 2018, which we passed in the Oireachtas?  I believe those are really important questions.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned by the emphasis Mr. O'Rourke has placed on financial markets as a priority.  They are a priority but I believe energy supply and the environment will also be key priorities for the ESB in the longer term security picture.<\/p> <p>  Could and should environmental impact assessments be used earlier and better in terms of ESB infrastructure?  That is really important.<\/p> <p>  Rather than looking to alternatives in terms of hydrogen, what percentage of this new funding will go into investing in the issue of storage?<\/p><p>That is the crucial issue.  We do not want to hear in six years' time that sometimes the wind does not blow.  That issue really needs to be dealt with and prioritised as an area of innovation.  We hear much more about carbon capture than we hear about renewable energy storage.  The emphasis needs to shift there.<\/p><p> In the previous Oireachtas, the ESB appeared before this committee regarding the unfortunate issue of leaks.  Have Mr. O'Rourke or his colleagues heard, or do they have information, about whether the 75 new and historic leaks have been addressed or whether the decommissioning of the fluid-filled infrastructure cables has happened?<\/p><p> I note a new code of ethics has been introduced.  Could Mr. O'Rourke comment on that because it is a governance code of ethics?  Has there been consultation with the workers, unions and all relevant stakeholders around that new code of ethics for the ESB?<\/p><p> Finally, I note Mr. O'Rourke has a background in history and he spoke about heritage.  I am extremely concerned by the proposed change of No. 29 Fitzwilliam Street from a public museum and amenity.  With great respect, the new heritage measures suggested by Mr. O'Rourke do not replace what was in a way, as I see it, a penance for demolition and ruining of a 1 km-long Georgian street by ESB building works in 1965.  I know that in 2015, the obligation on the ESB to restore it fully was lifted on the understanding that anything that replaced that site would be a public amenity.  Does Mr. O'Rourke not regard that public museum as a key public amenity?  I urge him in his new capacity as chairman to look strongly at reconsidering the removal of one of the few publicly accessible Georgian buildings in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#U00200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins.

The Senator said that we appear to be chasing regulations rather than anticipating them.  I have only been involved with the ESB for the past number of weeks but I have seen that it is well aware of the need to change.  That issue of getting the legislative framework required for offshore wind in place is a matter of ongoing consultation between ourselves and the regulator and ourselves and the Department.<\/p> <p>  The ESB is absolutely involved in anticipating and shaping those regulations and trying to make sure they are the most effective way of getting to do the things we need to do.  I therefore hope we would not be seen as chasing regulations but actually anticipating and helping to shape them.  Our job is to be the experts on the ground and know the right way to make sure the regulations are effective, not only for the operations of the ESB but for the protection and safety of the community.<\/p> <p>  The Senator spoke about the investments and alluded to my reference to the need for the ESB to be financially strong.  That is reality.  The issue is that we need to make a lot of investment now.  There is a big investment, which will be repayable over a long future.  We have a situation where we need to make big investments now and the repayment will be over many years of supply of electricity.  It is something that is entirely suited for borrowing.  The Senator is correct.  We must do that prudently and in such a way that the financial markets are helping it.<\/p> <p>  I should say that I have chaired another sale and investment forum in the last number of years, which is about trying to help our financial investor colleagues to understand the need for transformation in the economy, that is, the need to go to green energy.  We found there was a great and growing interest from financial investors in decarbonisation because they did not want to invest in projects which are not sustainable and do not have a long-term future as we move to a zero-carbon world.  Investors are well aware of this.<\/p> <p>  I am not aware of the detail of the mix.  The Senator made a comment about blue hydrogen.  As I understand it, that would not be a necessary part of the mix.  If any blue hydrogen is involved, it is a matter of transition as we need to go to green hydrogen.  Blue hydrogen is only a stepping stone as we go to green hydrogen.  We will get there eventually.<\/p> <p>  I already mentioned the importance of battery storage and dealing with intermittent wind.  I agree with the Senator.  I do not want whoever is in my chair in ten years' time telling the committee the wind does not blow on certain days.  That is the reality today as we transition, however.  We need to deal with that because we need to keep the lights on, businesses powered and homes warm.  That requires us to use an appropriate mix of generation but that mix is changing over the period in our plan.  We plan to change it to 70% renewable energy by 2030 and earlier if we can, and as soon as possible thereafter with the technology and investment required to get towards zero carbon.  Therefore, it is exactly in our lines to do that and we must do it in a way that ensures we remain financially stable.  There is no point in us borrowing imprudently and not being able to make the investments and provide electricity to the people of Ireland.<\/p><p>We must balance the needs that the Senator, entirely appropriately, raised as a concern, but it is an issue of which we were already aware.<br\/><br\/>The Senator is correct in that, as an historian, I am aware of the importance of showcasing heritage and reminding current and future generations of its importance.  That is why we have initiatives like the archives and the visitor centres in Ardnacrusha and Oweninny.<br\/><br\/>On the museum, my understanding is that there was no planning permission or anything else.  It is something the ESB did voluntarily.  It was not a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>, as we understand it.  The museum comes in two parts, namely, the contents and the building.  The contents have always been owned by the National Museum of Ireland and have always been borrowed from it.  We returned them to the National Museum of Ireland when we started a redevelopment a few years ago.<br\/><br\/>I agree on what was done in the 1960s to the kilometre-long Georgian street.  Nobody would want to endorse or support that now.  I regret it also.  We hope the redevelopment of the new building is more in keeping with the heritage and the streetscape.  I hope members will see that.  It involves two new office buildings to replace the 1916 buildings, one of which has been sold to help to finance the project.  As part of the process, we are refurbishing up to 11 Georgian houses, three of which will be used for ESB's offices and eight of which will be returned to family and residential use.  That is what we are doing.<br\/><br\/>I absolutely agree on the need to showcase the heritage.  My contention is that it does not necessarily have to be in No. 29.  We are going to work with colleagues in Dublin City Council, the OPW and the National Museum of Ireland to examine heritage-related initiatives that could address concerns.  I recognise that point.  I was a visitor to the museum myself even before I was involved in the ESB and I know it very well.  My children visited and they were fascinated by it.  We need to have the heritage available to people.  The uses of buildings change.  If we did not change buildings, the members would be sitting in a building that was the home of the Duke of Leinster or home to the Royal Dublin Society.  We need to have the heritage available to people.  We are going to work with all the stakeholders to make sure it is available, but it does not necessarily have to be at No. 29.  As part of the project, it made sense to do significant refurbishment.  When we sell these houses, we will not be a making profit.  The houses were built a long time ago and need a lot of work in terms of refurbishment of floors and the fixing of windows and roofs.  There is a considerable amount of work to return them to what they were built for, which was to house families.  That is what all the houses are going to be returned to now.  That is what we are about, but we are very conscious of the heritage point and we are going to commit to dealing with that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I apologise for being delayed.  I was at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, which I am sure Mr. O'Rourke is glad he was not at.  That will be for another day.  I congratulate Mr. O'Rourke on his appointment.  It is lovely to have him here.  I have read his opening statement.<\/p> <p>  On the decarbonisation of the sector and the ESB's contribution to it, I commend Mr. O'Rourke.  I heard a presentation from his public affairs section some weeks ago and it was very informative.  What supports has the ESB given over the past year to both residential and business customers in the face of the pandemic?  While that is slightly off topic, I would like an answer since Mr. O'Rourke is here.<\/p> <p>  On the ESB's Brighter Future strategy, I am aware from D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown, from which I hail, that the council has worked closely with the electricity suppliers to change sodium lights to LED lights.  Is Mr. O'Rourke familiar with this?  Will he enlighten the committee &mdash; excuse the pun &mdash; on how many public lanterns have been changed across the country?<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Rourke said 240,000 new meters are being installed across the country, resulting in efficiencies.  He might delve into this a little.<\/p> <p>  With regard to energy security overall, I would be interested in hearing Mr. O'Rourke's thoughts on Ireland's energy security in the face of Brexit and the impact it may have on energy efficiency in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I join Senator Higgins in commenting on No. 29 Fitzwilliam Street.  I welcome Mr. O'Rourke's comments on righting the wrongs of the 1960s and the destruction of the terrace, but there should be scope within the redeveloped complex to house a museum.<\/p><p>He said the ESB is working with Dublin City Council, which I welcome.  There should be some museum after the works are completed.  It is imperative.  He also said his own children saw the museum.  As a child, I went to see it.

It was a wonderful asset and I do not want to see it lost to the city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#W00200","speaker":"1481","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":420,"content":"<p>On pandemic supports, we have done a number of things.  Obviously, we are aware that the pandemic has hit people in different ways.  Many small businesses, in particular, have been hit.  Many families have also been hit.  Especially in cold times like these, people need their energy but may not have the ability to pay.  We will work with anybody.  We will engage with anybody.  We absolutely made a commitment during the lockdowns not to make any disconnections.  There were no disconnections made during any period of lockdown, and that will continue to be the case.  We have a fund of &euro;1 million with which we are able to help our vulnerable customers.  With it, we are helping to contribute to costs where customers are just unable to pay and cannot see a way forward through deferment or anything like that.  Additionally, we have increased our contributions to organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and bodies working with the homeless at this time.  We are aware of the stress the pandemic has caused in the community, and we are working with all our customers, both business and domestic, to try to ensure they get from us what they need.  Bearing in mind the many problems people have, I understand electricity supply has not been a particular issue, but we recognise it can be a stress factor.  We will work very closely with customers to alleviate their concerns as best we can.<\/p> <p>  On public lighting, I will not be able to tell the Deputy how many sodium lights have been replaced.  Public lighting is a matter for local authorities, which I am sure will be able to answer.  I am happy to work with him to get the information.  It is not information I have and I am not sure the ESB has it.  I believe it is a local authority issue.<\/p> <p>  On the installation of 240,000 new meters, and those to come, these are new digital meters.  Instead of the old wheel that clicked around, the analogue device, there is now a digital meter.  It is connected and will help with microgeneration.  If homeowners wish to have a solar panel and put electricity back into the grid, rather than taking it from it, the new meter will allow that.  It will enable people to work out costs.  There will be different tariffs available at different times of the day.  People may decide to run the washing machine or to engage in heavy electrical usage at certain times, and they will be able to do so much more flexibly with a digital meter.  We will offer different tariffs to people at different times so it will be much more flexible.  It will help customers to decide how much money they are going to spend and when they are going to spend it.  It will help them to contribute towards decarbonisation and to lower energy usage.  The meters are an essential part of this.  They are being rolled out to houses right across the country as we speak.  Almost 250,000 were installed before the end of last year.  While the process was affected a little by Covid, we almost managed to meet our target for last year.<\/p> <p>  Energy supply and security comprise an important issue.  We talked earlier about the need for a generation mix.  The impact of Brexit is not significant at the moment.  The interconnectors are still working.  There is potential for more challenging issues to arise regarding the use of the interconnectors but the interim position when 1 January clicked round was that there was no change in the market.  There is, however, potential for disruption.  The interconnector proposed to connect us to the electricity grid in France is, therefore, an important part of the mix.  We are not sure of the exact framework for how the interconnector with Great Britain will work in the future.  The interconnector is an important part of the energy mix, along with renewables and some remaining gas, which is being phased out.  The interconnector is important and, as I understand it, Brexit just complicates matters.<\/p> <p>  On No. 29 Fitzwilliam Street, we were very happy to work with others who were interested in preserving and showcasing Georgian heritage.  We will play our part in ensuring the kinds of experiences members' children and my children have had will be available to Irish citizens in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I was very happy to hear Mr. O'Rourke mention the Ardnacrusha visitor centre.<\/p><p>It is just a few kilometres upriver from my home.  I have been to the centre, which is fantastic, and I congratulate the ESB on embracing its own industrial heritage.  Indeed the ESB was born in Ardnacrusha and it is something of which people in Limerick and Clare are very proud.  I know Mr. O'Rourke's father was at the microgenerator on the river in Monaghan.  My family was involved in the construction of Ardnacrusha and it is something of which we are quite proud.  At the time, it was a vast engineering project.  One fifth of the national budget was spent on building Ardnacrusha, which was the first of its kind in the world.  Indeed many large-scale hydro projects around the world emulated what was done in Ardnacrusha.<\/p><p> I do not think it is a project we would do now, partly because of the cost but also because of the environmental impact of it.  It is true to say that it did have a huge environmental impact in Limerick and Clare and I believe it continues to do so.  I know the ESB operated it with the best intentions and has all the right safeguards in place but essentially we are talking about a major man-made construction on a river whose operation impacts, in terms of its health, on the local environment.  The issue of flooding, which we are very used to in Limerick, also arises.

Obviously, some of the things we do have an environmental impact, so our objective is to carry out our main programme in a manner that is as environmentally sensitive and adaptable as possible.  Regarding Ardnacrusha, the safe discharge of floodwater takes precedence over all other matters, including the generation of electricity, so if we have a choice between releasing floodwater or generating electricity, we release floodwater to try to relieve flooding pressures at various points on the Shannon.  The Shannon is obviously a very complex river that is very slow moving and tends to flood along its reaches.  The ESB works with other parties like the Office of Public Works, OPW, the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, Waterways Ireland and the various local authorities.  We will continue to work with them to see if the operation of Ardnacrusha can help in any way to minimise the flooding impact and with regard to things like fisheries and other areas in respect of which we have a remit to make sure that is done as sensitively and effectively as possible.<\/p> <p>  I take the Chairman's point about wind farms.  Offshore wind power is very challenging technically in terms of floating offshore platforms, but in a way it is probably the least environmentally impactful of the various trends we are looking at, and this is why we are very keen to develop our understanding of and plans for that as soon as we can.  The Chairman can take it that we have a subcommittee of the board dealing with environmental issues and the impact of the ESB and its operations to make sure they are environmentally sensitive as well, that we are as low carbon as possible and that, where possible, our vans are fuelled in a way that does not take much fossil fuel.  The environmental impact of all we do is a constant imperative for the company and our board to be cognisant of.<\/p><p>I, therefore, take the Chairman's comments and I will make sure that we continue to be focused on that and try to watch out for that all the time while also trying to provide safe, secure and affordable electricity to the people of Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021020900002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke for his answer.

Today we are joined by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  They are welcome.

The Minister, Deputy McGrath, is accompanied by officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, including Ms Caroline O'Loughlin, assistant principal for performance budgeting, Mr. John Kinnane, principal officer, central expenditure policy and reporting division.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is accompanied by officials from the Department of Finance, including, Mr. Niall Cassidy, principal officer in the economics section and Ms Anne-Marie Walsh, principal officer in the tax section.<\/p> <p>  Today we will discuss the committee's interim report on the framework for parliamentary engagement throughout the budgetary cycle, the potential for enhanced parliamentary engagement, and the capacity of the Executive to support an enhanced framework.

Pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, the evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege.  However, if they are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the places in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, to make his opening statement.  Due to technical problems we cannot hear him.  We will try to establish contact.

The interim report of the committee sets out a number of key observations, including in respect of pre-budget and performance scrutiny.  I will deal with the issues that are relevant to the expenditure side of these processes.<\/p> <p>  I am very appreciative of the efforts and the insights that have gone into the preparation of the interim report.  It is encouraging that the progress that has been made in recent years in improving and strengthening the opportunities for parliamentary engagement in our budgetary process not least through the establishment of this committee, of which I am a former member, but also that it would be kept under review and that opportunities for further enhancement should be identified and implemented, where appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Equally, it is important to acknowledge and to remind ourselves of the progress that has been made and that is under way to support increased parliamentary engagement.  As I have just mentioned, the establishment of this committee is one milestone in this reform agenda, as is the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office.  At the same time, the reforms introduced by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform also support budgetary scrutiny and effective engagement with the budgetary process.  The programme for Government also outlines a number of priorities in the area of reform to the budgetary process, including the development of well-being measures and better budgeting for demographic costs.  These priorities, along with the significant reforms in place, can help to deliver more focused and more informed engagement.  As the committee noted in the interim report, a more effective budgetary framework has the potential to lead to improved outcomes for citizens through better informed policy-making, resource allocation and accountability.  Ultimately, that is an outcome we all want to see delivered.<\/p> <p>  Reforms in recent years with the publication of additional documents such as the summer economic statement and the mid-year expenditure report support better pre-budget scrutiny.  I acknowledge that the pandemic impacted this process last year, with the mid-year expenditure report not being published in July as usual and being replaced by a pre-budget expenditure update published in advance of the budget in October.<\/p> <p>  The exceptional circumstances last year, with a requirement to respond to the evolving situation with the virus, meant that the focus was on implementing measures to support people and businesses experiencing extreme difficulties arising from Covid-19 and to ensure that the health service had the resources to respond to the crisis.  The scale of support provided resulted in overall gross voted expenditure for 2020 coming in at &euro;85.3 billion, an increase of almost &euro;15 billion on the amount set out in the pre-Covid Revised Estimates for Public Services 2020, the REV.  I acknowledge the role of the Oireachtas in considering and approving this significant level of additional expenditure required to implement these support measures.<\/p> <p>  Turning to pre-budget scrutiny, there are a number of processes in place that can support such engagement.<\/p><p>In setting out the departmental expenditure baseline for the medium term, reflecting pre-existing commitments arising from cost pressures such as demographics and outlining the mid-year expenditure position for Departments, the mid-year expenditure report is focused on supporting enhanced pre-budget scrutiny.  I note that the interim report specifically references the cost of standing still for the budget year, including taking account of demographics.  This is an issue that the mid-year report seeks to inform and, as I noted earlier, better budgeting for demographic costs is included in the programme for Government. <\/p><p> Alongside the mid-year expenditure report, my Department publishes the spending review papers.  Among the objectives of the spending review process are the assessment of the effectiveness of public spending in delivering on policy objectives and the development of evidence-informed policy making.  With more than 100 published papers from the spending review process since 2017, this represents a significant evidence base to support policy formulation and development and a year-round approach to the budget process. <\/p><p> I note that the interim report outlines that performance scrutiny should move towards a more structured year-round engagement.  I am supportive of the principle that underlies this recommendation.  Indeed, there are a number of processes and reports in place that can support such engagement.  In this regard, performance budgeting has been a key focus of budgetary reform.  With the change in the budgetary timetable in 2013 and the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, now being published in December each year, this provides an opportunity for earlier engagement by committees with the Estimates during the first quarter of the year.  The REV itself has developed significantly in recent years and now routinely includes details on activities, outputs and context-specific outcome indicators.  <\/p><p> Over the past three or four years in particular, the performance budgeting initiative has been expanded to include indicators relating to equality objectives.  The equality budgeting initiative was first introduced as part of budget 2018 and aims to provide greater information on how budgetary measures are likely to impact upon the various dimensions of equality.  Expanding from an initial pilot, REV 2021 includes equality indicators for a number of Votes across 12 ministerial Vote groups, with additional Departments providing indicators this year including the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Since its introduction, the performance budgeting initiative has been kept under review with a view to enhancing the quality of the information provided.  As we look to develop performance budgeting further the OECD, under the EU&rsquo;s structural reform support programme, is currently engaged in a project to improve the effectiveness of performance budgeting drawing on international best practice.  In its work, the OECD has met with a wide range of stakeholders including members of the committee. <\/p><p> A significant volume of information is published in the REV each year, with information at programme level on financial resources, outputs and public service activities and impact indicators.  Taking into account the ongoing work to enhance performance budgeting, this affords the opportunity to leverage the use of existing reports and processes to support the work of the Oireachtas in scrutinising Estimates.  While the REV deals with planned performance for the year ahead, the public service performance report outlines the key outputs that have been delivered each year.  This report was developed to facilitate meaningful and constructive dialogue on what is being delivered with public funds and is available for use by Oireachtas committees. <\/p><p> As noted earlier, the programme for Government contains a commitment on the development of a well-being framework for our country.  The development of this framework is aligned with the aforementioned reforms.  In developing this framework, I am mindful of the need for Government to consult with key stakeholders as such consultation should ensure buy-in to the framework and ensure its relevance to the work of those charged with designing, implementing and scrutinising public policy. <\/p><p> There are many reports and processes in existence that we can look to utilise as we work together to improve engagement between Government and the Oireachtas on the budgetary process and on scrutiny of performance.  Such an approach can support effective engagement, timely provision of information and the identification of those metrics of performance, equality and well-being that are most useful to parliamentary accountability.  It would also be important that there is a clear sense of the respective roles and responsibilities of the various committees as this clarity can support Departments in their engagement with the Oireachtas.  I look forward to a good discussion and to working with the committee on ways to enhance this area of work in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#B00100","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and now invite the Minister for Finance to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#C00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson and the committee for the opportunity to discuss the current framework for parliamentary engagement in the budgetary process.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the committee's report and look forward to the discussion we will have.<\/p><p>At the outset we can all agree that there has been much progress in our broader approach to the national fiscal framework over recent years and I want to assure the committee that I and my Department will continue to play a constructive role going forward, both formally and informally.  To put this in context, it would be useful to briefly highlight the main reforms to our budgetary framework.<br\/><br\/>I have spoken on many occasions about the importance of our institutions.  Independent, analytically-robust and respected institutions perform an invaluable role in any democracy.  In this regard, perhaps the most important reform to the fiscal framework in recent years has been the establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.  The council provides a crucial input to the budgetary process, providing an independent assessment of my Department&rsquo;s economic and budgetary forecasts, the stance of fiscal policy and compliance with the fiscal rules.  In terms of the economic projections that underpin Government policy, a transparent, rigorous process precedes both the budget and the stability programme update forecasting rounds.  Additionally, the scrutiny of Government policy provided by the council is now firmly embedded within our budgetary architecture.  I know that this committee&rsquo;s deliberations with the council have provided a broader context for my engagement with this committee. <br\/><br\/>Another important reform initiated in recent years is the national economic dialogue.  This is now firmly part of the annual budgetary cycle although, unfortunately, it was interrupted this year.  The dialogue is normally preceded by the publication of the summer economic statement which sets out the main parameters of the budget.  I will say more about this later.  The dialogue provides an opportunity for all stakeholders to participate in an open and inclusive exchange on the competing economic and social priorities facing the Government. <br\/><br\/>Each summer my Department also oversees the circulation of the tax strategy group<i><\/i>papers to the relevant sectoral Oireachtas committees.  This group comprises representatives from various Government Departments, political advisers and politicians in government.  The papers that are published on our website are a stock take of existing tax measures and include issues for discussion and costed options for change.  Finally, the establishment of this committee itself is also an important reform to the budgetary infrastructure<b>.<\/b><br\/><br\/>Turning now to the committee&rsquo;s interim report, many of the issues raised have been covered by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and I will not repeat what he has already said.  As the committee will be aware, the programme for Government outlined the Government&rsquo;s objective of developing better measures of quality of life and well-being.  Connected to this is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to expand equality budgeting.  In this regard, I am engaging with my colleagues, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, on next steps in this area. <br\/><br\/>In terms of the further development of well-being measures, this will be guided by an expert group convened through the Department of the Taoiseach.  My officials have been engaging with their counterparts in the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform in order to further develop the technical aspects of this work.  My Department published a paper entitled Wellbeing and the Measurement of Broader Living Standards in Ireland alongside budget 2021.  The paper examined the development of international approaches to well-being and looked at options for national well-being measurement in Ireland.  The purpose of these measures will be to complement existing economic tools and measures and not to replace them.  It is hoped and anticipated that these new measures can serve over time as a useful reference for a range of policy and budgetary reform initiatives which are currently under way, including performance budgeting, equality budgeting, spending reviews and proofing of policy proposals against environmental and other goals.  On green budgeting, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has already incorporated green budgeting practices into its expenditure analysis in recent years<b>.<\/b><br\/><br\/>I will conclude on the summer economic statement as it concerns one of the recommendations in the interim report.<\/p><p>In a nutshell, the summer economic statement is a vehicle in which the available level of resources for the year ahead is communicated to the Oireachtas and to the general public, taking into account the need to ensure sound budgetary practice.<\/p><p> I am aware of the views of the committee on the fact that it was not possible to produce this document last year.  I wrote to the Chairman outlining the reasons for this.  I believe the SES is an important staging post in advance of the annual budget and I have been in front of the committee on many occasions to discuss it.  I will continue to accommodate the committee in terms of future attendance.  It is my expectation that the SES will be published over the summer.  We will have to engage in government on the format and role of the SES.  I look forward to engaging with the committee at the appropriate time.<\/p><p> Having said that, it is important as we look at the SES to highlight the voluminous amount of economic and fiscal analysis published by my Department over the course of any year.  For example, we recently launched the annual debt report some weeks ago to highlight the many issues, positive and negative, associated with the accumulation of public debt.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I believe it is fair to say that the budgetary processes have evolved significantly in recent years.  Notwithstanding the challenging times we are in, the Government shares the committee's view of ensuring we have an open, transparent and engaged budgetary process.  Sound, counter-cyclical budgetary policy is at the heart of a well-performing economy and a fit-for-purpose budgetary framework is a key part of this.

We have acknowledged that, due to the circumstances of the year, it was not possible to publish a mid-year expenditure report.  That was and has been in recent years an important part of the overall process for the committee in preparing for the budget that will be unveiled the following October.<\/p> <p>  Also, we did not have the summer economic statement, as has been acknowledged.  The truth is that in preparing budget 2021 we were dealing with an extraordinary amount of volatility.  Final decisions on the budget were made following careful consideration over a period at a late stage.  As we know, we constructed the budget against certain key assumptions in terms of Brexit, the pandemic and the issue of a vaccination programme.  We decided on the need for a recovery fund of &euro;3.4 billion and a Covid-19 contingency fund of &euro;2 billion.<\/p><p>All of these issues were very much in play and remained under active consideration until the eve of the budget.

The scope of the package of the budget that the Minister relayed to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight five days before the budget was increased by one third.  That is not on.  It is not the relationship we should have with the Executive.  The Minister knew or had a sense of where the parameters would be.  The Minister might not have known the final figure but decided to keep it from us.  It was okay because we learned about it in the Sunday newspapers, as I said to the Minister at the committee.  I said the Committee on Budgetary Oversight will gain more from reading the Sunday newspapers than from questioning the Minister five days before the budget.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance said the expectation - or words to that effect - was that the summer economic statement would be published.

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council criticised the Government and the Department for not doing that last year.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the stability programme update and the spring statement.  Is it the intention that the statement will be published at the end of April?  Will there be medium-term projections?  In the budget documentation last year the Minister said it would contain medium-term projections to set a pathway towards moving the national finances back to a balanced position once the public health situation allows.  Can the Minister explain how far out we are going to look?  Is it a five-year projection?  Is that forthcoming in April?<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister respond to the issue of the fiscal rules and the Stability and Growth Pact?  Does the Minister share my view - more and more people across Europe are saying it - that the pact is now outdated?  I believe that, with the levels of indebtedness chasing the 60% targets, it is not appropriate at this point and we need to look at these rules all over again.<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister, especially in his role as president of the Eurogroup, support the extension of the general escape clause and the work of rewriting the fiscal architecture of the European Union?

It is a matter for the Government to decide on what our application is going to be and we have to engage with the Commission on that.

At the same time, are we recognising fully the problem that faces the general public?  After experiencing hard times for so long and being crushed for so long, do we need to give them some kind of encouragement or incentive in recognition of the efforts they have made and in view of the fact that we cannot recover all the expenditure in a year or two years but that, with the passage of time and growth, we will recover some of the ground?

It is open until 22 February and we would be delighted to hear from the committee as part of that process.  All Departments have been consulted regarding the preparation of that plan which is currently under way.<\/p> <p>  On the question asked by Deputy Durkan, we are certainly pursuing counter-cyclical policies at this point.  Over the course of 2021, our expenditure ceiling is almost &euro;88 billion.  That encompasses the money that has been allocated to the 45 Votes as well as the &euro;5.4 billion across the recovery fund and, of course, the Covid contingency fund.  We will require that money because the fact is that we are in level 5 restrictions.  We are dealing with a very strong third wave of this virus.  As such, the cost of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the CRSS, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the local authority rates waiver and so on is running at between &euro;1.2 billion and &euro;1.3 billion per month at this stage.  A certain amount of the provision necessary for that was provided for within the Votes allocated but, as the months go by and depending on the length and depth of the restrictions that need to be imposed, the resources we provided for are going to be required.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, given his international experience and overall responsibility in terms of macroeconomic policy, is well placed to comment on the overall budgetary strategy for the coming years.  One thing he and I share is the view that we should be unremarkable in European terms when considered next to our peers.  By that, we mean that we cannot be an outlier on the negative front because the extraordinary support of the European Central Bank, coupled with the strong position from which we went into this crisis, means that the current level of historically low interest rates will not continue indefinitely.  The markets will at some point take a view as to the overall sustainability of each country's public finances.  We are in a good position.  I believe we are managing this well.  We can afford to do what we are doing, but over the next period, and particularly in the stability programme update, we will need to map out a roadmap for the country in terms of the restoration of the public finances onto a sustainable path.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#H00200","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I emphasise and agree with the remarks of the Minister, Deputy McGrath.<\/p><p>We are in a public health emergency and have emergency economic measures in place to help our society and, indeed, Europe deal with this pandemic.

We have major levels of support in place in our economy.  As our public health conditions improve, we will need to begin the journey towards how we can put in place more appropriate budgetary policies that support our country in its recovery but move away from very high levels of support that are needed when many people are not in a position or not able to work. That is the approach we are taking in Ireland and it is paralleled by the approach being taken across the eurozone and the European Union.  For now the measures we have in place are needed.

If by referring to a short sharp movement the Deputy means a very rapid withdrawal of the measures we have in place and trying to move from having a deficit to being in balance in a very short period, that is not what we are envisaging.  It will take time for our economy and society to recover.  A withdrawal too quickly of the measures we have in place could be counterproductive.

A debate will begin during this year on the future of fiscal rules, but it is worth noting the fiscal rules have the general escape clause that was triggered which allowed for the measures that are in place in 2021.  The fiscal rules are in some way showing their worth in that, when this pandemic hit Ireland and Europe generally, national finances for the vast majority of countries within Europe were in a position of having a very small deficit, being in balance or having a surplus.  That, in turn, combined with the work of the European Central Bank, has been vital in allowing us to do what we are doing at the moment.<\/p><p>Therefore, fiscal rules play a really important role.

In respect of many of the recommendations in the committee's interim report, we can develop them on a partnership basis and I look forward to doing that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy touched on a really important issue, namely, the extraordinary level of savings we have witnessed in recent times.  However, we should be careful and put it in context.  When we talk about these things in the aggregate, it is far removed from the reality very many families have faced since last March.  A point the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, regularly makes, and it is one that strikes home with me, is that of the order of 115,000 people currently on the pandemic unemployment payment have been on it since March 2020.  They will be rapidly approaching 12 months of being in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment continuously.  Many of those people are facing great hardship.  We need to be very conscious of that when we touch on what is an important issue in the round.<\/p> <p>  For other people, their incomes are largely unaffected and they have far fewer opportunities to spend money in the hospitality sector, on holidays and on all the things that people might normally like to do.  There is pent-up demand.  The amount of savings across the financial system offers us great hope that, once we can get beyond the necessary restrictions we are having to impose, many people will want to return to the things they always liked to do.  There will be much demand for goods and for services, but it comes down to sentiment and confidence.  For me, in any economy that is the critical intangible, and that is why we have always said that moving out of the health pandemic is inextricably linked to our economic recovery.  Until people have the confidence that we are not heading into deeper restrictions in the future, I do not think they will adjust their behaviours.  For us the key issue is to manage the health pandemic as well as we can to make sure we do not have to deal with a fourth wave and reintroduce further restrictions over the course of 2021.  That will then give people confidence, as they see a level of normality returning in line with the vaccination programme.<\/p><p>Much of that money can undoubtedly represent a stimulus for the Irish economy which is something we would welcome.

The Deputy is correct to call out the fairly significant increase in household savings.  I understand that the last set of figures that were produced by the Central Statistics Office indicated that the level of household savings in the economy for the quarter in which they measured it had increased by nearly one third.  Such a level of increase is a significant economic development.  I very much agree with what the Minister, Deputy McGrath, has said that many in our society are saving more.  Many others in our society are using their savings to live on and to support their businesses at a time of significant strain.  Those savings can mean very different things to different people.<\/p> <p>  As the Minister, Deputy McGrath, said, how that money is released into our economy is also tied into confidence regarding the sustainable opening of our economy in the future.  A key factor that will influence how savings are used is whether those who are saving more believe their income and their employment will it be stable over a longer period of time than it was in 2020.  <\/p> <p>  The consumption mix as those savings are used within our economy is of course critical in being able to understand what effect it will have on our economy.  For example, if that money is spent on exports other countries will benefit from the use of those savings.  That is not necessarily a bad thing because, of course, our exporters can benefit from the spending of savings in other economies and so the two things go hand in hand.  If that money was to be spent over time within our hospitality and services sector, within domestic tourism for example, the release of that level of savings into a part of our economy which is really hurting could have a particularly positive effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#L00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We need to produce more common-language reports so what we can have better understanding of what is going on.<\/p> <p>  I ask both Ministers to consider having engagement with our committee prior to the publication of the summer economic statement so that the committee is better placed to consider that because it is usually over the summer.  If we could have some engagement with the Ministers or their officials in May, it would help us in our work.<\/p> <p>  We talk about the well-being and the measurement of the broader living standards in Ireland.  However, the north and western section of the country has been downgraded in its status to a region in transition, which means that our output and our economic derivative have fallen.  How will that be tackled in budgets in coming years?  This does not come from me but from the EU, which has written to Ireland about this.  There is a significant difference and we should be positively discriminating towards the north and western region.  I ask the Ministers for their comments on that.<\/p> <p>  I often say that the biggest problem we have with budgets is looking at what the outcomes are.  We set the budget and we get reports, but we do not actually see how the budget works.  For instance, I have tried to elicit information from different Departments about how their capital projects are performing and if they are overrunning.  They are struggling to come up with the information.  It beggars belief that we are spending billions of euro on capital projects and we do not have readily to hand how each project performs, and if we have overruns why we have them and whether we should take corrective action.  There are many strategic issues we have not taken into account when we are spending billions of euro.  Nobody, apart from officials from the OPW, has come back to me how they are performing on their capital spend and whether their final accounts are exceeding their tenders.  It is a very simple process.  I ask the Ministers to comment on those matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#M00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I will take this to begin with.  I thank the Deputy for those observations and I agree with much of what he said.<\/p><p>What I will say, however, is that in recent months, in finding my feet in the Department, I have come to the realisation that there are a lot of very good reports written that do not get the attention they deserve.  I would point to the spending review papers, for example.  Since 2017 more than 100 spending reviews, including 25 last year, have been completed and published.  They look to the very point the Deputy raises.  We spend all this money in different areas and do we look back and see how it worked out?  Can we learn lessons?  Did we get the outcomes we were trying to achieve?  I urge this committee and the respective line committees to undertake work with the spending review papers because there is a wealth of information there.  Similarly, the public service performance report is published annually, normally in spring.  Again, there is a huge amount of information there which measures performance.  Ultimately, from my perspective as Minister with responsibility for public spending, it is important we measure outcomes because that should inform better decision-making going forward.  I would really welcome any feedback from the Deputy or the committee on the language, the terminology and the presentation format in the various reports we publish because we need to make them as understandable, meaningful and accessible as possible.<\/p><p> As for the north and the west, we are currently undertaking a review of the national development plan, NDP, as the Deputy will be aware.  That is out for public consultation until 19 February.  One of the objectives is to make sure that the aim of balanced regional development is progressed.  I encourage all stakeholders in the north and the west to engage in that process.  Over the course of the coming months we will finalise essentially the new NDP for the next decade, and there is a fantastic opportunity there to have the voice of the north and the west heard.  If Deputy Canney needs any information on any of the capital spending programmes and is not getting information he believes should be made available, I ask him to contact my Department and we will make sure that whatever information is at our disposal is made available to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#M00300","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Does anybody wish to comment on the summer economic statement and earlier engagement-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#N00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I will come in on that.

I was engaged in a one-man campaign in the previous D&aacute;il to banish the terms \"gross fiscal space\" and \"net fiscal space\" from any conversation in which I was involved, and the Deputy's words will encourage me to keep at it.  We need to challenge ourselves in the language we use to make it as clear as possible.<\/p> <p>  In truth, I think we can work with the committee to explain the principles behind the summer economic statement and its work before decisions are made and how it works, but I do not believe we can engage with the committee on the content of the summer economic statement before we in the Government agree it.  It is a decision by the Government on future budgetary priorities and has to be agreed within the Government before we can take that strategy to the Parliament and to our country.  Yes, there are definite opportunities for us to engage, to explain the process and to make it as clear as possible, but it is appropriate that we engage with the committee on the content of the statement only when it is agreed by the Government.  We have to put enough time into doing that inside the Government.

I see that as an opportunity for the regions to grow their population and create a balance throughout the country.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Ministers would give their thoughts as to how, from a budgetary point of view, the Government might positively discriminate towards such a scenario in which we spread the population from the major centres of population out into the regions to support them.

I thank the Deputy for the question.  There are undoubtedly opportunities for the regions in the post-Covid world that we are all really looking forward to.  Many of the changes that have occurred in the past nine or ten months have been forced upon us, and we would not be having this engagement in this format were it not for Covid-19.  The truth is that many people have now realised they do not necessarily need to be at their normal place of work five days a week.  If that enables more people to spend time in their local communities, that offers a lot of opportunity and potential.  I think the truth is that we will be looking at a hybrid.  I think it will take us a while to figure out the appropriate balance.  We also need to have strong cities.  That is important for our country as well.<\/p> <p>  We are working under the umbrella of an overall national planning framework, as the Deputy will be aware, which is to be reviewed in the coming years.  That is the overarching strategy for Project Ireland 2040, with the NDP sitting alongside the national planning framework.  Certainly, from the point of view of the work ongoing in my Department, I anticipate that the issue of remote working and the opportunities it presents for towns and villages across regional Ireland will feature strongly as part of the review of the NDP.  The Deputy will have already seen a number of different Departments invest public money in different initiatives to facilitate people working in their local communities: in remote working hubs, co-working spaces and so on.  There are a whole range of programmes in that regard.  I think we will see much more of that but it will be a hybrid.  I do not think that into the future the current position that pertains during the crisis will be the permanent situation.  It will move back to probably a more balanced combination, which I think would suit an awful lot of people and which presents opportunities for rural Ireland for sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#O00200","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":478,"content":"<p>It is the Green Party time slot now, so I will focus on the process and the issues we are dealing with in this report.

This came out particularly from discussions with some counterparts in Austria.  One of the issues that has come to the fore for us is the timing of the mid-year expenditure report and whether it is too late to allow for a proper budgetary oversight review of that document before the budget process is in place.  Linked to this is the treatment of the Finance Bill.  I think we can all agree that the Finance Bill properly belongs in the finance committee, but there was a suggestion that we could support some of that work by looking over the course of a year at things such as tax expenditures in order that we might formulate some kind of position on a hands-free budget.  I put that to both Ministers.  It is the idea of producing a more detailed overview of what a hands-free budget would look like every year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#O00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":479,"content":"<p>May I come in on that?

Clearly, the sooner we can have material shared with the committee the better, but we do face challenges in doing that from a departmental point of view.<\/p><p>A concrete example would be the stability programme update, SPU.  We would struggle to do an SPU any earlier than we do at the moment because even when we do that update, we only have a single quarter of tax revenue available to analyse.  Our ability to form a projection regarding our economic performance for a year any earlier than April is limited.  If we were trying to produce forecasts for this committee in quarter 1 about the economic outlook for the year, we would only have a month of two worth of data available to us and we would run the risk of sharing forecasts with the committee that would be plain wrong and that could cause difficulty later in the year.<\/p><p> The option for a no policy change budget is, in effect, made available when the White Paper on expenditure and receipts is published but that does not happen, typically, until the Friday night before the budget.  Perhaps in the coming year we could look at the possibility of providing the committee with some kind of a starting position for the budget before any new policy decisions are made.  A considerable amount of information is made available about the budgetary process.  The wealth of information contained in, for example, the tax strategy group papers gives a sizeable amount of advice and perspective to the committee.  If the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform manages to repeat the expenditure review process that has happened in other years, a huge volume of data regarding how we spend money within our country is available.  There may be opportunities to bring it forward to a little bit earlier in the year but I am not sure that we can do that in the way the Deputy is suggesting without undermining the accuracy of what we are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#O01000","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>We now have the volume of Revised Estimates for the following year in December.

That is important.<\/p> <p>  We then have the SPU in April and the summer economic statement, which is normally around June.

We in the committee have talked a lot around the treatment by sectoral committees of budgets in general, Estimates and Supplementary Estimates.  One issue that arisen is the fact that we are somewhat an outlier compared to other EU countries.  We do not approve or take a view on Estimates or Supplementary Estimates and get them quite late in the budgetary cycle.  The Oireachtas does not approve the SPU, for example, and unlike almost every other European country, there is no facility for the Opposition to amend the budget.

There are always opportunities for us to engage with and better explain our work to the Oireachtas and hear the views of others.  I have been present at many such debates over the years and have always listened to what the members of the committee have said and tried to respond to them.  There are core issues that are fundamental to the Government regarding its being charged with producing a budget and then, because we have a history of majority governance in our country, although that changed during the previous D&aacute;il, the Finance Bill and Estimates have been the preserve of the Government.  It is not a balance I would be recommending we change at the moment.  I am sure if there was a majority Green Party government, the Chairperson would be eager to ensure that its budget reflected the majority Green Party within that government.

As committee members know, Supplementary Estimates go to the line committee in the same way as normal Estimates. They are scrutinised before they come back into the D&aacute;il.  Some thought needs to be given as to the exact demarcation of the responsibilities and roles of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which would perhaps focus on the overall framework.  We should then ask whether we can enhance the work of the sectoral committees when it comes to considering the annual Estimates and Supplementary Estimates which are considered in committee and then come into the D&aacute;il for an actual vote.

The basic point of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight is to ensure the sustainability of the public finances, to oversee the moneys that are allocated, what we get for those moneys as they are allocated in different areas, and whether they are achieving their ends.  I want to put to the Minister something obvious to which he has alluded, that is, all bets are off during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many of the normal signposts or markers for the budgetary cycle have been put off.  The summer economic statement was not produced.  An extra &euro;6 billion had to appear days before the budget.<\/p><p>All of this is happening because of a pandemic, a virus that does not give a hoot about the budgetary cycle, fiscal rules, summer economic statements, projections or anything else.  It seems to me that we are flying blind until we get this virus under control and that all of the chatter about sustainable public finances is borderline meaningless until we get it under control.  I would like the Minister to respond to that point.  In comparison with other countries that have the virus under control, where most of the time most people are living normal lives and they can plan, such as New Zealand, Australia, Vietnam, Taiwan and much of China, we are not doing as well.  We have no idea what is coming down the line.  This week, we had Ministers making statements about arbitrary dates for the reopening of sectors of the economy which seem to bear no relationship to the level of Covid infection.  At the current level of 800, it is four times higher than it was when the Government made the decision to reopen sectors of the economy prior to Christmas, with disastrous effect not only in terms of infection but economically, the full ramifications of which we still do not know.  I put it to both Ministers that if this happens again, maybe two or three times this year, our ability to manage the public finances and be sustainable in our approach to them will be somewhat difficult.  <\/p><p> The budget deficit was &euro;20 billion extra last year and is projected to be &euro;20 billion extra this year.  The debt increased by 10% last year.  I ask the Minister to confirm if that &euro;219 billion will rise by another 10% if his plans come to pass this year.  Would the Minister agree that in the interest of sustainable management of the public finances, we need to get control of the virus.  Will he acknowledge that trying to live alongside a virus that does not want to negotiate with us is not a very good idea and that we need to get control of it by adopting a different strategy?  I am serious in saying that because this has a bearing on everything we and the Minister have to deal with for the next year.  I ask the Minister to respond to that point as well.  It seems to me the current plan is not working and it is costly us a great deal at every level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#Q00800","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I am not sure which Minister would like to take those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#R00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I will begin by offering some thoughts on the debt issues raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Most of the figures he referenced in regard to the debt forecast are correct.  By the end of last year, our debt stood at &euro;219 billion, which is an increase of approximately &euro;15 billion versus what we estimated it would be.  Taking the two year period of last year and this year together, there will be an increase in our national debt of &euro;33 billion.  We are seeing a very considerable increase in our national debt, albeit an increase in the stock of our debt that is in line with what we are seeing happening in other countries.  This is additional debt which we have been able to refinance at a next to zero interest rates due to the manner in which we have managed our public finances and the work of the European Central Bank.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked if we need to take a different approach to Covid.  We have to be open to all debates and points of view in regard to what we are doing and not dismiss each other's point of view out of hand, which Deputy Boyd Barrett rarely does on important issues and I do not propose to do so now.  I will offer three points that matter to me in relation to the points the Deputy made.<\/p><p>First, the Deputy spoke about the need to reduce radically the presence of the disease within our country and its transmission.  That is what we are trying to do.  As a country, we have taken the most extraordinary measures over the past year to do that.  Second, the Deputy seemed to suggest we should go beyond that and have a target of zero Covid.  As I understand it, zero Covid is defined by some people as zero community transmission for 14 days consecutively.  When community transmission was at its lowest level, we did not get to that point.  Third, if we were to set that objective, it would require public health measures that would stretch beyond what we are proposing to do in regard to travel and borders within our country because the origin of much of this disease is community transmission as opposed to travel.  It would require very significant and sustained measures in terms of the contact we have with each other, our society and how we organise movement within our country that would stretch beyond how we manage travel.<\/p><p> I would like to make a further point genuinely to the Deputy who I know is raising this point genuinely.  I have heard him speak eloquently about the personal and social consequences of demanding public health measures.  It is at least implicit, if not likely, in the approach he is suggesting that those public health measures would be of greater severity for longer periods.  That is a factor in evaluating the case the Deputy puts forward.  As demanding as the management of mobility in and out of the country is - the Deputy will know that travel accounts for less than 0.5% of recorded Covid cases over the past number of weeks - far more would be required to deliver zero Covid.  If that is what the Deputy is looking for, even stronger measures will be required in regard to travel.  It is important to outline what those measures are and what effects they would have on our society and the well-being of many people about whom I know the Deputy is concerned, which is why he raised this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#R00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett's time has expired.

As the Ministers are aware, it provides for the investor court system, which is a legal mechanism that will allow large corporations to sue the State for massive sums of money.  This has the potential to have a significant impact on the budgetary position both directly in terms of a reduction in available spend because of legal costs incurred and indirectly in terms of tax foregone because the presence of the investor court system may act as a deterrent to Governments using the tax system to modify corporate behaviour.

I would point to the overall context within which our economy operates and our experience over the last ten or 11 months of living with Covid-19.  The reality is that the role of FDI in Ireland and our position as an open, trading economy has, in many ways, helped us to absorb some of the enormous shock of Covid-19.  This is clear from the number of jobs that have been sustained, the corporation tax paid and the income tax receipts underpinned by employment in the FDI sector.  Ireland's place in the world is as a small, open trading economy with a very strong enterprise sector.  That is why the Cabinet today approved an additional &euro;90 million for Enterprise Ireland for the sustaining enterprises fund.  Many of the businesses that will avail of funding from a scheme like the sustaining enterprises fund will be seeking export opportunities to countries like Canada.  In that regard, from the perspective of the Irish Government, the opportunities of CETA far outweigh the risks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#T00100","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I am absolutely astonished, given our 20-year liability, that a risk assessment has not been done.

A certain amount of grants that can be provided constitute capital spending as well so the Deputy will be aware of all of the money we provided for the restart grants for businesses in 2020, which was in the region of &euro;700 million, and the funding we provided to our schools with regard to minor works grants and the ICT grants.

Ulster Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland seem to have used all of the resources related to providing the recovery funds.

This is potentially a huge blow to consumers, the financial sector here and small and medium enterprises, in respect of which a quarter of lending is done through this institution.  The Governor of the Central Bank has said that a decision to withdraw is likely to push up interest rates, which would be a problem in a jurisdiction which already has the highest interest rates in Europe at double the European average.  At my request, the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has asked that the Minister for Finance formally engage in this process.

There are a number of State-owned banks or banks where the State has a majority shareholding.  The worst option in all of this would be that the loan book would be sold to a vulture fund.

We are talking about value for money, but I think we would get a hell of a lot more value out of it if we put the additional resources into the local authorities and asked them to run the scheme.  We would deliver quickly to where it is needed to help people in fuel poverty.  It is something that might be considered in the context of how the whole scheme has performed since its introduction.  It has failed many people and there are many people waiting from 18 months to two years to have an inspection, which is totally unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#X00700","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":546,"content":"<p>May I respond briefly or does the Chairman wish to move on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#Y00100","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":547,"content":"<p>If the Minister can respond in about 20 seconds he should go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021020900002#Y00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Very briefly, I think the significant delay has been in getting the assessors out to homes.

Following events surrounding the Northern Ireland protocol, the committee welcomes the opportunity to engage and ask questions about the sequence of events that ultimately led to the European Commission triggering Article 16 before it made a U-turn on that decision.<\/p> <p>  As members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, we feel we have a twofold responsibility in this regard: first, to ask questions at a Government level as to what happened and how it happened and, second, we must have accountability at a Commission level.  We want to ensure what happened does not happen again and that we can have public trust and confidence in the protocol's procedure in the future.  We look forward to the engagement today.  The Minister of State will get a feeling and a sense from the members as to where they are on this issue.  Last week, however, there was a certain anxiety and obvious desire to deal with this issue.  We appreciate the Minister of State being with us today.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm aon eolas at&aacute; agam a scaipeadh.<\/p> <p>  This is my first appearance before the committee since the trade and co-operation agreement was reached between the EU and the UK.  I will first speak briefly speak on that before I talk about the issue of the protocol, which is obviously of huge concern not only to the committee but to Government as well.<\/p> <p>  The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is the framework for the relationship between the European Union and the UK into the future and complements the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Northern Ireland.  Like any international agreement, it is the product of compromise and give and take.  Neither the European Union nor the UK has got everything it would have wanted but there is much to recommend it.<\/p> <p>  The agreement provides for zero tariff, zero quota trade in goods of EU or UK origin.  This is a major priority of the Government and is vital for sectors such as our agrifood industry in particular which would have been devastated by tariffs.  It provides robust safeguards to ensure there is a level playing field between EU and UK businesses to protect Irish businesses and our future prosperity.  It provides for close co-operation with the UK in the energy and transportation sectors, which are essential to making our economy work.  It allows for close co-operation between the police and judicial authorities in Ireland, which is essential to effective policing on the island of Ireland.  I pay tribute to Mr. Michel Barnier and his team in the European Commission for their tireless work in securing the agreement.<\/p> <p>  Separately, and as the committee will be well aware, the Northern Ireland protocol came into effect on 1 January 2021.  It plays a vital role in protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including a key priority of the Government to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, as well as protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  It ensures that Northern Ireland traders continue to have access not only to Great Britain but also to the EU Single Market of 450 million consumers, access that is unique and vital for all-island supply chains.<\/p> <p>  For Northern Ireland, and indeed for businesses across the island, adapting to the changes is undoubtedly a challenge.  It is important, however, not to lose sight of the overall purpose of the protocol, what it is for and the role it plays in providing as much certainty as possible under the difficult circumstances caused by the UK leaving the European Union.  After four years of painstaking negotiations, it is clear there are no easy alternatives to the protocol.  It is clear that the European Union and the United Kingdom will have to continue to work closely together, particularly in the first weeks of the protocol&rsquo;s operation, as traders adjust to the new rules in place.  Every effort will need be made within the framework of the protocol to iron out any challenges that emerge.<\/p><p> It is very unfortunate that the protocol got caught up in the issue of the European Union vaccine procurement last week.  It is entirely regrettable that the Commission did not consult us in advance of the ostensible decision it contemplated with regard to invoking the protocol's safeguard clause.  The decision was, rightfully, rescinded shortly after the Taoiseach spoke to President von der Leyen on the Friday evening in question.<\/p><p> The European Union has a legitimate aim, on behalf of all of us, of protecting vaccine supplies.  Ireland will continue to work closely with the Commission on this issue.  However, that is entirely separate, and should be entirely separate, from the operation of the protocol.  We will be working with the Commission to review this matter and to continue to ensure that the protocol and its political context are properly understood.  All sides must now redouble their efforts to make the protocol work for Northern Ireland and all its people and businesses.  It is important to take a calm and measured approach based on trust and pragmatism to any issues that arise in regard to its implementation.  <\/p><p> I welcome that a call took place last Wednesday between the Vice-President of the European Commission, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Mr. &Scaron;efovi's opposite number in the UK, and the First Minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, of Northern Ireland.  In a joint afterwards, the EU and the UK described the discussion as a constructive one and stated they had agreed to work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues.  This approach is best managed through the established mechanisms and communication channels to address practical issues around the operation of the protocol, including the specialised committee on the protocol and the withdrawal agreement joint committee.  Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Chancellor Gove agreed to meet again this week in London and to keep in close contact as this work progresses.  EU-UK channels must remain the primary recourse for addressing any issues that arise in the interests of stability, clarity and sustainability.  Unilateral approaches to working through issues are unhelpful, no matter what the source.<\/p><p> The committee will also be aware that certain staff working at border control posts at the ports of Larne and Belfast were advised not to present for work on 2 February owing to concerns arising from intimidation and threats.  I condemn the intimidation of port staff and the menacing threats that have appeared as graffiti in Northern Ireland.  I welcome that the PSNI is actively engaged and taking appropriate measures.  I also welcome the confirmation that Larne council staff have returned to their duties.  All staff should be able to carry out their work safely and political leaders should make every effort to reduce tensions.<\/p><p> The Government is closely engaged with its counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive.  We are also listening carefully to business representatives on this and other issues.  We have been consistent in our position that we want the protocol to work as smoothly as possible for the people of Northern Ireland and people and businesses across the island of Ireland.  Trade volumes between Ireland and Great Britain remain low but they are gradually increasing.  We had 61 inbound movements on 1 and 2 January.  The figure reached its peak so far this year with 1,344 movements on 3 and 4 February.  <\/p><p> The Government understands that new controls have created challenges for many traders.  We will continue to help traders and hauliers to make the adjustment.  The changes are not temporary.  It is important that we all work together to adapt to the new trading environment.  A range of advisory, upskilling and support services remains available.  Over &euro;9.4 million has been allocated under our ready-for-customs grant that provides funding of up to &euro;9,000 per eligible employee.  It is also very important that, in line with its border operating model, the UK will introduce new checks and controls on imports from the EU in April and June.  We are working with our exporters to help them prepare for these changes.<\/p><p> No new controls apply on direct continental routes, which are proving very popular.  Freight volumes on these services are up 100% on last year.  We now have daily direct services to France, which was a key ask of the haulage sector.  In January there were 62 roll-on roll-off freight sailings in a typical week, which is up from about 26 such sailings last year.  We have 36 sailings to northern France per week as well as sailings to Spain, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands.<\/p><p> Brexit means change in the short, medium and long term.  Ireland will need to respond to the challenges and opportunities that this brings by playing a leadership role in shaping and developing our common European Union.  The relationship between Ireland and Britain is always close and special but our home is at the heart of the European Union.  I am very happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#C00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat Aire St&aacute;it Byrne.

He is right to acknowledge the huge work that has gone into getting us to the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  It was a massive achievement in very difficult circumstances.  The support we as a country have got from the European Commission since the Brexit referendum in 2016 has been immense; it has effectively been hand in glove.  The Minister of State is also right to separate the protocol from the triggering of Article 16.  I will discuss the protocol later.  The support and co-operation from the Commission makes what happened with the triggering of Article 16 on 29 January even more unbelievable and harder to get our heads around.  The triggering apparently happened without our knowledge.  Apparently it happened without the knowledge of the Irish nominee to the Commission.  Given that the European Commission has shown a massive understanding of the sensitives of relationships and of the protocol and the background to it, has the Minister of State learned anything in the intervening period about why it was triggered, who ordered its triggering and why the European Commission saw fit to trigger it without consulting the Irish Government in advance?<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to the meeting with the Commission and the British Government last week.  The meetings were positive.  I understand that there is to be a meeting today between European Commission officials and Irish representatives and that proposals to manage this issue going forward are to be tabled.  When it comes to our neutrality we have a triple lock.  We need some kind of a lock mechanism such that in future Article 16 can never be triggered without the agreement of the Government or without consultation with it.  The Minister of State is closer to this than we are and he has seen at close hand the damage done by the triggering, including the damage done to trust.  It is being reported on RT&Eacute; today that we will get some sort of vague comfort blanket assurances that this will not happen again, that there will be consultation with the Government around legislation and that if there is a problem, it will be put through Commissioner McGuinness's <i>cabinet.  <\/i>Instead, we should have something substantial, an actual formal process that would involve the Government in a formal way rather an <i>ad hoc<\/i>one.  I genuinely think the damage done by this triggering has been so immense that we now need a process to ensure it does not happen again.<\/p><p>On the protocol, I absolutely condemn the violence and threats being issued to people doing their jobs in the last few weeks.  It brings us back to a much darker time.  On the general matter of EU-Britain trade, we are currently running at volumes that are around 50% of what they were this time last year.  Revenue has declared 1.8 million custom declarations in January alone, which is more than the total for 2020.  Who in the Government is co-ordinating the response so that we will be ready when trade returns to full volumes?  Can the Minister of State say we will not have any major difficulties or delays with goods going to Britain and coming in from there when trade is hopefully restored to full volumes?  The lower volumes at the moment are presumably due to Brexit stockpiling before December and to the pandemic.  Who in the Government is going to co-ordinate this to ensure there is no disruption to supplies either between here and Britain or the reverse in terms of the food industry, etc.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#E00200","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Deputy Calleary has asked some very important and fundamental questions on various aspects of this.<\/p><p> On the question of Article 16 being triggered, while we might not be as shocked now two weeks on, the reaction Deputy Calleary shows today is similar to the Government's reaction on the day, namely, one of complete shock and surprise.  It is absolutely the case that we had no knowledge of what was being planned.  We had spent the previous weeks being asked about Article 16 from another perspective, and quite rightly pointed out that this was a pretty standard safeguarding clause in trade agreements and was not designed to eliminate the protocol or be used except in the most extreme circumstances.  It came as a complete surprise to us when we saw that it was invoked.  In my case, I saw it on social media at 4.30 p.m on the Friday while I was out for a walk.  I was a bit shocked.  It went against everything we had been considering and planning for over the previous weeks when this was an issue.  It has caused continued consternation and has been deeply unhelpful.<\/p><p> On the how and the why the article was triggered, these are questions for the European Commission.  Clearly, it should not have happened.  There was a commercial dispute with AstraZeneca.  We stand in solidarity with the Commission on that and on the vaccine purchasing arrangement.  Article 16 should not have come into that at all, however.  As soon as the Taoiseach was informed of this by his chief Sherpa he was immediately on the phone to Ursula von der Leyen.  There was ongoing engagement in the early evening, but the Taoiseach will have to speak for himself on that because he was the one making the calls.  There was subsequent engagement with Boris Johnson.  We continue to engage with the Commission and other member states, at my level, at the Minister for Foreign Affairs' level, at the Taoiseach's level and at ambassadorial level.<\/p><p> The point of concern for the moment, and which Deputy Calleary has hit upon, relates to how will we ensure this does not happen again.  The Government wants an early warning system to be put in place.  Whatever meeting is reported today, there are also ongoing meetings.  I will have a range of meetings with my counterparts too.  There is a view, which is a risky view, that yes the Commission made a mistake and has acknowledged the mistake and that everything has been resolved.  Clearly, that is not the case because the consequences of this matter are continuing.  We must apprise our colleagues around the EU of the lasting consequences of what has happened around the protocol, and that when one action is taken it inevitably provokes an opposite reaction.  Members may have seen press reports where our ambassador gave a full-blooded account of the consequences of invoking Article 16 to other EU ambassadors at a meeting of the Committee of the Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States to the European Union, COREPER, last week.  I have also done this with my colleagues, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the Taoiseach in his interactions.<\/p><p> This has not been good and we want an early warning system.  I am not sure about a formal process, as Deputy Calleary referred to, but engagement is ongoing to make sure that it does work.  Before my time in the role, a great deal of work was done in recent years to keep the Commission and the other member states apprised of the actual situation on the ground in Northern Ireland.  We cannot assume prior knowledge.  We were lucky with Michel Barnier in that he had a long history in the context of the various roles he has held.  He was a Minister for agriculture and for foreign affairs and then he was in the Commission when the PEACE programme funding was first put in place.  Mr. Barnier had a deep knowledge of the situation in Northern Ireland but this may not be the case for everybody else, which would be natural.  That is one of the first points.  We must make sure that people know what the situation is like on the ground, that it is not simply something that can be put in writing between the EU and Britain and that there are many complicated aspects to it.  Whatever meeting is reported today, I will not come here and describe this as a key, crunch meeting.  There is ongoing engagement under way and we may not have a resolution on it today.  It is safe to say that people are fully aware of the significance of what has transpired.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the Deputy's point on trade volumes and the concern about co-ordination.<\/p><p>A group comprised of representatives of all Departments meets on a daily basis to examine all of the issues around trading goods, particularly between Britain and Ireland.  We are also, as I am sure are members, engaging with hauliers and logistics companies and their concerns are being fed into the system.  I compliment officials and Government agencies on taking on board some of the concerns.  People at the coalface and on the front line of importing and logistics need to get things done.  Much of this work is time sensitive.  They have brought many issues to our attention and I encourage them to continue to do that.  The numbers show that some trade has moved from the land bridge to the direct routes.  We can see that by volume.  It is not possible to do an exact comparison but some trade has moved.  Numbers on the Ireland-Britain route are down but they have increased dramatically on the direct continental routes.  <\/p><p> I mentioned in my earlier contribution that Britain has not yet introduced checks to the extent that we have.  Businesses will have to start preparing for this and Government will be trying to help them prepare for it through the various schemes.  Businesses need to be aware that things are going to get more difficult.  It is important to remember that checks are taking place for a reason.  This is our contribution to the European Union Single Market and customs union.  The Single Market was created to avoid red tape and border checks.  Britain decided to leave the Single Market and that has inevitably resulted in checks raising their heads again.  They are not temporary.  This is an obligation we have to take seriously because our economic prosperity and the protection of our public health and safety depend on it.  The Single Market is essential to our economy.  That is an important message.  We do not want these checks but they are essential to our membership of the Single Market.  Revenue has introduced some easements to help the situation and that may continue but these are not exemptions or free passes.  We have to implement the new arrangements in the most practical way possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#E00400","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

There is no point in underscoring our collective reaction to the decision to trigger Article 16.  It went beyond unfortunate and regrettable, but I suppose the Minister of State has to use those words.  I am interested in getting behind the process.  The Minister of State said that is a matter for the Commission, but it is a matter for all of us to know how the Commission operates.  The President of the Commission said this was a decision of the college of Commissioners but we heard from our Irish nominated Commissioner that she was not alerted to it.  Does the Minister of State know how this came about?  It is akin to a Government decision being made without members of the Government being aware of it.  I am sure that happened in the past, but it should not happen.  There is a process.  One would imagine that on something as sensitive as this there is a clear process.  It undermines my confidence in the decision-making processes for the future.  I would like to know how this happened, as I am sure would the Government.  Where was the mistake or is there a structural difficulty in regard to all of this?  In terms of this not happening again, the utterances of the Commission immediately afterwards did not indicate that would be the case.<\/p><p>It basically reserved the right, maybe, to exercise Article 16 again.  As I said, I listened last week at the meeting to the EU ambassador to the UK, and he was less than clear in saying this was an action we should not have taken.  That is the first question.

The President of the Commission herself has taken full political responsibility for this, and I think that is where accountability lies.  Again, I am not running away from the question because I am as concerned as the Deputy.  However, I cannot answer for the Commission.  It is accountable to the European Parliament and the parliamentarians plan to question Commissioners, and maybe the President as well, and she has already addressed people.  I am not here to defend the Commission in any way but I cannot be accountable for it either.<\/p> <p>  All of us, when we see a decision of the European Commission, are entitled to assume that the Commission has decided to do this in accordance with its powers and the way it does business, and we are entitled to assume that the College of Commissioners, in general, is part of the decision-making.  As to the exact mechanics in this regard, the Commission will have to explain that, and we are in ongoing engagement with the Commission on that.  Obviously, with trade policy, the Commission has the competence and it makes decisions like this, I am told, on an extremely regular basis in terms of safeguarding measures.  Unfortunately, it appears to be the case that while the trade experts crossed every t and dotted every i, and made sure there was no possible theoretical escape route, somebody with a political sensibility in terms of the actual reality of the ground, and the lived lives of people in Northern Ireland, was not in the room making that decision.  That is fundamentally the problem here.<\/p> <p>  It is a decision that I certainly hope will not happen again but Deputy Howlin is right that we need to ensure it does not happen again.  As I said, we have ongoing engagement and that will need to continue.  I strongly encourage members of the committee in their engagement with the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, and with their counterparts not just to say that a mistake was made here but to state that it cannot happen again, because to do otherwise would be to state we are okay when, in fact, we are not okay because we see the ongoing consequences in Northern Ireland.  All of us here on this island, as Europeans, need to let our European colleagues know, in whatever capacity, what the consequences are to ensure more people know what the actual situation is on the ground in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, she has taken political responsibility and will have to be accountable to the European Parliament.  I know the Vice-President of the Commission has been invited before the committee and I sincerely hope he attends and answers its questions.

It says that 80% of vehicular traffic coming in is green-lighted, which means that one in five vehicles is stopped.  That is a very significant volume.  I acknowledge not all of that is within our remit, inasmuch as the preparedness of many of the British authorities and companies was not what it should have been.  However, we have a real problem in regard to that level of stoppages in a situation, first, where there are already derogations from some elements of the protocol for a period and, second, where the volumes were down to 50% in January.  There will be a chaotic build-up if 20% of vehicles are being stopped when it is at full volume.  While it is not entirely within our remit, we need to have flexibility within Revenue if its systems are not working.  I want to know what the Government wants to do about that.<\/p> <p>  Second, I listened to Revenue yesterday stating that, because Britain is now a third country, it is applying the standard checks for third countries, with something like 5% or 6% of vehicles being checked at random.

That is just not possible.  The Single Market was built to avoid this type of bureaucracy, paperwork and checks.  Britain has left the Single Market and some checks are inevitably necessary.  There will always be some checks.  There were checks previously but they were not for customs.

The stops involve paperwork.  Much of that paperwork can be rectified.  That will take some getting used to, with companies getting used to the new procedures and finding it difficult to get customs experts, which is why there is Government support.

Moving on from Article 16, my next concern is twofold.  Does the Minister of State think that the British Government is now in danger of pushing this too far?  We see extra demands and a consistent underlining that it is now prepared to trigger Article 16.  If one looks at the albeit typical British newspapers, they are demanding a renegotiation less than six weeks since the trade deal was agreed.  A British minister on national radio this morning accused the EU of being unreasonable and changing its position.

That is a point I have been making.  Many people said yes, put up their hands and said that a mistake was made and that it has been acknowledged.  Some people said we should move on but obviously we cannot move on when we see the particular situation on the ground in Northern Ireland.  As I said already, it is up to all of us, in whatever interactions we have with our interlocutors in Europe, to make sure the situation and the damage done is if fully appreciated by them.  The solution then is to have this early warning system which will presumably ensure that this could not possible happen again.  Nobody will want this to happen again but the important point it is to make sure that is does not happen again.  With colleagues, I am certainly making it very clear that damage was done and that is continues to be lasting.<\/p> <p>  There is on going contact between Britain and the European Union, in particular between the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and Michael Gove.  In Northern Ireland, there has been much engagement.  By the way, there has been a North-South Ministerial Council since this happened.  There is ongoing political engagement as well in relation to Northern Ireland.  We were getting many calls about Article 16 before all of this happened and, indeed, its invocation was suggested at very high levels in Britain in January.<\/p> <p>  The important point to remember is that the protocol is a legal agreement between Britain and the European Union and its function is basically to make the best possible job out of a bad job, which is Brexit, for the island of Ireland.  Even the attempted invocations of Article 16 a couple of weeks ago, did not eliminate the protocol.  It did damage but it provided for a very limited arrangement there.  That is what Article 16 is there for.  Anyone who is going to invoke Article 16 needs to realise doing so will not eliminate the protocol.  The protocol is there to avoid the hard border on the island, to make sure people and good can move freely, and that Northern Ireland remains part of the Single Market of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  There is very close contact with the British Government at all levels.  Late last year Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Michael Gove, in terms of their plan to implement the protocol, showed their good working relationship and that they are practical people who will get the job done.  They need to be given time to agree flexibilities that will help the protocol to work more effectively for all people of Northern Ireland.  It is not about Article 16.  It is not about getting rid of the protocol or replacing it.<\/p><p>The protocol is there and will remain, but it is about working to make sure it is as flexible as possible within its terms.  I am confident we can do that.  It will not make everybody happy but we do not have a winner takes all system in Northern Ireland.

It had no application to an attempt to stop vaccine being exported through Ireland.  Is it the case that whoever made this decision did not read and did not understand the extent of the protocol?  If that is the case, we are left in a situation not merely in which damage was done but the operation of protocol is in the hands of people who do not understand it.

It is not a multilateral process in which we step in or out.

I know the Minister said that we cannot really move on from it, but we will eventually.  We need to learn the lessons and to move on from it eventually perhaps by, as other speakers said, putting the early warning system in place.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions and a few thoughts.  Problems were always going to arise with the implementation of the protocol for business and consumers in Northern Ireland.  It is fair to say that many businesses in Northern Ireland were simply not prepared for Brexit.<\/p><p>Trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland has been disrupted.  Supermarkets in Northern Ireland have experienced shortages of time-sensitive goods, such as fresh produce and chilled meats.  Many sorts of horror stories are emerging concerning people not being able to bring their pets into Northern Ireland from Great Britain because of issues with vaccination etc.  It is clear in that context that practical and sensible modifications are needed regarding the operation of the protocol in Northern Ireland.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that such practical and sensible modifications can be made to sort out these types of problems?  Do such possibilities exist?  For example, is an extension of the grace period a possibility?<\/p><p> My second question concerns the Northern Ireland peace process, which we are all worried about.  The Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and unionists in general have always seen the creation of a border in the Irish Sea as some sort of step in the direction of Irish unity and the holding of a border poll.  Therefore, the sensitivities involved with this issue are clear to everybody.  The DUP has not had a good Brexit.  The party supported Brexit in the first place and then opposed the deal reached by the former British Prime Minister, Theresa May.  The members of that party are of course going to exaggerate the consequences of the Northern Ireland protocol for political purposes.  We saw the DUP put forward a five-point plan to have the protocol abolished, which of course is not going to happen.  The party is, however, calling on the UK Government to invoke Article 16 and to have the protocol abolished, if possible.<\/p><p> In respect of the threat to relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, I was interested to hear the Minister of State say that there has been a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  The DUP had threatened to cease co-operation with such bodies, and that would be a serious issue.  We all agree with the call to calm things down because of the sensitivities involved in this situation.  I take it that the Minister of State agrees that North-South relations are extremely important, but will he reassure me that things are being done to repair the damage done?  We are obviously not responsible for that damage, but we are seriously concerned about this deterioration in relations.  We must improve those relations and take positive steps to bring that improvement about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#M00400","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":597,"content":"<p>The North-South meeting which took place was one of the formal structures on waterways.  The North-South bodies are limited anyway, and we would like for there to be more of them.  It is important, however, to note that meeting did happen.  I share fully the Deputy's concerns regarding North-South relations.  It is important to keep everything on an even keel in that respect.  This situation has clearly interrupted that endeavour.  There are many other threats to the peace process in Northern Ireland, but what has happened has shown us that if something in this vein occurs, then it can cause immediate harm.<\/p> <p>  When I said we cannot move on from this, my point was that at this particular moment we cannot accept people just putting their hands up and saying everything is now fine.  Clearly, it is not fine right now.  Deputy Haughey is correct, though, that we need to move forward.  People calling for the protocol to be abolished must realise that is not going to happen, and that is a fact.  The protocol is a legal agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union and it is not going to be abolished.  Ultimately, these problems have been caused by Brexit.  The protocol exists and is designed to alleviate the problems of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  Trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is about where it was previously.  It has not gone down.  Some of that is possibly a reflection of trade coming here, and there has definitely been some movement from Dublin to Belfast.  It may seem, therefore, that trade is down.<\/p><p>In actual numbers, however, it is not; it is at a similar level.  It is important to remember that there is a huge amount of trade getting through between Northern Ireland and Britain, as well a lot of people doing works.  Even after the threats last week, which were repulsive and are to be condemned, a great number of checks still were happening because much of this is done on a documentary basis.  There are issues, however, that are causing annoyance.  They can be dealt with within the structures of the protocol that might help the situation but that does not mean that the protocol is going to be changed.  The UK has set out some things it is asking for some of which reflect demands in the North, including businesses there.  Modest extensions of the existing grace periods would definitely help reassure the business sector and moderate voices and Northern society broadly that they are being listened to and that we genuinely want to make the protocol work for every section of the community in Northern Ireland.  That is important to all of us.  <\/p><p> It is not about winners and losers but about trying to make the best possible situation out of what is a very difficult scenario in Northern Ireland at present.  I am convinced that if we can get over the current difficulties, recognising that a great deal of trade is happening and that many goods can come in, we can solve some of the issues the Deputy raised.  I cannot give any commitments on them but I know some can be resolved.  Some cause particular anxiety, such as the issue concerning pets.  The Alliance Party proposed a veterinary agreement between the EU and Britain and that certainly is in the range of possibilities in the medium term.  It is not something that will provide immediate answers but it is something with which we would have no difficulties whatsoever.  We want to make this work and work for everybody.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#N00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I am in agreement with much of what others have said.

I welcome that the Government is taking on board issues brought to it by people involved in supply chain logistics and so on, as the Minister of State noted.  <\/p> <p>  What I think has happened is that unionist politicians have looked at their polling numbers,know they are under pressure and are using tried and tested methods from the 1880s nearly or from the 1980s.  If we accept that the Irish protocol and the withdrawal agreement are international agreements that are not going anywhere, it could be another case of leading people up the hill, which is not helpful.  Nor is it helpful when one hears about Michael Gove's ultimatum letter or hears Arlene Foster speak of how she has Boris Johnson on side from the point of view of introducing legislation that would negate elements of the Irish protocol, as well as the fact that he might simply invoke Article 16.  I have no doubt that the Government has engaged with the British Government on this issue.  I would like to think the engagement is robust.  I seek an update from the Minister of State on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#O00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":600,"content":"<p>There is a hugely changed political situation in Northern Ireland, and we see from opinion polling that it is changing all the time.  There are many nuances of opinion; it is not one side versus the other.  I think we can all agree now that there are significant nuances and a broad range of the public there who want to live decent lives, have prosperity and be able to move around the place.  The Irish Government will try to ensure the best opportunity for the North.  When these issues are solved, and work is ongoing to solve them, Northern Ireland will have a huge opportunity to be part of the Single Market of the European Union.  If one's perspective is on the unionist side, Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of Britain as well.  There are therefore huge opportunities there for the economy, and it is up to all of us, but particularly leaders in Northern Ireland, to help drive that forward and to make sure those opportunities are seized.<\/p> <p>  I cannot get into what questions officials or others have asked many times.  The Commission as a body signed off on the measure which included Article 16 and political responsibility rests with the Commission.  Ursula von der Leyen has accepted that and there will be accountability to the European Parliament.  I accept that there is a point in trying to find out who did what to make sure that we have the right people there, that this cannot happen again and that somebody knows about the situation.  When I think of our system, however, which is slightly analogous, if a government were to make such a mistake, that government and its Ministers, not individual officials, would be accountable to the D&aacute;il.  The reality is that this was drawn up.  Commissioners, who are in regular contact with their counterparts here and indeed with the British Government, did not see fit to take out this provision or to say to themselves, as I did and, as I am sure, all committee members did when we first saw this on social media at about 4.30 p.m. that Friday, \"What the - ?\" I could not believe it.  I would like to think Commissioners would think in that same political way that this is something that just should not have happened.  That did not happen and, ultimately, there has to be political responsibility.  I know the European Parliament will do its job in that regard, but the lessons are very important too.<\/p> <p>  I will repeat this.  The protocol is there.  It will not go away.  Nobody has the possibility to remove it.  There is no possibility of negating elements of the protocol either.  There is the possibility of all of us working together to make sure it works in the most flexible way possible, consistent with everybody's demands that there be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  This is really important for the economies north and south of the Border, and we cannot lose sight of this when we talk about checks and customs.  It is really important that Ireland protects its place in the Single Market and that no questions are asked about that.  It is absolutely central and essential to our economic policy and our economic growth into the future.  That is very important, and I think everybody recognises that, but sometimes when we talk about difficulties and inconveniences we can perhaps put to one side the fact that the Single Market is so important and so central to us.  The invocation of Article 16 has already happened, almost, and we see the fallout from that, so I think it is very unlikely that that will happen again.  The point is that nobody can invoke Article 16 to eliminate the protocol or to change its terms.  The protocol remains and always will remain, and there are ways of making sure we all work together to work it as effectively and efficiently as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#P00100","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Due to the efficiency of the Minister of State in his answering, we can facilitate a second round of questions, but does Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; wish to come in with a supplementary question before I open the meeting up to the floor again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021020900002#P00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Yes.

Despite the fact that it is directly between the EU and Britain, we are fully involved.  Those systems were not used in this particular context.  That is part of the problem but there are ongoing engagements between Dublin and London also at a political level, which is very important.  When this matter first arose the Taoiseach was in touch with Commission President Ursula von der Leyen a number of times.  He then took the opportunity to speak to Prime Minister Johnson.  There is still ongoing contact between Michael Gove and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, as well as ongoing contact at official level and on the ground.

I have no doubt he will get a sense from this meeting that this conversation will not finish today.  There is an appetite among committee members to ensure we get accountability and transparency.  I believe that no single person made a decision of such magnitude and impact.  My belief is that a group of individuals came together and that people in the Commission know their identity.  For us to have confidence in the Commission into the future, it is imperative that we find out who made this decision of such magnitude because it had consequences.  For every action there is a reaction.  We only have to think of the time, effort and diligence invested in this by officials in the Commission such as Michel Barnier and his team and the individual countries throughout the European Union which knew of the sensitivity of the Northern Ireland peace process and went out of their way to send ambassadors here.  I met the Danish and the Dutch ambassadors in my county.  Many other ambassadors went to County Louth and different parts of the Border region over the past four and half years to get a sense of the situation.  Individual countries of the European Union understand the importance of the peace process and protecting it.  However, this decision, which was made very quickly by a group of individuals on a Friday evening, had drastic consequences that could have had a deeper impact on Northern Ireland.  It was a very serious decision.  It is very important that we as a nation have confidence in the European Union and have a Commission that is accountable.  It cannot be a powerful entity where individuals can be protected.  The message in that regard is strong.  The Minister of State need not address that again as he covered it to the best of his knowledge.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State may not have an answer to this specific question.  What assurances can he give that the protocols around strict veterinary distribution practices employed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are replicated in Northern Ireland?

We would like to explain why we believe that Ireland should formally endorse the World Health Organization's, WHO's, Covid-19 technology access pool, C-TAP, without delay.  I am a GP based in Dublin.  I am joined by Dr. Aisling McMahon, an assistant professor of law at Maynooth University with a special interest in patent and health law.  Access to Medicines Ireland is a membership group, an organisation of relevant workers.  We are honoured to be joined by Ms Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS, UNAIDS, and a leading advocate of the People's Vaccine Alliance.<br\/><br\/>To date, more than 3,600 people have died from Covid-19 in Ireland, and more than 2.3 million people have died globally.  The global economic cost of Covid-19 has been estimated at $3.4 trillion per year.  Furthermore, Oxfam has calculated that the economic impact of the virus could push 500 million people into poverty and nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost, according to UN estimates.  While the arrival of effective vaccines has brought an expectation that the pandemic can be brought under control, that is threatened by an inadequate supply of vaccines.  Most lower income countries are not expected to be vaccinated until 2023 or later.  Vaccine scarcity and slow roll-out will ensure a prolongation of the pandemic as outbreaks re-emerge due to travel between and within countries.  Even more worrying is the risk that variants of the virus will emerge, which will be more infectious, more dangerous and resistant to current vaccines, as we have seen in South Africa in recent days.<br\/><br\/>Ongoing research into identifying and addressing these problems before they arise is essential.  For these reasons, efficient mechanisms for scientists to collaborate and accelerate research and to achieve faster global roll-out of effective vaccines is essential.  The reality is that the current vaccine scarcity is artificial and can be resolved by increasing production capacity globally.  However, to do so, companies must share their know-how and intellectual property rights to expedite research and enable others to produce vaccines.  Given the extent of the extraordinary health crisis and a significant public investment that has supported the creation of many Covid-19 vaccines, this is not an unreasonable expectation.  As Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe have got to get it together as a society.  Social justice is only a dream if we don't put health justice at the centre ... <\/blockquote> <p>Rapid, equitable, global access to vaccines must be a key priority and to achieve this, we urge the Government to endorse the WHO's C-TAP.  I will hand over to Dr. McMahon who will detail this model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran Harkin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":616,"content":"<p>In May 2020, the WHO initiated the solidarity call to action, launching its support for the C-TAP and urging key actors, including governments, to take action.  Put simply, the C-TAP is a platform to facilitate the sharing of intellectual property rights, data, know-how and cell lines related to Covid-19 technologies, including vaccines.<\/p><p>Its end goal is to increase equitable access.  The C-TAP model is needed because production capacity for vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for Covid can be increased globally but, in order to do this, more companies must license and share intellectual property rights, know-how and technologies to enable others to produce them.  The C-TAP sets up a mechanism to facilitate this.  It is a voluntary model that is subject to the agreement of such companies.  Participation, depending on the context, could include compensation in the form of royalties where appropriate.<br\/><br\/>Countries must learn from the past.  The use of intellectual property rights in a manner which hindered access to medicines has had devastating impacts previously, particularly in the HIV-AIDS crisis, with many millions of lives lost as a result.  We must ensure that in this health crisis, that does not happen again.  In short, supporting the C-TAP provides a way to achieve global equitable access to vaccines.  It would maximise the manufacturing capacity globally by enabling more companies to make vaccines.  It would accelerate the development of new technologies by encouraging the sharing of data and know-how, thereby increasing transparency.  It would facilitate more accessible access.  The C-TAP works in collaboration with the existing UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool, which has extensive experience in pooling intellectual property rights for public health.  Furthermore, support for the C-TAP aligns with the European Commission's recently published intellectual property strategy and the Word Health Assembly's Covid-19 response resolution, both of which encourage voluntary pooling and licensing of intellectual property for Covid-19.  Addressing vaccine inequality in this way also gives us a better opportunity to ensure that the core values and intentions of Irish Aid's policy, A Better World, are put into practice, reaching the furthest behind first and leaving no one behind, which is Ireland's approach to realising the UN sustainable development goals.  It is fully consistent with Ireland's foreign policy goals of openness, global solidarity and a commitment to multilateralism.<br\/><br\/>The C-TAP is also vital if COVAX, the vaccine pillar of the WHO's Access to Covid-19 Tools, ACT, Accelerator is to be a success.  C-TAP and COVAX are complementary to each other.  On 5 February, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus of the WHO, in discussing COVAX's first interim vaccine distribution forecast, cautioned that:<\/p><blockquote>\tCountries are ready to go but the vaccines aren't there...  We encourage all manufacturers to share their data and technology to ensure global equitable access to vaccines. <\/blockquote><p>However, it must be emphasised that the C-TAP will only be a success if more Governments and companies support it.  On the other hand, if voluntary mechanisms like the C-TAP do not achieve sufficient support, then mandatory measures for suspending intellectual property rights under the WTO Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver proposal will be needed, and should be supported, to encourage and achieve change.<br\/><br\/>Access to Medicines Ireland is joined by ActionAid Ireland, the Irish Global Health Network, the INMO, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res Ireland and Oxfam Ireland in calling on the Government to support the C-TAP.  To date, 40 countries worldwide, including five European countries, have endorsed it.  Furthermore, last September, the President, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, indicated his support for the WHO's global solidarity call to action in his speech at the UN General Assembly.  Most recently, on 3 February, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that rich countries had a moral responsibility to help countries unable to access vaccines.  This could include supplementing their own ability to produce vaccines with co-operation from the pharmaceutical companies regarding relaxation of some of the patent situations.<br\/><br\/>The bottom line is that we have got to get the entire world vaccinated.  Global multilateral action is needed and Ireland can and should be a leading voice in this regard.  Access to Medicines Ireland encourages the Government to endorse formally the global solidarity call to action and the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool as soon as possible and to take action at an EU level to encourage greater support for the C-TAP.  Alongside this, we urge the Government to increase financial support for the WHO's ACT Accelerator.

My name is Winnie Byanyima.  I lead the United Nations joint programme on HIV-AIDS.  It is called UNAIDS.  I am grateful for this opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the critical issue of Covid vaccine equity.  I am also happy to let the committee know that I am the proud daughter of Irish missionary sisters of St. Francis.<\/p> <p>  In the early years of the AIDS response, millions of lives, as Dr. McMahon said, were needlessly lost because life-saving treatment remained out of reach for people in poor countries as people in rich countries benefited from antiretroviral treatment and went on to live long, healthy lives.  In poor countries 9 million people died waiting for the prices to come down.  It was a deeply painful lesson that many of us know very personally and one that the world, it seems, is having to learn again.<\/p> <p>  Ten months ago world leaders declared that any Covid-19 vaccine would be a global public good, a people's vaccine, but we now face a situation that the South African Government has called a new global apartheid.  Nine in ten people in the poorest countries are set to go without a vaccine this year.  A small group of rich countries representing just 14% of the global population have bought up most of the supply of the Covid vaccines that are available until the end of 2021.  I am sure the committee is as shocked as I am that pharma companies are charging developing countries more than they are charging rich countries, in some cases more than double.  My country, Uganda, will pay $7 per dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and South Africa will pay just over $5 whereas the European Union will pay just over $2 per dose.<\/p> <p>  The problem is not only one of money or unfair allocation; it is also that not enough vaccines are being made.  Even rich countries face challenges over production quantities in this year.  What the European Union is experiencing now is deeply troubling, and we empathise.  It is a taste of what Africa, Asia and Latin America have been experiencing.  This is why approaching vaccination as a competitive race between countries and regions means that everyone loses out.  What Europe thought was defending Europe was really defending the profits of the owners of big pharmaceutical companies.  The vital decisions of production, supply and price and, therefore, who gets the vaccine and when have been left in the hands of big pharmaceutical companies.  How is that right?  Our best chance of all staying safe from Covid-19 is to have vaccines, tests and treatment available for all, for the whole world.  As the Irish President, Michael Higgins, noted when he and I spoke on the same platform at the UN last year, \"Unless such medical tools are fully accessible to all on an equitable basis, the world remains at risk.\"  Right now, however, big pharma is protecting its monopolies, technology and intellectual property and thus restricting production.  We know how to solve this problem: it is to open up production.<\/p><p>Maximising global production can happen only if all companies that can produce vaccines have access to the vaccine technology, know-how and intellectual property.  Pharma companies will not share unless pressed to do so.  Governments have that leverage and there is a mechanism to enable the sharing that Dr. McMahon described, namely, the WHO's C-TAP.  It is a one-stop-shop for pooling all data, know-how, biological material and intellectual property and then licensing production and technology transfer to other potential producers.  So far, pharma companies have not joined C-TAP and the proposal presented by the Governments of South Africa and India at the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, council for a temporary waiver of certain TRIPS obligations has been blocked by the rich countries that host the pharma companies with a vaccine.<\/p><p> This is not only about access for the poor.  The longer the virus is left to ravage developing countries, the longer people in rich countries will remain at risk.  The virus is mutating, as Dr. Harkin stated.  This threatens the efficacy of vaccines, as we have seen with the so-called South African variant.  Yesterday, the South African Government had to postpone its roll-out of the AstraZeneca vaccine because, having bought millions of doses, it realised that the vaccine did not have efficacy against the variant.  The slow pace of vaccination everywhere means that we risk seeing more dangerous variants developing.  As Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO, a wonderful Irishman, often remarks, no one is safe until everyone is safe.<\/p><p> The economic cost is also great.  New research from the International Chamber of Commerce predicts that delays to vaccine access in poorer countries will cost the global economy an estimated $9 trillion, with nearly half of that being the cost to wealthy countries.  These vaccines were developed with public money and these companies depend on government support.  Whenever we raise the question of leverage over companies, though, we are told by rich countries' governments that there is COVAX.  While support for COVAX is welcome, it cannot solve the supply problem on its own.  Indeed, COVAX can only complement C-TAP.<\/p><p> We need to ensure that constraints on licensing and know-how no longer obstruct mass production of Covid vaccines.  We must make companies take part in C-TAP.  It is their governments that can make that happen.  We also need to speed up agreement on a waiver at the WTO, especially if C-TAP does not work.  I hope that the Irish Government will consider joining C-TAP.  I join Dr. Harkin and Dr. McMahon in urging the committee's parliamentarians to ask their Government to do so.<\/p><p> Like AIDS, Covid is revealing the underlying fissures of inequality, how they hurt all of us and how outdated rules and approaches obstruct us from overcoming them.  Fixing them is a policy choice.  It is a moral, public health and economic imperative to ensure that everyone gets vaccinated in 2021 and that no one is left behind.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Winnie Byanyima","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Byanyima for her presentation and for agreeing to stay with us for our questions and answers session.

As we face into the ongoing commitment for global solidarity and social justice, the contributions are very timely.  Unfortunately, the big pharmaceutical companies continue to profiteer on the backs of people throughout the world.  I believe one of the witnesses said countries are ready to go but the vaccines are not there.  That is the call from throughout the world.  It is very clear that the pandemic can only be ended by protecting all nations.  It is interesting to hear the comment that no one is safe until everyone is safe.  That is the only way we will get on top of this global emergency.  No pharmaceutical company should profit from the pandemic.  We need to ensure widespread availability across all nations.  It is shocking that nearly 70 countries will only be able to vaccinate approximately 10% of their populations next year.<\/p> <p>  Another shocking figure that was given related to the cost of one of the vaccines.  The term \"morally corrupt\" springs to mind when some countries are being charged &euro;7 per vaccine.  South Africa is being charged &euro;5, but some of the better off countries in Europe are only being charged &euro;2 per vaccine.  That clearly shows everything that is wrong with the roll-out of the vaccines.  <\/p> <p>  Wealthy countries will have enough vaccine to protect all their citizens three times over in 2021 and yet some of the poorer underdeveloped countries are struggling to vaccinate their citizens.  Lessons need to be learned from the AIDS crisis.  I believe 9 million people in African countries alone died of AIDS while they were screaming out for access to the medication to help with AIDS.  <\/p> <p>  I believe five European countries, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal and the Netherlands, have signed up to support the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, CTAP, along with 40 countries globally and a list of organisations that were mentioned earlier.  Several Irish experts, including Professor Luke O'Neill, Dr. Sam McConkey and many others, support it.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the programme.<\/p> <p>  We also support another initiative and I might ask for views on this.  I refer to the Right to Cure initiative, a European citizens' initiative that was launched last year, which proposes to put public health before private profit, and to make anti-pandemic vaccines and treatments a global public good, freely accessible to everyone.  As we need 1 million signatures to move that initiative forward, I appeal to anyone who is listening to sign up to support it.  There is significant crossover in the objectives of CTAP and that particular initiative to ensure intellectual property rights and patents do not hamper the accessibility or availability of any future Covid-19 vaccine or treatment, and to ensure that EU legislation on data and market exclusivity does not limit the immediate effectiveness of compulsory licences issued by members.<\/p><p>There are a number of other points there as well.  Is this something our witnesses also support?  I have a question relating to the failure of countries to support C-TAP and the dire consequences of that.  Do we have expectations or analysis of what the impact will be?  We see some of the financial impacts, which are shocking, and how it will affect some poorer countries.  When we speak about people and individuals, how will the failure to introduce C-TAP affect them?  <\/p><p> It is unbelievable that the Irish Government has not signed up to support this.  What engagement, if any, has taken place between Access to Medicines Ireland and the Government?  What do the witnesses feel as organisations, doctors and people about this issue?  What are the largest obstacles blocking C-TAP?  Are there particular interest groups such as shareholders?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#F00100","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":627,"content":"<p>There are a number of questions from Deputy Brady that he has not directed at any one individual but perhaps I might get a brief response from Dr. Harkin, Dr. McMahon and Ms Byanyima.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#G00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to hear the endorsements from Deputy Brady.

While the UK Government has not formally endorsed C-TAP, it has certainly made a number statements suggesting that it agrees with the principles underlying it and in reality, is not too far away from supporting it.  Every day, it is becoming more and more clear that the current system is failing and that we cannot rely on the pharmaceutical industry to guide us through this pandemic as its eye is clearly directed towards its shareholders rather than public health.

In terms of the Deputy's question about the failure to support C-TAP, we are seeing the consequences of it since the vaccines have been approved, particularly since they have started to be rolled out.  It is fantastic that we have these vaccines but, unfortunately, we do not have enough of them.  That is becoming more and more clear for Ireland and other European countries and all over the world.  C-TAP would facilitate the manufacturing of vaccines and the ability to make more.  There is an artificial scarcity because the rights holders are simply not sharing intellectual property data and know-how.  Know-how, data and intellectual property are needed to make these vaccines.  Rights holders could be willing to come on board, take the opportunity to share and realise that we are in an extraordinary crisis and pandemic and need to bring it under control and that the only way to do that is increase the production of these vaccines.  C-TAP is a direct avenue that would facilitate that.  We support the COVAC scheme but, unfortunately, the target is that they would have enough vaccines for 20% of populations, which is nowhere near the figure we would need to achieve herd immunity or a population-wide spread of vaccination.  The consequences of not supporting C-TAP are that we will at best achieve 20% and that is assuming we even have a supply to achieve that.  C-TAP can deliver more vaccines for the likes of COVAC and facilitate that so it is important to stress that C-TAP would provide a mechanism to deliver more vaccines if it was supported but it needs support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling McMahon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":630,"content":"<p>We have a situation where the rules that regulate business and trade, which have been in place for the past 30 years or so, have had an impact on our minds to the extent that we think that the right to profit is equal to the right to health and the right to life.  We have a mindset that is completely taken over by the notion that profit is as important as health and life.  It is a big problem for all of us that we have developed a mindset that justifies profits coming before life.  The second issue is that the rules themselves, which we should be challenging, are not being challenged.  Why is that?  It is because shareholders in this modern world of trade have become so important in businesses that their voice is more important than that of workers, communities and ordinary people.  We had a form of trade and business 30 years ago that allowed profits to be ploughed back into workers' wages, research and community development.  Shareholders took only 10% of profits in the UK, for example, but today, shareholders take 70% of total profits.  The voice of shareholders is so dominant in the politics of our countries.  Their voice is heard before the voice of ordinary people, including consumers and workers and that is part of the problem.<\/p> <p>  We would like to see countries that do not host the pharmaceutical companies that produce the vaccines joining C-TAP because they do not have anything to lose.  We salute Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Norway for supporting C-TAP, as well as many other developing countries.  Of course, countries like Germany, the USA and the UK oppose C-TAP because the pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders have a powerful voice in those countries.  We would like the countries that do not have a stake in the companies producing the vaccines to come together and insist on fairer rules that allow sharing of the technology.  We urge them to back the WTO waiver that is being requested at the TRIPS Council or to join C-TAP.  These are two avenues that will assist in maximising vaccine production for the world.

Approximately 40 countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Norway in Europe, have supported the WHO's solidarity call to action and C-TAP.  Can our guests give us any insights into why other countries have not done so?  I also note what Dr. McMahon said earlier about the fact that we are very fortunate in now having a number of vaccines that seem to be effective.  When the virus emerged initially, there was concern that it might take a very long time to develop vaccines to combat it.<\/p><p>Thankfully, this has happened very quickly within a year.  We are all concerned about the possibility, and the fact, that the virus is mutating and is changing and has the potential to change into something even more deadly.  I note Dr. Nabarro is also online and I welcome him.  Perhaps when he speaks he might comment on questions such as access to non-government controlled areas of Syria.  There is no guaranteed channel for vaccines for people in this area.  There are other areas of conflict in the world such as Tigray, Mozambique, Libya and Rohingya in Bangladesh, and places with many refugees in Uganda and Lebanon.  Will our guests comment on the possibility of these people getting vaccinated?  I am also interested in hearing the views of our guests on whether these areas could become centres for more changes to the virus, leading to deadlier strains, if the people in them are not vaccinated.<\/p><p> It is also quite interesting to note the Government here has not said \"No\" to joining the call for action, but if some of the recent responses from the Minister are to be considered, is examining the situation fairly strongly.  I hope we will be in a position to do so before too long.  This time last year, this issue was just starting so things have moved very quickly.<\/p><p> The AIDS epidemic was absolutely catastrophic.  I take on board in particular what has been said by the director of UNAIDS.  This pandemic is even more deadly because it is even more transferable and has the potential to really and truly cause devastation throughout the world.  The Government here should sign the solidarity call to action as soon as possible.  I note a number of other European countries have done so.<\/p><p> Throughout the world, is there a lot more capacity to produce the vaccines to the standard required?

My Green Party colleague has written to the Department of Foreign Affairs, which provides the lion's share of Ireland's overseas development assistance, to request that Ireland uses its seat on the UN Security Council to advocate on behalf of the countries worst affected and least capable of overcoming the pandemic.  In addition, Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has written to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, inquiring as to whether he will support C-TAP.  Our party believes further avenues of international co-operation and assistance in addition to COVAX should be explored and leveraged to maximise equitable access and distribution of vaccines in developing countries now and in the longer term.<\/p> <p>  With respect to international efforts, the fast response of Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO in initiating and leading of the work of COVAX should be applauded.  It is an important demonstration of collaboration and solidarity to support vulnerable developing countries as they work to overcome Covid-19.  It is important that Ireland supports this initiative to the greatest extent possible through funding and our knowledge and experience of public health emergencies.  It is also welcome to see the aim of the COVAX initiative is to protect at least 20% of each participating population by the end of the year.  Given the task at hand, this is no small feat but the efforts of COVAX will not be sufficient to fully address the challenge and its various aspects.<\/p><p>Some issues and questions that come to mind are technical, operational and political.  Could the witnesses address whether health services will be sufficiently staffed and trained to administer vaccines in a timely manner and how we can ensure the safety of access in countries that are politically fragile?

I will start by answering some of the questions raised.  On Deputy Stanton's question on why other countries have not joined the CTAP initiatives, 40 countries worldwide have done so, as was noted, including five European countries.  In terms of why others have not, that is the question we are also asking.  In our minds, CTAP will facilitate more access to vaccines.  I can only speculate as to why countries have not signed up so far.  I wonder if perhaps it is only now that as vaccines have thankfully come on board, we are seeing gaps in terms of access, supply chain issues and that do not have as many vaccines as we initially thought we would.  Now would be an opportune time for people to reflect on that and countries to put themselves behind some of the initiatives such as CTAP which will, if it is supported, facilitate more people being able to make these vaccines.<\/p> <p>  Another important point was raised, which relates to the Chairman's point on the new variants that are arising.  It is a worrying time.  Others are more qualified to speak on those points and I am sure we will hear from Dr. Nabarro later on this.  In terms of the intellectual property perspective, one of the obstacles to having access to vaccines is intellectual property, data and the sharing of know-how, in particular.  This also relates to the point on the safety of the production of vaccines.  We need companies to share their know-how to facilitate and enable others to produce vaccines of the same quality standard.  CTAP would facilitate that.  If we had more vaccines, we could deliver more vaccines.  That would mean more people could be vaccinated and, it is to be hoped, reduce the number of new variants emerging.  I will not speak on that.  I am sure others can speak later on it.<\/p> <p>  On whether there is excess capacity in the system, we have looked at some of the research produced by other groups such as Knowledge Ecology International, KEI.  It suggested that there is untapped potential.  We know there are various different pharmaceutical companies, including in Ireland, who could facilitate and help with the production of vaccines.  In recent times, some pharmaceutical companies have entered into voluntary licensing deals where they have agreed to help in the production of vaccines.  For example, as far as I am aware, Pfizer and BioNTech recently reached an agreement with Sanofi to help to increase its production.  We are calling for more of this. <\/p> <p>  Reference was made to shareholders.  The traditional shareholder model involves a focus on profit.  Some of the work we are now doing suggests that a small group of shareholders see themselves as stewards of resources.  Actions are being taken in other countries, such as the US, where there have been shareholder motions, in particular in a pandemic context, to state that profits should not be the main priority and instead other goals such as delivering global equitable access should be prioritised.<\/p><p>We must consider who the shareholders are, which in some cases are pension fund or investment companies.  There is potential for the public to leverage their voices by saying that in this pandemic we must see a change and the sharing of intellectual property and data to facilitate this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I will reply to some of the questions that were raised.  There was a question about refugees and internally displaced people, whether they will be catered for, and if not, whether the communities of refugees and internally displaced people could turn out hosting new and dangerous variants of the virus.  This is the case but there are some good practices.  For example, in Jordan, one in every four people is a refugee.  It is rolling out its vaccination programme to include refugees and it has the support of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  We also heard from the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies last week, which launched a plan to help vaccinate 500 million people globally.  There is a need to pay attention to those people with weak citizenship rights and have them vaccinated.<\/p> <p>  We have looked carefully at the question of capacity in the People's Vaccine Alliance, estimating that the three biggest vaccine producers - Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford AstraZeneca - are producing enough vaccines for only 1.5% of the global population, which tells us how small is the supply.  We are looking at how much capacity is being used by the other big vaccine producers.  When we started probing, we saw some of the production companies moving very fast to try to conclude agreements with some of the major vaccine producers in Europe and America to license them.  They have really been holding on to their technology and know-how to first try to scoop as much profit as possible before they license others.  That is why we need the pressure.<\/p> <p>  The capacity is there and we will estimate those figures.  This capacity is not only in Europe and North America.; there is also capacity in the emerging economies.  There is huge capacity in India, with some companies licensed to produce the AstraZeneca vaccine, for example.  There are other Indian producers with capacity that is sitting there.  There is also capacity in Indonesia, China, Russia and so on.  There is capacity and we will estimate those figures but we must put pressure on those companies.<\/p> <p>  I also wanted to speak to the question of the pandemic being really more devastating than HIV\/AIDS.  I agree.  In developing countries like ours in Africa, the economic devastation is worse than the health devastation.  For some reason our people have not had as many deaths or even infections as in Europe.  Perhaps it is because the populations are younger or we have suffered many infectious diseases previously but nobody knows yet.  Infection rates are lower and deaths are fewer.  Nevertheless, the economies had to be closed completely so the economic devastation is huge.  People have lost jobs and their income so they have nothing to eat.  It is devastating.  The need to recover is global and this pandemic is more damaging than HIV.  Every life is important.<\/p> <p>  Many countries and governments support CTAP, but they have not yet signed up to the Costa Rica resolution.<\/p><p>I think that has to do with some fear of the pharmaceutical companies because this is now about survival of the fittest and booking supplies with a few companies.  I suspect that some governments did not show up to sign up to the common technology access pool because that would be seen as perhaps \"anti\" the pharmaceutical companies.  I suspect one is seen as in conflict with the other.  While some governments have signed on to the People's Vaccine Alliance and the People's Vaccine Alliance is demanding support for C-TAP, the same governments have not signed up to C-TAP or the Costa Rica resolution.  That tells us they will sign onto the People's Vaccine Alliance, which is campaigning for C-TAP, but they will not go to the WHO pool.  Something there suggests that one is in conflict with the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Winnie Byanyima","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":641,"content":"<p>I am going to move on to our fourth guest.

It cannot be, we respectfully suggest, an alternative to the formal governance process of the WHO through the UN World Health Assembly or other similar mechanisms.<\/p> <p>  I wish to start by acknowledging the incredible work being done by Dr. Kieran Harkin, Dr. Aisling McMahon and Ms Winnie Byanyima.  I may have got the order wrong but that was the order I was given.  What the committee has been hearing this morning is really important.  I was proud to be able to join and hear Dr. McMahon and Ms Winnie Byanyima talking and explaining their points of view, and I am pleased indeed to be here.<\/p> <p>  I want to talk about three things.  The first is Covid-19 and the pandemic.  The second is the way in which efforts are being made to improve access to vaccine through something called COVAX, which the contributors have been describing.  The third thing I want to talk about is improving access to technologies through initiatives like the People's Vaccine initiative and C-TAP.<\/p> <p>  We will start with the pandemic.  I imagine everyone in Ireland knows but perhaps I will say it again.  This pandemic is nowhere near finished.  This is nowhere near the end.  Some people say there is light at the end of the tunnel but from my point of view, I am not sure how far away that light is.  I have no idea how long it will take to reach the end of the tunnel.  I am prepared to say to committee members that I believe there are some really difficult and rocky periods ahead of the world to get through it.<\/p> <p>  This is a new virus that has appeared and entered into the human ecosystem, just as HIV did some decades ago.  The world needs to adapt to a new virus.  That adaptation process takes time, especially given that the virus will change.  Humanity's response to the virus will change as well.  The adaptation will be continuous.  Right now, we are in a phase where the incidence of reported new cases of Covid-19 in Europe has gone into a decline.<\/p><p>This is in particular since the beginning of January and is super-welcome news.  It has gone into decline because of the extraordinary effort by the people of Europe and, increasingly, the people of North America to take this virus seriously by maintaining physical distancing, wearing face protection, practising incredible hygiene, self-isolating when ill and protecting the most vulnerable.  These are the tried-and-tested measures through which people can reduce their risk.  That has to be accompanied with well functioning public health systems that can detect people with the disease, enable them to isolate in a decent way, trace their contacts and enable those contacts to isolate and, when necessary, deal rapidly and robustly with outbreaks that occur.<\/p><p> These are big shifts happening in humanity.  We are all working out how to come to terms with it.  We have had various moments when we have been able to learn: the first acceleration in March and April of last year; the second acceleration at the end of the summer months of last year; and the dramatic third acceleration towards the end of last year and over the new year period.  We have been learning such a great deal, perhaps most importantly that the virus is the adversary and people are the solution.  There is a requirement to enable people to be strong, connected and empowered to fight the virus despite the fact that this entails massive social and economic dislocation.  It hits poor people the worst and it often hits people who have different ethnicity from the dominant ethnicity in western European countries the worst.  Dealing with Covid in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe means empowering people to respond and enabling those most affected, particularly the poorest and those with least access to resources, to be strong.<\/p><p> Having said that, there are ways in which it is possible to help people.  The ways to help include all those I have mentioned and now we can add vaccines.  Who should be receiving vaccines now?  In our view, it is clear that it should be the people who are at risk: older people and people with simultaneous illnesses; and those who are most exposed to the virus, namely, people dealing with Covid in their professional work all the time, particularly in healthcare, residential care, dentistry or other professions where one is in contact with the exhalations of people with the virus.  If the vaccine is helpful in protecting people, there is one priority for the world, as stated clearly by the Director-General of the WHO and the Secretary-General of the UN.  That priority is to make sure everybody in need of the vaccine can access it on the basis of need first, not on the basis of geographical location or nationality.  Right now, the people who must be a priority for any vaccine are health workers, older people and people with concomitant illness, wherever they live.<\/p><p> That is why at the request of the different member states of the WHO, the COVAX scheme was set up as part of the access to Covid-19 tools, ACT, accelerator.  COVAX is a scheme to enable the pooled purchase of vaccines at a negotiated price, ideally a low price.  The vaccines can then be made available to countries to purchase with their own funds or, if their GDP is low, to purchase with aid funds.  It is an advance purchase scheme like what we have used for other vaccines around the world to enable everybody to get the lowest possible price.  By negotiating with the producers, we are able through COVAX to get the price low.  In order for that to work, there has to be vaccine in the system and there is not enough for COVAX to work right now.<\/p><p>Anybody who criticises COVAX needs to be clear about what he or she is criticising.  Is it that it does not have enough vaccine coming through or is it because it has design flaws?  At the moment, the people who run COVAX tell me they want more vaccine in, which means, first, expediting the regulatory approval of existing vaccines that are currently on the edge of COVAX but not in it because COVAX can distribute only vaccines that have an emergency use licence from the WHO advisory committee on vaccination.  Second, we have to get some of the new vaccines properly into the COVAX portfolio, that is, the ones that use messenger RNA.  These are very exciting vaccines.  At the moment, they have to be kept super cold, which makes them a real challenge to use, but the technology will improve and we have to get them in.<\/p><p> Third, countries that have purchased their own vaccine through bilateral deals and have some to spare should give it to COVAX immediately.  It should become a movement everywhere that whenever there is some spare, it is given over.  The key question is what is spare.  My colleagues and I are asking whether, given the current availability of vaccines, any country should be planning to vaccinate all its adults against Covid or whether they should carry out vaccination of the at-risk groups and then share the rest with COVAX so that it can go to other countries where it is needed.  Moreover, COVAX needs to take on new products and new vaccine production needs to come in.<\/p><p> Another key question is what is the hold-up.  What could allow there to be more vaccines?  I certainly agree that the resolution produced by Costa Rica before last year's World Health Assembly, which led to the C-TAP proposal and the associated medicines patent pool being set up, is very important.  It is a mechanism that has worked for voluntary licensing for vaccines and treatments for other products, and it is surely the right way to go in the long term.  In the meantime, let us try at least to get existing schemes working as effectively as possible while, at the same time, exploring possibilities for upgrading the C-TAP system.  To get vaccines moving now, we need not only more vaccines coming in but also to scale up the potential of different manufacturers working to the full.  When that happens, each scale-up has to be individually licensed by the WHO system.  That is absolutely essential for quality assurance, safety and efficacy.  Let us ensure that all the approval processes happen quickly.<\/p><p> It will not be possible to get vaccines into the arms of people everywhere without an enormous global support programme for vaccine administration throughout the world.  Without that, we might end in the embarrassing scenario of vaccines becoming available more and more, particularly during 2021, with the inability to implement them.  For polio, we have had to have a global immunisation programme, while for measles and other childhood illnesses, there are strong global programmes.  There will need to be the global support of countries so that they can implement the vaccines.<\/p><p> Some of that is available through COVAX but, frankly, I know from experience that the world will have to get behind poorer countries to help them carry out their immunisation programmes.  That is where we will need continued commitment from the G7, the G20, the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly and other global bodies to ensure that the money moves.  That is absolutely the key.  Colleagues have made that point and I endorse it.  COVAX will work if it gets the support it needs from rich countries; it will fail if countries go round the back, do not give it enough money or discredit it.  Let us work together to make COVAX a success.  In the longer term, let us use the C-TAP system and other medicine patent pools to increase the availability of supplies in poor countries where they are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Nabarro","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Nabarro for his contribution.

It was great to hear from Dr. Nabarro as well.<\/p> <p>  As I stated at a previous committee meeting, it is interesting that we have a case where self-interest and the morally correct thing to do coincide.  They often do not coincide, but in this instance they do.  As Dr. Mike Ryan would say, no one is safe until everyone is safe.  It is very scary that 2.3 million people have died globally.  Dr. Nabarro's interpretation of the future is also frightening.  The economic cost of &euro;3.4 trillion per year is shocking.  Basically, we need the global south, the developing world and all other parts of the world to be on board.  As the world is now a global village, one cannot assume that because what are, from our perspective, isolated areas are not covered, we are safe.  As a result of the prevalence of travel, we are not safe.  The issue of variants then arises.<\/p> <p>  I refer to two stark and frightening figures.  The first is that it will be 2023 before several countries are looked after.  The other figure, if I picked it up correctly - I may be corrected if I did not - is that only 1.5% of the global population would be covered by the existing supply of vaccines.  Those are stark figures.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Stanton, raised the issue of capacity.  We should have reassurance in that regard.  I intuitively think there would be far more capacity available if there was a will to use it, but I would like to hear more on the issue.  Ireland now has a particular role in the context of the UN.  The Government must join and sign up to the international statements on this issue and use our position in the EU and the UN.  <\/p> <p>  I recently had a discussion with the Palestinian ambassador to Ireland.  She explained that the Palestinian people have particular difficulties with access.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.  Of course, that links to the issue of refugees.  It is obvious that where there is a density of people, such as in refugee settlements, etc., and indeed in places such as Gaza, there is a greater spread.  I would like the comments of the panel on that but I think it is a pretty basic point.  One assumes the spread is more difficult to halt in the normal ways.  <\/p> <p>  I ask Dr. Nabarro to address the issue of the Russian vaccines and what is happening there.  I have been told that the Russian vaccine is very effective.  We in this western part of Europe do not know much about it.  I ask him to comment on that issue and how the vaccine is being used internationally.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the issue of capacity and the Palestinian question specifically.<\/p> <p>  I was here all day yesterday, when there was a full Seanad sitting at which many important issues were discussed.  I am sure many important issues were also discussed in the D&aacute;il in recent days.  However, without being ridiculous or melodramatic, I believe this is probably the most important meeting that has been held in these buildings for many months.  The issue we are discussing is the most serious in terms of morality, expediency, the economy of the world and the lives of people.  This is of mammoth importance.  I am certainly unequivocal in my support of what our guests are doing.  I am very proud to have the opportunity to say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#P00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their very informed commentary and testament.

They have our full attention in Dublin this morning.<\/p><p> I have three questions.  First, while the case the witnesses made is compelling, is there any way we can strengthen it further.  For the benefit of the committee, maybe one or two of the panel could outline diseases for which the patents on vaccines or medications have been waived in the past.  If there was a list of diseases for which medicine patents had been waived in the past, it would certainly strengthen their case because precedents are important.  Second, have the three pharmaceutical companies that make Covid vaccines formally declined to become involved or are we still awaiting a response?<\/p><p> My third question is perhaps a technical one to which the witnesses may not have an answer.  When countries in the EU signed up to this new mechanism, the C-TAP, that has been described, did their minister for health sign off on it or was there a motion on the floor of parliament?  What technical mechanism was used?  Is there a document to sign or does one merely have a press conference and make a formal pledge across the airwaves?<\/p><p> I will summarise my questions.

I will keep my questions brief.<\/p> <p>  My first question pertains to wealthier countries which are hoarding vaccines.  Canada, a high-income country, currently has enough vaccines to vaccinate its population several times over, yet it is hoarding some of its vaccines.  It still intends to secure 1.9 million vaccines through the COVAX system.  Will the witnesses comment on wealthier nations hoarding vaccines?  What can we do to stop that practice and what will be the outcome if it persists?<\/p> <p>  As part of the COVAX initiative, pharmaceutical companies have pledged that no country will receive vaccines for more than 20% of the population until every country has enough supply to vaccinate 20% of its population.  Currently, we are well off target, with 16% of the world's population having received 60% of the vaccine supply.  Pfizer has only supplied 2% of its vaccines to COVAX.  I ask Ms Byanyima or Dr. Nabarro what steps are being taken to ensure that pharmaceutical companies fulfil their pledges to the COVAX initiative.<\/p> <p>  Many international NGOs, including M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, have called for a relaxation of intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines and technologies to ensure the scaling up of production and access in the global south.

While the mRNA vaccine is a very sophisticated vaccine, some of the advantages are that it can be produced quite quickly and the manufacturing set-up can be done in a relatively short time, within three months.  It is interesting that Knowledge Ecology International, KEI, an international organisation, has identified more than 100 plants capable of producing Covid vaccine.  Six of those are in Ireland, four from Merck, which had attempted to develop its own vaccine which failed recently.  Two of the plants are in Cork, one in Carlow and one in Swords. <\/p><p> On what Ireland should do on the waiver on the national stage, our priority would be for Ireland to support CETA but we would also suggest that the waiver or the suspension of intellectual property rights in relation to Covid-19 products as proposed by the Indian and South African governments also warrants support.<\/p><p> On when a patent has been suspended and used from before, it has happened a number of times.  It is what brought an end to the HIV epidemic in Africa when the pharmaceutical industry and the governments which support them caved in under pressure and relented and allowed HIV drugs to be produced and manufactured generically.  Notable times this happened was when the US Government was threatened by anthrax and overnight brought in a law lifting patents on ciprofloxacin, the only antibiotic that would have been effective.  There are other examples which I do not have to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran Harkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":655,"content":"<p>This is a situation where the self-interested, pragmatic, and moral things to do are the same.  Unless we get more vaccines to more people globally and equitably, it is not in anyone's interest.  It is correct to emphasise that.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. Harkin, spoke on the capacity issues.  We also know there is capacity because we see the pipeline of vaccines.  We see other companies are working on vaccines, both mRNA and other vaccines.  Thankfully, there is a great number of them, which indicates capacity.<\/p> <p>  Given that there has not been voluntary sharing or co-operation, there is a need to share intellectual property.  To get that, some countries propose that there would be a waiver or a suspension of intellectual property.  The preference would be for companies simply to share but if that is not achieved, there has to be support for mechanisms such as the waiver.<\/p> <p>  The AIDS HIV crisis is one example of where intellectual property has been relaxed.  There was ongoing petitioning from civil society organisations and developing countries for years.  Several years were lost while that petitioning was going on because it simply was not being heard.  Eventually it led to an announcement and a declaration under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, which is the overarching laws on intellectual property, that public health would also have to be prioritised and that intellectual property would have to be used in a way that was compatible.  There are certain measures within that framework that allow, for example, for compulsory licences for a certain period of time which would allow a third party to make a drug without the intellectual property holder's permission.  That is perfectly legal and provided for within TRIPS under certain circumstances.  It was one of the key mechanisms during the HIV AIDS crisis that facilitated access.  It was 7 February 2001, so 20 years ago nearly to the day, that Cipla, the Indian generic company, made the announcement, and it was such a striking announcement, that it could produce HIV-AIDS antiretrovirals for less than $1 a day.<\/p><p>That was a game changer in this context.<\/p><p> Since then, the Medicines Patent Pool, which is the body that works with C-TAP, has produced generic products for more than 141 countries worldwide.  On top of this, some of the statistics from the Medicines Patent Pool suggest that those generic products have facilitated 38.75 million patient years of treatment.  Those generic products are being facilitated through the pooling of IP and they work for HIV-AIDS but also hepatitis C, TB and various other diseases.  The pooling of intellectual property rights is a system that has worked before.  C-TAP in particular is, in our view, a key mechanism.  Not only does it share IP, but in the vaccine context it shares know-how and know-how is particularly crucial for producing these vaccines.  We call on companies and governments to support this.<\/p><p> On the question regarding whether companies have refused to sign up to C-TAP, I cannot answer that.  It is not my knowledge that they have refused.  I do not have that information to hand.  I would encourage companies to consider supporting this and countries to encourage companies to support these initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I invite Dr. Nabarro to respond to the remaining questions, with particular reference to Senator Joe O'Reilly's question on the Russian vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#S00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I will answer as best I can.  The WHO has had a number of exchanges with the manufacturers of the Russian vaccine, the Gamaleya company, and it is continuing to seek from the very co-operative Russian manufacturers all the data that are needed for an emergency use authorisation.  It is complex.  For this process to go through, first one has to look at the vaccine and the results of the phase 1, 2 and 3 trials of the vaccine.  Second, under the WHO rules that have been approved and requested by the national Governments of the member states of the WHO, a certificate of good manufacturing practice is requested from the manufacturer.  All of these issues are being looked at.  In regard to other vaccines that are going through this system, I cannot tell the committee when the effort will be completed.  In regard to Gamaleya and Sputnik V, this is a work in progress that is being done with the greatest possible speed while at the same time maintaining the requirements for quality assurance, safety and efficacy.<\/p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly asked about ensuring access for refugees and other disadvantaged people.  It is important to stress that the COVAX scheme has been designed such that it includes capacity to ensure that when vaccines are available they get to disadvantaged and refugee communities.  Deputy Berry asked about the situation where patents have been waived, to which I think Dr. McMahon gave a pretty good answer.  I do not want to add to it.  In 2002, I was working with the director general WHO and the Secretary General of the UN.  The key issue is that company CEOs came to us.  As a result of an environment which created some pressure, they came to us and I recall that eight of them said they were going to find a way to reduce their prices and to deal with the various concerns raised previously around doing so.  The rest is history.  What a transformative change.<\/p> <p>  On the question regarding whether pharma companies have agreed to voluntary licensing in regard to Covid vaccines, the answer is that they have.  The agreement between AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India or between Sanofi and BioNTech are examples of where this is happening.  The key question that we all need to ask is what can be done to speed up things and make sure that the right amount of vaccines are available.<\/p><p> That brings me to Deputy Gannon's questions.  He asked if wealthy countries were hoarding vaccines.  I checked that with people who have the answers when I was getting briefed for today's meeting.  It is not that wealthy countries have got a lot of vaccine.  In fact, each of the wealthy countries that has a mass vaccination programme under way, including the United Kingdom and countries in the European Union, are short of vaccine.  They are worried about supplies because they have made advance purchase commitments, which means they got an option on vaccine with the manufacturers but there is such competition for supplies among governments that have made pledges to vaccinate large proportions of their population as well as those who have made pledges to support COVAX.  There is a terrible competition under way and I cannot underestimate the severity of this competition.  One just has to look at newspapers in European countries right now to see, for example, the frustration being expressed towards European leaders that there is not more vaccine becoming available.  That is creating a competition with COVAX.  Quite simply, that is what is happening now.  It is because the countries that are committed to vaccinating all their populations for the very good reason that they see this as the best way out of the pandemic are putting such huge pressure on the very limited supply that availability of COVAX is always in question.  That is our difficulty.<\/p><p> Deputy Gannon brought up this point by asking if wealthy countries are hoarding.  I do not want to use the term \"hoarding\" but they are certainly putting immense demands on the manufacturers in the current vaccine shortage to take vaccines away from COVAX so that they can fulfil pledges they have made to their citizens for widespread vaccination.  This situation is very difficult.  If a political leader has said his or her people will be vaccinated and after they have done the people most at risk - the health workers - they will go to teachers, then first-line responders like ambulance workers and then essential personnel like security guards, who have a lot of contact with people and we know have a higher incidence, it can be seen that the political pressure in Europe is huge, yet at the same time here are we, with COVAX, saying, as we have heard even in what has been going on here today, that the situation for health workers in poor countries is desperate.  Thousands of health workers have died as a result of Covid-19 in the past year.  Yes, we want to protect these health workers but there is this terrible conundrum, and I believe everybody sees it.  Unfortunately, increasing the licensing and using the Medicines Patent Pool and C-TAP will not deal with the acute problem right now.  The problem right now is that there is limited capacity.  We are in a shortage situation.  It should get better in the coming weeks and months but the competition for this small amount of vaccine right now is huge.<\/p><p> Deputy Gannon's question, and I do not want to answer it exactly as written, was how to get Pfizer to fulfil its responsibilities to COVAX.  Pfizer has got responsibilities to a number of different groups which have made advance purchase agreements.  It has also got shortages of production because, when vaccines are being produced, things do not work smoothly.  Batches go wrong.  Whole batches have to be thrown away.  Pfizer has licensed the Serum Institute of India, a Korean company.  It has also got its own plants in Europe and they are not all able to produce what is needed.  Given the demand that is coming, often backed by lawyers from European governments and from the European Union as well as from the UK and, I am sure, from other countries in the world, and it is building up, it is super hard to understand precisely what is going on.<\/p><p>One concern is that COVAX works if there is transparency about pricing, delivery dates and to what degree the company is able to say that it did its best but could not deliver.  Right now, we do not have full transparency, which makes life difficult.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Gannon, the lack of transparency makes this difficult.  What steps should the Government take to support the matters we are talking about?  Everything that has been said in the chamber is right.  This requires political action, not just within the nation but also across Europe and through the UN Security Council.  There is a core question that comes back to members here, representing the Irish people, which is what the Irish people want.  My colleague, Dr. Mike Ryan, who is the greatest Irishman working on infectious diseases, works as head of emergencies at the WHO.  He talked to me last weekend as I was preparing and said that it is difficult because politicians believe that it is their job to always fight for the interests of their constituents, which, right now, is for as many people as possible to be vaccinated with a safe, effective and functional vaccine as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> Is there any way that we can get a message to politicians that perhaps the population of Ireland is prepared to look at an alternative proposition, which is for high-risk people in Ireland to be vaccinated now with whatever spare vaccines are available being shared with other countries in the world so that they can vaccinate their high-risk population?  Once we have all high-risk populations vaccinated, then we can complete the vaccination of the adult population.  This is a political dilemma.  I do not know how one gets to know the mood of the population but there surely needs to be a test of what the people of Ireland and other European countries want right now, whether it is fairness for the world or trying to get as much vaccine as possible for people in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Nabarro","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Nabarro.

Dr. Nabarro is correct that people are the solution, but we will only be the solution if we are willing to take on the role of being global champions and ensuring equal and proper access to all vaccines and treatments used to save the lives of those affected by Covid.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue that has not been touched on.

One concerns C-TAP and COVAX.  In the opening statement, 2023 was given as the year when people in some poorer countries will be vaccinated.  Is there a tipping point whereby that target could be moved out further or brought closer depending on the level of buy-in to C-TAP?  Other contributors have spoken about manufacturers refusing to engage.  Have manufacturers been asked to engage?  Have potential producers in other countries being directly asked to sign up to and support the programme?<\/p><p> On the companies based in Ireland that could manufacture the vaccine, do we know whether there is a relatively available supply of what they would need to facilitate their doing so?  I believe there are half a dozen such companies.  What engagement has taken place with them to determine whether they would come on board to engage in manufacturing if the conditions were right?<\/p><p> I understand certain countries have either overbought or over-ordered based on their populations.  I stand to be corrected but I believe New Zealand either over-ordered or overbought not for its own population but for neighbouring territories that may not have been best placed to order for themselves.  Is this a global trend?  Is there more evidence of this solidarity or is New Zealand very much an isolated case?  Of the countries that have over-ordered or overbought, how many have made an offer under the COVAX system?<\/p><p> We have touched on conflict zones, refugee movement and the vital job the Red Cross is doing.

It strikes me that the appalling mix of the animal instincts of capitalism is meeting up with competitive races.  The competitive race is not just that towards vaccination as it concerns individuals themselves.  As an individual sitting here, I watch every day to see how close my age group is to the next stage of vaccine roll-out in Ireland.  That is human nature.  All of us want to be vaccinated.  We want all the vaccines to be shared equally, but not just now.  It is a case of saying, \"I am all for it.  As soon as I have been vaccinated, let us get the rest of the world vaccinated.\"  That is a human response.  The animal instincts of capitalism are driven by the ownership of the intellectual property rights.  When we talk about declaring something a global public good, we are saying to the shareholders of the drugs companies and manufacturers that we do not want them to have super-normal profits, which is what they normally earn from the development of a drug of one type or another.  There are two ways of dealing with that.  One is that national governments would tax the shareholders to take the super-normal profits off them in order that the drug could be redistributed globally along the global network, but that is highly unlikely to happen because we are politicians and we ultimately answer to our local constituencies.  The other solution, therefore, is that we cough up and pay the super-normal profits to the manufacturers to have a free licence throughout the world to get manufacturing done.  I would be interested in the panel&rsquo;s view on that.<\/p> <p>  We have heard about occupied territories and war-torn areas around the world such as Syria and Yemen.<\/p><p>Where a totalitarian government is in place, do the witnesses believe, or is there any evidence to suggest, the denial of access to a vaccine may become another form of human rights abuse?<\/p><p> The other terrible term I heard this morning, which is quite frightening and I believe is happening in the United States, is \"vaccine chasing\".  People are moving from one geographical area to another because the roll-out of the vaccine is faster in the second area.  I am quite concerned about that.<\/p><p> I must ask this question today with respect to Covid-19.  Part of the argument or solution is vaccination, the other part is in testing.  There is a reluctance in Ireland to use antigen testing, which many European countries have taken up and are using to see schools and manufacturing plants open up.  What is the panel's view on the antigen roll-out?<\/p><p> The final question goes back to the issue of interpersonal competition for vaccine.  My colleague, Deputy Berry, referred to Defence Forces personnel who are going into extremely testing conditions.  Under normal circumstances, they are exposed to all sorts of infections, but in this particular instance they are exposed to Covid-19 on top of everything else.  I fully support what Deputy Berry is talking about.  Yesterday, however, we had a debate in this Chamber on special education.  The question arose as to whether those who are on the front line and will have to visit five or six houses a week now qualify as front-line workers.  The quite natural instinct is to stretch out the definition in order that we can bring more groups under the term \"front-line workers\".  I would love to hear from the panel as to how we might tie down what in fact constitutes a front-line worker and then work to that definition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#V00200","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":666,"content":"<p>I have a specific question.  Having discussed it with my Seanad colleague, Senator Higgins, I know she would have intended to ask this question if she could were it not for the Covid-19 restrictions.  She understands and appreciates that.<\/p> <p>  Building on Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s question to our panel, there are public health concerns internationally, specifically around Israel's unequal distribution of vaccines and access to vaccines for Palestinians in the occupied territories.  As our panel will know, the Palestinian human rights group, Al-Haq, joined by more than 100 Palestinian human rights and civil society organisations, called Israel's vaccine policy discriminatory and unlawful due to its complete disregard for its obligations toward Palestinian healthcare.  I believe one of our earlier contributors spoke to global apartheid with regard to the vaccines.  Article 56 of the Fourth Geneva Convention stipulates that the occupier has a duty to ensure the application of necessary preventive measures to combat the spread of diseases and epidemics.<\/p> <p>  So far, more than 172,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories have tested positive for Covid-19 and there have been more than 1,900 deaths.  As other members have said, I note the Government is contributing to COVAX.  In keeping with the Chairman's advice, however, I have a specific question.  Not least in the context of Ireland's often-cited and often-lauded soft power on the global stage, whether that is in the context the of the EU, UN, the Security Council or our historic and long-standing links with North America, will the panel give us their views on what more could be done specifically by Ireland and this State to support Palestinian equitable access to vaccinations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#W00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":667,"content":"<p>Before I go back to the panel, I want to ask about the immediate way forward.

If my recollection serves me right, it was put forward by countries in October and it has been discussed since then.  There were informal discussions again, I think, last week, and as far as I am aware there will be further discussions.  In March, there will be more discussions within the formal meeting context on the TRIPS situation, so it is still ongoing.<\/p> <p>  In response to some of the other questions, the C-TAP initiative is a voluntary system.  It does not suspend and instead encourages companies to share their intellectual property rights.  They retain those rights.  It is also a non-exclusive system so they would still be able to have licensing agreements.  That is the key difference between the two.  The other difference is that C-TAP encourages the sharing of know-how, which is crucial within the vaccine context.  Both of those measures are ongoing and, as we have said, both are ones that we support.<\/p> <p>  On the first question that Deputy Clarke asked about the figures that we mentioned earlier of nine out of ten people not being able to get vaccines, and some of those figures are for Oxfam and other groups, our hope is that is based on projections around the current vaccine situation.  We hope that with agreements like C-TAP or, indeed, if more companies are willing to engage in voluntary licensing, that would either increase the capacity, because we are going to have more and more manufacturers producing these vaccines, or it would build capacity.  It would mean new manufacturers coming on board to produce those vaccines.  Our hope is that that would then increase the numbers available and bring the figures down, thus making sure we have a more equitable spread because, essentially, the aim is to produce more and have more manufacturers doing more.<\/p> <p>  In terms of IP, that currently is tricky.  If companies have intellectual property and if they are not sharing the know-how, then other manufacturers cannot come on board because it would be in breach of intellectual property rights, but also they may not have the know-how to do that.  They need the know-how and the sharing.<\/p> <p>  On who else supports or whether any pharmaceutical companies support the C-TAP measure, there is news that 18 generic companies, that is, 18 companies that could produce generic products, have come on board and are supportive of the C-TAP arrangement.  As I have said, I am not aware of the current picture and to what extent they are coming on board, although I am sure they are, and there are negotiations between the WHO and the pharmaceutical companies that have some of the rights at the moment.  Certainly, generic companies are coming on board, and the latest figure is that there are 18 companies that are generic producers and that are willing to do that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Senator Craughwell's questions, one was very important as it mentioned the idea of human rights.  This is something we have touched on briefly.  It has to be said and must be emphasised, however, that there is a human right to life and there is also a human right to health protected both under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and under international agreements such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  All countries that are party to those would have obligations to protect and promote human rights, and not just a legal obligation, although clearly there is one, but also a moral obligation in terms of these issues.<\/p> <p>  I know, given the time, we may not get the opportunity to say more on the following, so we would like to thank the committee again today, but one of the things that I would ask for is that there would be consideration given to or discussion of formal endorsement of C-TAP.  It is very important.  Others have mentioned Ireland's place on the international stage.  It is not enough just to support C-TAP.  We certainly support that and hope that the Government would do that, but also, if possible and ideally, the Government should be advocating for C-TAP and other mechanisms at an international level, particularly at the  EU level but also, given its role internationally in terms of the UN Security Council, being an advocate and being a part of that.<\/p><p>The other thing is to encourage other pharmaceutical companies to join.  Some companies, it must be said, have already engaged in and entered into voluntary licensing deals and I know this has been mentioned.  These include Pfizer and BioNTech with Sanofi, AstraZeneca with the Serum Institute of India.  More of that needs to happen and C-TAP, if they supported it, could facilitate that at a larger scale.  The idea of whether a D&aacute;il motion might be something that would be possible was also mentioned earlier.  We would particularly welcome a D&aacute;il motion or Seanad motion tabling these types of issues if it was something Members were willing to consider, particularly an endorsement of the C-TAP initiative, but also the other initiatives such as the waiver or other proposals to facilitate equitable global access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#X00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McMahon.

Speaking as a public health professional, as well as an envoy for the WHO, the tipping point is now.  There is no time down the road.  We are watching extraordinary and dramatic damage occurring to the fabric of human society everywhere as a result of Covid.  It is very active now; there are a lot of issues all over the world, including deepening inequities and real frustration and anxiety on the part of millions of people.  Now is the time when the leaders in the rich world must take the initiative and must focus on equity.  All that has been said by Dr. McMahon, Dr. Harkin and Ms Byanyima is so right.  I say do not wait.<\/p> <p>  The second point is how many countries are doing what New Zealand has done in terms of actually taking advantage of their skills in dealing with Covid and postponing an option they have got on a vaccine?  I have not heard of any others and it is time we had a vaccine solidarity challenge where heads of government, through their legislators, are invited to indicate what are the circumstances under which they will be ready to share.  Of course, they will all say they are worried about variants but the whole world is worried about variants.  Variants can affect poor countries just as badly as they can affect rich ones.  The key thing is to protect those who are most at risk.  The responsibilities of occupiers, as was brought out by Deputy Clarke, and the responsibilities of governments are well set out.  Dr. McMahon is much better qualified than me to talk about it but again, as a public health professional, I am really concerned when groups of people inside a national border are denied, for some reason or other, an opportunity to access a vaccine and I am sure that those who have occupational responsibilities will do everything possible to be transparent about how they are dealing with it.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell raised many points and I got five of them down.  I feel I have the responsibility to deal with the third question, on vaccine sharing.  I stress that one of the things we all must work on at the moment is vaccine hesitancy.  There are people who are not quite sure about whether they want to take the vaccine.  It is really important that in all societies they are given a second, third or fourth chance if they are uncertain when first asked.  Thus I am kind of advocating for a really tolerant approach and for offering people, as I said, a chance to think about things and not requiring them to make a decision now on the basis that otherwise they will not get a chance.<\/p><p>On testing, I stress that while there are concerns about the reliability and positive predictive value of some of the antigen tests available, the committee should watch this space.  I believe that more reliable rapid tests will come on stream.  That will make such a difference.  We do not talk so much about testing.  I believe that access to rapid and reliable tests is absolutely key to an equitable response.<\/p><p> On the question of the definition of \"front-line personnel\", countries could really take advantage of the opportunities they have in the international system through the UN to debate these things.<\/p><p> The Chairman said something that is very important about the money that is needed.  The Chairman asked where the impetus will come from for a real initiative in this regard.  There have been calls for a vaccine summit involving the new US Administration and perhaps involving the G7.  It is very important that we go beyond just saying there needs to be a summit.  World leaders have got to come together in a constant format to deal with this crisis as a global crisis now.  It cannot be dealt with by individual national leaders working on their own, which is bound to cause terrible problems.  The kinds of issues we are discussing today need solidarity in the responses.  The WHO and the UN Secretary-General are constantly asking for greater and more joined-up leadership by leaders.  I propose not just a summit but a global Covid response programme that deals with all of the issues such as access to tests, access to treatment, access to vaccines, travel issues, the problems of obligations of occupiers and all the other problems we are talking about.  This needs ongoing attention now because we do not know what a failure to deal with Covid in a joined-up way worldwide will lead to.  We do know that 2020 was a year like no other.  Who knows what will happen in 2021 and 2022 if we do not deal with this as the global emergency that it is?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021020900002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Nabarro","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":678,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Nabarro.

As members are aware, the IHCA represents more than 3,200 hospital consultants, around 95% of the total number in the country.  First, I will address the current staffing situation, including the level of absenteeism.  There is a severe shortage of hospital consultants in our public health service.  We have the lowest number of medical specialists on a population basis in the EU.  We are 41% below the EU average.  We have a serious recruitment and retention crisis, with more than 700 permanent hospital consultant posts vacant or not filled as needed.  This in large part has been caused by a flawed Government decision in 2012 to cut the pay of newly appointed consultants.  Our younger consultants, who are being discriminated against, have been front and centre in providing care in the ongoing Covid crisis.  They have carried an extremely heavy burden of work during this period and will continue to do so.<\/p> <p>  The leaders of all the parties have agreed that ending the discrimination against consultants appointed since 2012 is essential to attract and retain the number of consultants we need.  The Government's failure to address the recruitment crisis and restore pay parity is bordering on negligence and only serves to exacerbate the extremely challenging task in dealing post Covid with the massive backlogs and waiting lists that are accumulating across all specialties.<\/p> <p>  In a survey of members last week, more than half said there are moderate or high staff absentee levels that are having an adverse impact on service delivery.  Of the medical and dental staff, we had an absence rate of just 2.3%, around a quarter of the rate of other staff categories.  However, more than half of the absences were due to Covid, which is the largest proportion for any staff category.  The closure of schools is impacting on the availability for work of healthcare workers and it is increasing workloads and stress levels for those at work.<\/p> <p>  I will move on quickly to Covid transmission within hospitals.  In the survey, around half of all respondents confirmed that improvements are needed to increase the number of single-occupancy rooms and beds in dedicated isolation wards.  Our members also expressed concerns about the lack of regular testing and screening of staff.  In the nine weeks to the end of January, more than 12,000 healthcare workers had been infected with the virus, including more than 560 doctors.<\/p><p>A total of over 1,400 confirmed cases were linked with hospital outbreaks in the same period.  Four in ten of those infected in the hospital outbreaks were healthcare workers.  Of the 1,400 cases linked with the hospitals, 30 were admitted to the intensive care unit, ICU, and, sadly, 124 died.  When community transmission rates are at such high levels, it is almost inevitable that there will be outbreaks in hospitals.  However, more must be done to prevent Covid infections being acquired in hospital settings.  It is clear for infection control purposes that our pre-Covid bed occupancy rate of around 95% needs to be reduced to between 80% and 85%.  To put that in perspective, this requires approximately 2,000 additional hospital beds to maintain current service levels.<\/p><p> In terms of long Covid, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association is concerned about the effects of long Covid and believes a HSE policy on long Covid is required for healthcare workers.  Regarding the availability of protective equipment, IHCA members in our survey reported high levels of availability of personal protective equipment, PPE, of an appropriate grade, albeit there are some small glitches at individual sites.  As regards the mental well-being of staff arising from the Covid crisis, a large majority of consultants in our survey said that Covid-19 has had a moderate or severe impact on their workload, general well-being and mental health.  More than one-fifth of respondents are experiencing symptoms of burnout and work-related stress.  Two in five doctors in Ireland now say their mental well-being is worse compared with what it was at the start of the pandemic.  Worryingly, there is a high risk that when the pandemic eases there will be increased mental health issues impacting on our health staff.  Returning to the stressful overstretched business-as-usual model is not an option if we are to avoid an even worse workforce crisis than was the case before Covid-19.<\/p><p> Regarding additional staffing requirements to deal with the non-Covid backlog, over 70% of our respondents confirmed that low numbers of consultants available to deliver care will have a moderate or severe adverse impact on the capacity to deal with the backlog in non-Covid care.  More than 840,000 people are on some form of hospital waiting list.  With over 700 permanent consultant posts vacant, our acute hospitals are very poorly positioned to provide timely care to patients.  While the Government has committed record funding levels for health in 2021, until this money is channelled effectively and speedily to where it will make the most difference for patients, through the recruitment of additional consultants with supporting teams and infrastructure, public hospitals will continue to have record waiting lists and struggle to address the backlog of treatment due to Covid-19.<\/p><p> The Government can no longer ignore the fundamental requirement that essential treatment is delivered by consultants and that no amount of investment in hospital services will reduce waiting lists unless we recruit and retain the necessary number of hospital consultants to deliver timely care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Robert Landers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Owens to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#B00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":691,"content":"<p>There can be no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on our already overstretched front-line health service staff.  In a recent survey that was carried out among the thousands of members of the IMO we sought to determine the exact impact.  The three main impacts cited were preexisting staffing shortages exacerbated by Covid illnesses and requirements to self-isolate; the growing backlog of waiting patients; and the impact on doctors' personal health and wellbeing.  However, we should be under no illusion, as these issues existed long before the pandemic struck.  What is deplorable is that it is now almost one year since the first case of Covid-19 was diagnosed in Ireland, yet no substantial and systemic action has been taken to date to address the crises in recruitment and retention of medical expertise across our health system.<\/p><p>As a consequence, waiting lists have grown and stress and burnout are prevalent among the medical workforce.  In an as yet unpublished IMO survey, 80% of doctors across all grades cited feelings of depression, anxiety and stress, particularly emotional stress.<\/p><p> Although public health medicine is the first line of defence we have against Covid-19, we have 60 public health specialists compared to 180 in Scotland and New Zealand where the population is of a similar size and is similarly dispersed.  Public health specialists have the expertise and training to carry out risk assessments and manage and control outbreaks of infection in our healthcare settings and in the wider community and yet public health specialists have still not been provided with a consultant contract and the resources necessary to allow them to carry out their statutory duties.  It beggars belief and should be a cause of considerable shame that these doctors, who are our front line in this battle, had to ballot for industrial action in the midst of a pandemic to have their long-running grievances considered in a serious fashion.<\/p><p> In the past year, hospital waiting lists have grown by approximately 70,000 or 9% and now stand at 838,000, yet the number of vacant consultant posts or posts filled on a temporary or non-substantive basis has risen to 730, more or less.  The supply of medical specialists simply fails to meet demand.  The HSE itself estimates that we require a minimum of 1,600 additional hospital consultants to meet the needs of our current population.  If we include psychiatry and public health specialists, and we should, the shortfall is closer to 2,000.  Still, however, no concrete measures have been taken to address the twotier pay structure among hospital consultants, which is the major factor contributing to the consultant recruitment and retention crisis.<\/p><p> There is no doubt that staffing shortages are impacting significantly on the mental health of our medical workforce and we have surveyed to establish that.  Long working hours, excessive workloads, redeployment, requirements to cover for absent colleagues, the inability to get proper rest and take proper breaks and difficulties in accessing childcare are all contributing to high rates of stress and burnout among doctors.  This is particularly evident among non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, or doctors in training, who are seeing their training eroded by Covid-19.  It is also the case among public health specialists where morale is at an all-time low.<\/p><p> General practice is not without its capacity issues.  Some 600 GPs are due to retire over the next five years while the HSE's national doctors training and planning unit estimates that up to 1,660 additional GPs will be required by 2028.  GPs are encountering difficulties in recruiting additional practice staff and accessing locum cover.  Young GPs are finding it prohibitively expensive to establish themselves and build their own practices.<\/p><p> What can we do to address these matters?  We must urgently strengthen public health medicine services through the immediate awarding of a consultant contract to  specialists in public health medicine, as recommended by the Crowe Horwath report, the Scally report and the report of the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel.  We must ensure that adequate risk assessments are carried out across all healthcare settings.  We must complete the vaccination of all front-line healthcare workers as a matter of absolute national priority.  We must ensure that adequate supplies of quality personal protective equipment, PPE, for all front-line healthcare workers are available for hospital and community staff.  We must encourage continued adherence to National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, guidelines through public education campaigns.  All healthcare workers should have access to appropriately resourced and consultant-led occupational health services, including necessary mental health supports.  In addition, all healthcare workers should be aware of their occupational rights and entitlements during this pandemic.  This is not the time for fighting employers; this is the time to be on the same side.<\/p><p> We cannot hope to address the backlog of nonCovid patients on waiting lists, running at nearly 850,000, without addressing the recruitment and retention crisis as it affects hospital consultants.  This is a longstanding issue that now requires an urgent solution.  The Government needs to urgently address the twotier consultant pay issue.  The HSE is not an employer of choice as the Public Service Pay Commission, among others, has found.  Health service leaders know that to be the case and we suspect that many of our politicians also recognise that fact.<\/p><p> In the meantime, all higher specialist trainees, SpRs, who have finished training should be offered a temporary consultant locum post to get us through this crisis.  We must also ensure a sufficient number of intern posts and training posts for those who wish to come into the service and contribute at this time.  Once we get them in, it absolutely behoves the service to ensure that the working hours of our exhausted non-consultant hospital doctors comply with the European working time directive and the Organisation of Working Time Act.  We know that they do not.<\/p><p> Finally, we need to provide additional support for established GPs to allow them to recruit the staff they will need.  We also need to provide supports for newly establishing GPs to allow them to get through the difficult first few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Anthony Owens","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Owens.

We set out in our submission to cover the matters that we were asked to deal with, namely, issues to do with Covid infections and healthcare workers.  The first issue to which we draw attention is the rate of infections among healthcare workers.  This week, the International Council of Nurses confirmed that the rate of infection among Ireland's healthcare worker population, at 12%, is the highest it has recorded.  This is a worrying trend which we have raised previously with the committee.  We believe that the delay in the introduction of protection for workers by ensuring that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, has a role to play in examining workplaces has certainly contributed to this high rate of infections.  The INMO and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, sought for the HSA to amend regulations and that the Government would insist that they be regulated from the time that the pandemic was declared on 11 March last year.  Unfortunately, that did not happen until the biological hazard directive was introduced by the European Union on 24 November.  That interim period led to a lack of focus on the principle of preventing infections among healthcare workers.  These workers are in the eye of the storm.  The settings in which they work are workplaces and the HSA must conduct inspections where we know there are continuing clusters of Covid-19 infections in workplaces.<\/p> <p>  The data show that the prevalence of infection among females is highest in the health service because the number of female worker is higher than in other sectors.  The reports from the HSA confirm that if one is a woman working in the health service, one is at the highest risk of contracting Covid-19.  The issue is huge for us because a large portion of our members are women.  Stress levels and mental health issues surrounding the provision of childcare and the difficulties in attempting to secure childcare, when decisions have been made, for example, to close schools, are combined with the difficulties of going to work in a high-risk environment and fighting to have personal protective equipment, PPE, provided that is adequate.  That equipment is continually being assessed for its efficacy.  We had to do so again in January, unfortunately, having previously, last April, sought a policy change to allow all healthcare workers to wear surgical masks.  We had to repeat that process and seek the upgrade of those masks as what we know about the virus showed there was a higher risk.  We were tracking the numbers of infections rates and this demonstrated that the new variant was far more infectious than existing variants.  It took almost three weeks for the HSE policy to change to allow healthcare workers the right to wear the higher-grade mask.<\/p> <p>  Many other issues in our submission point to the fact of the precautionary principle and healthcare worker protection not being to the forefront.  We are and have been very critical of this.  It is a real issue for our members, who are putting themselves at risk on a daily basis in moving past all the obstacles to get to work, including incurring additional personal costs for the provision of childcare, in order to provide a service.  We believe that their health and safety has not been protected to the level that it should and must be.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the vaccine roll-out, we point out in our submission that the trajectory and statistics we have from the HSE show that some counties, including, for example, the Border counties of Louth, Donegal, Cavan and Sligo, had very high population incidences, yet vaccine administration was not concentrated in, and prioritised for, those areas.<\/p><p>Our members in those areas were absolutely devastated when they were not prioritised for the vaccine roll-out.  Today the HSE portal to allow healthcare workers register for vaccination opened and we are very worried that the same thing might happen again.  We hope it will not.  We have worked hard with the HSE on a sequencing document, which was issued on 19 January, to ensure that front-line, patient-facing healthcare workers are prioritised for the vaccine that is available because clearly this is their line of defence.<\/p><p> The long-term Covid effects are another issue on which we believe the committee must comment.  The long-term Covid effects are real.  Many of our members report to us that they have not recovered, that they continue to fight Covid at home, that they have long-term fatigue or long-term neurological or cardiac presentations post infection at work.  There is simply no fast-tracking or clinical pathway for them, despite numerous requests for same.  We believe that, as an employer, the health service has to do better and that there must be real precautionary and preventative measures in place.  There must also be very real measures now to deal with the long Covid effects.<\/p><p> In addition, we know from all the studies we have done or which other health services across the globe have looked at that the mental health effects post pandemic will be of huge significance.  More than 80% of our members have said their mental health has been affected by working in these conditions.  Now we have to prepare for that and make sure we are putting in place supports to allow recuperation and to allow the healthcare workers who have been working at 120%, 140% and 150% to recuperate when, it is to be hoped, the vaccine is fully rolled out and we have a reprieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I thank Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha.

Obviously, top of that queue are nurses, consultants and GPs but also all healthcare staff - cleaning staff, cooks, catering staff, maintenance staff, secretarial staff, administrative staff, porters, nursing assistants, managers, social workers, chaplains, pharmacists and physiotherapists - who have had front-line roles.

Perhaps all witnesses could comment on the &euro;21 billion budget, which is the highest ever, with an additional &euro;4 billion this year.  That is certainly very welcome.  I think Professor Landers has stated that that money is not being spent effectively.  Perhaps he could advise how it should be spent, whether more should be spent or what he suggests we should not spend money on within the health sector.  That is important.  As I said, money is not endless.<\/p><p> What percentage of members of the witnesses' organisations have not been vaccinated?  They should have been.  That was, and should still be, the priority.  What are the reasons for them not being vaccinated?  Some were missed because, when their hospitals, HSE nursing homes or whatever were vaccinating, they were out, isolating or had Covid and that caused a delay.  What is the relationship in that regard?  Front-line workers must be the first priority.<\/p><p> Professor Landers and Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha made reference to the benefits of single-occupancy rooms.  Will they expand on that?  How do single-occupancy en suite rooms protect patients and staff?  The new 75-bed unit in Galway is an example.<\/p><p> There are consultancy posts being advertised that are not being taken up.

This year's money is being spent in an emergency situation and with little in the way of planning.  That has been necessary, but we now need to plan into the future.  As I alluded to in my presentation, we need at least 2,000 additional beds.  We also need to examine the infrastructure.  In other words, the majority of facilities need to be single-room accommodation, which would bring us into line with the modern, developed world.  Any new hospital being built these days is all single-room accommodation.  The virus will spread in any congregated setting, be that a two-bed, three-bed, five-bed or six-bed ward.  Single-room accommodation greatly cuts down the virus's ability to spread.<\/p> <p>  Consultancy post vacancies exist across all model 2, 3 and 4 hospitals.  It is true that some consultant posts are not as attractive as others depending on someone's interests, but there are vacancies across all specialties and hospitals.

The number in question is 49,500 healthcare workers, but we do not have a breakdown by grade.  There is a long way to go, given that people must have a first and then a second vaccination.  There are nurses and midwives working in ICUs and emergency departments today who have not had their first vaccinations.  They must be prioritised.<\/p> <p>  We worked hard to get the sequencing document, which has been in place since 12 January and was reiterated on 19 January.  It is key.  Those who are patient-facing, front-line healthcare workers have to be prioritised for a vaccine.  It is a health and safety measure to ensure that their risk is mitigated.  In our view, the State, through the HSA must have an involvement in ensuring that happens.  Under the European directive, the HSA has a legal imperative to ensure that workplaces are safe.  To date, we have been critical of the lack of focus on that imperative in respect of healthcare workers.  Just because they are working in the health service does not mean their environment is safe.  In fact, it is the opposite.  We know that the rate of infection among workers in the health service is very high.<\/p><p>Those working on the front line of the health service, particularly women, are at higher risk.  This is very problematic, and we must find out why it is.  We cannot just look at it as we have been doing with the trolley count for years, nod our heads and say, \"Yes, isn't it terrible?\"  This is very real.  It is high risk.  The after-effects of contracting Covid will be with us for a long time.<\/p><p> In respect of the service plan, we have had an agreement since 2016 that the HSE would sign off the service plan with the union in respect of the funded workforce plan for nursing and midwifery every November.  It happened once in 2017.  This year we still do not have a service plan for the health service, a funded workforce plan or otherwise, signed by the Minister.  Today is 9 February.  It is imperative to focus on how we staff the health service, what is funded and how we recruit, particularly now in a pandemic when we know that more than 6,000 staff are unable to come to work because of being affected themselves.  It is a matter this committee should raise with the Minister for Health.

I thank the Senator for his questions.  He asked about vacant consultant posts in certain sites.  I would overlay that because we have many vacant consultant posts in certain specialties.  Right now, we need emergency medicine consultants and ICU consultants where we have many vacant posts.  We also need mental health consultants, psychiatrists, and they will be particularly needed when, touch wood, we get out of this.  We also have many vacant posts there.  Therefore, it is sites and specialties.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also mentioned the vaccine roll-out.  Many of our non-consultant hospital doctors came to us with a particular issue.  As he knows, non-consultant hospital doctors have a rotational pattern and quite a few will rotate from one location to another in January every year.  This year we had a particular problem.  Many of them who were leaving site A to go to site B were told in site A to hang on and get the vaccine in site B and others were told when they got to site B to go back to site A to get their second dose.  There are issues which affect numbers of doctors.  In the great scheme of things, it might seem relatively small but the fact of the matter is a vaccination campaign, which is our way out of this, should not make our doctors anxious and should not give them concerns or pause for thought.  It should not give us reasons to approach the HSE and ask, \"Would you please vaccinate front-line healthcare workers?\"  That should just be happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Anthony Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I believe Dr. Colleran has indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#G00400","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":709,"content":"<p>Senator Kyne asked about the empty posts.  We currently have 728 consultant posts that are not filled on a permanent basis, which is 20% of our current consultant numbers.  The national doctors training programme estimates that we need to increase the number of acute hospital consultants by 51% by 2028.  It is critical that we not only fill those posts, but then recruit another 50%.  Those calculations are all pre-pandemic and, as we all know, the 840,000 people waiting for care is only growing.  The Senator asked what would help to fix it.  The reality is that for many of my peers, with whom I have considerable contact in my role, the 2012 decision makes working abroad more attractive.  It is simple as that.  As long as we are paying two people differently for doing the same work, people who are away will not come home.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee, as public representatives, need to see that there is value for money and that people are delivering the care.  That is something we are doing every day.  If we look to what we have shown in the past year, the leadership, the innovation, the agility, the commitment shown by our members, we have shown what is possible and how we can turn around how we deliver care during a pandemic.  Where people previously thought that the health service could not change and could not be agile, that has all been turned on its head.  It has been down to the local teams and the local services, the doctors, nurses, the health and social care professionals, and the porters.  All of us working together have delivered for patients.<\/p> <p>  As long as we have the 2012 cut and a 30% pay differential, we will continue to have trouble filling those 728 or 1,100 or 650 posts.  The Senator is right; it is not just pay but also conditions.  People have too much call and too much workload.  They are filling the gap for the consultants who are not in post.

I will make a few points and then put a few questions to a number of witnesses.  All of the opening statements made for very difficult listening and should be for all of us but there is a very clear relationship between the burnout facing front-line staff and low morale on the one hand and the lack of capacity across the system, the failure to deal with the two-tier pay inequality issues that have been in play for a long time and the lack of supports in terms of occupational health on the other.  If we do not sort out these problems, we will lose more nurses, doctors, consultants and front-line staff.  It is as simple as that.  Student nurses and midwives have been campaigning for the past number of months - years in fact.  The public health specialists have pay demands, as do hospital consultants operating on lower two-tier contracts, so we need to sort out all of these issues.<\/p> <p>  I will make a number of points about occupational health.  It is outrageous to learn from the opening statements that there is no serial testing for front-line staff in hospitals.  If there is any place to use testing to hunt down the virus, it should be the front line in hospitals.  I cannot believe that serial testing is not being done or is only being done when there is an outbreak.  The fact that the roll-out of the vaccine has been haphazard and did not follow the infection rates is deeply troubling, as is the fact that there have been very few inspections by the Health and Safety Authority.  I make all of these points because staff are exhausted and facing burnout, their morale is low, they want us to fix these problems and they are facing into what, in my view, will be a tsunami of missed care that must be caught up with in the time ahead.  We cannot expect all of those people who have been through very difficult circumstances with all of the challenges they faced over the past year to face into all of that catch-up care if we do not support them.  <\/p> <p>  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha stated that the lack of routine testing and monitoring for exposed nurses, midwives and other front-line workers had exposed them to a greater risk of infection.  She said that, put simply, if we cannot see a problem, we cannot deal with it.  What was the response of the HSE when told by the INMO that serial testing was not happening?  We should bear in mind that over 50% of front-line staff who have been infected with Covid have been nurses and healthcare assistants, mostly women.  What was the response of the HSE when the INMO raised issues relating to testing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#H00100","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":711,"content":"<p>The HSE has consistently said it will test only where there are outbreaks.  There is serial testing in long-term care but there is none in the acute hospital system or in the community outside long-term care.  The study undertaken in Tallaght and Galway demonstrates that this means we do not pick up asymptomatic presentation and 34% of the asymptomatic presentation was not picked up.  According to that study, this means that people were going to work with Covid-19 but without any symptoms.  We have been very critical of that.  Our members have sought serial testing.  To date, the HSE has been unable to give us a satisfactory answer.  It is now saying that antigen testing may be introduced.  Again, there is a lot of information around the efficacy and accuracy of antigen testing.  We believe that until the vaccine is rolled out completely with both doses, it is imperative that we know the status of healthcare workers when they are at work and this requires a routine testing regime to be in place.  We believe this is the role of the Health and Safety Authority.  It must look at the staff and the areas with the highest level of infection and where outbreaks continue to occur.  We know from staff that the acute hospital system continues to have a very high infection rate.<\/p><p>Evidence suggests that some policies of the HSE such as the derogation for staff who were close contacts to return to work did not assist in reducing infection levels and may have actually increased the infection rate.  Those policies must be tested from the point of view of the safety of the worker.  <\/p><p> In terms of staffing, I agree with my consultant colleagues on the issue of the two-tier system and I am glad the Deputy raised the issue of student nurses because not only are student nurses going into the eye of the storm, they are not being paid at all.

The winter of 2019 was very busy.  We had a lot of overcrowding and our members were very tired coming into February and March 2020 when the pandemic struck.  When we hear the account by the HSE of changing capacity and surge capacity, what does it mean?  It means nurses and midwives in the main changed their roles.  Many of them moved from the areas where they practised and worked and went to work in intensive care surge capacity areas and changed their shifts and their attendance.  They worked extra shifts and continued long after their shifts ended to make sure the patients were cared for.  That is the reality.<\/p> <p>  Now, in the third surge, it has been more difficult because the requirement to provide high-level intensive care outside of intensive care units, with a total of 13 intensivists in the country, has put an enormous strain on the expertise of ICU nurses, who are in short supply, and on those who have assisted in recovery rooms and theatres.  There are also Covid wards with very high dependency patients.  Again, there is a high level of skill required.  It is the perfect storm of very low staffing to begin with, high levels of sickness and the requirement for the same pool to provide continuously the extraordinary work they have been providing.  This coupled with childcare means there are very real issues.<\/p><p>When our members heard about school closures they wondered how they were going to get to work.

We are asking for there to be enough colleagues for management workloads and safe call rosters, that is, just the basics so that we can do our jobs.  As for the infrastructure, what we have seen in terms of nosocomial infections is that our hospitals are just not fit for modern infection control, so we need rapidly to replace many of the acute beds in our system with single-room hospitals, that is, modern hospitals for modern infection control.  We know from history that it takes too long to provide public beds in the Irish system.  It takes seven to eight years, while it is turned around much faster in the private sector.  Some of that is tied up with tendering and processes.  We have a great deal of public land and we need to get new beds into the system that are built for modern infection control.<br\/><br\/>The 30% pay cut is the big barrier; we know that from talking to consultants who are on fellowship abroad.  Fairness is important in every aspect of life.  If two people are being treated differently and one is being paid 30% more than the other, it is not a recruitment and retention strategy.  That is the biggest barrier.  If that is addressed and more staff come in, people will be able to get through the work.  I cannot describe to the committee what it is like when one sees the impact on a child or adult who has been waiting so long on a list that he or she has a worse outcome.  There is a moral injury with that and it damages doctors, nurses and health professionals.  We need to remove it from our systems because when trainees who grow up in the system go away to Australia, New Zealand or America, as I did, and they work in systems where they can consistently feel proud and they do not have that moral injury and damage, they do not want to feel it again.  That is part of why they stay away.  If we fix the system so that it works for patients, and if we have capacity to meet need, that is when we will attract and retain people because of that feeling of being part of something excellent.<br\/><br\/>In many pockets of our health service, people are very satisfied with the care when they get in because we have excellent teams.  We saw that in the way that our healthcare workers responded to this crisis and stepped up, but too many people wait too long for access to scheduled care.  &quot;Elective&quot; care makes it sound as if it is not urgent, but if an elderly person cannot walk to the shops or to mass because he or she has hip pain, or if he or she cannot drive because he or she has not had a cataract operation, that elective care is essential.  We have to get the capacity into our system.  The belief that, somehow, our public health system cannot be fixed has to be tackled.<br\/><br\/>While I have this opportunity, I must talk about psychiatry.  There is a critical lack of beds in the psychiatric system.  When psychiatric consultants are on call, they do not have beds even for people who are suicidal.  They ring around trying to beg and borrow beds for people who acutely need admission with suicidal ideation or psychotic episodes.  We are discriminating against psychiatric patients and people with mental health issues.  We allocate 6% of the total health budget to mental health, whereas it is 12% in the UK and it still has issues.  There is an urgent need for parity of esteem for mental health in this country.  We are letting down a generation of Irish people.  We are seeing the impact of the pandemic on our children.  There has been an increase in the number of presentations with mental health issues to our paediatric emergency departments.  We really have to address this issue.<br\/><br\/>When I look to the trainees coming behind me, I want to fix the system so that they see a future leading and innovating in it and so that they will want to stay in the system.  As soon as the world opens back up, we will see an exodus because of the trauma of what has happened during this pandemic to our trainees and because of what they are seeing in terms of how our healthcare workers are being treated.  As Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha so eloquently articulated, we were abandoned when the schools were closed, with no plan for us.  In Northern Ireland and Britain, children of healthcare workers are going to school, whereas my children and my colleagues' children are being traumatised.  They are falling behind and we are too tired and burned out to help them with homeschooling when we get home.  I got home at 9.15 p.m. on Monday last and my seven-year-old was sitting there with her <i>Abair Liom<\/i>on the table, waiting to do her Irish homework with me.<\/p><p>I burst into tears.  I had nothing left to give.  She is stressed because she is falling behind.  The anxiety is through the roof.  We are not working from home, so we are not there to support our children.  We feel we have been abandoned by the State at exactly the time when we have all stepped up.  We went into work every day before we were vaccinated, putting our own lives on the line, seeing colleagues getting sick, seeing colleagues being out with long Covid and not coming back, knowing that we were at risk of that ourselves, but there was no plan for us.  The schools just shut and there was nothing to help us, but it was our problem and our cost to absorb.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabrielle Colleran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I do not have time to call Dr. Colleran's colleagues.

The Senator might recall that the ambulances were backing up at the time in Letterkenny General Hospital.  Nurses and doctors were going into the ambulances and they had not been vaccinated.

I have been in this job for less than a year, and I am already becoming weary of the constant conversations about how the system was not able to deal with things before the onset of Covid-19.  Given the way things are now, and considering I am already weary of it, I can only imagine how utterly wearying and draining it is to be working in the system.<\/p> <p>  I cannot get over the stark situation regarding the low numbers of staff and their low morale.  As everyone has remarked, the information we have and which we are discussing is all from before Covid-19 struck.  We now have this explosion of chaos, if I can put it so delicately.  Not only were the numbers short before this, we now have appalling treatment, if I could be so bold as to put it that way, of the staff in the system.  We have as a result the double whammy of trying to keep people in the system, while also trying to recruit people into the same system.  Arguably, people would have to be mad to come into a system like this one.  It seems incredibly bleak.  I commend wholeheartedly, therefore, all the work being done by staff.  <\/p> <p>  It is fair to say that the conditions in which work is being undertaken by these staff include being overworked, underpaid, stressed and burnt out in respect of mental health.  In respect of several articles and studies having been published on this aspect, I also think it is fair to say that many people will exit the system at the other side of this crisis.  People here have referred to that prospect already.  We not only have a problem, therefore, with getting people into a system which is already drastically understaffed, but we are also going to have people scarpering out the door as soon as it is reasonably safe to do so.  I think that would be a fair enough assessment.  <\/p> <p>  Is the answer to addressing this situation an extremely aggressive recruitment strategy, involving elements such as pay parity and improvements in conditions?  It seems to me that the solution on paper is quite simple, namely, better conditions, better pay and getting going pretty lively in recruiting people into the system before other people head out the door when it is safe to travel again.  How do we get all of that happening, though?  It seems these committees have Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha coming in repeatedly to lay out the details of these bleak situations, but we are not moving anywhere in addressing them.  We are not going anywhere with getting solutions to these problems.  I do not know what to do as a public representative in order to bring these solutions about.  I am at my wits' end, and I am only here a few months.  What is it that needs to happen?  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of student nurses, which is my favourite topic to talk about, some 93% of student nurses in 2014 said that they were considering emigrating.  I would not be surprised if 100% of student nurses were now considering emigrating.  Again, here we have another problem coming down the line.  It seems that we are constantly talking about this problem coming down the line, but that we have already jumped over it because we have now been landed with Covid-19.  I am so flabbergasted as to how we are supposed to deal with this issue.<\/p><p>I am astonished by the patience of those presenting today and their ability to keep their decorum, as it were, when this situation is so ridiculous.  Many here have spoken about student nurses.  The Labour Party has published a Bill to pay student nurses and midwives.  I am really excited to see the appearance of the cross-party support that would be needed to get it over the line.  It seems to me that everyone nods and agrees that student nurses need to be paid and the situation is not good enough, but people are not willing to put their money where their mouths are and support changes in the legislation to do that.<\/p><p> Those are observations that Dr. Colleran or Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha might respond to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#S00500","speaker":"1663","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":791,"content":"<p>The Senator has hit the nail on the head.

Those of us on the consultant front just want to have enough colleagues for safe manageable workloads, for call rosters that are safe to be able to provide the care for all the patients that need to see us.

That is what we are doing.  She is right that we do need a recruitment strategy, but at the moment we have something more like a removal strategy.  The safest and surest way to build up the consultant capacity that we need is to train our own consultants.  We are not doing that.  We do not have enough training places and we are not bringing people through who could get into those consultant posts.  This is something that will become very real.  We took in the biggest ever intern cohort last year and the system has not put training places in place to get those people going through the system to be trained to be consultants.  We are going to lose many of them.  That is a removal strategy; they are going to go.<\/p> <p>  When people come to a consultant post, if they have had experience abroad, as Dr. Colleran said, they will not come back to work here for 30% less than their colleagues.

We are not doing that properly.<\/p> <p>  I have referred numerous times today to the fact that public health medicine is our insurance policy.  We have one third the number of the public health specialists who should be consultants as there are in Scotland, which has a similar population size and similar geographic dispersal of population.

We need to stop the removal strategy and move to a proper, sustained and focused recruitment strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Anthony Owens"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":793,"content":"<p>The Senator asked what the Joint Committee on Health can do.  The first thing it can do is make sure that there is a policy decision that the moratorium on recruitment, if and when it is reintroduced, can never apply to nursing and midwifery, as it has in each of the moratoriums that have happened since 2008.   It has not applied to consultants but it has applied to nurses and midwives.<\/p><p>We have, therefore, been constantly running to try and undo the damage done by the moratorium.  One should remember that we are still very reliant on overseas recruitment from non-EU countries.  That is a major issue right now, because we have a lot more evidence that this pandemic affects communities from the black, Asian and ethnic minority groupings to a greater extent.  We have to look at that and put specific protections in place because we are very reliant on that community of healthcare workers in Ireland and that will continue into the future because there is a global shortage of nurses and midwives.  The first ask, therefore, is policy to ensure that moratoriums cannot apply.  Thankfully, we now have a scientific tool as part of Government policy to determine how many nurses we need but that must be funded and rolled out across the health service.  We cannot just decide how many nurses and midwives we need based on the available resources.  There will be science behind it and it will be based on the patient dependency.  The framework on nursing and midwifery staffing is accepted as Government policy, but it has to be funded to be rolled out.  If one wants to open one ICU bed, seven ICU nurses are needed.  That is not possible to do overnight, so one has to pre-plan and put a lot of planning in place.<\/p><p> The health and well-being of all front-line health workers who have been battling this pandemic will be severely compromised.  We have lodged a claim to have respite for them, hopefully when the number of admissions to hospitals and community care areas reduces, the workload reduces and the vaccines take hold and reduce infection rates.  That must be addressed.  The committee should promote that.  We should do what other countries have done.  We should show appreciation for the extra give in response to the ask.  Compensation must be afforded to the health service workforce for that.  Senator Hoey is very familiar with the student nurse issue.  I have heard her speak on it previously but this committee must comment on it.  It cannot be silent on it because it is exploitation.  This is 2021 and we are in a pandemic and there is no excuse for trying to portray what student nurses have contributed as not being work.  It is simply not credible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":795,"content":"<p>I confirm at the outset that I am on the Leinster House campus so I am able to participate in the committee meeting with parliamentary privilege.  I join others in thanking all the front-line health service staff for everything they have done.  We are approaching a year of this crisis and it looks very much like the situation will be prolonged for a number of months to come.  We are certainly not out of the woods and yet there is some cause for hope with the roll-out of the vaccine, albeit it at a slower pace than everyone in the country would like, but it is progressing nonetheless.  The situation should improve.  As the witnesses have articulated, staff on the front line are still exposed to the ferocity of the situation and the risk involved every day.

The stresses do not stay behind in the hospital when staff close the door and sit into the car; they are carried home with them.<\/p> <p>  I wish to put a number of questions.  The first relates to the vaccination of mental health staff.  We continue to see real difficulties in the mid-west region.  A fortnight or three weeks ago I put a number of questions to the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>He advised me there has been a devolved function in terms of vaccination roll-out for front-line staff, that each hospital group has received a certain number of batches of the vaccine and, using the disbursal criteria, the groups are ensuring their staff are vaccinated.  In the mid-west and particularly in Ennis General Hospital the mental health nurses have been passed over.  The front-line medical nurses have all been vaccinated and vaccination has moved down through other elements of the staff, including administrative staff, ground staff and people who during their working day, even though they are in a risk environment, have some mitigation measures around them such as perspex and the like.  However, the mental health nurses continue to circulate and go into homes without the benefit of vaccination.  Is the INMO aware of that?  It is not to blame, of course, but is it aware that some of its members continue to be outliers and have been passed over in the chain on command?<\/p><p> I saw with great interest about two weeks ago that Bantry General Hospital in west Cork was a poster boy for vaccination.  It had gone through all its staff and had started calling in the local GPs.  The mid-west does not appear to be at that point.  Will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha comment on that?  Is she aware of that breakdown of the chain of command there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#U00200","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":797,"content":"<p>Again, we said the initial roll-out of the vaccine was very unsatisfactory.

Many doctors have been in contact with me and told me about the early days when the portal opened in which they had to register for vaccination.  Many of them went through the first and second pages of inputting data, but then the system crashed several times.  Some of them did not get around to it a second time because of the immense workload they take on each day, or when they did, a week had elapsed.  Some of them tried a second time, but again the same technical glitches were encountered.  Basically, they did not get to register properly and by the time they did, they are of the view that it set them back in the roll-out calendar, as it were.  They have fallen further back.

Absolutely, there was a design flaw in the roll-out of the vaccine.

We are told that it has been fixed, that the sequencing document has been brought up to date and it is now fixed with the portal.  There are still issues in terms of getting registered for vaccination.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to mental health.  I will say a few words on mental health, which is important.  We have been contacted by doctors, both NCHDs and consultants, who are mental health doctors, psychiatrists and trainee psychiatrists and are employed by one arm of the HSE but who work in the acute hospitals.  They have experienced difficulties in getting their names put on a list in an acute hospital by virtue of the fact that their payroll is somewhere else.  Those are the types of issues we are still trying to iron out.  They have damaged the confidence we can have in this vaccination campaign.  Hopefully, we are approaching the end of such problems.  We need to be because the psychiatrists I mentioned have unscheduled care commitments and see patients who present through emergency departments and wards.  They absolutely need to be vaccinated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#V00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Anthony Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":800,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Owens.  Dr. Colleran might intervene in a moment, but I wish to make a final point and she can respond to the points generally.  My last point relates to long Covid, which a number of people have mentioned today.  Typically, in a work environment if one is out for a long period, one is referred to Medmark Occupational Healthcare and there could be certain screening barriers to somebody returning to work or remaining out of work.  Are front-line staff encountering any of those barriers?  Is it accepted that one may not present with antibodies but one still has the symptoms of long Covid?  Is that generally accepted across all strata of the health service or are people being referred to Medmark Occupational healthcare, being scrutinised and having those barriers put before them?<\/p><p>The final thing I will say is that the vaccination of healthcare staff, across all spectrums, is important.  There are ancillary or therapeutic staff who enable children with learning and physical difficulties to attend education as best they can.  I was teacher until the general election.  There are still many services, such as the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, that are not engaging with children online or face to face.  It is not for our guests to solve but, as some of those staff are members of some of our guests' unions, we need to see those people out there and offering supports to children at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#V00500","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":802,"content":"<p>There are very high levels of Covid-19 among mental health workers and consultants.  Services are under extreme pressure because of the number of acute presentations and the lack of beds.  It is essential that they are prioritised.<\/p> <p>  I want to take this opportunity to emphasise something that is key for us to talk about, that is, our public health specialists and infrastructure.  People sometimes get confused between the acute public hospitals and the public health infrastructure and the staff who provide it.  As the IHCA does not represent public health specialists, I cannot be accused of having a vested interest in this matter, other than the same vested interest that we should all have in having a public health system that works.  We do not give consultant status to public health specialists in this country.  We are an outlier in that regard and it massively impacts our ability to manage pandemics and to plan healthcare.  It is essential for that to be addressed and all of the outbreak management and contact tracing falls under the auspices of, and is led by, public health consultants.<\/p> <p>  The elephant in the room is that vaccine roll-out is hampered by the fact that we do not have a universal health identifier for people.  We do not have public health IT that is fit for purpose, compared with the UK and other countries.  Those other countries are well able to prioritise people and have back-up lists because they have a universal health identifier and the required IT infrastructure.  We have the specialists.  Public health specialists are trained to consultant level in public health.  If we actually pay them properly, give them the tools that consultants have in terms of teams and software resources, they will optimise our response and we will reap those benefits, societally and economically.  It is incredible to me, as an individual watching this, that 11 months into the pandemic, there are only 60 public health specialists in the country, as Mr. Owens earlier outlined.  In Scotland, which has a similar population, there are 180.  That we have not addressed that and upped the numbers of public health trainees, given them proleptic appointments with consultant status at the end of it, is incredible and must be addressed.  This is not the last pandemic.  We may not even be experiencing the last surge of this one.  Until we tackle climate change, we are going to have more and more pandemics and our ability to respond to them without locking down our society is dependent on having the public health infrastructure, including the people, IT and structures.  If this committee takes just one lesson from this meeting, that is it.  It is essential.  It is what has hampered us and is a part of why we are rolling from one lockdown to another.  We do not have the public health capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabrielle Colleran"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":803,"content":"<p>I will direct my first question to everybody.  Has a deadline been set for the roll-out of vaccines for all front-line staff who are in contact with patients or potential patients?  If not, why not?<\/p> <p>  My second point relates to student nurses.  Has the emergency nature of the call to student nurses to work in extraordinary circumstances in which they would not normally have to work been established?  They are putting their health and lives at risk to a large extent.  Has the emergency nature of the need to respond been conveyed to the HSE and the Minister?  If not, why not?<\/p> <p>  How should the concerns raised today be relayed through the system to the appropriate authorities?  Delays have taken place and I understand why all of the people concerned are upset and annoyed at the delay that follows the need for action in any particular area.

We have been meeting with the HSE on a weekly basis on this matter.  As it stands, only 49,000 are fully vaccinated.  I know figures are thrown out about so many doses, so many vaccines etc., but that is the reality.  The figure I gave refers to those who have received their first and second doses.<\/p> <p>  It is nearly by chance that healthcare workers are getting the vaccines this week.  If the decision had not made regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine, healthcare workers' access to vaccines would probably be delayed until next week or the week after.  When the decision was made in regard to the over-65s and over-70s, it meant that the vaccines in question were available to healthcare workers this week.  We understand the portal is open and live today.  We understand that front-line healthcare workers began to be vaccinated yesterday and are being vaccinated today.  That refers to first doses; they will have to get a second dose in 21 to 28 days and, in the case of AstraZeneca, after a longer timeframe.  It is going to be a significant period down the line, into March and April, before those healthcare workers are fully vaccinated.  The understanding from the HSE at the moment is that by the end of February, all of those staff will have got their first doses and some of them will start getting their second doses.<\/p> <p>  I know my colleagues would like to respond on the other matters raised by Deputy Durkan but I have a couple of other points to make.  We have said all along that the vaccination portal, which is only working today, or at least we hope it is working today, was meant to be in operation from 28 December last.  Six weeks later, it has only begun working from today.  That has been a major failing on the part of the HSE in terms of its IT infrastructure.  The portal was meant to be up and running when the vaccinations were up and running.  It is clear that healthcare workers have delivered.  Nurses and doctors on the front line administering the vaccines have delivered.  They have done so across seven-day weeks and covering long hours.  Some of them have gone in voluntarily in their own time to get the vaccines rolled out.  Front-line healthcare workers have rolled up their sleeves and really delivered in that regard as well as trying to provide a Covid service and a normal healthcare service.<\/p> <p>  In regard to student nurses, the dithering that has gone on by the Minister and the Department of Health is completely unacceptable.  I am not making any political points here, because I am completely apolitical, but when the situation was bad last March and April, the former Minister made a clear decision to utilise the student nurses to allow the health service to respond to the crisis.  No one can doubt that January this year was much worse than the scenario that existed last March and April.  Why the dithering?  The Government must make the decision to utilise these valuable, skilled individuals to allow the health service to respond in a situation where we have had 7,000 to 8,000 people absent from work.<\/p> <p>  An issue that we have not focused on at all is the situation in long-term care facilities.  The reality is that we talk about the numbers in ICU and in our acute hospitals but many patients with Covid-19 are in our long-term care facilities.  Many of them are not even going to acute hospitals.  Many of them are on syringes and are receiving a high level of care at a time when staffing is decimated in those services.  We have had staff from across the public service redeploy into our long-term care facilities in order to care for those patients.  That situation has been overlooked.  It is time to start publishing the figures for Covid-19 patients in our 582 long-term care facilities as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021020900002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar Gilligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":806,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan mentioned costs to the system.

I know this full well because members of my family were involved in the healthcare sector in a number of different areas.<\/p> <p>  I will start by asking just three or four questions.  The first is to Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha.  She spoke at the very start about the failure to respond quickly enough to the demands of the nursing staff.  Nursing staff are on the front line.  They know sooner than anyone else when change is required.  I was looking at the HR report from the HSE.  There are 7,800 nurse managers.  Nurses, obviously, will go to the nurse managers.  Is it the case that nurse managers are not getting the response quickly enough from the administrative level of the HSE to make the changes that are required?<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns nurses who have retired from the system and now want to get back in.  I understand that the Nursing and Midwifery Board is looking for a fee of &euro;350 for such nurses to re-register.  Has the INMO engaged with the Nursing and Midwifery Board on this issue?  It sounds like an extremely high charge to impose on people who want to come back in and give assistance at present, when there are huge demands.<\/p> <p>  My third question concerns consultants.  We have seen the figures for the number of GPs who are due to retire over the next few years.  There are around 600.  Have we any idea of the number of medical consultants who are to retire over the next three to five years?  Are there particular areas where we do not even have people in training to fill those vacancies?  The second issue I wish to ask the consultants about concerns the number of specialist registrars who are in training at present.  What is the total number per annum across all areas who are in training?

There is not at present.  The WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, for example, were advocating that we look at the wearing of FFP2 masks for greater protection in early January.  We had to lobby the HSE and wait for a national circular from it before the practice was allowed to change across the health service.  Nurse managers gave a testimony to us that they went and sought these masks and their release to staff when they asked and they were refused.  In one location staff were threatened with disciplinary sanction if they continued to ask for those masks.  Eventually, we got a letter from the HSE which opened the door and allowed the policy change in respect of what was appropriate to wear during the third wave and, obviously, with the higher contagion of the new variant.<\/p><p>I hope that answers the Deputy's question.  It illustrates how bureaucratic the system is.  There is a significant amount of national control.<\/p><p> Health and safety measures have to be put in place much more quickly.  It cannot be a case of always waiting for an incident to occur.  Preventative measures have to be in place and thought about because this pandemic is changing all the time.  With new variants, we will need agile and quick responses to protect workers.  That is simply what is missing.<\/p><p> On the issue of the availability of staff etc., I refer to the whole area of Sl&aacute;intecare and the fact that 82% of care of older persons services are privatised.  There are many waiting lists etc., but there is 30% availability of private hospitals.

We anticipate there will be an exodus of younger consultants abroad as a result of the working conditions they are being offered here unless we sort that issue out.  In addition, workforce planning indicates that we need an increase of 51% in the number of consultants.  That equates to approximately 1,600 extra consultants needed in the system to match the current demand.

I am assistant secretary in the housing, affordability, inclusion and homelessness division in the Department.  I thank the committee for facilitating this early consideration of the affordable housing Bill, the general scheme of which was approved by the Government in December last year and which was published on 20 January this year.  I am accompanied today by colleagues who are working on affordable housing and the Bill, Robert Nicholson, principal officer and Marian O'Driscoll and Alan Smyth, assistant principal officers who work with Mr. Nicholson.  We welcome the views of the committee on the provisions contained within the general scheme and together we will try to address any questions the committee has.<\/p> <p>  I will start with an outline of the main provisions in the Bill.  The Bill is made up of three Parts and 23 heads.  The bulk of the heads deal with amendments to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Part 5 of that Act deals with affordable dwelling purchase arrangements and the provision of affordable housing led by local authorities.  The approach taken has been to seek to utilise existing provisions, where possible, to facilitate as early as possible the delivery of affordable housing for purchase by local authorities.  The Bill contains new provisions to facilitate delivery of affordable housing through new channels, such as cost rental, delivered by local authorities, approved housing bodies and the Land Development Agency, LDA.<\/p> <p>  Given the nature of affordable housing, we have sought the optimal blend of necessary facilitating measures in primary legislation, while allowing for flexible responsive requirements to be set in regulations.  Our work has been informed through engagement with key stakeholders and delivery partners, including local authorities, the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, approved housing bodies and the Land Development Agency.<\/p> <p>  To give a breakdown of the Bill, 20 heads contain amendments to the 2009 Act dealing with local authority-led affordable purchase, one broad head puts cost rental on a statutory basis, as a new form of tenure, for the first time, and one head provides for the Housing Agency to administer the new cost rental equity loans announced in budget 2021.  There is also one head to facilitate Government investment in a new national affordable purchase shared equity scheme for the purchase of private homes, which was also announced in budget 2021.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the local authority-led affordable dwelling purchase arrangements, the majority of the amendments to Part V of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 are administrative and intended to improve its operation.  Key amendments relate to the following areas.  One is assessment of purchaser eligibility, involving an amendment to the criteria to replace the current provisions with a more workable assessment regime on the basis of regulations to be made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Regarding the scheme of priority, following engagement with local authorities, it is proposed to streamline the ministerial power to make regulations to cover the issues such as the suitability of the home for the eligible household, the length of time a person has been living in the administrative area and the time of application.  Rather than lapsing after a charging period, an amendment is proposed to allow the local authority charge or its equity stake on the property to remain in place until bought out by the household.  This charge or equity stake would become enforceable by the local authority on a breach of the agreement or at the end of a given period to accommodate the senior mortgage maturity.<\/p><p>In respect of the Land Development Agency, a new section is proposed to allow for affordable purchase of homes provided by the LDA to local authority eligible and priority households.  <\/p><p> Other key provisions cover the cost rental scheme.  For the first time, a legal definition of a cost rental tenancy will be provided.  The Minister will be given the power to designate cost rental tenancies and ensure that the rent is set at a cost-covering level, including cost elements to be prescribed in regulations.  The head also sets out the manner in which rents for a cost rental tenancy may be increased each year to ensure they remain stable in real terms, while continuing to cover costs.  The head contains provision to allow for the setting of eligibility criteria for entering a cost rental tenancy, and the Minister would be given the power to set household income thresholds by regulation.  The head also clarifies that cost rental tenancies are a new tenure and confirms it is not a social housing support.  Cost rental tenancies will generally be subject to the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Acts, with a number of exceptions to provide even greater security of tenure to households.<\/p><p> In respect of the amendment to the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971, the proposed amendment will allow the Housing Agency to administer the new cost rental equity loan scheme.<\/p><p> Finally, on the issue of affordable privately provided housing, the proposed amendment will allow for the contribution of funds towards a special purpose vehicle to purchase an equity stake in homes for affordable housing provision.  The head sets out what the terms of a memorandum of agreement may provide for, including purchaser eligibility, types of dwellings, charges that may be applied, etc.<\/p><p> The provisions contained in the Bill, subject to their progression through the legislative process, will help provide the legal basis for the delivery of more affordable homes to eligible households under each of the programmes outlined during this year and beyond.  Importantly, these measures will not operate in isolation.  In parallel, and to help respond to housing affordability challenges, a broader range of longer term and complementary measures are in place or are being developed in line with programme for Government commitments.  Taken together, they will represent a significant and expanding level of interventions to support affordable housing provision.  We welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee on the provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":829,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinlan and his team for all of the work they have done on this Bill.  It is most important legislation and I am delighted we have an opportunity to scrutinise it.<\/p> <p>  A major chunk of affordable housing will obviously come from the new builds that will be delivered by the local authorities, the LDA and the approved housing bodies, AHBs.  That is most welcome.  I am fully supportive of the commitment to a new housing plan this summer.  I appreciate that the national development plan has to be reviewed and that takes a bit of time, but the new housing plan is important.  I ask Mr. Quinlan to provide us with an update on how it is progressing.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of the serviced sites fund, from the numbers I have seen, there is funding for more than 6,000 units, at least in the initial stage.  The local infrastructure fund is also key.  It is very important for unlocking land and for the building of affordable homes.  Will Mr. Quinlan give the committee an indication of the number of units that can potentially be funded through the local infrastructure fund?  In respect of the cost rental scheme, I know 400 units will be provided.  The affordable rental scheme will make affordable rental an option for the first time in the history of the State.  The three AHBs have been announced.  Will there be a second round of announcements for cost rental later this year?  While the scheme is very welcome, we would like to see it scaled up.  What are the Department's plans in that regard?<\/p> <p>  I apologise for not raising the purchase of affordable housing under Part V earlier.  I am going backwards.  Affordable housing purchase under Part V was abolished by a former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, in 2011.<\/p><p>What is the Department's thinking on reinstating that as an option?  <\/p><p> On the shared equity scheme, I understand that regulations have to set the eligibility criteria.  It is my understanding that those eligible will be people who do not qualify for social housing because their income is marginally above the social housing income thresholds.  Can Mr. Quinlan confirm that?  Will having a local connection be part of the regulations?<\/p><p> On the issue of repayments, having spoken to people in Dublin about this, some of them estimate they could potentially save &euro;11,000 per year.

On the new housing plan, the Minister has signalled his intent to have that ready in the summer.  Work has commenced on it.  It will be a cross-government plan.  Within the Department, the teams are in place to review Rebuilding Ireland and to prepare the information, etc., for the new plan.  That work is under way with a timeline of the summer.  At the same time, the review of the national development plan is under way.  Again, the Department is inputting into that in terms of future investment in social, affordable and other forms of housing on a multi-annual basis.<\/p> <p>  With maximum funding of &euro;50,000 available per home, around 6,200 homes could be facilitated under the serviced sites fund.  So far, more than 3,000 homes have been facilitated across 14 different local authorities on the basis of the &euro;50,000 maximum funding.  To date, around half of the fund has been approved in principle.  The Minister has approved a number of sites more recently, including St. Michael's and other sites in Dublin.  <\/p> <p>  On the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, I will bring in my colleague, Mr. Nicholson, when I have responded to the other questions.  <\/p> <p>  On Part V, a review was signalled as an objective in the programme for Government.  It has been carried out by the Housing Agency and is now under consideration in the Department.  Again, depending on what changes come about as a result of that, there will be an impact on affordable housing plans going forward.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of the local authority equity scheme and the eligibility piece on that, the plan is to change that from what is currently in the 2009 Act to a more workable solution which will be based on individual ability to buy a home.  It is trying to link the eligibility in terms of income to an individual's ability to buy the home that is available from the local authority.  The local connection piece is a simplification, more broadly, in respect of who would be eligible.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of repayments, the overall objective of the equity schemes we are bringing forward is that people will own their homes.  They are help-to-buy schemes.  Therefore, the sooner people can buy out the equity share and own their homes in full, depending on how house prices go, the sooner it can be of benefit to people.  That is an objective.  In other schemes and in international comparison, we have seen significant buy-out in the first five years, so that people own their homes fully.<\/p> <p>  With the Chair's agreement, I will ask Mr. Nicholson to respond on the LIHAF.<\/p><p>Could Mr. Nicholson please cover the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":833,"content":"<p>As the members will know, the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, was a scheme introduced in 2017 with &euro;200 million to fund 20 large infrastructure programmes around the country.  Those programmes intended to deliver approximately 20,000 social, more affordable and private homes.  To the end of 2020, based on incomplete data - we are still looking for figures - approximately 2,703 were homes delivered.  Of those, 1,129 had some form of cost reduction and 251 were social.  The rest were private.  Everyone accepts that the local infrastructure housing activation Fund, LIHAF, delivered more slowly than anticipated originally.  That is largely because they are very complex infrastructure programmes and take quite a deal of time.  Delivery is beginning to significantly ramp up.  We saw an announcement by Cork City Council yesterday that it was going to tender for 600 homes in Old Whitechurch Road.<\/p> <p>  What we are seeing around the country in respect of the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, programme, where the infrastructure comes first and the housing comes thereafter, local authorities tendering for the delivery of housing.

It has been confirmed that two of the 30 will not progress based on local authority decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Nicholson"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":834,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Quinlan for the presentation and the work on the legislation.  This is approximately two and a half years in gestation under two Governments, so I do not envy Mr. Quinlan and his team's difficulties in this regard.  It is also important to point out that the serviced sites fund of &euro;300 million was to deliver those 6,200 homes by the end of 2021.  That was the ministerial commitment on the D&aacute;il record.  Only &euro;2 million of it had been drawn down by December of last year.  While &euro;50 million has been allocated in budget 2021, that would only deliver 1,000 homes.  While they would be very welcome, those 1,000 homes are not under construction.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the serviced sites fund, how many units of accommodation, including the 50 cost rentals on Enniskerry Road, will be completed in 2021?  There will be 390 through the cost rental equity loan, but how many will be delivered and completed under the serviced sites fund this year?<\/p> <p>  Many of us were surprised there was not more detail in the legislation on the eligibility criteria for the serviced sites fund and the cost rental programme.  Will the Minister and the Department consider releasing the draft regulations in parallel with the Bill, when it comes before us?  All members would like to know, when we are debating and voting on the Bill in the D&aacute;il later this year, who will be eligible and within what income and what will be the criteria.  Publication of draft regulations would be very useful.<\/p> <p>  Is it significant that the income eligibility criteria in terms of percentage of household income has been removed and replaced by mortgage criteria for the serviced sites fund?  Why is there no consideration of clear income-related criteria for what one is paying back on the mortgage for the serviced sites fund and on the rent as opposed to market discount considerations?<\/p> <p>   I refer to the shared equity loan.  I will not bore people with my strong opposition to it.  People know our party's position.  Can Mr. Quinlan confirm what the entry level interest will be from year six or at least what the range is between what the Department wants, 1.5%, and the 3% proposed by the Banking and Payment Federation Ireland?  Can Mr. Quinlan confirm that the interest will increase over time and if the proposition is to index link it to something such as inflation or have a step stair ladder?  <\/p> <p>  Can Mr. Quinlan clarify how the shared equity loan will relate to the help to buy scheme?  The Minister indicated one would get some level of help to buy to combine with that.  Can Mr. Quinlan clarify whether or not the shared equity loan can be combined with the serviced sites fund in an affordable purchase with the Land Development Agency or a local authority?<\/p> <p>  I have other questions, so I ask that I be put on the list for the third round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#E00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":835,"content":"<p>I will bring Mr. Nicholson in again at the end on the detail on the serviced sites fund.<\/p><p>Regarding the regulations, I will bring that back.  I can see exactly where the Deputy is coming from on that.  There is a move to move it.  As I said, it is the optimal in primary and regulations.  The rationale for that is really around operations.  We have had much interaction with local authorities in terms of people being able to access mortgages and so on in order to be able to buy.  I take the Deputy's point that they are extremely important so I will bring that back.  It is a fair point so we will endeavour to try to do that.<\/p><p> Regarding the change itself, it is very much linked, as I mentioned at the outset, to individual affordability and what is affordable for an individual in terms of buying a home that a local authority can make available.  There are many inputs into that but it ends up with an individual who we want to help to buy and a local authority-led unit that it is able to deliver.  There is much discussion around costs and so on and the Department is again looking at those closely following the SCSI report.  The lower one can get the unit cost of delivery then people will be able to buy.  We are trying to get the best value and the lowest cost for homes that are to be provided for purchase and rental.<\/p><p> Regarding the individual, it is very much targeted towards people who would not qualify or be eligible for social housing but would have an affordability difficulty in being able to buy or rent a home.  That is the general approach we are taking in trying to make units affordable for individual households.  We found that the legislation, as drafted, made it difficult, particularly when the macro-prudential rules came in after the 2009 Act.  In fact, one could have a situation where somebody is eligible but is not able to access the mortgage required to buy the home.  It is really about being able to operate in practice.<\/p><p> The final question was around the shared equity scheme.  The Government decided to fund that for this year so that units could be delivered.  That had to be done in budget 2021.  I, along with Mr. Nicholson and the team, are mandated to work with other stakeholders.  We work closely with the Department of Finance and the retail banks and engage with Homes England and others on various schemes.  As regards the detail of that, much work has gone on and much interaction has happened.  However, at this stage we have not brought those final proposals to the Minister for agreement in terms of interest rates, how they might change over time and the interaction with the help-to-buy scheme.  The proposals are very developed and we want the scheme introduced as early as possible this year, so we will be bringing them to the Minister in the next number of weeks, but they are just not quite there yet.  They are ongoing.<\/p><p> As regards interaction with the LDA, with the publication of the LDA Bill, we work very closely with the LDA in a number of ways on what it can do.  It is very important that it understands the various schemes as they are developed and rolled out.  We are making sure it does and will engage with the schemes.  We facilitate as much as possible in the Bill that the LDA can participate with local authorities and others in delivery of the units under the various measures.<\/p><p> I will bring Mr. Nicholson in on the specifics of the serviced site fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":837,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Nicholson to come back in at a later stage to answer those questions for Deputy &Oacute; Broin.

The legislation is a long time in gestation.  It is very welcome that the area is being prioritised.  If we are honest, it is probably an area that has not received a massive amount of attention as the focus has been on social housing.  The social housing output has been increasing considerably.  It takes a long time to deliver houses.  We cannot magic them out of thin air.  It takes a lot of foundations being filled and building blocks to put them all in place.  It is all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  On the schemes and who they are targeted at.  The legislation focuses on first-time buyers, but there is a cohort of people who lost homes at the start of the economic crisis, before we introduced fantastic schemes such as mortgage-to-rent and the changes to personal insolvency.  They have been stuck paying very high rents in recent years with no prospect of getting back on the ladder because they are unable to get a commercial mortgage again.  Is there provision in the legislation to enable us to cater for those people and families?  There are specific clauses in the case of marital breakdown but my point is more specifically related to those who lost homes at the start of the crisis.<\/p> <p>  The applications to the cost rental equity loan, CREL, scheme were oversubscribed.  What is the situation with the other applications?  Are we prioritising the other applications that were not successful?  The Minister announced schemes in Dublin and Cork yesterday but schemes were submitted for other urban areas, including Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  Can we prioritise those so that they can commence construction before the year end to deliver cost rental units early in 2022 rather than wait until the end of the year to get them going?<\/p> <p>  There has been considerable public criticism about the equity scheme for the provision of affordable homes in private estates.  Will the officials comment on this, specifically on the argument that it will result in cost inflation?  What has the Department stitched in to ensure that will not be the case?  I understand there are specific provisions to prevent the cost inflation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#G00100","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":839,"content":"<p>On eligibility and priority, we have heard a lot of feedback on how society has changed and on the need for schemes to be able to cater for new household formation.  As the Senator observed, there is some allowance for marital breakdown.  We can consider further eligibility criteria.  Predominantly, these schemes are aimed at first-time buyers.  Capacity in output is limited but we would welcome the committee's feedback on targeting schemes beyond first-time buyers.<\/p> <p>  On the cost rental equity loan scheme, the Minister announced the first 400 units today, which will be the first cost rental units in the State, in the Enniskerry Road development, which is led by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  That scheme was oversubscribed.<\/p><p>As Senator Cummins said, there are a number of other very good proposals within that, and I am in discussion with the Minister regarding them.  I think he would be minded to try to support other proposals if possible.  I think the intention would be to try to do that if we could, but at the moment it is fully subscribed.  The &euro;35 million that was allocated in budget 2021 has been fully allocated and is supported by a further &euro;100 million in loan financing from the Housing Finance Agency.<\/p><p> The shared equity scheme is a market-based scheme.  It is one element of the affordable proposals coming forward.  It is designed to try to boost affordability and to help people to buy in the immediate term.  As well as boosting realisable demand in the short term, it would lead to a future increased supply of housing, but that will not happen unless the people who can buy the homes are there.<\/p><p> We have done a significant amount of research on this, dealing with our own internal stakeholders in Ireland like the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, and we also met Homes England.  We discussed in detail the experience in the UK, which was that the National Audit Office found that it did not hugely inflate prices on a like-for-like basis in terms of buying the same home before or after the scheme and it did lead to an increase in supply.  As I said to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, we are working on the final details of the scheme.  We very much take those points on board.  They are the key risks in a scheme like this.  We are trying to work through the detail of the scheme to mitigate those types of risk in terms of putting a cap on the price of the homes that could be bought to ensure to the greatest extent possible that we mitigate against inflation.  We have seen and heard that criticism and we have taken it on board as an important piece of feedback.

It is great to see them back before the committee.  I wish to focus on the affordable house purchasing scheme.  I will to refer to an article I read recently in the <i>Business Post<\/i>.  It raised a number of questions in which I have a particular interest and I will tee up my questions around the article.<\/p><p>The main points relate to the potential breach of the Central Bank mortgage rules, the potential to drive up house prices, and the potential to increase personal debt.  They were the three issues discussed in the article.  I will tee them up as four or five questions.  What assurances have been given or sought from the Central Bank that it will approve the scheme?  If not, why not?  What evidence or data does the Department have to ensure that the scheme will not increase property prices, given that we know it will do nothing to increase the supply of houses?  Will the witnesses outline for us precisely what the buyer's responsibility is in relation to the State's equity share?  That is an important issue that has been raised.  How will councils be funded for their affordable purchases?  That is also an important issue.  What risk will councils carry?<\/p><p>I want to touch on recent statements in the media which refer to a costs-based model but then refer to it as a scheme, which will offer rents at 25% below the discount.  Either it is a costs-based model or one which is based on reduced market prices.  Those are a few questions I would like the Department to address.<\/p><p> I have two comments also.  The scheme involves the buyer paying the State's equity stake in due course and it could be argued that he or she is not really getting an affordable home but will carry a burden of debt that may be more than he or she can manage, and that is something that has to be addressed.<\/p><p> It would be also good to know what data and model the Department has studied on a similar scheme, design or type of project.  Apparently, in the UK, there was some success but it drove up the cost of property.  I would like to hear the Department's views on that.  I heard that the Minister suggested that this was not the case but let us hear the evidence around that.<\/p><p> Those are my few points.  I would like to give my time to hear the answers rather than to me to keep talking on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#H00500","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  In terms of the shared equity scheme and the Central Bank, we are working with the Department of Finance and, as I mentioned earlier, the various stakeholders.  In terms of the engagement with the Central Bank to date, that has been led by the Department of Finance.  While the Central Bank has made some comments so far, it really needs to see the full details of the scheme to be able to make its final informed judgment.  We are working towards that but we are keeping them informed through the Department of Finance, particularly around the policy objectives of what we are trying to do, which is to help people to buy their own homes sooner than they would have been able to otherwise but, ultimately, to own their full home in as affordable a way as possible.  The Central Bank also needs to see the final details to be able to make their final judgment on it.<\/p> <p>  As for house prices and supply, and the international evidence, I will make a couple of points.  We have looked at the reports from the UK.  I mentioned the UK National Audit Office and it reported a double-digit increase of 14.5% in supply and a 1% increase in prices.  They were very much on a like-for-like basis.  There were some other reports but the National Audit Office report was the one that we looked at in particular.  We also met Homes England, which administers that scheme.  In the UK, more than 200,000 homes have been delivered under its equity scheme.  It is a very big scheme.  It has some differences.  We have been closely examining it in terms of what worked and perhaps elements of it that did not.  We are very much looking at both of them.<\/p> <p>  In terms of supply, the Ministry is engaged regularly with home suppliers in Ireland.  One issue in this regard is that we have a lot of planning permissions.  There were 47,000 approvals last year and only half of those commenced.  Our sense is that if we can help people to increase realisable demand, the supply will follow.  Obviously, some of that remains to be seen.  The plan would be to review the scheme after a year to make sure, for instance, that it was increasing supply etc., to check for inflation, to safeguard on those.  A lot of work has gone in to inform the development of the scheme and then there are safeguards in terms of the final details.  I mentioned some of those, such as price caps etc. that we are working in.  It is only when we have the final detail of the scheme that people will be able to fully judge it.<\/p> <p>  As for the equity stake, the plan is that people would secure a mortgage to be able to buy a large percentage of the home and then be helped to buy that final element and that the State would take an equity stake, either through local authorities or central government, and the person would buy back that stake and own his or her home fully.  In the UK model, 50% of households bought out the equity stake within the first five years when there was no interest rate on it.  At the cheapest that one could, many people got in and bought their stake.<\/p><p>Consequently, the participants were really helped to buy.  They got in and they got to own 100% of the home quite quickly.  We are looking at all of those issues.  We have tried to bring them all together in the design of the scheme here.<\/p><p> In terms of local authorities and funding, the serviced sites fund was mentioned earlier.  That is currently available to local authorities to support enabling infrastructure that can then go on to be contributed towards the delivery of affordable homes for purchase or rental.  That is a multi-annual scheme as it is but we are looking at it in the context of issues such as the review of the national development plan, NDP, and how the Exchequer might be able to support local authorities in the delivery of affordable housing moving forward.  The serviced sites fund is available already with up to &euro;50,000 per affordable home delivered.<\/p><p> The cost rental model is new to Ireland.  The way the homes announced today will be delivered is through State support, in terms of the cost rental equity loan up to 30%.  That is capital at the start to support the approved housing body to be able to acquire the homes.  The Housing Finance Agency has provided long-term low-cost lending to match that in order that the AHBs are able to acquire the homes.  By minimising costs, we are able to achieve - this was the minimum - 25% below market rents.  It is really a cost minimisation model whereby those savings are passed on to the renters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":848,"content":"<p>We are out of time on that slot but we can return to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#K00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":849,"content":"<p>That is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Quinlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinlan for the comprehensive reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#K00400","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":851,"content":"<p>On the cost rental aspects, if I could come in on head 22, there is a term in it, \"equity return\".

In the first instance, most of these developments would be explicitly on balance sheet and in some way subvented by the State.  That, obviously, has a particular limitation in terms of the amount of funds that might be made available.  What we want to do over the longer term is get proof of concept as to how the model works and then introduce, and make it attractive, to the likes of international pension schemes.  At the same time, we want to put a limit on what those returns might be in order to prevent the resulting impact on rents and the required level of cost rents.  Typically, internationally, there would be an allowance for a level of return and pension funds might look for 3% or 4% return on their level of investment.  What we are trying to do in the legislation is to provide for the Minister, in the future, to put a cap or regulation on what that level of return might be to expand beyond purely the State sector into private finance such as international pension funds to deliver much greater numbers at scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Nicholson"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":855,"content":"<p>What is built into this legislation to prevent a profit-driven motive in the provision of cost rental?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#K00900","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":856,"content":"<p>It is intended that the Minister would set regulations for costs, which would be allowed to be considered for cost rents.

In the case of the CREL, that would be the Housing Agency, and these loans would be vetted for accuracy and maintained then over a long time.  When we identify the total costs involved in a development, therefore, we can then see what is coming out the other end in respect of the number of units being made available and the level of rent which must be set in those units to repay those identified costs.  It is really an open book scenario, where designation for cost rental requires the provision of proof that all regulations have been adhered to etc.<\/p> <p>  As I said, the equity aspect is more a longer-term element in respect of trying to harness the private sector after we get proof of concept for all the ongoing projects.  It is effectively, though, a case of trying to set the scene for that to happen.  We will learn the best way of doing this as we go through CREL and some of the Land Development Agency units.  We are working with the European Investment Bank, EIB, now on some of this material, and a report is due relatively shortly on the optimum financing model for cost rental.

We were doing significant work on it ourselves and with the Housing Agency.  We would have measures that would bring affordability in the medium to longer term, and what we were looking at from a policy perspective was whether one could boost supply in the short term on the basis of it being a demand-led scheme designed to turn potential demand into realisable demand and through that process then to boost supply.  It would give assurances to the construction sector that if it builds homes that they would actually be sold.  When we look at the planning permissions that have turned to commencements and been sold, they are based on a certainty around demand, whether that is demand from the private sector in terms of purchase or from the State in terms of social housing, student housing and other housing.  The housing that has worked to deliver the supply tends to be based on a high certainty of demand.  That linkage was a key policy consideration.<\/p><p> Significant analysis has been carried out.  That is very much part of the deliberative process at the moment.  The Minister has yet to finalise his proposals in terms of the underlying detail of the scheme.

I can only see a reference to a price premium of 1%, which is a totally different thing from price inflation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#M00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I do not have that report in front of me now, but I will get back to the Deputy on it.  In terms of that point, we are very sensitive to this, and the last thing we would want to do is increase house prices and not have an impact on supply.  That is not the intent.  We discussed this in detail when we spoke to representatives of Homes England.  They are the people who have delivered this scheme and Homes England has supported home purchase to the tune of more than 200,000 in the UK.<\/p><p>Their sense of it was that when the same unit is compared - a person buying a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Dublin, for example, where the median price at present is around &euro;355,000 - the person buying the same unit supported by the scheme did not see any significant inflation on that unit.  That is the feedback we received directly from Homes England when we spoke to its representatives.<\/p><p> However, there are many homes in it and many different things, so it must be safeguarded.  We have made this point to home builders in Ireland who have looked for this scheme.  Many of them did and said that supply would respond to the realisable demand.  We have received many assurances, and some of them would be large plcs and so forth, that they would be willing to show that there was no price inflation if a scheme like this was put in place.  That would be very important.  As I said earlier, the plan would be that the scheme would be reviewed after perhaps a year of operation just to safeguard that those unintended consequences had not occurred.<\/p><p> What the scheme is designed to do is to boost realisable or actual demand.  We are hearing that, given the house prices we have for new homes, particularly in places such as Dublin, people are being approved but perhaps not approved for a sufficient mortgage to be able to buy those homes.  That is really the policy intent and we are going to put in every safeguard we can to the detailed design of the scheme, and then we, along with other stakeholders, are going to monitor the scheme's operation very carefully.

There was mention earlier about the families who are trapped in the middle.  These families cannot get on the social housing list because they earn too much and they cannot get a mortgage from a bank because they are not earning enough.  We must deliver affordable housing for these people, because they are trapped and have been waiting.  There has been talk about an affordable housing scheme for years, but we could be looking at months if not years more before this delivers houses.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise a point on which Mr. Quinlan or Mr Nicholson can respond.  Cork City Council owes &euro;36 million on unsold affordable houses from the previous downturn.  It also owes &euro;36 million on land it purchased to build social and affordable houses.  Cork City Council, alone, owes at least &euro;72 million.<\/p><p>If the council owes that, I imagine most other local authorities have similar debts for either unsold social or affordable housing and land that they purchased to build housing.  We want this to continue, but how can local authorities move ahead when they have this large debt hanging over them?<\/p><p> Can we get more clarity about the criteria for how people will qualify?  Then there are the issues of what affordable houses will be, because I am from Cork and, obviously, Cork will be different from Dublin, Limerick and Galway.  We need affordable housing that will work for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#N00900","speaker":"1453","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":878,"content":"<p>In the first instance, we work closely with Cork City Council.  The council has been to the fore in trying to deliver affordable housing, and we work closely with the team there on Boherboy and other sites.  Boherboy will be one of the first sites that will come forward for affordable purchase under the new scheme.  In addition, a great deal of support will be given to the council under the serviced sites fund and under LIHAF, as Mr. Nicholson mentioned earlier.  One part of trying to help councils is the Exchequer funding towards delivery.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point regarding unsold affordable housing.  It is not universal.  There is quite a rump in Cork, but it was not the same everywhere.  Part of that was because it was a very successful scheme there and there were many units.  Obviously, when circumstances changed, the situation with those units changed.  As I understand it, they are predominantly used at present for social housing, so they are being utilised for an important purpose.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  I also take the Deputy's point about land.  Again, land was generally bought by local authorities on the basis of it then being used for social or affordable housing.  As things turned, some local authorities were left with land debt and land that was not capable of being developed at the time.  A large amount of that land has now been worked through the various programmes in terms of social housing and so forth.  There are some lands left.  We also had the land aggregation scheme, which helped local authorities with the debt issue.  There are some local authorities left that have significant land debt and no immediate pathway for the development of those lands for financial reasons.  We are working on that with the CCMA at national level, so we are trying to work through some of those issues.  However, I take the Deputy's point about them being legacy issues in the sector.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Nicholson to respond on the point about eligibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Quinlan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":879,"content":"<p>As we said, the detailed criteria have to be finalised, but we can give the shape of our thinking.  On both affordable purchase schemes, it is intended that they would be targeted at those who can afford the home with the equity stake.  If one is in a position where one can afford any home that is made available, depending on the area, through a standard mortgage, one is not eligible.  If someone is on an income level where he or she cannot afford to buy that home and it is a home that is suitable for his or her needs - they are all modest - he or she is in the space of being eligible, if the equity stake that is available can bridge the gap.  They are the general criteria.  Measures on affordability can be very blunt instruments if one gives a straight percentage, so what we suggest is that we try to develop the schemes around the individual.  We say affordability is not a question of how much, but how much is too much for whom and in what circumstances.  That is the broad model we are trying to use in the affordable purchase schemes.<\/p> <p>  On cost-rental, again the criteria are not finalised, but the likely lower threshold will be those who are not eligible for social housing, somewhere around the space of middle income earners just over the gap.  We have not fixed on the higher threshold.  Obviously, it is going to be informed by the ultimate rents, and the rents are informed by the cost of construction and the level of subvention provided.  However, we can explicitly say that it will be hard-pushed middle income earners.<\/p> <p>  I wish to clarify the affordable purchase scheme and some of the references earlier to the UK.  It is important to say that the affordable purchase scheme, at present, would probably only assume approximately 1% of the transactions in the market, and perhaps a little above.<\/p><p>Compared to some of the other schemes it is relatively low in terms of its capacity to impact on inflation more broadly.  If it is only 1% of housing transactions per year or a little over, it is relatively low.  I can comment more on the UK scheme in terms of the 1% figure.  The people referenced were explicit around the inflationary effect being 1%.  In fact, when they looked at it in detail, they referred to some of the other published reports that analysed the help-to-buy scheme.  They commented that those reports referred to inflation rates of between 5% and 20%.  They looked specifically at those reports and found that the estimates did not compare similar properties and so did not accurately assess any additional premium paid by those using the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Nicholson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":881,"content":"<p>We have reached the end of this time slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#P00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I am sorry we cut off Mr. Nicholson.

That is totally correct given the experience so many of us have had at local authority and Government level with property developers in the past, perhaps with unfinished housing estates and the property market generally.  It will be critical for us to get the information to give us a certain comfort level.  When we get the detail of the scheme, it will put us all in a different position.  I hope that when we get the EIB report, it will help us all as well.<\/p> <p>  A report from the London School of Economics is referenced.  One of our concerns as parliamentarians is that there is no one source of information on the EU scheme that has not been in some way criticised.  Of course, that is natural because that is what happens when governments bring in schemes.  One statement Mr. Nicholson made that stuck with me was the reference to hard-pushed middle-income earners.  This question is one all of us on the committee are here to help to resolve.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Quinlan has gone through with much detail the schemes we have been focused on, namely, the cost rental and shared equity schemes.  I have two quick questions on each of these.  Will Mr. Quinlan give a little more information around why HAP tenants are excluded from cost-rental?  Again, there is a push to try to get to the middle-income earner who might otherwise be caught in the private rental trap.  Will Mr. Quinlan give us a little more information around how the long-term tenure leases are going to be built into schemes?  What level of information is available at this stage?<\/p> <p>  My next question is on the shared equity scheme.  Is it possible for Mr. Quinlan to spell out the &euro;75 million that has been allocated?  How will that be drawn down? When will it be available to be drawn down?  What is it likely to yield in terms of house buyers and home buyers who would be able, hopefully, to afford their own homes?  Is there information around how the cap will be determined at local authority level?  When will that information be announced?<\/p> <p>  That is important from my perspective.

I will comment on cost rental generally.  This is a point I made at the start in terms of social housing and HAP.  We really want to distinguish cost rental in particular at the outset as a new form of tenure.  What is proposed is that this will not be social housing at the start.  It will be separate and distinct and more targeted at the squeezed middle, the people who do not qualify for social housing but who have affordability challenges.  At the outset, that is important to note.  We have put in a safeguard so that if a person's circumstances change, and after a period he or she goes from private cost rental on to social housing where the rent was being paid through HAP, then it would be facilitated so that the person would not necessarily lose the tenancy.  That is an important element of it.  At the outset, we want the scheme designated for the people it is targeted at, which is a different cohort.<\/p><p>That is the rationale behind that.<\/p><p> There was a question about the &euro;75 million.  It was an important signal of intent for the Government and the Minister in budget 2021.  It has given momentum and impetus to us in our work in trying to design the scheme and have it operational this year.  It will depend on the amount of equity stake that the State would take in an individual property.  It depends on how many home buyers can be supported.  The scope is in the thousands.  We see it beginning this year in the low thousands or perhaps hundreds - these are the numbers.  As Mr. Nicholson said, that is the scope generally contemplated for the scheme at the moment.  It is a targeted, immediate measure to boost realisable demand and supply in the short to medium term.  A good deal of planning permission has not commenced.  Mr. Nicholson may wish to address the other technical question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":885,"content":"<p>I will comment on a couple of items.  Deputy Higgins asked about the shared equity scheme.  What we are informing ourselves with around eligibility is effectively the first-time buyer new home median price for the past rolling 12 months.  We are informing ourselves by geographic area.  We are trying to ensure that development happens in the places where we want development.<\/p> <p>  I will bring in the point again around the suggestion that there are no income caps.  By virtue of the handbrake of requiring that individuals avail of full eligible mortgages under the macroprudential rules, house price caps are set.  If a buyer can afford a house at normal market prices, the buyer will not be eligible for the scheme.  That is a fairly significant difference from the scheme in the UK.  There is a handbrake relating to income caps and those income caps are discrete to the individual.<\/p> <p>  Again, the national planning framework influenced price caps.  We intend to ensure that we have developments in the areas where we want them and that we do not have sprawl whenever we can prevent it.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to the cost rental question.  A question was asked about HAP tenants.  Effectively, there is a limited available budget for particular measures.  Cost rental is explicitly targeted at earners, people who have the capacity to cover the cost rent and cover the development over the long term.  Then, as it matures, it becomes more beneficial to the ultimate renter and more sustainable.  That is the reason for the provision, in short.<\/p> <p>  There is also an element of ensuring we have a good blend of tenants across social, cost rental, private, affordable and whatever it may be.  Indeed, some of the cost rental programmes we are working on will be approved.  The 390 units referenced yesterday are in developments where there will also be social tenants.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on leases and the types of leases.  We are working off security of tenure.  Again, we will learn from this as we go in the roll-out of the cost rental equity loan.  Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act provides long-term tenure for individuals.  Typically, six-year leases would be the intent.  Again, we will learn from that and it is our opening gambit in terms of ensuring we can get these schemes up and running and in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Nicholson"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":886,"content":"<p>If we have a moment left, perhaps Mr. Nicholson would finish the point he was making to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan on the UK schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#Q00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":887,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Callaghan was referring to the premium in the UK schemes.

Straight up, there is a new-build premium for new-build homes as opposed to second-hand homes purely based on efficiency and the increased standards that have come in over the years.  It did not relate to an inflationary effect.  The report referred to house inflation in the round over a long period when it referred to the higher percentage rather than house inflation for homes that were bought with an equity stake as compared to equivalent homes that were bought without an equity stake.  Our reading of it, backed up by our conversations with officials in the UK, was that there was a like-for-like increase of 1%.

In some ways, that gives me an opportunity to reflect on some of the suggestions being made, in particular members of the committee who are in opposition.  Effectively, what the affordable housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill are doing is giving tools to local authorities to develop mixed-income and mixed-tenure estates for the first time in a long time.  Significant amounts of public money have been put in to allow land owned by local authorities to be developed.   Where that is not possible, the LDA has been given the opportunity to develop other public lands.<\/p> <p>  Part of the issue is that it is a significant departure to allow public lands be developed for public housing.  Part of the reason some Opposition members are focusing on the shared equity purchase loan, which forms a very small part of the Bill, is that it is a significant departure and a substantial attempt by the State to provide affordability.  The shared equity loan scheme accounts for 2% of the total housing budget for next year.  On the affordability element, the elements not related to that scheme account for 84% of the total spending to provide affordability.  In reality, the shared equity scheme is a short-term measure with a review clause and regional price caps, which is limited to first-time buyers and is not comparable to the UK scheme, yet much of the debate on the Bill has focused on that rather than on the 84% of spending that provides affordability.  <\/p> <p>  My questions are on managing delivery because local authorities now have no excuses to fail to develop lands in their control.  They cannot now argue that mixed-income or mixed-tenure is not provided for, that the financial models are not there or that it is not on a statutory footing.

It is actually very timely.  We recently met the CCMA, whom we meet all the time, regarding the publication of the Bill in particular.  The feedback we are getting is that, as was mentioned throughout the discussion today, affordable housing is in significant demand across council chambers, particularly in the greater Dublin area and other cities where housing affordability is an important issue.  My sense is that local authorities are absolutely committed to delivering and being the key delivery partner and facilitator of affordable housing.  We are now working through that with them, building on the pipeline that is there in the serviced sites fund.  We are working on that with reference to what could be delivered over several years.  Much of that is being factored in to the work we are doing on the Minister's detailed housing for all plan, which will, as I stated, come on stream in the summer, while, in parallel, looking at the funding streams.

As the Deputy stated, it will also be increasingly important for the LDA to be able to aggregate land, including public land, and develop into the future in that regard.

At the outset, cost rental is designed to be a completely new form of tenure rather than just being market-based private rental sector, PRS.  Whatever safeguards are needed within the legislation for that to be clear will be provided.  As Mr. Nicholson outlined earlier, the intention is very much to be clear to funders about the level of returns that will be tolerated.  The intention is to put the shape on that.  As the rents are so linked to the costs, it is critical that the allowable costs are clearly defined.  Whatever is needed to be clear in that regard will be provided and we will definitely take the feedback from the committee into account.<\/p> <p>  I might bring in Mr. Nicholson on the longer-term financing piece around cost rental.  Part of that relates to the Vienna model.  We have given the Vienna model a significant amount of consideration.  It really is an incredible model, not just because the cost rental there is so effective, but it is often voted as one of the best places in the world in which to live.  Much of that has to do with the fact that they got housing right to a large extent.  It is a very successful model, but the authorities there have been pursuing it for a long time.  As such, there is a significant amount of stock for which the costs would have been divvied up.  The front-end costs would have reduced over time.  There is a whole piece around the long-term sustainable financing element.<\/p><p>It is possible when one builds up scale over time.  The income from the cost rental projects will allow for the funding of new projects.  I will bring Mr. Nicholson in later on that point.<\/p><p> In regard to the shared equity scheme and supply, the concept is a simple one at its base in that, as I said, supply tends to respond to demand, but a realisable rather than theoretical demand.  In terms of the launch of various schemes, there are schemes around Dublin that are delivering, but not the types of numbers that we need to be able to reach the output levels that we require.  The proposal is that to the greatest extent possible we seek to facilitate people to buy those new units.  As mentioned by Mr. Nicholson, these are, or can be, more costly units because much of the time they are premium units built under the new standards.  The median price in Dublin for a first-time buyer is approximately &euro;355,000.  As I said, the objective is to facilitate more people to buy and realise their homeownership sooner.  As supply responds to realisable demand - also known as definite demand - the response would come.  The supply response is capable of being delivered because the planning permissions are in place.  There are schemes that are delivering.  We will deliver 21,000 homes this year.  The estimated need is approximately 33,000 homes per year, so there is a gap.  We are trying to bridge that gap by bringing realisable demand to the market.  <\/p><p> I will bring in Mr. Nicholson at this point to address the longer-term financing piece around cost rental.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":898,"content":"<p>We looked at the Vienna model.  We had its regulations translated to inform us and we also spoke to the relevant people.  The Vienna model has a couple of different delivery streams.  Broadly speaking, it allows for a return of approximately 3.5%, in the same way as we are catering for some form of percentage of a return.  To a decent degree, we are mirroring what Vienna intends to do, but are open to reviewing the regulations as we go in terms of the work we are doing with the EIB.<\/p> <p>  On the question regarding what happens to units in the longer term, as things stand we have a few different delivery methods or potential delivery methods.  We can deliver through the LDA, through local authorities via the serviced site fund and through approved housing bodies with CREL.  Each of those would have characteristics of its own.  However, we are intending that these would be long-term units.  For example, on Enniskerry Road there is a long-term covenant.  I cannot recall the exact details, but I think it is 150 years.  The scheme at, say, Shanganagh would go to the LDA for 150 years.  In short, developments that are supported either by CREL or other Government funds will stay in the system for a long time.  Typically, as those systems mature all sorts of scenarios such as cost subsidisation and more competitive rents develop and this allows the bodies involved to generate more equity or loans for them to develop more housing based on the returns they get from the units.  They would be getting a level of rent over and above what it is costing to manage particular units.  That is a long-term transition.  It is 30 to 50 years hence, but we are factoring in that those units that are supported stay in cost rental for a significant period of time and, in many cases, in perpetuity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Nicholson"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":899,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nicholson.

I accept it is the overall model that we are seeking to approve here but we need to ensure the principle of mixed income applies in the same way as it does in a private housing estate, a social housing estate and an affordable housing estate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#U00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":903,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Fitzpatrick and Deputy McAuliffe for their questions.  I will start with the question on cost rental.  I accept Deputy McAuliffe's point.  From a policy perspective, I have worked in social housing for a long time and I have a lot of experience in that area.  Everything we are trying to do around affordable housing would be complementary to social housing.  We are seeking to build sustainable long-term communities.  The cost rental projects that are being brought forward include significant elements of social housing as well.  More broadly, we will be working with local authorities as housing and planning bodies to ensure cost rental is part of thriving, sustainable communities.  In the first instance, it is important to get the cost rental model up and running.  One of the points made to us by people in Vienna that have worked in cost rental for years is that it is really important to get started and build up the stock.  Over time, cost rental units should be part of thriving communities.<\/p> <p>  In terms of older people and people with disabilities, this matter also comes within the remit of my new division within the Department.  I know from working with local authorities that they want to integrate all forms of housing into the communities of the future.  I take on board the point made.  It will be a key part of the schemes as they come forward that to the greatest extent possible they bring all forms of housing together in communities.<\/p> <p>  On the question of rural counties, if I am not mistaken County Longford has the lowest median and mean house prices in the State.  The all-in median figure is &euro;108,000 and for first-time buyers it is &euro;130,000.  In that type of scenario, it is difficult for new-build products to compete with the existing housing available.  In the first instance - we touched on this earlier - it is important that the State targets its affordability measures towards the parts of the country that are experiencing the most extreme affordability challenges, such as the greater Dublin area and the other cities.  There is an understanding within the Department that other measures are needed over time to support new home building in parts of the country where that is not currently viable.  It is a slightly different issue from affordability.  In terms of current rural house prices, affordability is not the issue.  It is more about the viability of building a new unit versus what is available from the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Quinlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":904,"content":"<p>Mr. Quinlan is correct in his response.<\/p><p>The intention is that the cost rental model would be part of wider social housing development.  We cannot forget that the goal should always be to have mixed tenure.  We saw the problems which existed in the past when we focused on one type of tenure.  Let us not forget private development in that context.  The mantra that seems to be put forward all the time now is that the approach taken must be the construction of social and affordable houses.  Private housing is also an essential part of the mix, however.  This endeavour cannot just have two elements in operation.  We should try to ensure in everything we do in the area of development that we have social, affordable and private housing.  I do not buy into the narrative being painted by some people that development must be focused on just two of those three aspects.<\/p><p> In that regard, there are areas in the country, especially in my constituency of Waterford, where the collapse in the housing market meant we only had social housing developments, because that was the only housing being built in recent years.  We have excellent infrastructure, such as roads, schools and libraries, but we just have social housing.  Private housing has not followed.  I see the affordable housing product as a way of stimulating private development and ensuring we have a mix of those three strands in areas.<\/p><p> If we are in search of such a circumstance where ownership is in the hands of private owners, how do we stimulate that aspect, aside from the equity side of things?  Will the county councils be able to work with private developers to ensure we get mixed and varied developments?  I am also acutely conscious of those areas of the country where the local authorities do not have land banks.  How do we address that situation?<\/p><p> The cost rental model has got a good bit of airing from Mr. Nicholson, and he has explained it quite a lot in respect of the goal of getting to the pension funds and expanding these schemes.  We cannot scale up this scheme and the product solely on balance sheet through the AHBs.  We are trying to prove the model, as has been said, but the only way we can really get scale in this regard - and it can be achieved quickly - is via attracting finance through pension funds examining a 40-year term of investment and in turn giving people security of tenure for 40 years.  This approach can and will work in Ireland, but we must look at loosening the rules in this context and our sole focus on the AHBs, although I appreciate that we are first trying to prove the model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#U00400","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":906,"content":"<p>Private development is going to be a key element of our endeavours overall.  When we look at this situation in the context of housing policy, we look at it from the perspective of citizens and social housing, and people who require assistance in that regard.  Those eligible for affordable housing are a different group of people who would not be eligible for social housing, but who can have difficulty accessing the market.  There is also an element of housing provision where the market can respond and people have sufficient incomes to enable them to buy or rent a housing product.<\/p> <p>  Overall, from a planning perspective and in the context of the national planning framework, the vision is for mixed communities which really work.  As I said, we must ensure some special areas of housing, such as housing for people with disabilities and older people, are integrated.  These are exactly the types of conversations that we have with our colleagues in planning and with the local authorities concerning the implementation of these various mechanisms to build communities.  The private part of this policy, therefore, is encompassed in two ways.  First, in the area of planning, there is a role for the local authorities in planning overall development in an area.  Second, the approach that has been successful in social housing is an element that will be available in this context.  I refer to local authorities having multiple mechanisms to make affordable housing available.  Those mechanisms can work, and if the local authorities have problems with land, they can have various partnerships to deliver the same product.  Consumers get affordable houses sooner, and the local authority has a mechanism which it can access more quickly and which allows it to deliver housing more quickly.<\/p><p>Turning to the development sector, the homes are generally built by the same builders.  Much of this approach involves giving certainty in respect of demand and that the product will be taken up.  That is what we are trying to do in working with the local authorities, AHBs and the LDA.  <\/p><p> There is a very co-ordinated approach in the Department, and all the policies and programmes seek to complement each other.  We were really careful, in respect of cost rental and other things, to ensure cognisance is taken of the other policy objectives regarding social housing, private development more generally and, ultimately, the planning requirements for areas.  <\/p><p> There has been much discussion regarding pension funds, and there are two sides to this issue.  The Senator is correct about the issue of capacity and that it becomes an issue when there is a deficit in the provision of the numbers of homes we need.  We must in that context open as many channels as possible for that delivery.  On the other hand, as we discussed previously, we must also carefully manage those approaches so the costs do not render the cost-rental model of housing as unaffordable as it would have been if we did not manage this area.  There are two sides to this issue, therefore, but I take the Senator's point regarding overall capacity.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":908,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinlan.  I think we have covered everybody due to speak in that round.  I will follow up briefly on the point made by Senator Cummins on the public-private mix in trying to achieve the target of building the 33,000 units we need each year, initially anyway.  Where the State invests significantly in the provision of infrastructure, and especially in public transport, it also provides an economic benefit to private landowners.  We must ensure that the value added in that context is captured by the State and not the landowner, through mechanisms such as a site value tax and-or special contribution levies.

There has also been some confusion regarding what is known as the help-to-buy premium, which is part of the British scheme, and the impact of shared equity schemes on inflation.  Mr. Nicholson has outlined that the help-to-buy premium is the difference between two comparable properties, one of which was bought with a shared equity loan and one which was not.  As Deputy Cian O'Callaghan rightly pointed out, that is not an aspect that we are concerned about; we are concerned with the overall impact of shared equity loans on house price inflation.  Those are two fundamentally different things.<\/p> <p>  I have furnished the committee with a reference to a report by the London School of Economics because it is the most up-to-date empirical academic study on this topic.  It concludes that the impact of shared equity loans on house price inflation in London, where demand is highest, is 6%.  Across England and Wales overall, the rate of inflation is between 3% and 5%.  While the study found that while the shared equity loan scheme in Britain increased supply, it also explicitly states that the resulting increased supply was provided in the wrong areas.  In many cases, it was on the Welsh-English border and not in the major urban centres, where affordability was most difficult.  The report went on to say that hard-pressed working families, which it calls \"cash-constrained households\", did not benefit from the scheme, and \"Only developers or landowners, not new buyers, benefited from the policy\".  I appreciate that Deputies and Senators supporting the Government must defend its policy in this committee.  I understand that, but all I ask them to do is to read this report, because it shows that in areas of high demand house, price inflation is driven up and those people we all want to help do not benefit. <\/p> <p>  I will make one small correction to what Deputy McAuliffe said.  Of the three schemes we are dealing with today, the shared equity loan scheme is the largest, at &euro;75 million of public expenditure this year.  The serviced sites fund will have &euro;50 million in expenditure this year and cost rental is &euro;35 million.  The shared equity loan scheme, therefore, accounts for almost half the affordable housing expenditure in this year.<\/p><p>He is right that we should look at all three but shared equity is much bigger than the other two on their own.  That being the case, perhaps Mr. Nicholson can give me a direct answer on how many serviced sites fund homes will be delivered this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#W00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":911,"content":"<p>On the serviced sites fund, as the Deputy has suggested, the delivery this year is going to be relatively small in terms of affordable purchase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Nicholson"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":912,"content":"<p>Do we have a number?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021020900002#X00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":913,"content":"<p>Based on submission from local authorities, there would be 51 in Boherboy and in Dun Emer, Lusk, there would be 39.

I would caveat that by saying that, in a similar way to LIHAF, when initial proposals come in, they are largely concepts.  The Minister has kind of flagged this frustration with the speed of development himself.

We have approved, overall, funding for approximately 4,000 units.  In terms of a very similar scheme we are now seeing payback from LIHAF in the form of homes being delivered.  Again, it is slower than everyone would have anticipated and wanted but at the moment we have homes available in Adamstown for between &euro;300,000 and &euro;320,000, somewhere around 300 homes.  Meath, Glanmire, Cherry Bank and a number of programmes are due to be delivered and that will increase over the next year or two.

Currently, Bus &Eacute;ireann provides more than 220 State-supported, or public service obligation, PSO, routes nationwide.  We also have a fully commercial intercity service, Expressway, and we operate the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department of Education.  In the 2019-2020 school year more than 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to schools throughout the country as part of this scheme.  This is unparalleled in its scale throughout Europe.<\/p> <p>  We are in our 35th year. While the last year has been one of the most challenging in our history because of the impact of Covid-19, we are delighted last year to have introduced the single most significant enhancement of public service obligation services, PSOs, with the support of funding from the National Transport Authority through the July stimulus.  The link between investment, improved services, higher levels of customer satisfaction, which leads to increased usage is very clear.  This type of initiative demonstrates a commitment to maintaining growth in public transport, notwithstanding the current challenges we face during Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  Our 2,700 employees have been at work throughout this pandemic.  They have ensured that essential services continued to be delivered for those who depend on them most.  I would like to pay tribute to the dedication of all the employees and many who deliver services on our behalf.  These people were very steadfast right throughout the crisis in demonstrating a very strong public service ethos associated with Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>  The board and management are very thankful for the ongoing support from the Department of Transport and the Department of Education, the National Transport Authority, NTA and CI&Eacute; and for the very constructive engagements we have with the trade unions which represent many of our staff to ensure safety continues to be at the forefront of everything we do.<\/p> <p>  In 2019 Bus &Eacute;ireann carried 89.4 million passenger journeys.  It was our highest level since 2008.  The company  saw a return to profit for the first time in five years.  However, in 2020, Covid-19 related drops in passenger demand and public transport capacity restrictions created financial challenges for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It forced us to take some very difficult decisions on a number of our commercial services.  We had to do that to protect the remaining network in the longer term and continue serving more than 150 communities which rely on our Expressway services.<\/p> <p>  Our commercial services are currently relying on temporary support for the next three months under the commercial bus operator direct award contract but every route needs to be sustainable in the longer term.  If there are any issues of connectivity, we liaise very closely with the National Transport Authority, NTA, as it has the ultimate responsibility to assess demand and provide connectivity if it is needed.<\/p> <p>  We believe Bus &Eacute;ireann has a central role to play in many of the ten strategic outcomes outlined in the national development plan, so for the convenience of committee members I will make my comments under some of the headings outlined in the plan.  The first is compact growth, strengthening rural economies and communities and enhancing regional accessibility.  What we would say in that regard is that while the National Transport Authority is responsible for overall connectivity nationwide, we work closely with it to ensure integration of services across our nationwide network.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has the reach and transport skills to participate in any plan which connects Ireland and to support sustainable urban and rural development, efficiently and effectively.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, we have experienced significant growth in regional cities and towns.  In particular, when we have investment that goes in by way of additional fleet and increased frequency.  Some examples I cite are that in 2019, we grew city passenger numbers by 50% in Waterford, by 70% on route 220 in Cork and by 60% in Drogheda with a doubling in frequency.<\/p> <p>  Having the right infrastructure in place for buses to operate efficiently and on time, such as bus priority measures, real time information and ongoing investment in regional roads and motorways is key to incentivising people to make the shift from car to bus.  Where infrastructure is in place, the impact is clear.  We look forward to planned BusConnects projects sitting under this plan.  We see it as a key in transforming bus transport in our cities.<\/p> <p>  It is essential that sustainable funding is in place for all routes that have a public service obligation and that supply and demand is carefully considered and balanced for routes which require a commercial licence to ensure that these services can become sustainable again when the recovery begins.<\/p> <p>  We also provide services to more than 1 million people through our free travel scheme.  As our population continues to age and grow more generally, demand for our services will increase again.  The demand-led school transport scheme we operate on behalf of the Department of Education continues to grow.<\/p><p>We look forward to actively participating in the Department of Education review of the needs of the scheme, including the sustainable transport plans for schools for the future over the coming months.<\/p><p> Under the headings of sustainable mobility and a transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society that are called out under the national development plan, this year we have confirmed orders for 204 new vehicles and we are making considerable improvements in the transition of our fleet to greener, cleaner, more accessible vehicles.  We will not be introducing any diesel-only buses to our city and town fleets.  We are beginning the process of switching to hybrid vehicles in our city and town services very soon and that will start in Galway over the next couple of months.  For longer routes, we are exploring hydrogen fuel cell power and investing in Euro VI diesel vehicles.<\/p><p> In 2020, we were the first transport company to operate Ireland&rsquo;s first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle in a unique trial between Dublin and Meath.  That was led by Hydrogen Mobility Ireland and we plan to add three hydrogen buses on route 103 in Meath in quarter 2 of this year.  We are also leading on a project to roll out the electrification of Athlone town services in partnership with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and our company car and van fleet will all be fully electric by 2025.  By 2030, half of our fleet will be zero emissions and all diesel vehicles will be at least of Euro VI engine emission standard, which have up to 90% lower emissions than some of our current diesel fleet.  We need multi-annual funding commitments to continue.  We see them as being critical in ensuring we can deliver on these targets.<\/p><p> In summary, we believe bus and coach transport is highly flexible, safe and demand responsive.  It produces much less carbon dioxide per passenger kilometre than the private car, and can increase passenger numbers more rapidly than any other public transport solution.  It can do that within a year to 18 months of investment approval.  The current national development plan includes very ambitious plans to grow and to green public transport nationally.  Both will help to deliver economic recovery post Covid-19.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is looking forward to the opportunities presented by both the growth and the greening of public transport.

He will be aware that Bus &Eacute;ireann has delivered new services to areas like Kilkenny.  The NTA has been working on a proposal for a long time.  Has Mr. Kent held discussions on the provision of a town bus service for Ennis?  It is incorporated in a document called Ennis 2040, which will shortly be published by Clare County Council.  Similar services are being rolled out in towns the size of Ennis.  I would like to hear his views on that.<\/p> <p>  We have had different results over the last number of weeks in relation to some services being delivered by Bus &Eacute;ireann in County Clare.  I welcome the fact a service, around which there was a question mark and which delivered people from Broadford to Limerick city, has been reinstated.  I received calls from people living along the estuary in a village called Labasheeda in west Clare.  Basically, their service has been discontinued but the slack has been taken up by Local Link, which is very welcome.  Funding has been provided to do that through the job stimulus and I welcome that.<\/p> <p>  This leads on to my next question.  What other services has Bus &Eacute;ireann discontinued in County Clare?<\/p><p>I ask him to expand on that.

We do not operate the Kilkenny town service.  That service was put out to tender and is operated by another operator.  The Navan town service, for example, is one that has been significantly enhanced most recently, in respect of frequency and buses that were added in to the service.  I am not aware of any direct conversations with the NTA to date in respect of the town of Ennis.  Obviously, much of what we have put into operation over the last number of weeks has resulted in a significant enhancement both for Limerick city and connections for west and east Clare.  However, on the actual specifics of the town service, we would be very interested in discussing potential movements with the NTA, if it were to be considered.  All activities and the plans going forward as part of this, typically go out to consultation.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct to state that Local Link has been used very effectively as a service by the NTA to integrate with services that are included in the direct award contract that we have.  We operate 220 routes within that.  Typically, those routes are integrated for connectivity with other services that might include Local Link or, indeed, other operators, commercial or rail services.  That is typically where it has happened.  If demand is not currently at a certain level, or if it is more efficient for the State to deploy funding in a way to provide more of a feeder service onto the main arteries, that has been typically the approach that has been developed.  Other than that, in respect of the development of the main arteries, all of the main issues can be seen in the national development plan to address capacity.  If capacity is required, we deploy it.  Speed of service and the ability to go from A to B are things Bus &Eacute;ireann and the NTA are continuously trying to address, so that we can get the right levels of frequency and coverage in places like some of the towns.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy said, particularly as the Covid pandemic unfolds, it is possible that many more people may decide not to live in Dublin and to settle elsewhere.  We have watched the news like everybody else.  That is going to be an interesting part of how things will develop in the future.  The aspects of interchange, directness of service, having the right levels of capacity and deploying it efficiently, dictate the way things are happening.  If there is demand for a service, then it will have to be considered in that context.  If there is a possibility to provide that service, we will be very willing to engage in relation to that.  That is all I would say.  Typically, where services have been redeployed into Local Link, it is because it is more efficient to do so.  On the main services that we are deploying, we are trying to make sure that we are deploying them with the right levels of capacity, speed and frequency, and to do that in unison with the other operators if they are involved.  That is what is happening at this particular point.  This has been the approach since 2019 and there is a broader project in relation to connecting Ireland under way.  That is all I can say in response to the Deputy.  If the question needs to go further, we can probably bring it to and discuss it directly with the NTA, because ultimately it has the responsibility for connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1032,"content":"<p>There is a route between Ennis and Shannon.

Plans were probably in place for further improvements on the route directly serving Limerick, Shannon and Shannon Airport, and we knew all that information.  While I was there, I went for a walk around the park and I saw that several new companies were coming in.  I guess we were right, in advance of the onset of Covid-19, in giving some consideration to providing enhanced infrastructure, such as bus stops, and achieving a better understanding of some of the shift pattern movements.  Some of those changes were certainly in train before Covid-19 struck.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that those changes are still encompassed in many of the plans being considered.  An example is route 343, in respect of enhancing that service with better buses and ensuring they will be more accessible.  I can tell Deputy Carey that I would be very happy to engage in what he has just suggested.  It would be subject to funding, however.  Providing the additional frequency of services and redeploying the buses required is something we would depend on the NTA to do.  To be fair, there is no lack of willingness on its side.  We are all reliant to a great extent on funding coming through so we can provide that better service and bring in the improvements of which the Deputy spoke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#F00300","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kent and all the staff of Bus &Eacute;ireann for their hard work on the front line during the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#F00400","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>On the scale of State support needed during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic and in respect of the projected plans for Bus &Eacute;ireann's future expansion, what level of investment is being sought from the Government?<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of unmet needs, many people would agree with the point made by Mr. Kent regarding investment leading to improved services and a higher level of customer satisfaction, and that those aspects are self-fulfilling.  There are significant levels of unmet needs across the country.  I am thinking of areas and new communities in my constituency which have no bus services.  Some 4,000 people live in Stamullen and hundreds of people live in Kentstown.  I could list all these areas.  It is the same with the school bus transport scheme and the situation with concessionary and non-concessionary tickets.  The unmet need this year was unprecedented.  Is this a matter entirely for the NTA?  I ask that because surely Bus &Eacute;ireann's drivers know these areas and the communities which are growing very well.

We have regular weekly interaction with the NTA regarding planning teams.  We have a network planning team and the NTA has a similar team, which is looking at all those issues.  The Deputy is right about small villages like Stamullen.  There are many such towns and villages that, typically, we would be looking at.  All these aspects again come back to the fact that within the direct award, as granted to us, there are still 220 routes.  Several of those routes could possibly be changed and extended, as that is allowed under the direct award contract.  Those changes allowed can involve alterations to scale and frequency and additional permeation.  We know society is always changing, so the NTA addresses those aspects when it is possible to do so and it works on that process with us.<\/p> <p>  Turning to additional villages that may come on stream, the Deputy might be aware of an example of that happening just before Christmas when the small village of Portroe got a bus service for the first time and was connected to Limerick city.<\/p><p>That was certainly a part of the consultation with the NTA.  However, it is the NTA that would make that decision and then we deploy the services to do that.  Therefore, we are entirely reliant on funding being made available to pay for driver hours, to pay for the fuel, to pay for the maintenance and to pay for the vehicle.  If that funding has been available, we have been providing it.  As I said, we had a unique opportunity at Christmas.  There were 112 jobs created in this business here and 26 additional vehicles deployed for a fleet, but that was all part of the Government stimulus that was created to connect all those additional frequency services in towns that went in.  It came with an additional price tag.  From the NTA's point of view, it was an investment by the State of an additional &euro;10 million.  That is what went in to deliver those levels of service.  As I said, it is probably, certainly in my tenure here since 2013, the largest investment I have seen.  We believe it is the largest, maybe, in 15 years.  It was part of a Government stimulus package and I think that we will see the results of that.  It is very encouraging if we can bring those in and connect them but, as I said, it still has to be the subject of an effectiveness and efficiency review.  If a smaller village is not best suited by us, it may be addressed by Local Link or by another operator.  That is typically the way it may end up happening because all of the PSO services are supplemented by commercial services.<\/p><p> Returning to Deputy O'Rourke's question on the State support, we have been very thankful during Covid because there has been a huge amount of additional funding provided for services, in particular, on the PSO side.  We are currently recovering many of our costs, including lost revenue.  During parts of Covid, we lost up to 80% of revenue and, in one extreme, 90%, which was at the very beginning.  That, obviously, oscillated through the summer as reopenings occurred.  The revenue deficit has been made good and the costs have effectively been recovered for the NTA during that period, including, as I would say here for the benefit of the public, a large amount of the additional investment in all of the sanitisation regimes and everything that we could deploy to make the service as safe as possible.  I am glad to see, even at this point, that we have not had any Covid-related-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1041,"content":"<p>I need Mr. Kent to conclude.

Like my colleague, Deputy Carey, I want to impress upon Mr. Kent the necessity for him to engage with the NTA in the provision of that long-awaited service for the town of Ennis.  It is something that has been in the offing for a long time and Mr. Kent's skills and understanding of what is involved would be helpful to the debate.  Hopefully, Mr. Kent can address that.<\/p> <p>  I will also address the issue of the service that was discontinued from my own part of the county, from Whitegate, through Scarriff, Tulla, Broadford and onwards, to Limerick.  I thank Mr. Kent for his engagement and for reversing that decision.  Unfortunately, it should not have happened.  When Bus &Eacute;ireann is offering some good news, we all get the press release.  It is important, too, that Bus &Eacute;ireann engages with us when it intends to change a service.  As others have said, it is appropriate that some of the routes are handled by Local Link rather than through Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Kent probably needs to engage the NTA and Local Link a little more to ensure that we do not have that drop in service as was talked about there.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carey referred rightly to west Clare.  That is being resolved through Local Link.  There was a conversation with Local Link, probably, a month or six weeks in advance, which meant that there would be no discontinuation of a service.  That is the way to go when Bus &Eacute;ireann is changing its services and I recommend that.<\/p> <p>  I also want to recognise Bus &Eacute;ireann's staff and Mr. Kent for what they have done for us through the pandemic.  That has been really helpful to consumers.<\/p> <p>  I am glad Mr. Kent raised the issue of the Portroe to Limerick service.  It is just across the water in County Tipperary but it has potential positive implications for County Clare.  Mr. Kent may be familiar with the twin towns of Ballina and Killaloe and I would hope that he could see some possibility in that service taking in Killaloe.  As the service transverses from Portroe to Limerick, a loop into Killaloe would enhance the service greatly, would give many more people an opportunity to avail of the service and would see greater passenger uptake.<\/p><p>Quite some time ago, Bus &Eacute;ireann had a plan to introduce bus rapid transit in and around Limerick and onwards to Shannon.

There is no lack of willingness to participate positively in all those initiatives.  What we will need to do, as I said earlier, is anything that gives us more directness, coverage and speed, all the things that customers usually need if they are going to make a choice to convert from the car to public transport.

That is very much appreciated.<\/p> <p>  The provision of bus stops and bus shelters is the responsibility of the NTA in conjunction with ourselves.  Consultation is a part of that.  Obviously, we have some liaison with councils.  Typically, all of those inputs are made.  There has been great progress in recent years, particularly with shelters and trying to ensure bus stops are made more accessible in cities.  A lot of that work is continuing.  That is a steady state investment plan that is rolled out.  The NTA is at an advanced stage of procurement for bus stop infrastructure, which it has been trying to put in place for a number of years.  We are on the other side - we serve just short of 10,000 bus stops around the country, some of which probably need reinvestment.<\/p><p>Where shelters are put in place, that is typically by way of consultation with the city council to make sure that can be provided for and that footways, clearance areas and so on are all there.  I will take back the point the Senator has made.  He mentioned Maryborough Hill so I will ask what our input has been to that.  That might progress it on the Senator's side and if he keeps pushing on the council side, maybe it will come together.<\/p><p> The Senator asked about Expressway routes.  It was a difficult decision.  We are very reliant on Expressway, which is integrated in the business.  We have a large number of drivers, mechanics and staff that continue to work and deliver those services.  They are commercial in nature and, outside of what we have with Covid at the moment, they are completely reliant on the cost recovery that is happening.  Most commercial services out there are low-margin businesses.  That is just a fact.  For every route we operate, that is important, particularly when we are not in receipt of State money.  We do not get subvention for those routes other than what we are getting currently.  We were not getting a subvention in the period until July, so we ran many of those routes at a loss.  Revenue loss went to 90% and even at the height of it during the summer, we operated at about 50% of revenue.  One cannot operate a low-margin service with such extreme revenue loss.  In that period, we ended up having to look at the routes individually, which was done with detailed consultation with the Department and discussions with the NTA.  We had to take a view on the projections as to whether some of these routes would come back.  Our view on some of the routes was that their long-term viability could threaten the long-term viability of the other routes we are doing.  We took a decision on the 18 routes we operate to effectively come out of four.  As members saw last week, we came out on the Limerick route on 29 January, we came out on the Belfast route and, currently, in relation to the Senator's area of Cork, the X8 services and connectivity have been reduced but the long-term plan will be to come out of that.  That will be in consultation with the NTA so connectivity solutions can be identified in advance of any further decision.  It is pure economics.   We have to make sure a route can generate money to pay wages, to pay for investment in a new fleet because one cannot continue running old fleet and to pay for maintenance.  It is as simple as that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>How does Bus &Eacute;ireann promote connectivity and how do people who have no access to a service get such access, if that is the model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#J00200","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1051,"content":"<p>We operate services by licence.

We say that openly as a company but there is only so far we can do it.  To do that, we have been reliant on funding from the NTA.  Where it is in place, we have stood up and been able to deliver and deploy that.  However, on other routes, where there is no possibility of revenue covering our costs, we get to a place where, as a commercial semi-State company, we have to make sure we can keep it all operating and we did not want to endanger the other routes that have a greater chance of coming back.

While I acknowledge that schools are not open at the moment, a large volume of students this year have not yet been able to reconcile the difficulties they have had with Bus &Eacute;ireann with regard to school transport.  It remains a big issue and I am glad a national review is under way, into which Bus &Eacute;ireann will have significant input.  Its staff have probably been pulled 100 ways by the public and public representatives.<\/p> <p>  As an example, Corofin in north Clare is a typical Irish village.  Mr. Kent may or may not know it.  It is quite close to the Burren.  As one leaves the village, one can see the typical typography that is around any village, such as streams, dykes and ditches, and they form the parish boundaries.  They are the very parish boundaries that become the hard cut-off point between a student qualifying or not for a ticket; it is totally illogical.  This probably worked in the 1940s and 1950s, when buses started to be seen going down rural roads.  They would pass people going to the local creamery and the parish boundary was a drain or a stream.<\/p> <p>  It is totally illogical in 2021.  It forces some people to go three miles one way to a primary school, while the cr&egrave;che or childminder might be six miles across the Burren, and then they have to drive to Ennistymon school afterwards.  It is illogical that large numbers of people pass one another unnecessarily on the road each morning, and that is just one example, although it could probably be applied to every village in Ireland.  The case of Corofin is replicated throughout Clare and Ireland.  The new model for school bus transport has to be based on supply and demand.  If there are five or six kids in a community, that should logically dictate that there be a stop.  It should not come down to streams, drains and ditches; that does not work.  I would like to hear Mr. Kent's views on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the overall bus service, I accept that Bus &Eacute;ireann is constantly seeking to enhance its offering to villages and communities.  I recently made a number of submissions to the company, particularly regarding the south Clare area, such as Parteen, Meelick, Ardnacrusha, Clonlara and Cratloe.  They are in the south of the county, a stone's throw from Limerick city, but they do not enjoy the fabulous city bus service that operates into the north suburbs of the city.  As Bus &Eacute;ireann examines rolling out an improvement in the service, it might also factor in these villages.  The two most recent censuses identified this corner of Clare as the largest population growth area.<\/p><p>I would like to hear the views of Mr. Kent in respect of the prospects for an orbital bus service around Ennis town, as raised by other members.  It is the largest town in Munster that does not have city status and is home to 18,500 people.  There is a significant hunger and demand for a bus service there.  Just last week, Ms Anne Graham of the NTA gave some positive vibes when I asked her about this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#K00500","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>On the issue of school transport, while it is evident that the scheme has been expanding, the difficulty is that, as was stated, it has always been subject to iteration.  In this particular case, eligibility criteria apply.  We do not have any discretion in that regard, but we will participate in the process and we will look at the issues raised by the Deputy with regard to particular locations.  More than &euro;200 million has been spent by the State to try to deliver school transport services.  In fact, coming into Covid, additional moneys were deployed so that we could do that in a socially distanced way for post-primary children.  On the issue raised by the Deputy, there are definitely opportunities within the scheme but it is always subject to review.  There has been massive growth in the scheme.  As I stated, whatever about 2019 when there was demand for 120,000 seats and that was growing towards 125,000, even during Covid there was still demand in September for 114,000 seats.  There was a very small fall-off in demand.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to places such as Corofin.  I understand that the school transport scheme is critical for rural villages around Ireland.  That is absolutely intrinsic to the scheme.  Bus &Eacute;ireann understands that better than anybody at the moment.  The company has been carrying out planning and making the effort currently being made in this area for more than 50 years.  However, our planning and effort are subject to the eligibility criteria, which are specified and agreed by the Department and signed off by the Government.  Whatever way it is done, it has to be all done as part of a wider review.  From our perspective, we stand ready.  We will do what we can do to deploy the services.

As such, Bus &Eacute;ireann would be like any other organisation and would have to participate in a process.

I reiterate the remarks of my colleagues in terms of the thanks we wish to pass on to the staff of Bus &Eacute;ireann for keeping services going, especially for those who depend on public transport and do not have access to a car to get them through these difficult times.  It is much appreciated and acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  I wish to elaborate on the last point made by Mr. Kent.  I believe we need to shift the focus a little from investment in roads to investment in public transport, both bus and rail.  The national planning framework seeks to ensure balanced regional development.  The NDP is up for review.  I believe there has to be significantly higher investment in public transport to meet not just the objective of balanced development, but also to ensure that when we seek to build houses, it is transport-orientated development.<\/p><p>We cannot be building houses everywhere depending on car transport.  When Mr. Kent looks at how Bus &Eacute;ireann can deliver balanced development, and he said that he knows rural transport as well as anybody else having been at it for so long, is the organisation limited in its fleet numbers?  Obviously it is limited in its fleet numbers to the service.  Is there a service static steady State view of public transport so that if Bus &Eacute;ireann had more fleet and higher ambition that was supported it could supply a lot more rural bus transport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#L00500","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1063,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments about staff.<\/p> <p>  To answer the question, there are two aspects.  One aspect is the infrastructure that the Deputy has talked about.  As he can see, under the consultations that we will have on the city, there is massive change required for a number of those cities.  There is just 30 km of bus prioritisation available outside Dublin, which is a radically low number.  If one looks at the consultation that is put in place for Limerick, for instance, where it proposes to get up to about 84 km in the city alone from its current 12 km.  Places like that, and putting that level of prioritisation in, will ensure confidence in the service and reliability regarding all of those issues that the Deputy talked about.  There is massive infrastructural development required in the regional cities to get bus prioritisation measures in place.  They need to be supported, with all of the things that he mentioned, bus gateways and all of those things that would allow buses to come in to closures and to give them prioritisation.  Nobody likes to be here, on my side of a table, ever having to apologise for the fact that the service has run late.  In fact, everything that we are trying to do every single day is to work on punctuality and service improvements.  So we are doing that in a measured way but to make the step change one needs the infrastructural change that the Deputy talked about and that investment needs to come.<\/p> <p>  The second part is vehicle investment.  Currently, we operate with a fleet of 1,100 vehicles and a lot of those are mixed age vehicles.  I am delighted to say that we had tranches of investment that came in in 2008 but then there was nothing until 2012 and another burst in 2015.  One needs steady State investment for a fleet and all of those things will get addressed now.  That is why I am delighted, under the national development plan, NDP, because it will provide capacity needs.  I must say that in the last of couple of years there has been huge investment by the National Transport Authority, NTA, to move from single decks to double decks so one will see, in regional cities, that a lot of those have come in in the last couple of years.  Now there are better energy efficient vehicles and everything is targeted at trying to move to having low to zero emissions.  So having the investment for those reasons alone is worthwhile.<\/p> <p>  On schools, it has been a very difficult part because we operate less than 10% of the services directly, under school transport, and a lot of those are reliant on vehicles that are cascaded old to new.  We have not secured investment at the levels required for school transport at this point and that is the subject of analysis with the Department.  To answer the Deputy's question, we need investment for school transport because I do not believe that children should be treated any differently.  In fact, a greener cleaner school fleet turning up at schools is such a positive message.<\/p> <p>  On the NTA, it has made great strides with investment in vehicles.  The NTA has funded double decker hybrids and hydrogen buses.  The only issue that we have, for instance on the Expressway routes, is that there is not currently anything outside of Euro 6 diesel engines for longer intercity routes but there are trials under way and we hope that things like hydrogen technology might come to bear to make them better.  On investment, particularly in commercial, people want toileted buses.  They want a relatively good standard of buses for their journeys and we need to be able to make sure that we give them that relative to the power.  We used to promote Expressway with the line \"like the car, only better\", and that is exactly how I feel.  It is what people get out of it.  As members will know, three out of four journeys in this country are by car.  That is a lot and we have to change that mindset.  So what I see in the NDP is investment in infrastructure, quality of service and fleet, and all of those things combined will move us a long way on the green agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>I will be quick given that the time is approaching 11 a.m.<\/p><p>I refer to the good news on the fleet transferring to hybrid models.

For a company the size of Bus &Eacute;ireann to show some leadership on how carbon emissions can be reduced and to have that quantified would be very useful for other states and also private actors.  I ask that the company have a look at doing that in the interests of furthering the good news story.<\/p><p> I echo the sentiments of others in thanking all the company's staff for their work during this pandemic, from those who are driving the buses to those preparing them and to everyone behind the scenes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#M00300","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1066,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and appreciate those comments.  On the carbon emissions, as I have said, the biggest contributor to energy emissions we have at the moment is fuel and diesel types.  When one adds it all together, 97% of what we contributed goes out in fuel type.  As I said, when we start transitioning to modes such as hybrid that will provide around a 30% fuel saving on the current level.  Moving to electric will obviously have a huge additional benefit as we will effectively go to zero emissions at that point, and then there is hydrogen.  I have mentioned some of the other developments, whereby even where we have to settle for a Euro 6 versus what we used to have back in 2006 or 2008, it will deliver major savings in emissions.  We are tracking this.  To give the Deputy more confidence, our board has set up a sustainability committee which will commence in the company in March.  We are developing a full sustainability plan that will tie into many of the goals that will be set out across the whole business on everything we have to do to achieve the climate action plan.  We have started a lot of energy and climate action projects.  We will do that in consultation with the people who supply us with goods.  While it is a small step, last week we even had a vendor coming in who planted trees on our behalf in and around some of the places.<\/p> <p>  All of these are small measures but, collectively, the big issue we must address is the transition into more energy-efficient fuel alternatives.  That is the path we are taking.  I have no problem providing the Deputy with information on our current carbon emissions.  We can measure those and return with them.  I am delighted to say we are making progress and setting ourselves up to align with the 2030 plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#N00300","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>I want to focus on two issues.

Mindful of the short time available to us today, this opening statement is short and focused on one or two key issues identified by IALPA members as significant for the continued survival of the aviation sector in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>We refer to recent news coverage and reported comments from the T&aacute;naiste in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>on 26 January that &quot;international travel was unlikely to reopen until sometime in the future, but certainly not for the summer&quot;.  It appears that there is now a prevailing narrative that international travel is preventing Ireland from becoming a Covid-free island like New Zealand.  Clearly, the Government shares this view and is preparing to close Ireland to international travel further for the foreseeable future.<br\/><br\/>Regardless of whether an international travel ban will suppress virus transmission in Ireland, we are fully supportive of any measure aimed at protecting public health and reducing the prevalence of this virus.  However, Irish airlines rely on summer bookings to make enough money to tide them over the loss-making winter season.  The loss of a second consecutive summer season after an entire year of practically zero revenue will prove fatal for airlines that have already depleted their cash reserves.<\/p><p> The &euro;80 million support package for the aviation sector announced in November was essentially a grant for Ireland's airports, the majority of which are State owned.  The funds left over for the airlines may have, at best, covered a few days' worth of losses.  Our airlines are intrinsic to the success of an island nation like Ireland, and they supply economic lifeblood, bringing, among other things, foreign direct investment and an estimated &euro;10 billion into the Irish economy annually.  Every aircraft that leaves Ireland will represent lost jobs and lost GDP.  It is an economic fact that if our airlines are allowed to go out of business, the consequences for the Irish economy will be devastating.<\/p><p> Most governments have recognised such dangers and have accepted that if they are to intervene to prevent airlines operating for the sake of virus suppression, they must ensure those airlines do not go out of business as a result.  New Zealand, so often our favoured Covid comparator, moved quickly to extend supports worth $900 million to Air New Zealand.  Much closer to home, the list includes &euro;10 billion for Lufthansa, &euro;7 billion for Air France, &euro;2.5 billion for British Airways, and &euro;1.2 billion for TAP Air Portugal.  The UK Government provided a loan worth &euro;670 million to Ryanair, an Irish airline, such was the value it placed on its contribution to the UK economy.  We have provided the committee with a copy of recent media coverage detailing the state aid approved by the European Commission for dozens of European airlines from their respective governments.  Why does Ireland remain an outlier as the only European country not to provide meaningful financial aid to its indigenous airlines?<\/p><p> The window remaining for decisive action is fast closing.  Airlines plan and budget for their vital summer schedules at this time of year and they will soon have to make hard decisions based on expected market conditions.  Our Government needs to understand that creditors and airline owners will not allow for yet another lost summer.  They will cut their losses and move their money and assets to other countries that support aviation.  The market will not save Ireland's airlines.<\/p><p> If international travel must be suppressed into the future, significant financial aid for Irish airlines is the only option available to avert sectoral collapse.  If the Government acts to suppress travel, the Government must also act to save our airlines from the destruction that such interventions cause.  They cannot have it both ways.  We implore the committee to lobby the Government to provide meaningful financial aid to Ireland's airlines before it is too late.<\/p><p> Over the weekend it was reported that Aer Lingus accessed that &euro;150 million loan facility.  We understand that was to address a problem it had last year.  It will not do anything for the problem that has now been created because the Government has cancelled the summer of 2021.  In our submission we also include an IATA document on the importance of air transport to Ireland.  We also provide detailed information on the dozens of airlines across Europe that have received direct government aid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Cullen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1083,"content":"<p>F&oacute;rsa represents over 80,000 members, including around 5,000 workers in airlines, airports, air navigation bases, aviation regulatory bodies and air traffic control.  Eleven months of pay cuts, lay-offs, redundancies and job insecurity along with continued uncertainty about the future have put aviation workers and their families under significant strain.  For many, mortgage and other debt incurred during this period will be a burden for years to come.  It is not sustainable for these members to continue to endure this hardship.  With no early end to travel restrictions in sight, thousands of jobs will remain at risk unless the State acts now.<\/p> <p>  While the industry and its staff have benefited from State wage supports, Ireland continues to lack a European-style joined-up Government approach to underpin jobs in the sector, protect aviation infrastructure and ensure the survival of a viable post-pandemic industry.  This runs the risk that Irish aviation will be left behind when the rest of the world moves on, with potentially devastating implications for the national economy and employment in the aviation sector, and the sectors and communities that depend on it.<\/p><p>It is highly likely - if not certain - that aviation will be among the last industries to emerge from this crisis yet the Government has been slow to engage fully with stakeholders.  Recommendations from the task force for aviation and this committee have been largely ignored.  This inaction is placing an entire industry at risk along with the jobs and connectivity it supports.<\/p><p> F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s written submission to this committee gives a detailed assessment of the impact of the crisis across the industry and contains a range of recommendations both for the sector as a whole and for specific companies.  I will draw particular attention to three industry-wide requirements.  First, we make recommendations regarding income supports that acknowledge their contribution to the sector and its staff while highlighting the need for a flexible, industry-specific approach for this phase of the aviation crisis.  There is a strong risk that the employee wage subsidy scheme, as currently constructed, will lack the flexibility required to underpin employment relationships in the sector, which is essential if we are to position the industry to bounce back post Covid.  F&oacute;rsa is proposing an aviation income support scheme similar to that in place in Germany, which enables employers to reduce hours rather than laying staff off, with Government income support for the time employees cannot work.  Second, we emphasise the need for Government-led social dialogue with employers and unions to underpin a sustainable and thriving aviation industry as we emerge from the pandemic.  Third, F&oacute;rsa is calling for the Central Bank to adopt European Banking Authority, EBA, guidelines for the extension of mortgage payment breaks in 2021.  The European guidelines do not currently apply in Ireland, where the application process is slow and onerous.  After 11 months of income reductions and no early sight of recovery, this is placing avoidable strain on our workers.<\/p><p> Ireland went into this crisis as a major force in global aviation and our connectivity to the rest of the world plays a crucial role in supporting economic activity and attracting inward investment.  It is, therefore, crucial that we act collectively to ensure that the industry not only survives the impact of this current crisis but is fit to perform robustly as and when safe international travel resumes.  F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s approach has been to work closely with aviation employers to maximise job protection but this approach cannot succeed without significant and continuing Government support and intervention.  The union continues to call for any such support to be contingent on the avoidance of compulsory redundancies and the offshoring of Irish aviation jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ashley Connelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1085,"content":"<p>I will not take as long because most of the points have been made and I do not want to repeat them.  To summarise, since we last met in November, the situation for our members has continued to deteriorate and has got much worse.  Connect not only represents members in the airlines and the airports but also those working in production areas.  At the moment, those workers are also experiencing significant lay-offs and redundancies and an inability, particularly among younger workers, to obtain mortgages, etc., because of reduced circumstances.  We have seen situations where workers have had agreements for pay, etc., deferred.  There are deep concerns about health and safety, particularly the roll-out of vaccines for workers in airports.  If people are to be ready for the upsurge, they must be protected for when that comes.  We all know about the downturn in figures and the impact of that on numbers.  We echo what has been said about increased Government support for the industry similar to what we have seen across Europe.  We are calling for some very precise issues that we feel have been missed to be addressed.<\/p><p>No worker should be subject to compulsory redundancy while his or her employer is benefiting from any Government subsidy during the pandemic.  The legislation on redundancy means that workers who are currently laid off or on reduced hours cannot avail of voluntary redundancy, yet that time is not counted as service.  If we are denying workers the right to voluntary redundancy, that time should be counted as service.  This is a serious issue for our members.  We would support a system similar to the German kurzarbeitergeld system or even that of Sweden, where workers who continue to work during the pandemic are supported through better terms.  In that context, we are concerned about a future skills shortage in maintenance and specialist roles because people are leaving the sector.  When the upturn comes, there will be a skills shortage.  Our members have particular and precise specialist skills in certain areas and we are concerned that when the upturn comes, which it will, there will be a shortage of skills.  In that context, we are asking the State to see this as an opportunity to subsidise the industry for specialist upgrading or maintenance works that could be done to get the airports and airlines ready for the upsurge when it comes.  Basically, we support everything else that has been said here.  <\/p><p> Approximately one third of our union members are in construction.  While construction has been badly hit, we understand that the sector will resume much more rapidly than aviation.  Aviation will not be where it was pre-pandemic until 2024 or 2025 according to the latest estimates.  Workers in the aviation sector will suffer the longest hit and they must be taken care of with some sort of scheme to ensure that while they remain in the industry, their earnings are protected. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kavanagh and now invite Mr. McGowan from SIPTU to make a four-minute presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#T00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to make a presentation.  The Covid pandemic has had a devastating impact on the aviation industry, which continues to worsen by the day.  All workers in aviation have suffered a significant drop in income due to the pandemic.  Those that have remained in work have suffered drops in working hours and pay, thousands have faced lay off and many more have lost their jobs on a permanent basis.  Flights and passenger numbers have collapsed and the industry has been brought to its knees.  The outlook for aviation in the short- to medium-term is bleak and workers face into 2021 with real uncertainty and fear for their jobs.<\/p> <p>  Despite a dramatic drop in earnings, workers in aviation continued to work throughout the pandemic.  This has allowed essential medical supplies, PPE and most recently, vaccines, to continue to arrive in the country.  While State supports through wage subsidies and financial support for the regional airports are welcome, they simply do not go far enough given the depth and breadth of the crisis.  <\/p> <p>  To ensure that we have an aviation industry post-Covid, a number of actions need to be taken immediately by the Government.  SIPTU recommends the extension and amendment of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, for the aviation sector to ensure that employment is maintained in the industry.  The scheme should be tailored for the aviation industry so it becomes a genuine short-time working scheme based on the German model that pays 85% of pre-Covid earnings.  It must be made conditional on several binding commitments from employers, including that no worker be made redundant on a compulsory basis and that no worker suffers a permanent reduction in any terms and conditions of employment, unless by collective agreement, while the employer is benefiting from the EWSS.  SIPTU recommends that Shannon Airport be returned to the same management group as Dublin and Cork airports.  The separation of Shannon Airport has not been a success and the Covid crisis has brought into question the airport's long-term viability.  Given the airport's absolute importance to the region's economy, SIPTU believes it must be brought back into the same management group as the other State airports.  SIPTU recommends the introduction of free and rapid testing for all airport workers and that aviation workers be given the vaccine at the appropriate time.  Any financial support by the State directly to airports or airlines must be accompanied by conditionality that prohibits compulsory redundancies or a reduction in terms and conditions.  We believe that such support is required at levels well above what we have seen to date.<\/p><p>In the absence of the Government taking meaningful action, we simply will not have a functioning aviation sector in this country.  Given we are an open island economy, the country will not recover to the full extent without a functioning aviation sector.  The thousands of people who depend on aviation directly and the hundreds of thousands in the wider economy who need a functioning aviation industry need the Government to act now through the tailored supports for which our union is calling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>Things were bad when we spoke to the committee in October and they have got much worse.  There was no reopening date for travel back then and we assumed it would resume in the second quarter of 2021.  This has now been pushed out to the first quarter of 2022 with no prospect of international travel in 2021.  Last Thursday on \"Prime Time\", the Taoiseach said that travel had totally collapsed and that some of the measures are a deterrent to travel and will have an impact.  On 1 February at the daily NPHET briefing, the Chief Medical Officer said it is not realistic to expect people can fly to Europe or other destinations for summer holidays and the only beach they are likely to travel to is their local one.  We now have the &euro;500 fine for anyone travelling for nonessential reasons.  There is clearly no doubt that travel agents cannot trade.<\/p> <p>  We, as an industry, are responsible and customer focused.  We have always and will continue to follow public health guidelines.  However, if NPHET and the Government want to close down international travel for a year, they need to put in place the appropriate level of support if they want an Irish travel industry when international travel can safely resume.  We are a unique sector in that we have had to remain open to clients to facilitate refunds with practically zero income for almost two years.  The travel sector needs a bespoke response with a specific support as a consequence of being closed on public health grounds linked to international travel.<\/p> <p>  Let me summarise the supports in place.  The travel industry is accessing the EWSS similar to other sectors.  The scheme is available when turnover is down at least 30%.  We are more than 90% down and for 2021 we could be 100% down.  We also have no visibility on wage supports after 31 March.  Most of the travel industry is accessing the Covid restriction support scheme, CRSS.  This is designed to assist with nonpayroll costs.  To qualify, a business must be 75% down on turnover compared to 2019 and it applies from level 3 and above.  The travel industry has been told the scheme only applies to it at levels 4 and 5.  This is an advanced tax credit; it is not a grant.  The maximum threshold of &euro;5,000 per week seems reasonable provided turnover is &euro;4 million per year or less but for any travel company above this level the support simply does not cover non-payroll costs to any material extent.  This is a retail-focused assistance and does not cover all Irish licensed travel companies.  The CRSS does not support a downturn in business and is directly linked to the levels in the Covid framework but, clearly, travel agents are prevented from trading irrespective of the levels, and have been since March 2020.<\/p> <p>  The Government introduced the refund credit note scheme in summer 2020.  This is a cash flow mechanism to assist with delayed supplier refunds.  We need to be clear that the refund credit note is not a grant, a subsidy or a support.  It is a pure cash flow mechanism introduced with a nine-month delay on the assumption that the industry would be back trading.  Clearly this is not the case and we need a solution to this issue similar to the approaches adopted with EU approval in Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal, Bulgaria and others.<\/p> <p>  This brings us to the issue of airlines refunds or the lack thereof.  When we spoke to the committee last October, we outlined the potential reason for the delay on the part of one particular airline being down to a conflict over two EU directives that impact the travel industry.  This has turned out to be the case and we can go into more detail in the question-and-answer session.  The fact is that a significant number of refunds to customers for cancelled flights are outstanding.  Given the current talk of no international travel for 2021, we need to discuss the issue of consumer protection and refunds when flights operate contrary to Government advice on travel.  These are known as \"ghost flights\" and the ultimate loser is the consumer.<\/p> <p>  Committee members may also recall that the ITAA called for pre-departure airport testing when we addressed the committee back in October 2020.  The aviation recovery task force, the airports and airlines also called for predeparture airport testing.  What ensued was a debate with the medics over which test should be used and none was introduced.  Subsequently, we have been dealing with the issue of variants of Covid that arrived into Ireland in late 2020.  Was predeparture airport testing a missed opportunity?<\/p> <p>  When we addressed the committee in October, there was no talk of vaccines.  The State is spending &euro;1 billion a week in supports and related costs and we are being told there is a vaccine supply issue.  There does not appear to be a supply issue for some countries and given this is a life-saving opportunity, it appears that we are lagging well behind in getting the vaccine into the arms of our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hackett"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1091,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hackett. <\/p> <p>  We have about 21 minutes remaining and eight members can have 2.5 minutes each.

It was in a closed period until a couple of weeks ago.  Aer Lingus is part of IAG and is in a closed period.  It will announce its results at the end of February or in early March.  During these periods, the airlines cannot talk to anybody about their financial state.  Other airlines have indicated to us that they asked for assistance from the Government.  If we are to believe those executives, they said none was forthcoming.  We understand however that there has been some discussion with the Government.  That is all confidential, based on market sensitive rules on share prices and so on.<\/p> <p>  There are aviation economists in IALPA whom we use for various negotiations.  The airlines need assistance in the form of direct State aid.  They cannot take on any more loans on their balance sheets.  It is important to note that when we last spoke, there was a reference in the committee's report to green shoots for 2021.  It came as an enormous surprise to us in January when the Government effectively closed international travel for the summer of 2021.  Every assumption we built into our plans was that we would get to a space of at least 70% of the 2019 production in 2021.<\/p> <p>  That has now been scuppered.  We will be lucky if in 2021 we get to 10% of the 2019 level of production.  Therein lies the problem.  We will also go into 2021 without the cash we had in 2020.  A lot of bookings were made in early 2020 for the summer of 2020.  That booking cash is no longer available and we are going into a zero revenue 2021.  Problem after problem is being heaped on us.  All the assumptions for getting out of this crisis have now proved to be false.  It looks like there will be a recovery in quarter 1 or 2 of 2022, if there are any airlines to take on that recovery.  That problem is massive and cannot be dealt with through loans from ISIF.  It has to be dealt with through direct financial State aid.  That is now the only way out of this. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>I apologise for the time constraints but we have no choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021020900002#V00400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>In regard to the scheme are making reference to, it is the short-time work benefit scheme, kurzarbeit.

In the second half of the meeting, Mr. Paul Kelly from Food Drink Ireland's food and drink sector will participate.  As we are all aware, Brexit has had serious implications for the Irish economy and the business sector.

As far back as 2017, IBEC published our first guide and toolkit for business to address the decision of the UK to leave the EU.  The central priority of our campaign continues to be to provide our members with clear and actionable guidance to address these challenges, focusing on four central themes of trade in goods, trade in services, the shared island economy and the labour market.<\/p> <p>  In 2020 and continuing this year, IBEC has held an extensive series of virtual briefings to provide practical guidance to our members to help companies prepare for the significant challenges that Brexit presents.  These briefings cover a range of critical issues for business, including dedicated sessions on customs, trade and VAT preparations, international data transfers, business readiness, the UK land bridge and direct routes to the Continent, and the all-island economy.  In support, the campaign has collaborated closely with key stakeholders and decision-makers in Dublin, London and Brussels, including the Revenue Commissioners, the Departments of Transport, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Foreign Affairs, and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Data Protection Commission, the UK Government and the European Commission.  Recently, we hosted a member briefing with the Commission's task force for relations with the UK and its colleagues in relevant Directorates General.  More than 3,000 individual member companies have engaged with our sessions in this period.  IBEC has also provided regular briefings for our industry sector associations and worked closely with our colleagues on initiatives to help our members in the most impacted areas prepare.  One of my colleagues, Mr. Paul Kelly, director of Food Drink Ireland, will also provide a briefing to the committee today.<\/p> <p>  The promised transition period for business was eroded by protracted negotiations, leaving little time for business to adjust to the new trading arrangements finally agreed on 24 December and signed by the European Commission, Council President and the UK Prime Minister only the day before the transition ended on 31 December.<\/p><p>Even now, the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, remains to be formally approved by the European Parliament following its scrutiny.<\/p><p> The trading conditions for business with our nearest neighbour are now very different, involving complex customs procedures and more costly transport options which are posing daily difficulties to our members as they, together with the customs officials, adjust to new processes for trading with Britain and digest the specificities of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  There have been and continue to be teething problems with customs controls on which we are in regular dialogue with the Revenue Commissioners and the other agencies.  In the coming months we expect challenges to continue as trade volumes rise as stockpiles run out and Covid-19 measures lighten, notwithstanding the UK gradually introducing full customs controls over the coming months, which will impact on our exports to the UK later this year.<\/p><p> The completion of the EU-UK TCA was welcomed by IBEC and Irish business compared with the consequences of a no deal scenario.  After nearly 50 years of co-operation within the EU, the negotiations were always going to be prolonged and difficult.  In this context, the TCA, however imperfect, must be welcomed as a strong platform for a future positive economic relationship between the EU and the UK.  Regardless of its scale, which is very significant and which includes an unprecedented no tariffs or tariff quotas for bilateral trade in goods, the impact on supply chains and east-west trade is seismic.  However, we all must recognise that, unlike traditional free trade agreements, this is not about bringing two parties closer together but rather about dealing with divergence as two parties move apart as the UK exits the EU Single Market and the customs union.<\/p><p> As has been well noted in recent weeks, the rules of origin provisions in the TCA are problematic for Irish business, including a requirement for tariffs to be paid on goods of EU origin which have entered free circulation in Britain or costly and complex customs procedures to avoid goods entering free circulation.  These provisions are not without reason; rather, they are a direct result of the UK&rsquo;s will for a very different relationship with the EU and its decision to leave the EU Single Market and the customs union. However, for Irish businesses which rely on the British market, the UK land bridge, or British suppliers, these changes are fundamental and, for some, existential.<\/p><p> With regard to trade in services, the UK&rsquo;s commitment to stopping the free movement of people with the EU has resulted in the anticipated restrictive, fragmented and complex relationship.  Here, I must underline that there are and will be impacts for the island because Northern Ireland is a third country of the EU for services.  It is welcome that the EU and the UK agreed to market access, national treatment and a most-favoured nation clause, in line with the World Trade Organization, WTO, among other respects.  However, a stronger relationship on services cannot be attained without the foundation of the free movement of people.  In the context of the common travel area, this is a real positive for Irish and UK citizens.  However, this limited agreement does not cover other EU citizens and poses challenges to critical issues for people and businesses such as the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.  We recognise and welcome the EU&rsquo;s pragmatic approach, including providing a temporary mechanism to permit the free flow of data for four months, extendable to six, while it works to finalise a unilateral data adequacy decision. The importance of rapidly agreeing such longer term arrangements to facilitate data flows North-South and east-west cannot be overstated as the environment for business undergoes even more digital transformation.<\/p><p> These are simply a few examples of the difficulties and challenges facing Irish business because of the UK&rsquo;s decision to depart the EU Single Market and customs union.  We welcome the ambition of the EU and the UK to reach a trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, that achieves as close as possible a relationship given the UK&rsquo;s restrictive red lines. However, we also recognise that principles to ensure a level playing field and governance structures were extremely challenging issues to agree and despite the positive elements of the deal, we must put it in context that it still constitutes a relatively hard Brexit.  We urge the Irish Government, the UK Government and the EU authorities to therefore work collectively with business to support our supply chains in adapting to entirely different trading conditions with the UK.<\/p><p> On 17 December, the EU and the UK reached a pragmatic, flexible and critical agreement on the implementation of the protocol following a protracted period of difficult negotiations because of the UK&rsquo;s threat to renege on its commitment in international law via the United Kingdom Internal Market Act.  The protocol, we must remind ourselves, is a creative solution to a series of mutually exclusive problems to facilitate the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU while at the same time ensuring peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland by protecting the Good Friday Agreement, the integrity of the EU Single Market and our shared island economy.  It is the agreed solution to meet these non-negotiable objectives and must be supported and advanced on a continuous basis.  <\/p><p> The protocol is already playing a key role with regard to supporting the business operations of all-island supply chains in areas such as dairy and drinks, for example, and the whiskey sector, which is a very positive outcome of the agreement for those important exporting sectors.  <\/p><p> The European Commission&rsquo;s shortsighted proposal to activate the Article 16 safeguard clauses of the protocol was at best regrettable.  However, we welcome that this misjudged error was swiftly corrected and Article 16 in fact was not triggered and that the Commission has since iterated and demonstrated its steadfast commitment to respecting the protocol in full and in close co-operation with its partners in Ireland, Britain and Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> We welcome the dialogue between the EU-UK co-chairs of the joint committee, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi and Michael Gove, towards addressing outstanding issues and wish to underline that this is the time for mutual effort to solidify the protocol with peace and stability as the core objectives.  We hope that some progress can be made in that regard in the meeting of the joint committee for implementation of the protocol this week. <\/p><p> Irish businesses, from multinational corporations to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, have worked diligently to prepare and adjust as much as possible to the new trading relationship.  However, it must be acknowledged and understood that business has been preparing in uniquely challenging circumstances.  The dual threat is the continued extraordinary trading complications caused by Brexit combined with the evolving consequences of Covid-19.  Compounding this is the reality that clarity on the rules which apply to businesses trading with Britain continue to ebb and be understood due to the sheer complexity and scale of the changes.<\/p><p> Despite the best efforts of Irish business and the authorities, the challenge is huge to be fully ready for the profound, overnight changes that the end of the transition period has brought. To immediately adjust in a short timeframe to a radically new trading and economic relationship with one of our closest trading partners is neither possible nor realistic, particularly for companies in the most exposed sectors.  The avoidance of tariffs and quotas is welcome, but it does not avoid the customs and regulatory barriers which have caused major trade and economic disruption.<\/p><p>IBEC's work to support our members will continue and we look forward to continuing our positive and constructive engagement with Government, the EU institutions and our business partners in the EU and the UK.  We welcome the significant Government supports and the EU Brexit adjustment reserve, of which Ireland will receive the highest allocation, and we note that the Government needs to bear the ensuing uncertainty in mind and ensure that adequate and agile supports are available to business as the practical consequences of Brexit become apparent.  These supports must prioritise and be quickly available to the worst affected sectors to offset the economic consequences of the UK's exit from the European Union.

I also thank Mr. Willoughby and IBEC more generally for the information that is given to business and to Members of the Oireachtas around the impact on business.  I was glad that Dr. Ivory mentioned the importance of getting arrangements concerning the free flow of data.  I have concerns that if there is not a clear data regime in place in the UK, that will have long-term implications here, particularly for the services sector.  Dr. Ivory might talk a bit more on that.<\/p> <p>  I will throw out a couple of questions which are looking into the future and at what will happen with business.  I am from Wexford and Rosslare has experienced a long-overdue boom in traffic as a result of Brexit.  Will Dr. Ivory comment on the infrastructure at our ports that we need to develop to ensure we can further realise the potential of those ports, particularly Rosslare?  Will he talk about IBEC's plans for marketing Ireland?  As an English-speaking, pro-European member of the European Union, we will be an attractive destination, particularly for services but for foreign direct investment generally.  Will Dr. Ivory outline how IBEC will help to promote that and what Government should do?  Dr. Ivory did not mention skills.  In relation to customs and so on, are there identifiable skills shortages as a result of Brexit that Government should address?  Are there such shortages on the part of business?<\/p> <p>  I will talk about the importance of international trade agreements.  In a post-Brexit scenario, it is increasingly important for the EU to further develop as many trade agreements as we can, including, in my view, the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, with Canada.  Will Dr. Ivory comment on why those trade agreements are important?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021020900002#E00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1145,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne.  It is nice to see him again.  Data adequacy is an area we are putting a lot of attention on.  We have had a number of engagements with the Data Protection Commissioner and with the European Union on the importance of establishing a data adequacy agreement and getting it in place as quickly as possible.  We had a meeting this week with the EU's Task Force for Relations with the United Kingdom and it confirmed that it is in the process of completing the review for that data adequacy decision.  It is a significant positive that the UK, because of its membership of the EU up to the end of last year, has a data protection regime in line with that of other EU member states.  We feel that data flows are critical, not only for the technology sector but for all parts of Irish business.  Irish business and international business in Ireland could not operate without the ability of data to flow across borders.  That is something we are committed to.<\/p><p>On the Senator's questions regarding ports and further port infrastructure development, one thing that has been welcomed by business is the range of routes now available for transport directly to the Continent.  Rosslare has been instrumental in introducing some of those new routes, including the Rosslare-Dunkirk route.  Other roll-on roll-off services have also been developed by Rosslare Europort.  These are important additions.  While the land bridge will continue to be important for a lot of business, we have also seen increased demand for new alternative routes and that has been very apparent from the early weeks of the implementation of the agreement.<\/p><p> On the plans for the marketing of Ireland, IBEC has been developing an international and global outreach in recent years.  We do a lot of joint work with partners in the United States.  We make sure that is part of our plans every year and it will be this year as well.  We have also worked closely with other European business federations to build strategic partnerships as the UK leaves the European Union.  We are now the only English-speaking member of the EU so that has to be a selling point.  We also have a business model of substance which is in line with the guidelines of the OECD.  It attracts foreign direct investment and we intend that model to continue to develop and attract such investment.  That is good for Irish business, Irish workers and the Irish consumer.  That is a big part of our strategy going forward.<\/p><p> On skills and identifiable shortages, it is apparent in the area of trade and customs that the skills available are limited.  There will be a need for more people to be involved in this area, particularly as the year progresses.  On the import side, we are already facing those challenges.  We will face them in greater degree on the export side from 1 April and then again from July, when the UK introduces its own administrative customs controls, which have been paused for the time being.  They will introduce new controls as the year goes on and those kinds of skills will be needed.  In that regard, the support the Government has offered, that is, the &euro;9,000 grant or &euro;4,500 if it is on a part-time basis, is something we have encouraged our members to look at to support the building of customs capabilities within customs agents and trading companies.<\/p><p> On the importance of other trade agreements, we are committed to that objective.  The Senator mentioned CETA, which is an important agreement and has been provisionally applied.<\/p><p>It is still to be ratified in Ireland and it has been ratified, I think, by 13 other countries.  We are very much in favour of its ratification and believe it offers fantastic opportunities for Irish and Canadian business.  We have been working in partnership with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce to highlight the importance of the agreement.  Mr. Danny McCoy had an opinion piece recently with the Canadian chamber to highlight what CETA has to offer for businesses both in Ireland and in Canada.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021020900002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat Ivory","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1148,"content":"<p>I apologise to the witnesses for missing the initial part of the presentation.

What engagement has the organisation had with counterparts and other stakeholders in the North to discuss harnessing and developing the all-Ireland economy?

If this is an unfair question, please tell me, as it could be work in progress.  It is encouraging to hear of the level of engagement between the various groups, organisations and stakeholders.  Is IBEC at a point, or does it intend to get to a point, where, for example, it could inform the groups it represents and lobbies on behalf of about some of the opportunities?  Is there a bespoke set of information guidelines or reports indicating the economic benefits to members' businesses or companies of working on an all-Ireland basis and, through the protocol that has been mentioned, between both islands?

It is something we raised yesterday with the Commission and we are hoping to follow up on it in the coming days and weeks to understand how it can be done in a more co-ordinated fashion, given the protection that exists under the protocol.

There is the difficulty that I did not hear Mr. Kelly at the beginning.  Are the requisite documents to facilitate the movement of goods flowing quickly and with efficiency?

I thank Mr. Ivory and Mr. Kelly for their presentations and I thank the Chairperson for this opportunity.  Am I getting an impression, because it was discussed last week and I wish to raise it again, that Mr. Ivory and Mr. Kelly are saying to us that the protocol is settling down after the Commission's approval, that we are back on an even-enough keel, that it is levelling out now and they do not anticipate a further challenge to the protocol?

Business can continue to be done, North and South.  On the whole, the protocol is a major bonus for Border communities.  However, there is sometimes a confusion between the conditions of the protocol and the conditions of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  That is presenting problems for business in the North as well as in the South in complying with all the conditions of the TCA.  We are only beginning to understand those conditions fully, for example, conditions on rules of origin, and other issues on the services side such as mutual recognition of professional qualifications, which we have discussed.  The protocol can be a big help, but businesses in the Border communities are still going to face customs procedures in trading product between the EU and the UK in the same way as businesses in the South will, so it is a challenge.  One of the issues we have spoken about, the data adequacy, will have a particular significance for frontier workers and workers going back and forth across the Border.  There is no doubt that it is a changed environment for everybody, so there are challenges for all communities and particularly for an SME in the Border counties, where business is already tough in many respects and there are many challenges.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the food importers and declarations and documents, that is an area where there have been teething problems for businesses across a range of sectors.  The challenge for the authorities and the automated import system of the authorities is that the volume of declarations they have to deal with is huge.  That has caused some glitches in the system and we have been working closely with the Revenue Commissioners to try to help resolve them.  The Revenue Commissioners have been very good in issuing simplification notifications.  There was also a statement yesterday that they recognised that the system has been going down under the volume of traffic and that this has to be addressed and agreed.  We believe that is a good thing.  We have close daily and weekly contact with the Revenue Commissioners and the agencies in trying to address people's issues and problems, and the response has been very good.  When we contact the authorities there has been a willingness to try to solve individual issues.  Sometimes companies can feel that the documents are being delayed for bureaucratic reasons.<\/p><p>It can also transpire that it is important that all of the information provided on these online customs declarations is absolutely correct.

Last week, we met the Northern Ireland Executive committee to discuss the all-island implications of Brexit.  Clearly, the protocol was quite topical last week and it still is.  I listened to Dr. Ivory's opening statement and his comments to Senator O'Reilly in which he stressed the importance of the protocol and the committee certainly agrees with him on this.  I have concerns about the consent mechanism and the vote that is to take place in four years.  The Commission initiating Article 16 was hugely damaging.  We were barely off the ground and this happened.  The political significance on the island is huge and I am not sure the Commission fully grasps how big it is.  It has now become a green versus orange issue.  It will become an election issue in the North.  I do not know whether Dr. Ivory agrees that the business community will have to take a position on it quite early on to stress the importance of the protocol to the all-island economy.  Is he concerned from a business perspective about the vote that is to take place in four years and the narrative?  Last week, during an engagement with a media outlet from the North, I was asked whether we should renegotiate the protocol.  I made the point that the protocol came at the end of four years of negotiations.  The conversation on whether we should renegotiate the protocol is really dangerous.  I would welcome Dr. Ivory's views on this.<\/p> <p>  Practically how is the rule of origin impacting on businesses in Ireland?  This issue reared its head when the story that Percy Pigs might go up in price hit the headlines.  When it becomes a reality for consumers, that is when we begin to take notice a little bit more.  From a business perspective, how tricky is the rule of origin issue?  Are we close to resolving it?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Ivory mentioned the increase in the cost of transport.  We will have the transport sector before the committee next week, including representatives from the haulage industry and the ports.  How big of an impact has the increased cost of transport had on business?  I am sure IBEC is still probably assessing this damage given that it is early days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021020900002#M00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1170,"content":"<p>With regard to the protocol and the four-year review, it is important that the protocol is given time to be fully implemented and that the value of the implementation of the protocol is properly appreciated.  This is something we want to continue to highlight.  It is just over a month since we had implementation of the protocol and the trade and co-operation agreement.  It is too early to do any assessment as to the full impact of either of the agreements.  I understand completely the concerns the Chair has raised and it is important that business highlights where the protocol is delivering for the shared island economy.<\/p><p>In that context we mentioned dairy processing, drinks processing and the trade area.  We have also mentioned the Manufacturing Northern Ireland survey and the views of the manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland.  IBEC will continue to work with our partners, CBI Northern Ireland, to ensure that, from a business perspective, we are not found wanting in terms of highlighting what the protocol actually delivers for business, for workers and for consumers on the shared island.<\/p><p> The rules of origin area is a real challenge and a bigger one than anybody could have completely planned for.  We only saw the full details of the agreement at the end of December.  The impact of the rules of origin on trade which moves through the UK is complex.  The customs procedures of getting over a product not being seen as entering and having free circulation in the British market, and therefore being subject to tariffs, are quite costly and complex.  This is an issue which is not yet resolved.<\/p><p> There has been some progress in terms of some good guidance and clarification from the European Commission, DG TAXUD, Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union and the Revenue Commissioners.  We are still assessing the costs and complexities of this, however.  There is the reality that, in some instances, businesses will take other options and may look at direct routes.  They may look at avoiding the kind of customs procedures and rules of origin that arise by transporting their product direct from continental Europe to Ireland, such as using the Rosslare-Dunkirk route for example.<\/p><p> It is a highly technical and challenging issue.  We continue to be concerned and work hard on it.  We continue to have discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on particular sectors, such as the bread bakers sector and the impact of rules of origin for it and whether some level of grace period or derogation could be given to sectors to look at other options, supply chains, etc.<\/p><p> There is the increased cost of transport.  It is clear that this was an issue for which companies prepared.  We know a number of our members put substantial budgets in place to deal with the increased costs of customs and transport.  Equally we know that, for SMEs in particular, these costs will be more difficult to overcome.  It is early days.  Hopefully, as the systems become smoother and some of the problems of the early weeks are ironed out, some of the costs of meeting the customs procedures, as well as the transfer costs involved, will actually decline and there will be a smoother movement of trade to our ports.<\/p><p> I would not like, however, to give the impression that after one month we are there.  We are not.  This is going to be a long year in addressing both the issues on the import side and then, from April and July, the export side.

Food Drink Ireland welcomes the opportunity to appear before the special select committee to discuss the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA.  I will address the initial experience of the industry in the first six weeks of the agreement, some specific issues that have arisen or will arise and the measures that we think are needed.<\/p> <p>  FDI has welcomed the agreement reached between the EU and the UK as disastrous tariffs have largely been avoided but the agreement reached is still very much a hard Brexit.  The UK has left the Single Market and the customs union and this has introduced a number of barriers to trade with Great Britain, in particular.  Food and drink companies face substantial non-tariff barriers to trade between Ireland and Great Britain with customs, SPS, sanitary and phytosanitary, and other food safety requirements.  This is happening when the sector also faces the twin challenge of the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p>  Looking first at imports, movement of shipments through the ports continues to improve but there are still teething problems, although lessening, with both SPS and customs controls.  We and our members continue to communicate these problems to the authorities as they arise and they are dealt with accordingly.  Dr. Pat Ivory talked about that in the last session.  As stockpiles decline and we move into traditionally higher volume months, there is the potential for more delays.  It points to the need to quickly resolve teething problems and for businesses to continue to adapt to the new administrative arrangements.<\/p> <p>  Exports to Great Britain have been working reasonably well.  Companies were largely prepared for the new customs formalities which came into effect from 1 January.  However, east-west trade flows have been impacted by difficulties for backloads from Britain, which has materialised as a major problem, leading to shortage of trailers, delays and increasing costs of transport as many trucks return empty to Ireland.<\/p><p> A big concern with Brexit is our reliance on the UK land bridge for trade with continental Europe.  Capacity and frequency of direct sailings to the Continent has been increased.  Further capacity is needed however, as the welcomed new capacity is well below the volume of traffic that has been using the land bridge.  Exporters are still using the UK land bridge by necessity, focusing in the early weeks on transit through the UK to Holland, in other words, taking the east of England route, but exporters are also now trying the Dover-Calais route.  Additional processes are required, some delays are experienced and additional costs are associated with the paperwork and the transit guarantee facilities which are being incurred.  The land bridge will continue to be an important route to market for Irish food and drink exporters.<\/p><p> The rules of origin in the TCA are severely disadvantaging the food and drink sector, and Irish consumers.  Here are three examples.  First, there is no industrial milling capacity in the Republic of Ireland and all flour for the plant bakeries is imported.  The majority of that comes from Britain.  The specification for much of the flour we import has a Canadian wheat content in excess of 15%.  This exceeds the tolerance level in the rules of origin and the full tariff of &euro;172 per tonne is imposed, which is equivalent to a 50% price increase on a tonne of flour.  FDI and the bakery sector are seeking a derogation for a period of time on the basis of the unique position of Ireland in not having an alternative supply as there is no industrial milling capacity in Ireland.<\/p><p> Second, many companies have evolved supply chains that stretch to the Continent and utilise British distribution hubs to serve the Irish market.  This model reflects the most cost-effective way for many companies to serve the small and physically distant Irish market, but under the rules of origin, they now face paying a full tariff on goods despite them originating in the EU.  To date some of the more immediate solutions, such as returned goods relief, are complex and costly to administer.  Simplifications are needed to allow this relief to be used on a more systematic basis.<\/p><p> My final example would be dairy products which are processed from the mixed North-South milk pool.  They will not be able to avail of the preferential tariffs in the many free trade agreements that the EU has negotiated with third countries.  Additionally, there are doubts over their ability to access a number of the Common Market tools, such as private storage aid and intervention.  Spirits will be similarly affected as regards free trade agreements.<\/p><p> One area of transport-logistics that has been severely hampered is groupage transport.  Shared loads, with multiple pick-ups or drop-offs, which are important to operators both large and medium or small, have become an important part of an efficient and cost-effective delivery system from Ireland to other markets.  However, experience to date is that groupage transport is severely challenged by the new post-Brexit procedures.<\/p><p> We are also equally focused on the forthcoming challenges for our food exports to Britain as the second phase of the UK's border operating model takes effect from 1 April.  Irish exporters will face a new sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, regime for products of animal origin such as meat and dairy with veterinary certification requirements, additional administration requirements and additional costs.  From 1 July, when the third phase of the border operating model kicks in, Irish agrifood exports consignments will have to enter the UK through ports with border control post facilities and will be open to SPS controls - identification and documentary checks and physical examinations.  This step presents further potential for disruption to logistics.<\/p><p> In the months ahead a big concern is regulatory divergence.  As early as April we will see changes in European legislation in areas such as certification - changes that UK probably will not adopt or adopt completely.  As these grow more frequent there needs to be an awareness of the closeness of the Irish and UK markets in terms of issues such as distribution systems and common packaging and the unique difficulties that will therefore be faced by Irish producers and suppliers.  The scope for divergence in regulation and standards potentially increases further in the medium to long term, especially as the UK completes trade deals with other global partners.  This presents a significant new competitive threat for our food exports to the UK.<\/p><p> A trade specialised committee on SPS measures is provided for in the TCA.  Part of the remit of the committee is for the EU and UK to review the SPS regime.  We believe it should be established quickly as it is the main route to achieve SPS easements and mitigate delays, administrative burdens and costs.  However, it is subject to both the EU and the UK engaging and reaching agreement on this issue.<\/p><p> As we look to the future, in addition to resolving the issues I have outlined, our priorities must be to maintain our valuable UK market position and continue to diversify our exports to the rest of the EU and further afield.  Last week's announcement by Government of the capital investment programme for food processing is welcome.  It will need to be supplemented by a lot more funding, both from Ireland's &euro;1 billion allocation from the Brexit adjustment reserve and from budget 2021&rsquo;s recovery fund.  This is needed for a number of measures: a wage subsidy scheme for Brexit impacted firms; an extension in state aid support; the budget 2021 recovery fund to be extended beyond 2021; investment aid to support competitiveness; market diversification supports; and a State-backed export credit insurance scheme.<\/p><p> I thank the committee again for the invitation to appear before it today and I look forward to answering the members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021020900002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1179,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for his comprehensive opening statement and the many issues he has outlined.

I have a specific question.  I did not fully understand Mr. Kelly.  Am I correct that Mr. Kelly is saying that, as it stands, there is a &euro;170 tariff on each tonne of flour coming into the country?  If I understood him correctly, Mr. Kelly stated that we do not have domestic flour and we import all our flour and that there would be a &euro;170 per tonne tariff on it if we could not get a derogation.  That would surely have significant implications for the price of bread, which is a fairly basic requirement.  Maybe Mr. Kelly would elaborate for those of us who do not fully grasp this.  He might explain how that will work out and whether derogation would be got from it.  That has significant implications.<\/p> <p>  I come from a Border county.  Could Mr. Kelly elaborate on what he stated about the milk?  There is significant interplay in respect of milk between Cavan and Monaghan and the North.  For example, more than half of the milk Lakeland Dairies in Bailieborough sources is from Northern Ireland.  That experience would be repeated along the Border.  Did Mr. Kelly say there were difficulties around that milk and that the food processing of baby powder, drinks or whatever is processed from the milk and butter in those areas will in some way be at a disadvantage in terms of pricing and the supports it would get?  Would Mr. Kelly elaborate on that as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021020900002#Q00300","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1181,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Reilly.  First, looking at the flour issue, the Senator is correct.  There is no industrial milling capacity in the Republic of Ireland.  There is one mill but it is largely doing consumer packs.  For the big bulk tankers that are required to deliver to the main bakeries around the country, it all has to come in from outside Ireland.<\/p> <p>  There are two mills in Belfast.  They would supply a significant amount of flour to the South.  Obviously, under the protocol, no tariffs apply.  That is all fine.  There is not much scope for additional supplies from them.  They are running at capacity.<\/p> <p>  The majority of our flour comes from Britain, and a small amount comes from the Continent.  Obviously, that which comes from the Continent will not face the tariffs.<\/p> <p>  The problem is the particular specification for flour.  The likes of sliced pans, in the main, require a lot of high-protein Canadian wheat.  The tolerance levels in the rules of origin essentially mean that one can have non-originating raw materials up to a maximum of 15%.  \"Non-originating\" means they come from outside either the EU or the UK.  In this case, they come from Canada.  If one exceeds that 15% tolerance, one loses the preferential tariff access, in other words, the full tariff applies.  In the case of flour, the tariff is &euro;172 per tonne.<\/p><p>It is one of those rules of origin issues.  The unique circumstances in Ireland are that we simply do not have a domestic alternative in terms of milling capacity for flour, and to source from the Continent, we run up against two problems.  One is costs, which are anywhere between &euro;800 and &euro;1,000 extra for each tanker-trailer to be brought from the Continent, as opposed to bringing it from Britain.  Second, everybody will know that if they go into a bakery or the bakery section of a supermarket in Germany or France, it is quite different to what is seen here in Ireland.  The flour that is produced there is made, naturally enough, for the specifications of the bakeries in those countries, so getting the exact flour specification we require here is very difficult.  Therefore, we are looking for a derogation for a period of time so our supply chains can be reconfigured.  What we would ultimately like is for the unique circumstances to be recognised to allow us to continue to source the flour we are sourcing, without the impact of the tariff.<br\/><br\/>As I said, it is equivalent to roughly 50% of the cost of flour in the first place.  The ESRI was commissioned to do some work by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission back in 2018 and it estimated that, in the event of a full tariff on cereals and breads, this would equate to about 9% on consumer prices.  That is roughly what we are talking about.<br\/><br\/>On the second point in regard to milk, I would preface my remarks by saying that dairy, in particular, is a classic example of the all-island or all-Ireland economy because of the mixed milk pool we have.  By and large, the protocol is working and it is allowing processing to continue very efficiently.  Approximately 9%, or 800 million litres, of the milk processed in the South comes from Northern Ireland, so it is a significant component and, obviously, for the processors close to the Border, the percentage is much higher.  There is no particular issue when the product is being sold in the UK or in the rest of the EU, or domestically here in Ireland.  The concerns we have are twofold.  Under the rules of origin in other free trade agreements, if one meets the rules of origin, preferential tariff status applies and, typically, that means there are no tariffs and one can sell tariff-free into those countries that the EU has a free trade agreement with.  Unfortunately, the way those free trade agreements are written currently means mixed milk is considered to be non-originating, so it will not be able to avail of those preferential tariff agreements in those free trade agreements.  On the other hand, for other markets where the EU does not have a free trade agreement, for example, China, there is no issue <i>per se<\/i>because a tariff generally applies.  That will apply regardless because there are no rules of origin because there is no free trade agreement.<br\/><br\/>The second point is that we are now discovering that although the European Union has market management tools to deal with difficult times, such as private storage aid and intervention relief, it looks like mixed milk will be problematic in that context as well.<br\/><br\/>What we are seeking in both instances is that all of that mixed milk would be considered to be wholly obtained from the Single Market.  In our view, that is no different to the way Northern Ireland was treated within the protocol as regards being part of the Single Market in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021020900002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1183,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for his very comprehensive presentation.

However, certainly in my own experience of shopping at home in Belfast, I have noticed a change in some of the produce that is on the shelves.  For example, I am seeing a bit more of the guaranteed Irish logo.  I wonder about the reorientation of supplies, North and South, and the opportunities that Mr. Kelly would foresee for companies in the South to provide to suppliers and supermarkets in the North that they would not have provided to previously.<\/p><p>I wonder if companies are being made aware of the potential in that reorientation.  I understand it is not as large a market as some others.  However, with the changing nature of the dynamic as a result of Brexit and, as Mr. Kelly said, with all of the out-workings of the protocol and the withdrawal agreement, it might be something that can be built on in the future.

There would be more UK products.  There are certainly opportunities but, to go back to some of the points from the previous session, some of the final outcomes of the joint committee on 17 December simply did not provide time for companies to prepare, whether that is companies in Northern Ireland or their pre-existing suppliers from Britain.  We can see why some of those grace periods are needed but, where we have certain supply difficulties, that does create supply opportunities for other companies as well.<\/p> <p>  Companies will be looking at all markets.  Perhaps southern companies will be looking with some trepidation at 1 April and the introduction of a lot more non-tariff barriers, given what they see happening in Dublin, Belfast and the other ports currently is going to start facing them from 1 April as well.

I echo the concerns of Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and Mr. Kelly around the issue of flour.  In the context of our own report, this is a serious issue.  Stafford Bakeries, based in Wexford, is one of the largest bread manufacturers in the south east and, indeed, in the country, and it has raised this as a concern with me.  If we allow a situation where bread and bread product prices increase by the order of 9%, as Mr. Kelly suggested, that has a knock-on inflationary impact, given the significant role that bread and bread products play in the basket of goods.  I ask that we look at this.  I would stress that, even in the short term, we try to get clarity around that derogation and that, as a committee, we would push for that.<\/p> <p>  Related to that, in the long run, given what is likely to happen, or if worst-case scenario difficulties were to happen in terms of supply from Britain, does Mr. Kelly think there is the possibility of the establishment of an industrial mill or that, in other words, we could try to produce flour domestically?  Would that be economically viable?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kelly mentioned market diversification, export supports and the export credit guarantee scheme.  He might briefly outline how he would envisage they might operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021020900002#S00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>On consumer prices, both the flour issue and the distribution hubs issue, as it is sometimes referred to in the context of rules of origin, have the potential to seriously impact consumer pricing.<\/p><p>That tariff will have to be absorbed at various points along the supply chain from the producer the whole way to the consumer.  How that will ultimately pan out will be a matter for producers and retailers in terms of the extent to which they can absorb or pass on that cost.<\/p><p> The alternatives being proposed, such as reconfiguring supply chains, distribution centres and all the rest, can be done.  All of these problems can be solved provided enough money is thrown at them.  The concern is that food, ultimately, is a staple.  It hits the pocket of the consumer quite quickly if costs are imposed in the system.  It is largely a low-margin business.  There is not much room for manoeuvre at various points along the supply chain from farmer to food company or even retailers.  They all tend to work off relatively tight margins.  We will see some degree of reconfiguration of supply chains over time.  One of the things that companies are looking for is time.  If things have to change, how will they change and be paid for?  That takes time.<\/p><p> In respect of the imposition of tariffs, they examined things like inward and outward processing relief.  They had to make major changes to comply with EU food law.  Many companies which import from the UK and Ireland are required to have an EU address on the food package.  A lot of them had UK addresses.  All of that had to be changed.  That takes many months because packaging, stock and so on had to be changed.  Companies worked on this for a long time but were very much blindsided by a number of the rules of origin issues.  Ultimately, there will be an impact on the consumer unless some leeway is given.<\/p><p> The bottom line for us in respect of the lack of milling capacity in Ireland or the distribution issue is that we are a small island with a relatively small market of 5 to 7 million people in total, off another island and continental Europe.  We are geographically distant and numerically quite small.  They are the realities that need to be taken account of when considering things like supply chains.  That is why the supply chains which have evolved largely use distribution hubs in the middle of England, and why over the years there has been consolidation in the milling sector and a number of mills in Ireland have closed.<\/p><p> There may well be an opportunity for a new mill in Ireland, but it is worth bearing in mind that the particular flour types which are required to produce the bread that consumers want in Ireland will still require a lot of flour to be imported from outside of Ireland because it will need to have a higher protein content.  That is a point of consideration to bear in mind.<\/p><p> One major issue is the impact on Union citizens and businesses.  We face the crazy situation with regard to bread that a UK bakery could produce it using the same flour we discussed over the past two minutes and sell it in Ireland without attracting a tariff, whereas an Irish bakery will have to import flour on which a tariff will apply and will be at a competitive disadvantage as a result.  Similarly, a French yoghurt producer which brings a load of yoghurt into a distribution hub in Britain, breaks it down and builds it back up again as an order and then sends it to Ireland will face a tariff, whereas a UK yoghurt producer selling into Ireland will not face a tariff.  Union citizens and producers are being disadvantaged.<\/p><p> On export credit insurance, there is currently a state aid derogation which has been extended a number of times.  It is one of the state aid measures the Commission introduced in response to the pandemic.  It brought in the export credit insurance derogation because, as it stated very plainly, there is not sufficient private market capacity.<\/p><p>The state has to step in.  In most European countries the state has stepped in and provided state backed export credit insurance.  Ireland is an outlier at this stage, which is extremely disappointing.  It is particularly disappointing for agrifood and drink because we account for the majority of the indigenous manufactured exports.  Therefore, we will be the biggest users of export credit insurance.<\/p><p> The problem is that if we are competing for business in, for example, Germany with a Dutch or Danish food company, such companies will have a competitive advantage because they have access to state backed export credit insurance in their countries.  We do not, and this will be taken into account in terms of how we pitch for business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021020900002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1190,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly.  I very much appreciate his bluntness in saying it as it is.  It has been very refreshing.  When he said we are geographically distant and numerically small, that was a nice way of putting it.  We punch above our weight, but we also need to recognise that there are limitations.  He hit the nail on the head in his remarks.<\/p> <p>  I apologise for fixating on the issue of flour, which other members have raised.  It would have a significant impact on every citizen if the price went up by 9%.  Why have we not seen that price increase to date?  Is it the case that there is a stockpile?  If a derogation is not received, when does Mr. Kelly expect it to impact on the price consumers pay?<\/p> <p>  He made a point on regulatory diversions and said he had concerns that would happen quite soon and become an ever-increasing problem.  This was the conversation over the past four years around the potential for this to happen.  In a lot of instances, it was almost brushed aside as something the UK would not do, and even if it could it would not reduce standards or diverge in terms of regulations because it is of benefit to stay aligned even if it does not have to.  <\/p> <p>  Where is that concern coming from in terms of the food and drink sector?  Why does Mr. Kelly fear that will happen soon and will become an increasing problem?  Is there anything we can do about it?  What are the solutions?  What should the Government look to do?  We will include some of that in our report for the relevant Ministers.<\/p> <p>  There were a lot of conversations before the end of the transition period about the fact that there was a lot of capacity at ports to travel directly to continental Europe, in terms of roll on-roll off or lift on-lift off, and that there was plenty of opportunity to shift from the land bridge to direct access to continental Europe.  Mr. Kelly stated there is no capacity to do that and a lot of exporters are using the land bridge because they have no other choice.  Could he give us an idea of the size of the deficit?  Is there a lot of demand for extra services?  What do we need to do to ensure that any exporter or importer that wishes to stop using the land bridge can get direct access to Europe?<\/p> <p>  One of the constraints of direct access to continental Europe is goods that are perishable or have a short shelf life.  Is there still a difficulty?  The travel time is much increased once the land bridge is bypassed and people go straight to continental Europe.  It is a slower process.<\/p> <p>  How are businesses doing?  How are they coping?  It is early days yet; we are just over a month into a completely new trading environment.  Dr. Ivory made the point that adjusting to a new trading environment does not happen overnight.  It takes time and we have just started on a long road.  As a representative body for businesses in the country, how are Mr. Kelly's members doing?  <\/p> <p>  As a committee, we are assessing the current supports available today from Government for business.<\/p><p>Are they adequate?  Are they working?  Are they effective?  Do they need to be adjusted in any way, or are additional new supports required that are currently not in place?  I hope that is not too much.  Those are my thoughts and questions on what Mr. Kelly has said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021020900002#U00200","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1192,"content":"<p>I will go through the questions in sequence.  Ultimately, any price increase will be a matter for individual companies, so I cannot comment directly on that.  What I can say is that even though consumer packs of flour have a relatively long shelf life, the type of flour which is used in industrial processing has a much shorter shelf life.  Companies will generally try to use it within around two weeks of it being milled.  I just want to give the Chair an idea of the flow of the production process.  Also, when that is combined with the silo storage capacity that each of the bakeries have, which generally does not run to much more than a number of days, it can be seen that it is quite an immediate problem for the companies.  The impact is being felt by them already.  I will make a more general point to which I will return at the end.  On the impact from a time perspective, there is a spectrum across the industry, and it is very much determined by the shelf life of the products.  Much of the fresh meat and dairy products are impacted literally from day one, whereas for other companies, where they have been able to stockpile because of the longer shelf lives, they will feel the impact in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p> <p>  On the second point, in respect of regulatory divergence, some very good work has been commissioned by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment from Copenhagen Economics over recent years.  There has been some really good analysis of the different Brexit scenarios.  It was updated at various stages.  One of the scenarios looked at relatively recently - I suppose it would have been last year - was the trade costs under a bare bones FTA, which essentially is what we have.  This was then broken down further, and looked at it with no regulatory divergence and with regulatory divergence.  They were looking at an increase in trade costs of around 4% to 5% for a FTA with no regulatory divergence, and an increase of approximately 14% for a bare bones FTA with regulatory divergence.  What can really be said, considering the pronouncements of the UK in particular, and with the move outside of the Single Market, is that we are talking automatically about regulatory divergence.<\/p> <p>  Regulatory divergence will happen in two ways.  There is the normal, ongoing dynamic of legislative change, and the work that the members, as Senators and legislators, are involved in every day.  We can see that, particularly at the European level, where so many pieces of legislation are programmed in terms of the fact that they are due a change for some reason, whether it is a review, a certain number of years have passed, or new pieces of legislation are required to implement particular policies.  It is happening on an ongoing basis.  In our area alone,for example, we can see very specific changes that are due to happen related to certification for composite products in April 2021.  A huge amount of work is going on as part of the farm to fork strategy which will see major changes to labelling over the next two to three years.  They are just some specific examples.  The UK is also stating that there are some particular areas that it will and wants to diverge on.  There are other areas where it will simply look at the new pieces of European legislation being produced and decide that it is not interested in transposing that legislation, as it would have done previously.  Therefore, divergence can happen very quickly.<\/p> <p>  What does that mean for businesses?  It means a few things.  First, there are additional resources required to keep on top of everything, because now businesses are serving two distinctly different markets from a regulatory perspective.  When it comes to things like packaging, it can result in major headaches for businesses, because until now, by virtue of the common language, Ireland and the UK were treated as one market for packaging purposes for many companies.  This helped from a scale point of view.  If we see changes, as we no doubt will, to labelling requirements, for example, two different production runs will be required.  Again, much of the time it comes back to issues like the small market that is geographically distant.  Where does a business serve the Irish market from?  Does it serve it from the Continent or by running an additional production line in the UK?<\/p><p>All of these things introduce cost and complexity into the market.  It is something that we will need to keep a close eye on.<\/p><p> There are more fundamental policy issues around other areas, such as plastics and pesticides.  Those are just two examples that come to mind.  We may see different approaches being taken by the EU on one side, and the UK on the other.  We will need to balance those.  They may create unintended consequences in terms of our ability to serve markets or to use ingredients from the other market.  <\/p><p> On the question of the impact on businesses, it is really too early to say.  Most of our engagement with the members has been around those teething problems and issues, particularly on the import side.  Companies are most focused on getting their product into market and meeting their commitments to retailers and food service businesses, where they are open.  As I have highlighted in my opening statement, what is important in respect of the issue of the impact on exporters, the big crunch dates will be 1 April and 1 July 2021, when many of the non-tariff barriers that importers are currently facing will start to impact on exporters as well, and those exporting to Britain in particular.<\/p><p> Related to that is the stockpiling issue.  Many companies still have stockpiles.  Those stockpiles are being run down, particularly for the longer shelf life products.  As those stockpiles start to run down and the volumes increase even further for imports, we will see more issues arise for the companies.  However, at this particular moment in time, many of the issues are operational in nature, and the companies are very much focused on keeping those supply chains going.<\/p><p> On the Chair's last point in respect of supports for business, as I mentioned in my opening comments, the capital investment programme for primary meat and dairy is welcome.  The companies will be working on their applications for that.  All the measures really should be predicated on two things.  The first is maintaining our market position in Britain.  As it stands at the moment, our exports can be divided into three, with roughly one third going to the UK, one third going to the EU-26, and one third going to third countries.  The ratios differ depending on whether it concerns meat, dairy, alcohol or prepared consumer foods.  We have valuable positions in all three markets, so it is most important that we manage to maintain our UK market position and potentially grow it.  However, 90% of our growth in recent years has been in respect of exports to the rest of the EU and to third countries.  The measures to both maintain and improve our competitiveness and our ability to produce new products and diversify into those markets, are going to be key.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021020900002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1194,"content":"<p>On the question of the land bridge and the capacity issue-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021020900002#W00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1612828800,"counter":1195,"content":"<p>Sorry, I forgot about that question.  We have been very consistent in what we have said.  Going back many months and into last year, we expressed many concerns and did not accept the view that there was sufficient capacity on the direct routes, particularly for agrifood, where we required accompanied roll on-roll off.  Certainly, there was a lot of capacity for the load on-load off of containers, and unaccompanied roll on-roll off, which takes place where the trailered unit is taken onto the ferry and taken off on the other side.  However, at the same time, despite our concerns, we were told that the market would be able to respond quickly.  That does seem to have been the case since the turn of the year.  We have seen a substantial increase in capacity.  We still have a concern that more capacity is needed but, in a sense, it is going to be for the market to respond to that need and to provide that capacity.  It has been heartening to see the speed at which it has responded to that.  However, there are a couple of points to be made.<\/p><p>The land bridge still remains essential.  It is the quickest route to market.  There are many concerns, particularly about Calais.  It will be some months before those concerns are fully allayed, if they are completely allayed.  Second, by taking the land bridge, a huge amount of sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, and customs administration measures must be put in place.  Those are, by and large, permanent.  They are part of the outcome of the decision of the UK to leave the customs union and the Single Market.  Companies are using some alternative land bridge routes, particularly east of England, to Holland and so on.  Again, the journey times are longer there but it may be more beneficial depending on which markets in continental Europe one wants to hit.  We will need a combination of the land bridge and more direct route capacity.  It is hard to see the ratio that will form but it needs to be a priority issue because ultimately it boils down to the ability of Irish food companies to serve their customers on the continent in a consistent and timely fashion.  It is an easy thing to say but that requires a number of options to be available to those companies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021020900002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1612828800,"counter":1197,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for that very comprehensive reply.
