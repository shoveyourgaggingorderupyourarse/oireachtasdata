I welcome my colleague and friend the Minister of State.  It is good to see him in particular, as he has a strong record on planning and environmental considerations and is a major champion of the Aarhus Convention.  It is important this Commencement matter is dealt with in this way.  It is very timely we are dealing with this item today because there is a very substantial piece in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>by Mr. Colm Keena, the legal affairs correspondent, on new proposals around judicial review.  I have a copy of the edition to hand, which I can give to the Minister of State later when we leave the Chamber.  The article suggests new proposals would see an individual having to pay up to &euro;5,000 and a legal entity &euro;10,000 towards a notice party&rsquo;s costs when a notice party successfully defends a judicial review.  That is outrageous and a disgrace and I hope it will not happen on the watch of the Green Party in government.  I do not think it will.  I am confident enough in the Green Party to know it will resist it and I again call for this to not happen.  The fact that this has even got life and been published in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>must be of concern to environmentalists and to the Green Party.  I opened the newspaper this morning in my office and read of these proposals.<\/p><p>I return to the kernel of the matter.  We know the housing planning system is in crisis over judicial reviews; the Minister of State knows it, I know it and we all know it.  However, it is not the objectors who are the problem but the fact that there are major concerns about strategic housing developments, SHDs.  Submissions were made in an interim report on SHDs and all of them were ignored.  I have engaged exhaustively with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and its documentation and correspondence and have also gleaned knowledge from my active involvement in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I will state three things: An Bord Plean&aacute;la has lost 90% of completed judicial reviews lodged against its decisions on SHDs; An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been the subject of 33 completed judicial reviews since the SHD fast-track process was launched in 2017; and An Bord Plean&aacute;la has lost 29 judicial reviews, 14 of which it conceded without a hearing and 15 which it conceded following the full court hearings and judgments.  That is the reality I want to put on the record of the House.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> There is a problem with the SHDs and we need to address it.  There are concerns about development, industry, jobs and homes, and I share them.  The process is flawed; it is a disgrace and should never have been put into the programme for Government but the Green Party had to compromise.  I engaged with the Green Party and it told me it had to compromise, which I recognise, but let us see the end to the SHD process.  Let us not take it out on environmentalists or citizens.  Let us empower city and county councillors and citizens to engage on an SHD application or any other.  The current SHD plan process excludes individuals from a third-party appeal in their local planning authority.  It excludes environmentalist groups, such as Friends of the Earth and An Taisce, which have a view.  It might not always be the right view but it should be aired.  I acknowledge I am talking to a Minister of State who is fiercely committed to all the engagement to which I refer so let us have that engagement.  If we have to have reform, let us have it on the timelines but let us not penalise or punish people for engaging.  Let us adhere to the principles of the Aarhus Convention, to which the Green Party, including the Minister of State, is committed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#A00500","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this issue.  I share his concerns and his interest in the Aarhus Convention and public participation in general.  I am glad of the opportunity to update Senators on the reform of the judicial review provisions in the Planning and Development Act and the related matter of the proposed establishment of the environmental and planning court, both of which are important commitments in Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.<\/p> <p>The general scheme of the Housing and Planning and Development Bill 2019, which was published in late 2019 and has since been the subject of a public consultation process, sets out an initial outline of the revisions to the judicial review provisions in sections 50 to 50B of the Planning and Developments Acts.  The general scheme was incorporated in the Government's legislation programme for the autumn session of 2020 among the list of the general schemes to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny.  However, given the range of other legislative measures proposed by my Department for scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in the earlier period of the current Government's tenure, it was not possible to progress the general scheme as envisaged.<\/p> <p>Further to the programme for Government commitment on the judicial review provisions and having regard to the increasing number of judicial review challenges being taken against planning decisions, particularly regarding large-scale housing developments such as the SHDs, which is undermining efforts to increase housing supply, combined with the knock-on implications for project delivery, including strategic infrastructure developments under the national development plan required to meet the demands of a growing economy, the Government is now anxious that the legislative process on reforming the judicial review provisions can be activated and progressed as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>My Department is currently engaging with the joint Oireachtas committee on the arrangements in this regard and I hope the process can be facilitated at the earliest opportunity.  However, I assure the House that it is intended that the reforms of the judicial review provisions would be in line with our EU law obligations on public participation under the Aarhus Convention.<\/p> <p>With regard to the proposed new environmental and planning court, it is intended that it will be established as a division of the High Court simultaneous with the coming into effect of the judicial review reforms.  My Department has already been engaging with the Department of Justice on the legislative and practical aspects associated with the establishment of the new court, which will require the resourcing of further dedicated judges upon establishment.<\/p> <p>I support Senator Boyhan on the points raised.  Public participation is and should be a cornerstone of our democracy.  I was involved in cases to test the early provisions of the Aarhus Convention when it came into effect in Irish law.  It is critical that community groups and NGOs have the right to participate fully in our judicial system when it comes to planning.  I support that.  There is a commitment within the programme for Government to move away from token consultation towards a more participative and inclusive planning system.  That is something we would all more than welcome. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#B00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that response.

It is important that communities, individuals and environmental organisations have the right to take legal proceedings without being unduly affected.  That is what the Aarhus Convention is about.

The historical significance of the unit is underestimated.  For the first time in the State's history, we have a dedicated unit whose sole responsibility is to examine policy, infrastructure and the future of this island on an all-island basis.  We see from the recent announcement on Narrow Water bridge and the Ulster Canal a belief in the importance of the shared island and what it can do.  These projects symbolise a belief in the people of the Border region and what it can achieve.  It is right, as we enter a new century, that we look forward progressively and inclusively, harnessing all the talent and resources that this beautiful island holds.  That is why I ask the Department of the Taoiseach's shared island unit to allocate funds to commence inclusive engagement with schools all across the island.  This would symbolise the belief among our young people and their ability to shape the future.  It is necessary that we seek to encourage our young people to dream, imagine and then create the impossible.  Young people look at things without the many barriers we oldies face.  They are the future.  Helping them now to create the future they dream of is our responsibility.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Erin McGreehan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I absolutely commend the work done to date by the thousands of people who have come together in civic engagement sessions.  It is very welcome.  The Acting Chair, Senator Flynn, has been part of this civic engagement also.  My proposal is possibly a model similar to the BT Young Scientist, whereby we create a space for young people to share their views, create projects and challenge themselves on how we move forward together over the next 100 years.  People on the island have worked together for many centuries.  Let us work together, no matter what the constitutional status of the two jurisdictions.  Get young people talking and tackling the issues of unionism and republicanism, how to improve on the <i>status quo<\/i>or how to reunite the island.  It is not us who have to live with the consequences of our decisions, it is our children who must do so.  I want them to create the narrative that we can help to implement.<br\/><br\/>We are in agreement.  From his previous portfolio as education spokesperson, the Minister of State knows, that education creates changes.  It is through education that changes will be made, challenges will be overcome and friendships will be developed.  As a consequence, we will have a positive shared future.  Under this, there will be no doubt this positive future will grow.  Prejudices, mistrust and fear of the unknown will disappear only through this dialogue and increased co-operation.  Education is something in which we all partake and we must educate everyone on the island on our history and our shared history to appreciate one's identity as British or Irish and to encourage a space where one's identity is not threatened by someone else's belief and we can all be confident in ourselves.  This is why I hope the school projects challenging our wonderful young people are a positive step.  I acknowledge the announcement this morning of &euro;40 million for all-Ireland higher education research projects.  It shows the shared island unit has a real emphasis on education and bringing the work of the unit to our secondary schools would be very progressive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#B00800","speaker":"1671","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>My best wishes to the Acting Chair, Senator Flynn, not just in the role this morning, which is significant, but I hope for her and her community that it will become routine and part of the normal fabric of our society.  This is very important.  I thank the Acting Chair for all the work she is doing.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator McGreehan for taking a patriotic approach to the island rather than an ultra-nationalistic approach of division.  Senator McGreehan has taken a unifying approach on the issue of this island, and this is especially relevant given where she comes from on the Border.  I thank her for raising the important role of schools and education.  The Taoiseach has asked me to respond to the points that she has raised.<\/p> <p>The shared island initiative aims to harness the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement to enhance co-operation, connection and mutual understanding on the island, engaging with all communities and traditions to build consensus around a shared future.  The Taoiseach established the shared island unit in his Department to act as a driver and co-ordinator of this whole-of-government approach.  In the budget, the Government established a shared island fund, committing &euro;500 million in capital funding out to 2025, ring-fenced for investment in North-South projects.  The Taoiseach has already announced substantial investments in long-standing all-Ireland projects that, quite frankly, were hanging around for too long, including the Ulster Canal and Narrow Water bridge.  I thank Senator McGreehan for her work in pursuing the Narrow Water bridge project.  It will be not just nationally important infrastructure but also a crucial piece of local infrastructure on the Cooley Peninsula and in south County Down.  As mentioned, research collaboration on the island is also a priority for the fund.  The Government is working with the Northern Ireland Executive, the British Government and other partners to deliver cross-Border capital investments that meet our objectives to enhance our shared island.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government also includes a shared island commitment to expand the North-South school exchange programme.  This affirms the Government's commitment under the New Decade, New Approach agreement to build on the success of the first pilot programme of bringing young people together from schools, North and South, with a target of achieving 100 cross-Border engagements per annum within a five-year period.  This objective is being taken into account as part of the development of the EU PEACE PLUS programme from 2022 onwards, under the theme of empowering and investing in young people.  The PEACE PLUS programme is unique because it is funding by the EU, the Irish Government and the British Government.  With all the talk of division and a lack of a joint approach, the PEACE PLUS programme is a practical example of everybody working together and it is very important.<\/p> <p>A second pilot North-South school exchange programme has received support under the reconciliation fund of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This programme and funding commitment by the Government makes an important contribution to the objective the Senator has raised, of bringing young people in schools throughout the island together, as they look to the future.<\/p> <p>In launching the shared island initiative last October, the Taoiseach initiated the shared island dialogue, to which Senator McGreehan referred, to foster inclusive civic dialogue on key issues for our shared future.  He highlighted the vital role that young people have to play in shaping the future of this island.  The Taoiseach also addressed the first shared island dialogue with young people in November on the theme of new generations and new voices on the Good Friday Agreement.  The participation and contribution of younger generations has been actively sought in the series of shared island dialogues that have been held so far this year.  This will continue to be a priority in the Government's approach to fostering inclusive civic dialogue as part of the shared island initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#C00200","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It is lovely to see her in the Chair today.  I thank the Minister of State for joining us today.  I hope he will provide a pathway to dealing with this very serious issue.  The absence of the Minister in charge is noted.<\/p><p>I have several questions.  What action is the Government taking to deal with the high levels of radon gas which affect more than 500,000 homes?  Does the Minister intend to provide assistance towards grants for testing for radon gas?  Last week, I spoke about radon, which is a radioactive gas linked to 300 lung cancer cases each year.  I spoke about the lethal gas, which is the second largest cause of lung cancer in this country.  I spoke about it creating 14% of the lung cancer cases which present in our hospitals each year.  I also spoke about the fact that one third of this country is classified as a high radon area by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  What I did not mention last week is the fact that we have particular geology in Ireland which means that this radioactive gas is emitted by igneous rocks.  As a result, radon is trapped by our homes at a higher rate than in other countries.  There are 500,000 homes at risk here.  I was shocked to read in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that the members of a household in Sligo were exposed to radiation levels equivalent to having 15 chest X-rays every day because of radon gas in the ground beneath their home.  This dose is 22 times higher than the level regarded as acceptable and left the people in the property at increased risk of lung cancer.  The article to which I refer is a year old.  What has been done about the matter?<\/p><p>Radon gas is odourless, colourless and tasteless.  It seeps through the soil and enters buildings through small cracks, holes or imperfections that may exist in floor areas or gaps around pipes or cables.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is nothing that a household or an employer can do about it.  There is nothing that a family in County Sligo can do about it.  However, there is something that the Government can do about it.  Radon can be tested in homes with a testing kit that costs &euro;50.  If radon is found to be above certain levels, it is recommended that the home undergoes radon remediation works.  An employer that finds radon levels in the workplace that are too high is required, under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, to have radon remediation works carried out to control and eliminate the risks.  Such works may include the installation of a fan-assisted sump.  These sumps can reduce radon levels by up to 90% and cost &euro;1,500.  The costs of &euro;50 and &euro;1,500 may sound like a small sum for such important prevention measures but to homeowners, businesses and employers across the nation who are already stretched with the Covid-19 pandemic, it is no small sum.  The only solution is Government support.<\/p><p>Lung cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the Republic.  To eliminate 300 radon-induced incidences of lung cancer, this cost is significantly less than &euro;100,000 per case.  In the interest of our citizens and taxpayers as human beings, I urge the Government to provide grants to support the cost of preventative measures.  Aside from the grant that I am urging the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to consider providing, is he taking any action regarding the risks radon poses to the citizens of Ireland?<\/p><p>In 2014, a joint position statement was issued by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the HSE on radon gas and its dangers.  How many Irish people know of the dangers, understand the risk and know how to protect themselves from the risk?  I dare say it is very few.  The people have been left in the dark about the unusually high levels of exposure to this deadly gas.  There would be shock if more people knew of the risks.  It is a gross injustice that no national awareness campaign has been commissioned by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  <\/p><p>I am raising this matter because the people of Ireland need to be aware of the risk, the danger and the associated cost.  The Government needs to the ready to help, inform and act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#C00500","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I must say that it is an issue about which I am most concerned.  We often hear scaremongering when new technologies or particular products are developed that they may pose a health risk.  While that always is debatable, in this case, it is not.  Radon poses a clear risk to health, as the Senator has mentioned.  It is something of which we all need to become more aware.  It is there and can be dealt with.<\/p> <p>The Government published a national radon control strategy, NRCS, in 2014.  It recommended a broad range of measures aimed at reducing the risk from radon to people living in Ireland.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications - and I apologise that the Minister is not available this morning- chairs the NRCS steering group tasked with implementing the strategy.  The group brings together key Departments and agencies to deal with the issue.<\/p> <p>The first phase of the strategy had tangible outcomes including the provision of extensive information and the inclusion of a question on radon testing in the conveyancing process for house sales.  That is most significant and will add to general public awareness, aside from being a practically important measure.<\/p> <p>Phase 2 of the strategy was published in 2019, along with a document on knowledge gaps indicating areas that would benefit from further research.  Phase 2 of the strategy has 33 actions to be implemented over five years and 20 topics within the strategy are to be addressed over the five years.  Supporting households financially is a key priority of the second phase of the strategy.  Behavioural research is also ongoing.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is carrying out significant work in that area.  Once that work is done, the Government will give careful consideration to designing an appropriate radon financial support scheme for householders.  Another priority of the second phase of the strategy is translating awareness into action.  In a point that applies to both the Government and the public, awareness about radon does not always translate into action.  It is important that we take action because we know about the risks.  While we are always willing to take action as a populace when new perceived health threats emerge, this is a long-standing health threat.  We need to more to tackle it as a populace and we need to be more aware of it.  We also need to do more in terms of Government supports, which are now being provided as part of the strategy. <\/p> <p>There are some other initiatives that are being undertaken to tackle the issue.  The EPA has rolled out a pilot project in County Wexford to make digital radon monitors available to library members for up to a month to test their homes for radon.  The results of the project will be reviewed.  Hopefully, it will lead to more wide-scale availability of tests.  A major research study has been undertaken in conjunction with the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, on the use of passive sumps. This technology adapts the standby sump currently installed in all new-build homes.  The study has shown encouraging results in field tests carried out in County Wexford.  When available, the results of this project will be considered and recommendations will follow.  In addition, the radon map has been updated.  A significantly enhanced version of the map is on the way.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#D00200","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The NUIG study mentioned by the Minister of State, which was carried out by Dr. James McGrath and Dr. Miriam Byrne, found that if the proper ventilation is not installed as part of the retrofitting programme, people could end up being exposed to more than double the levels of radon at home as a result of the retrofitting process that is going to take place.  Therefore, it is a very serious issue.  The retrofitting of homes may not be the answer.  It will not deal with the radon issue.

Time has stood still, however.  Nothing of note has happened regarding conservation or to enhance the Strawberry Beds as an amenity area since the early 1990s.  My father was a Deputy then, and time has stood still since.  This is despite the wonderful assets in the area and the stunning natural environment, including Shackleton Mills, which has been described as the jewel in the crown of heritage assets in Fingal.  It has not been developed, but it has been obtained.  It was a water-powered flour mill from the 1770s.  There is also the Silver Bridge, also known as the Farmleigh Bridge, which was built by the Guinness family in the 19th century to supply electricity and water from the Liffey Valley as well as to cater for workers coming from Palmerstown.  Waterstown Park, to which the bridge connects, is another beautiful park in the area, with 300 species of plants, animals and birds, a 5 km track and a natural playground.  Weirs are dotted along the Strawberry Beds which people do not know about.  The best way to enjoy that area is by kayak, because the roads are used as a rat run for the M50.<\/p><p>I have recently been successful in having the area designated as being for cycling.  Eighteen signs have gone up and lining is going onto the tarmacadam over the summer.  However, I was not successful in getting advisory cycle lanes because that would necessitate having lighting on the road.  All these changes are not enough, however.  Until Covid-19, this area had fallen between two metropolitan stools, namely, Blanchardstown on one side and Fonthill and Lucan on the other.  It has an underutilised strategic purpose.  Opportunities have been missed over the years in this regard, including the 260 acres at St. Edmundsbury which were sold by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, ten years ago.  There were calls at that time to purchase the land to create a Liffey Valley national park and to join up the lands from Islandbridge to St. Catherine&rsquo;s Park in Leixlip and including Lucan Demesne, which was secured under the auspices of the rainbow Government many years ago.<\/p><p>During Covid-19, businesses sprouted up in the area as well.  These include the Strawberry Hall, which has evolved with Goats Gruff.  The Wren&rsquo;s Nest is also evolving its businesses now, and the Angler&rsquo;s Rest has been there for many years.  There is also a market at St. Catherine&rsquo;s Park, while Lucan village itself is being marked as a destination town, with &euro;2 million going into the public realm and tourism in that regard.  The Liffey Valley Trail is something I steered, along with Councillor Howard Mahony, when I was on Fingal County Council.  We started a tourism working group, and Councillor Siobhan Shovlin is working on that aspect now as well.  We have launched the trail as a tourism proposition and &euro;140,000 has been secured from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to restore the Silver Bridge.<\/p><p>In addition, the canal loop is going to join the future greenways on the Royal and Grand canals.  We need to do more in this regard, however.  All these changes are coming because of the beauty and value of this area, yet it is behind and at the periphery.  We would not hide away the history and beauty of the Mona Lisa, yet we are not establishing this area and taking advantage of its potential.  The localism we have witnessed because of the impact of Covid-19 has highlighted the potential more.  Therefore, a feasibility study by the Department of Transport is needed to examine cycling and walking along a route between the Phoenix Park and St. Catherine&rsquo;s Park via the Strawberry Beds.  It is not the busiest commuter route, but it could be of more recreational value.  We must think bigger about this project.  It must encompass Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council and establish and develop the area as an official park and, potentially, as a recreational amenity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#D00600","speaker":"1648","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Currie for giving me the opportunity to address the  Seanad today, on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, to talk about the important issue of investment in cycling infrastructure, which will ultimately make our cities, towns, and villages more accessible for everyone.<\/p> <p>As Senators will be aware, the programme for Government sets out an ambitious and wide-ranging set of commitments concerning walking and cycling and states that &euro;360 million in cross-Government funding will be spent yearly on walking and cycling over the lifetime of the Government, which is equivalent to 20% of the 2020 transport capital budget.  This investment will help support the planned delivery of almost 1,000 km of improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025, as well as additional investment in greenways.<\/p> <p>The Minister was delighted to announce earlier this year an allocation of &euro;240 million to active travel projects in the greater Dublin area and the four regional cities.  This funding will support the addition of 233 new sustainable transport projects to the investment programme of the National Transport Authority, NTA, in 2021.  The NTA will be tasked with overseeing and supporting the development of the high-quality mobility infrastructure across all projects and will also ensure projects are accessible and age-friendly.  Fingal County Council, which is the lead local authority for the Strawberry Beds area, received an allocation of &euro;14.87 million under this funding programme, which is a sizeable allocation and will facilitate progress on numerous projects this year across the Fingal County area.<\/p> <p>The Minister fully understands that to deliver these projects local authorities require adequate resources to enable them to do so.  As the Senator is also likely aware, the Department of Transport has therefore agreed to fund 218 active travel posts in local authorities throughout the country to ensure delivery of the increased programme of active travel infrastructure.  In January, the Minister wrote to the County and City Management Association, CCMA, to advise that Fingal County Council has been allocated up to 18 additional staff through this funding, and I understand the necessary recruitment processes are under way.  The Department of Transport is also working with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the NTA to develop a national cycle network which will ensure investments are focused efficiently, which should outline the cycling routes currently available, identify gaps in the network, and ascertain improvements likely to be required.<\/p> <p>Regarding the specific matter raised by Senator Currie, the Senator is likely aware that the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, GDA, was approved by the Government in 2016.  Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the NTA must review the transport strategy every six years.  This review assesses the implementation of the current plan and looks to produce an updated strategy which will set out the framework for investment in transport infrastructure and services to take us to 2042.  The scope of the transport strategy encompasses all land transport modes and services in the greater Dublin area, including cycling.  As part of the broad range of inputs into the preparation of the transport strategy, the NTA is updating the 2013 greater Dublin area cycle network plan.  The need for cycling infrastructure and the appropriateness of the road network at and in the vicinity of the Strawberry Beds is being examined as part of that update.  This updated plan will be published for consultation as a background paper for the transport strategy in September 2021.<\/p> <p>The step change in funding for investment in sustainable transport projects committed to in budget 2021 is proof of the Government's commitment to active travel, and I and the Minister look forward to the delivery of the numerous projects throughout the country over the course of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#E00200","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the update.

I thank the Minister of State for coming this morning.  I call for an examination of the earnings of carers, whether family carers, informal carers or carers in general, and social protection for them.  Carers have prevailed in the most difficult circumstances during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We all have to compliment and acknowledge the work they have done during the pandemic.  The Government has referred to carers as the backbone of care provision.  The national carers strategy from 2012 states that we must consider carers as key care partners.<\/p> <p>Social protection payments for carers fall into five categories.  The carer's allowance is means-tested and is for people on low incomes who are caring for an incapacitated person.  Half-rate carer's allowance is payable with other social welfare payments.  Carer's benefit is a social insurance payment made to someone who gives up work to care for somebody who needs it.  The carer's support grant is a cash payment to carers.  It used to be called the respite grant.  Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment.<\/p> <p>I pay tribute to Family Carers Ireland, which is based in Limerick, where I am from, because it has provided so much support for carers' health, well-being and quality of life over the years.  One of its findings was that 70% of carers find it hard to make ends meet.  It found that 21% of carers struggle financially and have cut back on essentials such as groceries and heating to make ends meet; 29% of carers live in households with a total income of less than &euro;20,000 per year; 57% of carers have experienced or are likely to experience debt as a result of caring; and 39% of the respondents said their financial situation had deteriorated over the last year.  Compared with the general population, family carers were more likely to report themselves as living in households with a gross income of less than &euro;20,000.  The highest rate of carer's allowance for an individual is &euro;385.  That applies where someone caring for two people, which equates to a rate of &euro;9.64 per hour.  There are various other rates.  They are all below the national minimum wage, which is &euro;10.20 per hour.  Carer's benefit for caring for more than one person is &euro;330 which, in a 44.6-hour week, equates to &euro;8.25 per hour.<\/p> <p>The reality is that carers, especially home carers, provide 24-7 care for 365 days of the year.  It is believed they help to keep people out of hospital.  There are approximately 500,000 carers in Ireland.  It is reckoned that, including home carers, the State saves &euro;20 billion, which is a huge amount of money.  In addition, 19 million unpaid hours a week are provided to people who need care.  Before Covid, thousands of family carers across Ireland were experiencing financial difficulty.  The pandemic has made an already difficult situation much worse.  We must begin to give carers the respect and recognition they deserve.  We must examine their rates of pay and the benefits they are entitled to, because they are providing the State with substantial savings.  The fact that they are caring for loved ones at home is beneficial and helps the longevity of people who are being cared for.  Carers must be paid for the work they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#F00200","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this important issue.  The Government acknowledges and I personally acknowledge the important role that family carers play.  We are fully committed to supporting carers in that role.  This commitment is recognised in both the programme for Government and the national carers strategy.  My Department provides a range of income supports to financially assist family carers whose caring responsibilities limit their ability to work.  The main income supports provided include carer's allowance, carer's benefit, domiciliary care allowance and the carer's support grant.  Over 135,000 carers benefit from regular income supports and spending on these payments in 2021 is expected to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion.<\/p> <p>The value of income transfers to family carers has increased by over 50% since 2015.  Carer's allowance is the main scheme by which the Department provides income support to carers in the community.  Carer's allowance is a means-tested social assistance payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people who need full-time care and attention.  Carer's allowance is intended to provide an income support for the carer and does not depend on individual care requirements.  Where carers are providing care to more than one person, an increase of 50% is applicable.  Carers may also, subject to certain conditions, qualify for the household benefits package and the free travel scheme.  In some circumstances, carer's allowance can also be paid at a half rate with other social welfare payments such as pensions and disability payments.<\/p> <p>The number of hours that a carer can work while still being considered to be providing full-time care and attention was increased from 15 to 18.5 per week in January 2020.  As the Senator is aware, in responding to Covid-19, my Department has made special provisions for those who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic.  A carer whose work ceases as a result of Covid-19 and whose situation qualifies him or her for the pandemic unemployment payment will get the payment along with their current carer income support, whether carer's allowance or carer's benefit.  The means test for carer's allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system.  Currently, &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person.  The equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.  In comparison, the income disregard applied to disability allowance is &euro;140 per week.  It is &euro;20 per day for jobseeker's allowance up to a maximum of &euro;60 and the balance is assessed at 60%.  The weekly income disregard for jobseeker's transitional payment with 50% of the balance assessed as means.<\/p> <p>Changes to schemes are considered in an overall expenditure and policy context and from an evidence-based perspective.  Increases to the disregard would result in the provision of additional payments to people who may have significant sources of income while reducing the scope to provide income supports to lower income households.  Those existing carers whose sole income is the carer's allowance would not benefit in this circumstance.  Any further improvements or additions to the current income supports, including the earnings threshold for carer's allowance, can only be considered in a budgetary context, taking into account other pressures in the Department of Social Protection and other Departments and the available financial resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#F00300","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

As we are approaching the recess, I wish her the very best of luck with her impending arrival in September.<\/p> <p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to the House.  When she was last here to address another Commencement matter I tabled on this issue, I was delighted.  I noted at the time that July provision was to become summer provision and that the budget for summer provision had been increased.  That is important.  This provision is not a luxury for families who have a child with complex additional needs; it is a necessity.  Many of us have heard the stories of the struggles of parents and their children who lost out so profoundly during the Covid lockdowns.  There is no doubt that their development was very much hindered.  Many children regressed in the home-schooling environment and their parents were at their wits' end trying to support them, but they were powerless to help.  I welcome that besides special needs schools, DEIS schools were invited to participate in this programme.  <\/p> <p>We need to ensure that children who need this vital service can access it.  We need to ensure that every child and family is supported and that those who lost out most during the lockdowns are now given the support they so desperately need.  Having welcomed the announcement that July provision was moving to summer provision and that the funding was to increase from &euro;20 million to &euro;40 million, I was dismayed when a number of parents from south Kildare contacted me to say their school was not running a programme and they could not access places in any other school.  I was disturbed to hear that the DEIS school and the two special schools in Kildare were not running programmes.  I contacted each school and I received feedback from some schools, but not all.  I have spoken to some principals in regard to this matter, but generally the take-up of the programme has been very low.  This is disappointing.  This is not about the funding that has been provided by the Department, but about the outcomes.  It is about ensuring that every child has the opportunity to participate.  <\/p> <p>Last Friday, I was contacted by the group, Special Needs Schools and Classes, in relation to a survey it had conducted, which found that 60% of the schools their children attend do not offer any in-school programme for the summer.  That is unacceptable.  As a State, we have a duty to care and support the most vulnerable in our society.  I note that only 26% of DEIS schools are running numeracy and literacy camps this summer.  This is not right.  We have more than 4,000 schools in the State, made up of 3,038 primary, 729 post-primary and 140 special schools.  Every school that is eligible to participate should be running a programme.  <\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to detail the current state of play in counties Kildare and Laois as regards this year's summer provision programme and to outline the provision that will be made for those children who cannot access the service through their own school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#G00500","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Before I respond to Senator O'Loughlin, I congratulate Senator Flynn on the passage of Second Stage of the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018 in the D&aacute;il last week.  It is important Traveller culture and history is embedded within the education sector.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator O'Loughlin for raising this important matter.  The needs of children with special educational needs and children at most risk of educational disadvantage are a huge priority for the Government.  As correctly pointed out by the Senator, these children were adversely impacted by Covid-19 and the closure of schools.  The Government provided guidance and support for schools throughout this period and put in place a supplementary tuition programme for these children in March this year.<\/p> <p>In May 2021, the Government announced a package of supports to allow primary and post-primary schools to offer a summer programme for students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage as a Covid-19 pandemic response measure for summer 2021.  As mentioned by the Senator, the funding is not the most important issue, but it is important to note that the funding for this year was doubled from &euro;20 million to &euro;40 million, a 100% increase on the allocation for summer programmes in 2020.  <\/p> <p>The programme was developed following extensive engagement with education stakeholders, parents and advocacy groups.  It was important to me that any impediments or barriers to schools participating this year would be removed because we wanted to increase the uptake from last year.  We wanted to maintain children's connection with education, build their confidence, increase their motivation and promote well-being for those who are at key transition stages.  We also wanted to help to ensure that they continue their education journey in September, either in school or in further and higher education or training.<\/p> <p>The programme on offer this summer includes a new two to three week summer programme to all primary schools and an expansion of the existing programmes in special schools and classes and in DEIS schools.  Similar to last year, children with complex needs entering primary school next September are also eligible to participate in summer programmes.  As I said, there was extensive consultation with education stakeholders and advocacy groups.  The Senator will be aware that the closing date was 25 June.  To date, almost one quarter, or 968, of the schools eligible to participate in the summer programme this year have registered their interest to provide 1,346 programmes over the summer.<\/p> <p>In regard to Senator O'Loughlin's local area, there are 35 schools in Kildare, 29 of which are primary, five are post-primary and one is a special school.  In Laois, there are 24 primary schools taking part.  The summer programme is important this year.  As I mentioned earlier, Covid has had an adverse impact on these students.  We are concerned about regression and the loss of key skills.  That these students can avail of a summer programme is very important. <\/p> <p>It is important to note that 34,000 children will benefit.  That is a 161% increase on 2020.  The programme is voluntary, not mandatory.  As I said, we have removed the impediments to allow schools to volunteer to participate in the programme for all children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#G00600","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response.

However, at this point we need to move from the opt-in, opt-out model of summer provision.

This year we allowed flexibility in the time so that it is no longer the July provision and the service can also be provided in August.  They are paid in advance, there is a centralised application process, there are arrangements to have greater guidance and there is also a provision to recruit final year and professional master of education, PME, students so that we can have more of a staff base in place to assist schools.

I wish to raise the issue of dementia and Alzheimer's day care centres across the country.   It was brought to my attention recently that very few of these centres have reopened.  The person who spoke to me wisely put it that we spend a lot of time talking about pubs, bars and restaurants and very little time talking about the essential services families rely upon that have been shut for a year and a half.  I have spoken to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, who informs me that initially only 14 of the Alzheimer's day centres are to open and that we are looking at 100 opening this week.  That is still a long way off getting all centres open.<\/p> <p>Families rely on respite care for their loved ones to get time to themselves and recharge so they can get back to doing full-time care work for family members that need it.  For the person suffering with dementia or Alzheimer's, part of ensuring longevity and coping with their condition is having those activities and day care centres.  People deteriorate fast if they do not have access to same.  I am dealing with a case at home where the individual went from having five days per week to having nothing for the past year and a half.  This has put huge pressure on the family to keep him at home and make sure he is looked after.  They are doing a fantastic job but he needs those day services.  Will the Leader submit a request to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to see what we can do about getting the centres open without further delay?<\/p> <p>I raise the ongoing negotiations involving the hospitality industry.  Today, the industry is meeting a cross-departmental group.  I listened to Adrian Cummins on radio earlier.  He put it well when stating that discussions are taking place but that NPHET will not be at the table.  Those involved know they have to go through NPHET to get their plan off the ground.  I agree with them and support the call for NPHET to get involved in the negotiations with the hospitality sector and find a way to get the industry open in the next couple of weeks.<\/p> <p>I reiterate a point I made previously: I am not in favour of a Covid pass that would exclude those who have not had the opportunity to have a vaccine or, for whatever reason, cannot take a vaccine from indoor hospitality.  I point to the ridiculous situation whereby many of those young people will be working in hospitality, serving others dinner and drinks and will not able to come around the other side of the bar and have a drink after their shift.  That sends the wrong message.  The Leader has repeatedly made strong calls for rapid antigen testing and that should coincide with the reopening of hospitality to make sure nobody is left behind.<\/p> <p>This week, the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU will publish its interim report.  It will be launched at 11 a.m. on Thursday.  An invitation will go to all Senators.

An Bord Plean&aacute;la has indicated that the new target date for the decision on the building of the Galway city ring road is 27 August.  The latter is the third indicative date given in respect of a decision on this vital project.  The first date was in March and the second was in June, a number of days ago.  The new date is in August and there may possibly be a further extension.  This road is crucial to Galway city, Connemara and the western region in terms of quality of life, traffic congestion, continued investment and tourism.  The project was agreed by the Cabinet in October 2018 and the cost involved at the time was &euro;588 million.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The commitment of the Government then and, I have no doubt, now is clear.  I expect the project to be part of the review of the national development plan.  Indeed, the project has been in various national development plans going back for the past two decades.  This is a long-running saga in Galway and one on which people are probably sick hearing about but I will continue to show my support for the project to be sanctioned and constructed.  I have always said that if we get planning permission for this project, it will be built.  The commitment is there for it, it is of such vital importance and the cost-benefit analysis has been proven time and again.  The political support in the main is there and it is certainly there from the T&aacute;naiste and former Minister for Transport, Deputy Varadkar, who is very familiar with the importance of the project to Galway and the region.<\/p><p>The second issue I will touch on is the reopening of our hospitality sector, including restaurants and pubs.  They have been through an horrendous year and three months at this stage.  The expectation was that they would reopen this week.  Unfortunately, that was not to be and they are clearly looking for a definitive date with 19 July being indicated to coincide with the reopening of international travel.  The majority of travellers coming to this country stay in hotels where they can dine but they will not be able to get the feel of real Irish hospitality in our towns, villages and cities, unless they also get the full experience of indoor dining.  We would love to have the Mediterranean climate for our summer but that does not always happen and businesses have tried to accommodate outdoor dining as best they can.  I wish the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the hospitality sector well in their deliberations today and in the coming days and I hope that we can have a definitive opening time and date for the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#K00500","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I call now Senator Boyhan who is leading the Opposition speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#L00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I sound something like a broken record but I want to talk again about mushrooms and the mushroom sector, this unique product which is neither a vegetable or fruit but is a fungus.  This product is branded at great cost and expense by Bord Bia on behalf of the State and is exported all over the world.  Up until recently, it was being flown out of the country and three days later it was sitting in the refrigerators of Harrods, and all over London, Paris and Europe.  There has been great innovation in the mushroom sector in its growing methods and in the development of vitamin D and added subsets into the mushroom food as part of this imagination and innovation.  The sector faces wipeout unless the Government urgently brings in legislation to introduce a resumption of peat harvesting on some selected bogs and I deliberately use the term &ldquo;some selected bogs&rdquo;.  I understand the challenges and they are important but the reality is that shipments of peat imports are now arriving into Ireland, despite all of the debate about carbon leakage.  Despite all of the issues we now have, peat and alternative peats are coming in here from the Baltic states, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the UK.  This is total hypocrisy in terms of greenhouse gas policy.<\/p> <p>I have referred to Bord Bia and the significant budgets it has used, and rightly so.  Bord Bia is an amazing organisation that we can be proud of.  It has done amazing work in the agrifood sector, one which I support.  Last Friday, we debated just transition and we will talk again about it this evening in respect of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, but just transition is also about jobs, household income and bringing all the people with us.  Most of the representations that I receive are from the workers in the mushroom sector in Monaghan, Kildare, the midlands, and in particular, Wexford.  They are challenged by this.  They tell me - I believe them and I have questioned Teagasc on these matters - that there is no real, practical, viable alternative to milled peat.  I am not making a case for the nursery or forestry staff because I understand that there are alternatives, difficult as they are, but for the mushroom sector, other than vermiculite and other substances, there are no such alternatives.  Let us support the workers, these rural communities and the mushroom sector and bring in emergency legislation to deal with this crisis, which will be a difficulty for us in respect of jobs and incomes for these families in a matter of weeks, not months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#L00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I welcome the Government decision last week to allow people aged between 18 and 34 to avail of the one-shot Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson or Janssen vaccine from today in pharmacies.  It is a development that is greatly welcomed in the roll-out of the vaccine programme.  I compliment Senator Chambers on her work last week in opposing a two-tier reopening for younger people and, in particular, hospitality workers.  I have no problem with having a two-tier reopening if people refuse to take a vaccine but it is unfair to put people into that situation if they have not had the opportunity to get a vaccine.  I hope that people between the ages of 18 and 34 avail of the 800 pharmacies around the country that are offering a vaccine.  It is welcome that there not appear to have been a great rush of vaccine hesitancy among our young people and they want to get these vaccines.  That, combined with the roll-out of antigen testing in the autumn, will be a significant armoury against the spread of the Delta variant to enable us to get back to some form of normality and for people to be able to resume their lives and jobs.<\/p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise is the worrying sounds from Government on the reform of the strategic housing development, SHD, process and kite-flying around making people more financially liable for judicial reviews that are taken.  The SHD planning process has not worked.  It is delaying the delivery of houses, which is not what it was intended to do.  The basis for that is that the only opportunity that local residents have for appeals of bad decisions or bad planning is to go through the court system, which is cumbersome, long, and expensive. <\/p> <p>Rather than examining ways to limit judicial reviews, we need to get back to a planning process that engages local communities while encouraging the need for the development of housing.  A situation is developing where people&rsquo;s voices are feeling very powerless and this process is not achieving what is needed.  All the indications are that the SHD system is going to be replaced by something that is more restrictive in respect of the courts.  We need to have a proper, open, democratic and robust planning decision process and have people buy-in to the delivery of houses.  Most people do not want to oppose housing in their local communities or end up having to take judicial reviews but it is not unreasonable for them to be able to go through a process where they have some of their concerns listened to.  If it is blatant NIMBYism, that will not be listened to because these concerns have to be within the parameters of the planning and development Acts.  It is, however, reasonable for people to have a say on what is sustainable development in their local communities and it would be a regressive step if the one I am hearing about is the one we are going to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#L00400","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Single elections naturally attract significant and prominent media attention and we only have to reflect on previous presidential elections in this country.

According to the National Biodiversity Data Centre, one third of the wild bee population is facing the threat of extinction.  At Castletown House in my home county, in the constituency of Kildare North, the people there have done amazing work nurturing the meadows at the front to feed the wild insect population.  That large grassland of meadow at the front is now full of clover, buttercups and many types of grass.  Rory Finnegan, the head gardener there, recently gave a wonderful public talk organised by the Green Party in Kildare.  I commend everyone who is working on this, including the Native Irish Honey Bee Society that has, for more than ten years, been deeply concerned about the hybridisation of the Apis mellifera mellifera strain.  It has called for a ban on the importation of non-native honeybees.  Ireland is the last stronghold in northern Europe of the black native honeybee and we should protect it.  The other bees are less frugal, prone to swarming, aggressive and they will dilute the black native Irish honeybee that is special and unique to Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#L00700","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to take No. 18, the National Minimum Wage (Removal of Sub-minimum Rates of Pay) Bill 2021, ahead of No. 1.<\/p> <p>I will raise two issues today.  I wish the talks between the hospitality sector and the Government well today.  We are all anxious to see progress and to see indoor dining becoming possible as soon as it is safe to do so.  I wish to draw attention to one thing.  This morning, Adrian Cummins stated that he wanted all partners in the room and he is right to say that.  In that respect, I notice the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has requested to be a part of those talks and, in fact, wrote to the T&aacute;naiste over the weekend making that request.  It is an eminently sensible idea.  ICTU has already made some sensible proposals in relation to helping the hospitality sector, including the introduction of a continuous antigen testing programme, possibly modelled on meat factories' experience.  To put this into context, who else is going to stand up for front-line workers in the hospitality sector?  Surely, we need a union voice at those talks.  I hope that nobody from the restaurant association or the hotel industry would object to that.  It is a perfectly reasonable request.  I call on the Leader's assistance in supporting that request today, if possible.<\/p> <p>The second issue I want to raise is in relation to nursing homes.  We are all aware of the real concerns about nursing homes over recent weeks.  There have been serious allegations of neglect and abuse, and, of course, the horrendous death toll in nursing homes.  I refer to the expos&eacute; on \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" last week.  I join with others in calling for a public investigation into these issues.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, she has promised to investigate these issues.  It is urgent that we do so and I believe it needs to be a public investigation.  The thing that has concerned me for some time - I have raised this before - is the model that is used.  Over the last 30 years, we have moved from 80% public-sector control of elder care to 80% private-sector control.  That did not happen by accident.  There has been a rapid privatisation of elder care and yet I do not remember it being a cause for debate or discussion across politics, but that is what has happened.<\/p> <p>I know from my experience as a trade union official that the private-sector for-profit model is based on minimum rates of pay and extremely poor conditions at work.  This results in a significant turnover of staff which in turn relates to a disimprovement in quality of care for our elders and loved ones.  I pose the question: if a nursing home is not prepared to deal with a trade union, could a person trust it to look after his or her loved one?  The reality is that the private nursing home sector at the moment consistently refuses to engage with trade unions.  That is why one will never see a trade unionist talking about what is happening in terms of the pandemic, one only sees the nursing home managers.  That is a fundamental flaw in a poorly structured sector, and I call for a debate on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#M00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Leading for the Civil Engagement Group, I call Senator Flynn.

I was thinking of that when I read the annual report of the Ombudsman for Children entitled 2020 Childhood Paused.  At the launch of this report, the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, said that when we are on the other side of this pandemic, we cannot go back to normal.  What he meant by that was that we cannot go back to two-year waiting lists for children seeking psychological help for mental health issues.  We cannot go back to long waiting lists for children with disabilities who are awaiting assessment of needs.  Our normal should not be direct provision and emergency homeless accommodation where families are stuck in one room.  It should not be appalling living conditions at Traveller halting sites.  We have to consider the new normal.  We hope to learn from this experience.<\/p> <p>The Ombudsman for Children's office dealt with more than 1,180 complaints in 2020.  While the number of calls was slightly down on the previous year, it is hearing from more children directly.  More often, it hears about the new issues affecting children in the pandemic, including the digital divide, the lack of clarity around State examinations, disproportionate effects the pandemic is having on children with disabilities, and children in high risk households who were not able to access remote learning.  Dr. Muldoon said that we need to look at ending homelessness and reducing poverty so that children and families are safe and secure.  Who could disagree with that?<\/p> <p>I know we had an important debate in this House recently on young people and their needs, and ensuring their voices are heard.  I would like us to continue to keep the focus on the future and what our new normal will look like.  What is the future for Ireland's children?  This is a conversation we need to have.  I am talking about young people such as my little girl, Billie.  What will the future hold for her?  What will the future hold for the next generation of children who are growing up in this era?  I know it is something that we cannot address in this House today, but I would love to see our young people invested in and valued, treated with dignity and respect, and that there are no more inequalities for young people in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#M00400","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>As our schools are now closed for the summer period, it is an opportune time for us to record a vote of thanks to all those who worked so hard to ensure that our children got through a difficult educational year.  Often, the unsung members of schools are those on the boards of management who help to keep both our primary and secondary schools running.  It is worth noting that they do this in a totally voluntary capacity.  This year has been a particularly difficult one for them because they had to get used to online meetings and additional tasks in order to open our schools and, importantly, to keep them open.  They deserve our gratitude for the generous time they give in that area.<\/p> <p>The same is true of management committees in educational centres throughout the country.  There are approximately 21 full-time and nine part-time educational centres in different parts of the country.  I drive past the one in Monaghan every day on my way to this House.  It is always a hub of activity where continuing professional development courses and in-service training are delivered to teachers and it is a vital cog in the educational wheel.  They also deserve great credit because those committees also do that in a voluntary capacity.

I have tabled a Commencement matter for tomorrow to try to get clarity on this and I hope the Cathaoirleach will accept it.<\/p> <p>I have two things to raise with the Leader.  We need a debate on long Covid with the Minister for Health.  More and more people are showing symptoms of long Covid, whether it is difficulties with their senses, such as loss of their sense of smell, pains or fatigue, which is a major problem.  We need a defined, dedicated and funded strategy to deal with long Covid.  This is a debate we need to have in this House because Covid will be with us for a long time and people suffering from long Covid need our support and our understanding.  The symptoms in these cases do not go away after seven or 14 days.  I would like to see a summing-up debate on Covid with the Minister for Health before the summer recess, given the fact that Covid has dominated matters this term and since this Seanad was constituted.  Perhaps the Leader could organise that with the Minister.<\/p> <p>On a more positive note, the Cathaoirleach's part of the country, just like mine, depends very heavily on tourism.  It is great to see tourists starting to come back this year, as they did last year.  Tourism will be one of the cornerstones of rebuilding our economy post the pandemic.  We should have a debate on tourism and the evolving strategy relating to it, particularly what we are going to do to encourage people in America and other countries to travel to Ireland in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#N00200","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I second the proposal that the time limit for debate on the climate change Bill be extended to 8.30 p.m.  In that context, the Bill is just a Bill.  I spoke about this briefly last week, but I will say one more thing about it.  Over the weekend we had evidence that the ESB is now installing emergency generating capacity in the Dublin docks because of problems and to avoid blackouts.  If this plan is implemented, and if everyone's ambitions are to be met, we are moving towards a society that will be much more dependent on electricity.  We have turned our back on fossil fuels - or are trying to.  We have limited capacity for hydroelectric generation.  Wind power, onshore and offshore, is opposed by interest groups all over the country, and we want to see when that infrastructure will be built to a satisfactory degree.  However - and this is the most crucial thing - side by side with all the rhetoric about sustainable energy, we are building data centres.  The Apple centre in Athenry, which has recently been revived, will, if fully built out, account for an increased demand for electricity of 8%.  Five data centres would increase our electricity usage by 40%.  There are two schools of thought in the Government.  I say this to the Leader but I am not making a party political point.  There are two departmental schools.  One is that we cannot fail the multinationals, we must do what they want and we must build all these data centres because they are the future.  The other school of thought is that of economic reality as it relates to electricity generation.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has said he is not ruling out nuclear power.  If nuclear power is necessary and is an essential part of the implementation of Government plans, we should be told so and there should be no more hiding behind statements such as \"I am not ruling it out\".  It is either in or it is out.  Let us hear which it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#N00300","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>In recent weeks, we have seen from Amnesty International and a number of other global human rights agencies, further details of the continued genocide against the Uyghur people by the Chinese Communist Party.

We have seen throughout the past year the introduction of the national security law and how China has crushed press and legal freedoms in Hong Kong and detained political opponents and dissidents there.  On Wednesday of next week, outside the convention centre, there will be a protest by practitioners of Falun Gong.

For years now, secretarial assistants have been working with their union to try to resolve the issue of unequal pay and as of yet, the Minister for Finance has not even met with them to discuss the matter directly.<\/p> <p>The Leader's party leader, the T&aacute;naiste, spoke publicly about how Fine Gael is in favour of a living wage and yet the largest cohort of political staff in Leinster House are not guaranteed one.  There are more than 200 secretarial assistants working in Leinster House.  They have a starting salary of &euro;24,000.  To put that in perspective, parliamentary assistants start on approximately &euro;41,000, a Senator starts on more than &euro;69,000 and Deputies make a minimum of &euro;96,000, which is due to go up to nearly &euro;100,000 in the next round of pay rises.<\/p> <p>Our secretarial assistants keep the lights on, the phones answered and the letters written.  They write our speeches, policy papers and legislation.  They commit hours and hours of their time, outside of the working hours, to help our constituents and they work hard to get many of us, in both Houses, elected.  Despite all of this, they would not even be able to pay rent in most cities in Ireland on the starting wage we give them.<\/p> <p>I remind the Leader this ongoing issue of pay was raised a number of years ago as part of a wider cultural problem of bullying and harassment in the Oireachtas.  Many strides have been made to address these issues through well-being initiatives and training for Members on how to manage staff.  However, nothing has been done to address the power imbalance which comes when a secretarial assistant is learning less than one fifth of what his or her boss takes home.<\/p> <p>The Oireachtas should be a place of equals and that starts with guaranteeing an equal standard of living for all our staff.  Secretarial assistants in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il do as many hours as parliamentary assistants and should be paid equally.  They are as committed to their work as we are and they make a valuable contribution to the administration of our work.  I ask the Leader of the House to write to the Minister and invite him to give us an update on this issue.<\/p> <p>This House passed a motion by a unanimous vote in the last term to end the practice of paying secretarial assistants so little.

In Dublin Bay South, a new two-bed apartment can cost between &euro;2,500 and &euro;3,000 per month.  How on earth can working people afford these kinds of rents?

While we have provided them with the pandemic unemployment payment, and that has been a lifeline and has been very much acknowledged in the submission from the National Taxi Forum, the potential of the industry to recover is not like that of other industries.  There has been grant aid but we need to do more.  I would like a debate in this House regarding their plight.<\/p> <p>A number of things could be done.  The first is to acknowledge that while taxi drivers come under the remit of the Department of Transport, and that makes sense, these are vehicle-based small businesses.  Each one of the drivers operates as a small business.  Every one of these individuals is supporting their family and home and running their operation as a sole trader.  They work the hours they operate to do that.  If we were to run the employment test we would do that on the basis of they being sole traders.  They would satisfy that test.<\/p> <p>We need an extension to the ten-year rule.  While there is a need to change the fleet, we could make the requirement for drivers to replace their vehicles inextricably linked with replacing them not only with wheelchair accessible vehicles but with electric vehicles.  We need to freeze the number of taxi licences being granted.  While the State is supporting taxi drivers with the pandemic unemployment payment, it seems ridiculous we are admitting more people into the industry.  There is a failure on the part of the Minister to engage in the context that the industry is currently not financially viable.  We need a debate on this issue as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#P00700","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank colleagues for their contributions.  Senator Seery Kearney is right in that we need a debate and not only on this sector as a number of industries will not recover in the way we hope they will.  They will continue to need supports.  A specific debate on the conditions that exist in the taxi industry is very relevant for us to discuss.  Other colleagues have also asked for debates in the next number of weeks.  Next week&rsquo;s schedule is already accepted and agreed.  I will be proposing the following week&rsquo;s schedule to leaders tomorrow.  We are literally to the pin of our collar.  I have requested from both the Superintendent and the health advisers if we could have access to the D&aacute;il Chamber on a Wednesday and a Thursday but it has been refused.  I am curtailed by having Monday, Tuesday morning and Fridays sittings and I am trying to do the best for all of us.  I hope the Senator will understand I do not have space between now and the recess for that debate.  I will do my very best to fit it in at the beginning of the new term.  All these issues will not go away over the summer, much and all as we would like them to.  It is relevant that we have that debate.<\/p> <p>Senator Crowe raised an issue that aggravates most people in the country.  It is very relevant that coverage of our national games should be free-to-air for all of us to enjoy.  We should not have to listen on the wireless or in a car to some of the most exciting sports.  We were spoilt for choice over the weekend.  Most of us were dual screening switching between the Tour de France, Wimbledon and Euro 2020.  It is wonderful to have that little glimpse of normality and excitement just to be able to enjoy sport again.  We should write to the Minister on behalf of all of us.  It would great if the Chair of the Oireachtas committee would bring GAA officials before the committee prior to it negotiating any new deal for the next number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#P00800","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>If the Leader is writing to the Minister I ask that all sporting organisations be written to as it is not fair the GAA would be singled out.

The Senator may not be aware that we discuss the issue almost on a weekly basis at our leaders' meetings.  There is work ongoing, but it is very slow, so I take on board her suggestion to write to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  I will be happy to do that on behalf of the House today.  There are two separate issues.  The issue of SA pay is one that is long overdue refining and fixing but all staff of Senators and other parliamentarians should be considered to be parliamentary assistants, rather than secretarial assistants, given the amount of work they do.  They are distinctly different roles but one is inherently connected with the other.  I am very happy to send a letter on behalf of the House today.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins referred to a Covid debate.  Again, it is very relevant.

It is one of the issues we will speak about for many moons to come.  The increased demand for the services of all providers - private charities and State providers - has increased significantly in the past 15 or 16 months by approximately 40%.  The funding to those organisations from the State has not matched that level of increase.  Many young people and older people will experience significant issues in this regard for many moons to come.  A debate on the matter would be welcome.<\/p> <p>Senator Boylan raised the issue of rental prices in Dublin.<\/p> <p>Senator Cummins referred to the HSE advancement of the vaccine to 18- to 34-year-olds.  I wish them well.<\/p> <p>Several colleagues spoke about the hospitality industry.  The only thing we can do, to be fair, is to support the hospitality sector, both the workers and the owners, in the negotiations in the next couple of weeks.  We want them all to be able to earn their own livelihood and provide services not only to Irish people, but to the people who are now, thankfully, coming to Ireland, and to do so in a safe manner.  I agree with Senator Gavan that decisions can only be made by people at the table.  All concerned should be at the table to find a productive way forward on this issue.  <\/p> <p>Senator McGreehan raised the centenary memorials that will be take place in the coming years.  Indeed, we will celebrate Seanad 100 next year.  I wish the people organising those events well.<\/p> <p>Senators Burke and McDowell raised the issue of the generation of electricity and how much more reliant the State will be on electricity generation.  The debate on data centres versus green energy production is not an issue that has just been dealt with by this Cabinet; it has been there for a significant number of years.

The debate in respect of hospitality will be ongoing daily for the next couple of days.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher thoughtfully spoke about the fact as schools, particularly primary schools, have closed for summer in recent weeks, it is an opportune time to pay tribute and thanks not just to the teaching staff, but to all the staff who mind and care for children, as well as all the governing staff who help them in their daily lives in school environments, which are a wonder for children to be able to grow and develop.  As regards the school secretaries issue, I hope he is right that this will be the final year in which we have to discuss secretaries having to arrive at Intreo offices at the end of June.  It is just not good enough.<\/p> <p>Senator Flynn proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  However, the Senator raised a valid issue as eloquently as only she can.  We need a debate across multiple Departments and services on the future of children and I will try to arrange that as soon as possible when we come back in September.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan referred to the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme on nursing homes that was aired the other night.  It was difficult to watch.  I agree with the Senator on this issue.  I know inquiries will be taken on board by the Department of Health and maybe even the HSE but we probably need a public inquiry into this matter.  The purpose of such an inquiry would not necessarily be to apportion blame.  I am sure the situation most private providers and some public providers found themselves in was unprecedented and I do not know how they managed.  We need to shine a light on the lessons that can be learned to make sure that if anything like this ever happens again, the State will step in far more quickly than it did to help nursing homes, probably because of the ideology the Senator spoke about at the beginning of his contribution.  I will try to arrange for the sentiments of the Seanad to be sent to the Minister with regard to any proposed inquiry.<\/p> <p>Senator Martin spoke about the by-elections and how single elections may be becoming more bruising.  We have seen that elections have become more personality focused, which is an awful pity.  I know that in the cut and thrust of elections candidates jibe one other from a policy perspective, but all Members know how vital it is, whether from a party perspective or another perspective, to have quality candidates who are able to come on board.   We do not need potential candidates to wake up one day and ask themselves if they are mad to go for election; that they should not touch it with a barge pole.  We parliamentarians and society at large will be the ones to suffer if we do not have great people putting themselves forward for election.  I wish all the by-election candidates well on Thursday.  The outcome will be decided by those who show up to vote, rather than those who criticise or stand on the sidelines. <\/p> <p>Senator Moynihan welcomed the extension of the vaccine to 18- to 34-year-olds and referred to the antigen testing that will be required to help people to reopen their employment venues safely.  She also referred to the SHD planning process.  She has made valid points in that regard and maybe we will try to organise a debate on that in September as quickly as we can.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan referred to the mushroom industry.  It is a bizarre example of carbon leakage that the production of something that is needed for the production of other goods has been stopped and that it has to be imported from thousands of miles away, which makes no sense.  I agree with the Senator that a debate is needed on the matter.  Notwithstanding the climate action Bill that is currently before the House, the particular issue raised by the Senator should be debated in the House, possibly by way of a Commencement matter, or I can ask the Minister to address it subsequently.<\/p> <p>Senator Kyne spoke about the Galway city ring road.  It seems like we have been waiting for the planning permission decision on the project for ages.  I hope the decision is delivered on schedule in August so that the road can start to be built.  It will have a significant impact on the lives and livelihoods of people in the area.  <\/p> <p>Senator Chambers spoke about dementia care centres.   While other colleagues were raising issues, I took the opportunity to contact the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I can inform the Senator that all dementia care centres will reopen this week, save where they have individual issues.  The Minister of State asked me to convey that any centre with an individual issue relating to training, staffing or finances should contact her Department immediately, which is welcome.  We take it for granted that just because a person is in his or her own home, everything is grand and hunky-dory, but I know from first-hand experience that dementia patients have suffered incredibly as a result of the lack of socialisation in the past 12 months.  It has had a massive impact on them.  Just being able to go to their day centre will have a hugely positive impact so we need to try to get those centres open as quickly as we can.<\/p> <p>In conclusion, I pay tribute to Senator Chambers on her chairmanship or chairwomanship of the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, as well as all of the committee members, who have worked hard and effectively in the past year.

In that nine-month period, I prioritised this legislation again because, as Senator Bacik implies, it had taken a long time to germinate to its current position.

They will be detailed so we cannot just pretend that by putting in the term \"immediately\", everything will suddenly be done.  There is a detailed set of regulations and there is very significant primary legislation listing the various types of categories under which reporting must take place.

We certainly will be holding the Minister to account once the legislation is passed to ensure it is brought into effect as soon as possible.  I take the Minister's point that he does not intend to see any delays on that.  I will withdraw the amendment on that basis.

I have engaged extensively with trade unions on this and other legislation since I took office.  I place real value on that ongoing dialogue with the trade union movement, particularly in the context of issues involving gender in the workplace, be it on the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill; on the low pay many childcare professionals, the vast majority of whom are female, earn; or in the context of domestic violence leave.  These are all issues on which the Government is working.  I have engaged extensively with the trade union movement on all of those points and I value that engagement, as well as the trade union movement's leadership in many ways on many of these issues.<\/p> <p>We discussed writing a specific role for trade unions into this legislation on Committee Stage.  I have looked at the Labour Party amendments.  I did make reference on Committee Stage to the fact that the EU directive to strengthen the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women is being looked at in the context of the European institutions.  There are indications in the early draft that some role for the trade union movement may be explicitly inserted into that legislation and, therefore, there may be a requirement on member states.  It remains my view that I am content to wait and see what will be the specific position given to the trade union movement occasioned from that piece of EU law because we could implement something now that would be quite different from or at variance with the role envisaged by the European institutions and required of us under EU law.  As the Senator is aware, there is a provision in the legislation to allow for its review after four years.  Hopefully, the particular element of EU law we are discussing will be implemented before then but if not, we will have the opportunity at that review to consider whether there needs to be a specific reference to a role for the trade unions in terms of how companies address the gender pay gap that is revealed through the publication of this information.  <\/p> <p>Amendment No. 4 seeks to insert paragraph (d) into the proposed section 20A(1) that would require employers that are party to a collective agreement with a recognised trade union or staff association to consult with the trade union or staff association concerned prior to and following the publication of the gender pay gap information.  I flagged on Committee Stage that I was concerned that there was no clear detail as to the purposes of those particular consultations.  In particular, when dealing with primary legislation, I felt it would be important that there be clear elucidation.  Were we to put this in, there should be a clearer elucidation of what those discussions and engagements would be about.  I also made the point, which I repeat, that there is nothing to stop an employer in the public or private sector engaging with recognised trade unions or staff associations prior to or following the publication of this information.  In particular, in the case of employers where the publication of that information reveals significant gaps, such consultation could be useful.  At this point, in the context of there not being complete clarity in terms of what those consultations would require and where EU law may require something more specific or generalised in respect of the role of the trade union movement in these negotiations, the amendment proposed today is not the appropriate way to go and I ask Senators not to support it.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#U00900","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>My concern relates to section 20A(3)(a), which states that regulations made under this section shall not apply to an employer with fewer than 50 employees.

To initiate the legislation with respect only to bigger employers would miss a large number of employees.  We are disappointed, therefore, that the Government&rsquo;s legislation will only come into effect incrementally and will only apply to organisations with 50 or more employees after some years.  Given the years of gestation and preparation, it would be appropriate to move the threshold down to 20 employees, as provided for in this amendment.  Other Opposition parties had similar amendments on Committee Stage.  <\/p><p>There are many small firms in Ireland with small numbers of employees.  In Finland and Sweden the thresholds are 30 employees and ten employees, respectively.  Clearly, allowances must be made to ensure there are no breaches of identity and that the data are anonymised, but again we can see this being done elsewhere in countries with many small firms.  I reintroduced this amendment on Report Stage to highlight this point.  We are concerned, as is the trade union movement and the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, NWCI, at the slow pace of expansion of the legislation to cover smaller companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#U01800","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>As the Senator said, the proposed amendment to section 2 would reduce the reporting exemption from employers with more than 50 employees to employers with more than 20 employees and remove the incremental aspect of the roll-out.  We spoke at some length on Committee Stage about the gestation of this Bill and the degree of engagement which took place between previous Ministers, employer organisations, trade unions and NGOs, especially those representing women.  An approach was agreed which allowed for an incremental roll-out, specifically recognising that smaller companies would have a less well-developed human resources, HR, infrastructure and many would also be less well able to deal with the significant reporting requirements we are instituting with this legislation.<\/p> <p>As Senator Bacik pointed out, employers have been waiting for this legislation for some time and, in fairness, they have been waiting for this version of it.  There is a legitimate expectation in respect of how this legislation will be rolled out.  To change that significantly now would be a major move, and one which I have considered.  I have thought about the arguments put forward by the Senator and others in their contributions in this House in recent weeks.  While the larger companies may have the requisite infrastructure in place to begin their reporting requirements immediately, I do not believe smaller companies will be so well prepared.  One consideration in any legislation like this, and it is only one consideration, must be its cost and administrative burden on employers.  <\/p> <p>We are all aware, especially during these times of Covid-19, that many SMEs have gone through a difficult time in the last 15 months.  Senator Seery Kearney drew attention to the research done by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which highlighted the administrative burden that suddenly extending the scope of this legislation to all employers would have on smaller organisations, especially those without a designated HR capacity.  It is my view that the proposal being brought forward here is unduly onerous at this stage.  I also referred to the identification of the salaries of individual employees and the concern to ensure pseudonymisation was achieved.  It must also be remembered that we amended the Bill on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to allow for a review of its overall functioning to take place after four years.  That will be a good opportunity to consider whether we need to bring the thresholds down further.<\/p> <p>Regarding Senator Byrne&rsquo;s comment regarding those in firms with fewer than 50 employees being at risk of discrimination, it must be remembered that it is at all times against the equality legislation to discriminate on the grounds of gender.  This legislation does not change that.  It is concerned with information and the provision of specific information regarding differences in pay.  It is never acceptable and definitely not legal to discriminate on the grounds of gender in respect of pay.  I put that reminder on the record of the House.<\/p> <p>We will have the opportunity to examine the impact of equality legislation as I recently announced a review.  It is great legislation and has served us well but the review will be a useful exercise in looking again at the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 to see how we can continue to strengthen and protect the most vulnerable groups in our society.  I look forward to engaging with Senators on that review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#V00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>The Minister has made all the relevant points.

I reassure Senator Byrne that the Employment Equality Act 1998 does not allow any discrimination on the basis of gender.  Equally, given that there is a greater prevalence of part-time work among women, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 instituted a requirement that part-time workers be given all the same conditions as full-time employees.  That protection has is also in place.  The thrust of this Bill is to ensure transparency and the publication of information by larger companies, rather than to undermine or embellish what is already a requirement and well rehearsed in all employment forums as a protection for female workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#V00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

There is also the capacity and resources in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.

Reflecting on the comments of Senator Pauline O'Reilly, it is almost 50 years since we passed the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act in 1974, which was supposed to herald an end to all pay discrimination for women.  Women in Ireland have been waiting a very long time to see that bear fruit in terms of equality of pay.  This is the reality.  That Act, which requires individual employees to take action when they experience individual discrimination, simply does not work to address collective pay inequity.

Will it be a central website?  Will it be individual websites of employers?  My next amendment addresses this.  Who will maintain and check the data published on the website?  Who will keep it updated?  Who will put out the press releases about it.  I accept that of course some flexibility is required but I am concerned.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is an over-reliance on flexibility at the expense of clarity for employers and employees on how this will take effect.  We know the data the employers will be obliged to provide, but to whom will they provide it and how will it be administered is the key question.  To be fair, it was one of the key questions that Ministers in the previous Government raised with me in regard to my Bill.  Under my Bill, IHREC was given the role of collecting the data from employers, publishing it, monitoring it and enforcing it in regard to breaches and so on.  We were very clear in that legislation on how the publication of gender pay gap information would be managed.  The then Minister and Government said that it was not an appropriate function for IHREC and that it would require a great deal of extra resourcing for IHREC.  I accepted that point, but what we were seeking to do was to provide clarity on how this provision would take effect.  Looking at other jurisdictions, that is a crucial question.  This is not just about detail as to the information that employers provide, it is also about the detail as to how the legislation will take effect.  The day-to-day mechanisms of who collects the data is critical.  The provision in subsections (4) and (5) do not outline in a clear fashion exactly what the regulations will provide with regard to classes of employer, classes of employee and so on, let alone how the data will be maintained.  The concern is the lack of clarity in this regard in the legislation.  That is a fair point to make.  We also had much stronger enforcement powers for IHREC in the original shape of the legislation.  We are concerned not to see any of that in this legislation.  We are also concerned that when the Bill is passed, there will still be a lack of certainty about how it will take effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#W01000","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I am not sure that replacing \"may\" with \"shall\", as proposed in this amendment, will have a huge impact in terms of the detail of the running.  I do not mean that as a criticism of the points the Senator is making.  I spoke briefly on the website, but I note the Senator has another amendment on it.  We will be setting up a centralised website.  Employers are welcome to publish their gender pay gap data on their own websites if they so wish, but there will be one centralised website, which will probably be the most significant part in terms of being able to demonstrate and compare data.  It is hoped it will have searchability functions in order that it will be possible to compare which companies have the greatest gap and the least gap and the like.  The view at the moment is that my Department will administer that website.  As I said, we will be putting out the request for tender on that shortly.  The website will take a bit of work.  I understand that on its first day the UK version had so many hits it crashed.  We want to avoid that type of situation.  The website will be used as a central element in disseminating this really important information, allowing a recognition of good practice and highlighting those employers whose practices are resulting in their female employees receiving significantly less pay than their male counterparts.<\/p> <p>Returning to the question of replacing \"may\" with \"shall\", as proposed in the amendment, I emphasise again the importance of having some degree of flexibility in the design of these regulations.  There will be a degree of complexity in the regulations in terms of meeting the various criteria set out in section 20(A).  I believe it is necessary in this section to provide the degree of flexibility that is provided by \"may\" rather than \"shall\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#X00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1625477400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 7:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 5, line 22, to delete &quot;may&quot; and substitute &quot;shall&quot;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#X00400","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#X00500","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1625477400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 5, line 23, after &quot;manner&quot; to insert &quot;(which shall include, if the employer concerned maintains a website, publication on that website)&quot;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#X00700","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#X00800","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":163,"content":"<p>This amendment is related to amendments Nos. 6 and 7 and later amendment No. 9, in which we are seeking to establish a little more detail and clarity on how the legislation will take effect.

Will it be Revenue, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or some other organisation?  I ask the Minister to confirm what body or authority will administer the website.  <\/p> <p>I note that the Minister said that employers will be free to publish on their own websites.  The purpose of amendment No. 8 is to make that clear.  There is still a lack of certainty and clarity for employers and workers alike with regard to where the centralised data will be held and who will do the work to draw the comparisons that we have seen so powerfully made, for example on the British and Australian websites.  In other jurisdictions, we have seen a new agency established to run the website and collate the data.  I accept it is a massive task and that is why in our legislation we proposed to devolve that function to IHREC.  We do not get a sense in this Bill of who the task is being devolved to.

I would like to think that a presence on a centralised website, as described by the Minister, would be pointed to for reputational enhancement as well as the actual effect of bringing equity of pay.  When prescribing the regulations, the Minister should ensure the reference to that centralised website is within ethical audits that are easily accessible and searchable and also something to which the WRC in the context of an inspection would go to ensure the publication of the details is in order, which I have no doubt it will be.

I am concerned that in putting in that provision, even if only permissive, it would take away from the importance of the centralised website as the go-to source for information on gender pay information.  If we emphasise what companies put up on their own websites, there will be companies that do and others that do not.  Those who do have websites and a good story to tell will make that story front and centre.  They will do that irrespective of this legislation, but those who do not have a good story to tell will obviously bury the detail behind frequently asked questions or something like that, where it will not be very accessible.  If we legislate that the centralised website is to be the go-to source for this particular piece of information, it will ensure that companies, whether their story is positive or negative, will be listed there and current and potential employees will go to that source.  As stated by Senator Seery Kearney, the information there will become a key element in how we understand a company's compliance under a range of areas.  We are doing work on that website.

My own profession, law, is one of them.  There are sections of society where women are still poorly paid.  Those who earn more tend to be where the men are.  There is still an inherent injustice.  While the legislation today plants a flag in the context of employment, there is more work still to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#Z00600","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I call Senator O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#Z00700","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairperson.  There is no better person to preside over Committee Stage.  Others have spoken on this.  The Minister has outlined everything that has been done apart from this Bill.  It is important to look at this Bill in that context.  A number of amendments were about firming up some of the decision-making about gender pay gap legislation.  I can understand it when looking at one Bill in isolation.  Much has been done in the short time that this Minister has been in office.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has a long record from before even coming into this position.  It shows the importance of a good, solid programme for Government to address gender issues and being in government to get those things across the line.  We can call for things for decades as women but being in government has made the difference for me in getting them over the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#Z00800","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  I echo what Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, that this is important and an achievement.  It is important to have priorities in government and it is satisfying to get things over the line.  Well done to all involved.  While the Minister could not accept all the amendments today, I understand that it is important that he makes his case, but I also like the fact that he gives people an opportunity.  I do not like the word \"reject\".  I have said that to a number of Ministers when they suggest to the House that they might reject amendments.  It is the Minister's proposal and he does not want to change it.  It is a word that I would like to caution any Minister about.  The House decides.  I do not suggest that the Minister does not respect that because of course he does.  I thank him because he is always courteous, always listens, and he sets out his rationale and reasoning behind why he might not be in a position to accept an amendment.  He made a good case today.  I acknowledge that and thank those involved in the passage of this important legislation.  This is what we are primarily about.  We are about legislation and policy.  It is political, not personal.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Bacik for sticking with this for so many years.  As Senator Seery Kearney said, we have much more work to do.  Let us not sit on our laurels now that we have passed legislation.  We have a hell of a lot of work to do on pay and gender equality.  That must permeate through every part of our process, thinking and actions in these Houses.  I thank the Minister and all the Senators involved in this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#Z00900","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I call Senator Currie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070500002#Z01000","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1625477400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>It is lovely to address Senator McDowell in the Chair.  I am not the spokesperson for equality so I feel like I am gate-crashing Final Stage.  I have been invested in this over the years.  I left my job because of a lack of flexibility.  I recognise that there are more than 60 Bills relating to employment and equality that we will work on.  This is the benchmark.  It is up to us to then provide the solutions.  As Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, that is a core part of the programme for Government.  It is apt that I refer to my previous career because I worked in communications.  It is up to us as a Government to communicate what best practice is at all times.  That is particularly relevant coming out of Covid when there has been so much pressure on people.  It has resulted in pressure on women.  We will see changes related to flexibility and remote working.  There is a role for us in establishing what best practice is or is not.  While this is about benchmarking and identifying the problem, we have to be leaders in rolling out solutions and what can work for people.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Emer Currie:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I recognise the work of the WorkEqual campaign of which I am a co-chair.

We should also recognise the importance of this day, not just for the various spokespersons for equality or us as Senators but for everyone.  People will be able to go to a website and see how their company performs with respect to the gender pay gap, which is of huge significance.  We are going to empower them and that is where I hope to see the cultural change.  This is all about cultural change in workplaces.
