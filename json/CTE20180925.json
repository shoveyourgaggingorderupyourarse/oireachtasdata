We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  We will take the business of the committee as normal on Thursday next.  Today we will be dealing with the 2016 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts, Vote 1 - President's Establishment.  We will also have an update on the 2017 position.<\/p><p>I welcome Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General of the Department of An Taoiseach who is the Accounting Officer for the Vote relating to the President's Establishment.  I thank him making himself available, especially as I understand he had an accident.  His arm is in a sling and he is somewhat incapacitated.  We wish him a speedy recovery.<\/p><p>I draw the committee's attention to some distinctions relating to Vote 1.  First, while Mr. Fraser is the Accounting Officer for Vote 1, he does not have operational responsibility for the Office of the President.  Second, our examination will be carried out in a way that respects the constitutional independence of the Office of the President, as per Article 13.8.1 of the Constitution which states, &quot;The President shall not be answerable to either House of the Oireachtas or to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of these powers and functions.&quot;  I know members appreciate this point.<\/p><p>As Chairman, I want to put the purpose and timing of this particular meeting in context.  An Taoiseach discusses the Estimates and related information for Vote 1 before a select committee of the D&aacute;il every year.  The related appropriation account is voted on in the D&aacute;il at the end of each year.  The actual appropriation accounts for 2017, which include Vote 1, the President's Establishment will be published by the Comptroller and Auditor General on Friday next, 28 September.  The Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform will publish the 2019 abridged Estimates for Vote 1, the President's Establishment, as part of his Budget Statement on 9 October.  Our role as the Committee of Public Accounts is to complete the cycle by examining the allocation of moneys to the President's Establishment and how they were spent and to look at the governance and oversight measures adopted by the Accounting Officer relating to that expenditure.<\/p><p>Regarding the timing of this meeting, certain questions regarding the President's Establishment were raised over the summer months.  The first opportunity this committee had to discuss these was on Thursday last.  As already stated, this committee has a clear role in respect of the examination of all voted expenditure.  However, I was concerned that we would do so in a way that is respectful of the upcoming election process.  As a result, I proposed - and the committee agreed - that this examination should take place at the earliest opportunity and in advance of the closing date for nominations, which is tomorrow.  Unfortunately, it was not feasible to hold this meeting any earlier and I wanted to put that on the record.<\/p><p>Before we begin, I want to summarise guidance for members because of the unique nature of this particular Vote.  Objective questions relating to oversight and control of moneys allocated to or for the benefit of the President's Establishment are obviously in order.  Detailed questions relating to expenditure that would, of their nature, potentially concern decisions or actions of the President are not in order.  For other matters, I will carefully weigh up the question asked before deciding whether a particular matter is in order.  We expect to get answers to all of our questions today.  However, any matters that are not clarified will be dealt with at a later date.  I ask for full co-operation from all members in this regard.<\/p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones should be switched off.  I wish to advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092500002#C00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537866000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  While we expect the witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.

The amount provided in the Estimate for 2016 was &euro;3.9 million.  After receipts for the year of &euro;84,000 were taken into account, a surplus of &euro;287,000 was surrendered.

There is only one non-office expenditure, the centenarian's bounty, which is the amount paid to people on reaching 100 years, in the country each year.  My position is a little bit different in respect of Vote 1 in that I do not have any executive authority over the Office of the President, for obvious reasons.<\/p> <p>  Broadly speaking, in 2017 the spend is again approximately &euro;3.7 million and that was again within budget, but the account has not been published yet.

I want to touch on expanding on the net programme costs of the Presidency and the true reflection of the course born.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's short opening statement refers to the appropriation accounts and gross expenditure of &euro;3.6 million but, as has been pointed out by Mr. McCarthy himself, when one goes to page 7 of the appropriation accounts, the net programme cost is &euro;8.1 million.  We therefore have this direct expenditure of &euro;3.5 million and then these net allied services at a cost of over &euro;4.5 million.  This reminds me a little of when we were trying to get to the bottom of the accounts for local government.  Obviously, the net allied costs are quite significant, even more so when one discounts what is paid in terms of the centenary and the bounty.  Then the President's Establishment is only &euro;2.4 million, yet the net allied costs are &euro;4.6 million.  In order that I understand this, how does the Office of the President make those demands, whether it be the office of the Minister for Justice and Equality, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW or the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for defence?  There are half a dozen different departments there.  As has been pointed out, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW went from &euro;2 million in the 2015 accounts to nearly &euro;2.5 million in 2016.<\/p><p>In the overall context of these accounts, that was a significant amount.

Perhaps I might ask the Comptroller and Auditor General about this in the light of his role in dealing with all of these Accounting Officers.  Is it the case that they are coming up with it themselves?  Are they saying they anticipate additional expenditure in these areas?  If there is to be some big event in a particular year and a Department has to allocate expenditure for it, I am sure the Office of the President has to alert the Department concerned to the need for additional expenditure, expenditure which does not come within the remit of the office but which it thinks the Department needs to put aside to cater for the event.

The Comptroller and Auditor General seems to be the main person responsible even though his role is only as auditor.  Mr. Fraser has tried to pass the buck to him a few times.  There is also the audit committee in the &Aacute;ras.  The question of who is responsible needs to be established.

Indeed, this allowance or whatever it is - about which none of us know anything and which is not taxable - could be &euro;1 million.  That is not the point.  The point is that we, as the public, are entitled to know that Mr. McCarthy, as Comptroller and Auditor General, is auditing and having a look at this and that it is being done in the right way.  Even the perception of it being some kind of a slush fund is damaging.  I wonder could Mr. McCarthy give us any information other than suggesting that he presumes that there are procedures to govern that fund in the &Aacute;ras.  We look forward to getting that information as early as possible.<\/p> <p>  Again, I concur 100% with Deputy Connolly.  It was remiss of previous Committees of Public Accounts not to do this, rather than mischievous of this committee to do so.  I hope it is done every year in the future.
