There are no delays in the issuing of payments to applicants with clear applications under this scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that advance payments under the BPS commenced on schedule on 16 October, which is the earliest possible payment date allowed under EU regulations, and balancing payments will commence as scheduled early next month.  Ireland remains to the forefront of member states in relation to the early payment of BPS moneys.<\/p>  <p>  EU regulations governing the administration of the basic payment scheme and the various other area-based schemes require that full and comprehensive administrative checks, including ground or remote sensing inspections where applicable, are fully completed to ensure eligibility with the scheme's requirements before any payment issues.  Such checks aim to ensure that payments do not issue on ineligible areas or features, that only eligible applicants are paid and that an applicant does not receive an undue payment that would require subsequent recovery by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Cases that do not pass the administrative validation process go into error and cannot be paid pending a resolution of the error concerned.  These errors can include over-claims, dual claims, commonage errors and incomplete application forms.  My Department enters into correspondence, mainly through the issuing of query letters to farmers, in order to resolve these error cases.<\/p>  <p>  The EU regulations prescribe the minimum number of inspections that must take place annually.  These inspections can be undertaken by means of field visits on the ground or by means of remote sensing using up-to-date satellite imagery.  The regulations further prescribe that for inspection cases, the process must be fully completed before any payments can issue.  Where an application is selected for inspection under any of the area-based schemes, the outcome of that inspection applies to all schemes for which the applicant has applied.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 8,000 applications are subject to an inspection in 2019 under the various area-based schemes.  As of 25 November, my Department had received inspection results for more than 93% of these inspections, of which 92% had been advanced to payment stage.  The balance of these cases falls into a number of categories, namely, where applicants have been notified of the inspection outcome where an area over-declaration has been identified and a response is awaited, and where applicants have chosen to submit comments on notified inspection outcomes.  These cases are being examined with a view to final processing.  The remaining outstanding inspection results are being finalised and will then be advanced promptly through the final stages of processing.<\/p>  <p>  Some 7,700 of the overall number of inspection cases are eligible applicants under the 2019 basic payment scheme.  To date, some 6,500 of these cases have received the advance BPS payment.  The balance of these cases falls into the various categories I have already outlined.<\/p>  <p>   I am pleased to confirm that to date, more than 119,100, or more than 97.5%, of eligible applicants have now been paid &euro;786 million in advance BPS and greening payments.  The second instalment of BPS payments will commence on 2 December.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that my Department continues to finalise cases, including ground and remote sensing inspection cases, daily, to ensure that BPS payments are issued as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700003#A00300","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1574850600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

It will be 1 December at the end of the week and people's financial cashflow is under extreme pressure.  We still have 1,400 cases awaiting payment of the single farm payment, 1,500 cases awaiting a greening payment and more than 1,200 cases awaiting areas of natural constraints payments.  Would it be possible for applicants to be paid their advance payments and if there was a need for penalties or reductions that they could be taken out of the balancing payment issued later in the year?  That would be a common-sense approach and would allow a person's cashflow to meet their living expenses and pay their bills.  People depend on the single farm payment and payments for areas of natural constraints to pay their bills.  I accept the hit rate is high but anyone waiting for a payment is one person too many.

Employment figures are primarily sourced from the Central Statistics Office quarterly labour force survey.  Additional data on specific sectors is also sourced from Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Irish Forestry and Forest Products Association.<\/p>  <p>  The agrifood sector is an essential part of the economic and social fabric of Ireland, especially in rural and coastal areas.  Irish food is produced by farmers, fishermen and agrifood companies around the country and this locally-produced food is exported to more than 180 countries around the world.  Primary agricultural output increased from &euro;5.9 billion in 2008 to &euro;8.2 billion in 2018, an increase of 39%.  Agrifood exports increased from &euro;7.9 billion in 2009 to &euro;13.7 billion in 2018, marking growth of over 73% since 2009. <\/p>  <p>  At the same time, the numbers working in the agrifood sector have seen a gradual decrease.  In 2008, employment in the sector averaged 182,350 compared with 172,800 in 2018, a decrease of 5.2%.  Much of this can be attributed to increased productivity and the adoption of new technology, although there have also been changes to the way the figures are measured by the CSO.  The Food Wise 2025 strategy includes actions to support farmers and agrifood businesses in improving the competitiveness and profitability of their enterprises.  These supports make Irish farm enterprises more efficient and maximise their contribution to regional and local rural economies.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the first three quarters of the year, the 2019 employment figure for the agrifood sector as a whole averages 163,000 or 7.1% of national employment.  This must be seen in the context of record employment figures across the economy as a whole.  Employment in primary agriculture is 96,800 and 4,600 are employed in the forestry and fishing sectors.  The food and beverages sector employs 55,600, with wood and wood processing accounting for a further 6,000 jobs.  <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the labour force survey is based on the main employment a person reports in the survey.  Where a part-time farmer reports his or her off-farm job as his or her main employment, he or she will not be recorded as working in primary agriculture.  It is also important to note that while the overall level of employment from these sectors is 7.1% of total employment nationwide, the proportion of employment outside Dublin is much greater.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700004#B00400","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1574851200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>There has been a 41% decline in the number of people employed since 2011.

Such transitional measures are normal practice between consecutive programming periods to provide legal and financial certainty where a gap arises due to any delays in finalising a new budget and CAP regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The recent Council accepted the need for such proposals and broadly welcomed them.  However, discussions are ongoing, with a number of key issues yet to be agreed.  The first and most important for the majority of member states is the financial flexibility regulation, which allows the continued transfer of funds between Pillars I and II in the year 2020.  This is expected to be adopted by the end of this year.  <\/p>  <p>  The second more substantial regulation provides the option to extend the current rural development programme, in certain circumstances.

A number of issues need to be considered in more detail with regard to the RDP and how the transitional regulation will work in practice.  I am continuing to work with the Commission and my European ministerial colleagues to reach agreement on these important legislative proposals.  I want to provide certainty to Irish farmers at the earliest possible date.  I expect that the transitional regulations will, at a minimum, provide for the extension of the existing RDP payments into 2021.  I anticipate that there should be no interruption in direct payments.  The current proposals provide for the optional extension of the current RDP and potentially for new commitments for some measures for a maximum of three years.

The key question is whether the funding will be continued, at least at its current level, during the period until the new CAP comes into play.  Many of the schemes that are paid through Pillar 2, including the areas of natural constraints scheme; the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, which is known as GLAS; the beef data and genomics programme; and the sheep welfare scheme account for a significant part of the annual incomes of farmers.  It is essential that they are not brought to a stop at the end of 2020.  Farmers should not be out of pocket during 2021 while we are waiting for the new CAP to kick in.  Farmers who have exited the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, are not being facilitated by the Government in getting into the new GLAS even though it has the capacity to do so.  The Minister needs to open GLAS to those farmers.  In my view, every farmer deserves and is entitled to be in an environmental scheme at any stage.  We need to get away from the pattern that involves farmers being unable to enter new schemes for gap periods of two or three years after these five-year agreements come to an end.

This significant challenge is separate from the other CAP challenges.  I appreciate the point the Deputy has made about Pillar 2 payments.

There is an onus on the Minister and his Government colleagues to ensure there is a GLAS-type scheme for them to be able to continue on to.  Likewise, when the current seven-year CAP programme runs out, transition arrangements will be necessary before the next programme starts.  We need to see a very different approach to these RDP schemes from the Minister and the Government and at European level.

Since then, the independent chair of the task force and officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have been continuing to engage proactively with members of the task force with a view to making progress with the implementation of the provisions of the agreement.  The Department and its agencies are continuing to make progress with the commitments they signed up to under the agreement.  The full text of the agreement between beef sector stakeholders, along with an update on the progress made on the action points to date, is available on my Department's website.  An immediate increase in a range of bonuses was announced as part of the 15 September agreement.  It has been confirmed to my Department that this bonus system is now in place.  The initiatives in the agreement aimed at improving information along the supply chain include the commissioning of an independent review of market and customer requirements, an independent examination of the price composition of the total value of the animal along the supply chain and a summary of competition law issues relevant to the Irish beef sector.  The Department has issued the request for tender for these reports, with a deadline for receipt of tender responses of 12 noon on Thursday, 5 December.  This will enable the award of the tender before the end of 2019.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to market transparency initiatives, the Department has published an expert report on the mechanical carcass classification review, introduced an appeals system for manual grading and initiated a consultation process on the transposition of the unfair trading practices directive, with a deadline for submission of 13 December.  Bord Bia has developed a beef market price index model based on three components: a cattle price index; a beef market price index, including retail and wholesale; and an offal price indicator.  This is now available on the Bord Bia website.  Teagasc is significantly advanced in the first stage of the scientific review of the quality payment system grid.  The Department is engaging proactively with several potential beef producer organisations that have the potential to strengthen the bargaining power of beef farmers in the supply chain.  Two beef producer organisations have been fully recognised by the Department in recent months.  I established the beef market task force to provide the leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability.  As I have said previously, it is in the interests of everyone involved in the beef sector that the work of the task force goes ahead.  I hope all parties will agree to come together around the table at the earliest possible date to make progress with this important work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700005#C00900","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1574851800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

I would like to ask the Minister a question that I have put to him in this House previously.  As far as I can recall, he indicated that he had spoken to Mr. Goodman, or to C&amp;D Foods, about these injunctions.  I take it from the Minister's reaction that this is not the case.  I thought he indicated in this Chamber previously that such a conversation had taken place.  I ask the Minister to speak to C&amp;D Foods about these injunctions.  I recognise that it is a legal matter.  They sought the injunctions and they got them.  It would be helpful if the injunctions were lifted.

There are certain minimum numbers of inspections that must take place annually under the various schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The method of selecting cases for inspection is set down in EU regulations and is undertaken by means of a risk analysis process with cases being selected on a risk-based and random basis.  All cases to be selected for inspection must be in respect of eligible beneficiaries under the various schemes.  Therefore, the selection of cases for inspection, while commencing after the closing date for receipt of applications, 15 May, is an ongoing process so as to ensure this specific regulatory requirement is fulfilled.<\/p>  <p>  This year, late applications were accepted up to 9 June, with a deduction.  Furthermore, amendments to applications were accepted up to 9 June and allowing for the preliminary checks process whereby applicants could further amend their application up to 19 June as a result of issues notified to them by my Department the final details of the land to be subject to the inspection process cannot be fully established until these periods have elapsed.  Therefore, the inspection process cannot commence any earlier.<\/p>  <p>  The EU regulations further prescribe that the inspection process in each case must be fully completed before any payments can issue.  I wish it were otherwise, but that is the case.  Some 8,000 applicants were selected for a land eligibility inspection in respect of the various 2019 area-based schemes.  Where an application is selected for inspection under any of the area-based schemes, the outcome of that inspection applies to all schemes for which the applicant has applied.<\/p>  <p>  As of 25 November, my Department has received inspections results for over 93% of these inspections, of which 92% have been advanced to payment stage processing.  The balance of these cases falls into a number of categories, namely, applicants who have been notified of the inspection outcome where an area over-declaration has been identified and from whom a response is awaited; and applicants who have chosen to submit comments on notified inspection outcomes.  These are currently being examined and are subject to final processing.  The balance of the outstanding inspection results is currently being finalised and will then be advanced through the final stages of processing promptly.<\/p>  <p>  Some 7,700 of the overall number of inspection cases are eligible applicants under the basic payment scheme.  To date, some 6,500 of these cases have received the advance payment.  The balance of these cases falls into the various categories that I have already outlined.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that my Department continues to finalise cases, including ground and remote sensing cases, on a daily basis to ensure that basic payment scheme payments are issued as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700007#E00500","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1574853000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>We accept that the vast bulk of payments have been made but work remains to be done by the Department on a small number.

It states that the key drivers of this increase has been a reduction in animal feed use on dairy, beef and sheep farms, compared to 2018, as well as additional supports channelled to cattle producers to alleviate the effects of falling beef prices.  <\/p>  <p>  Beef farmers are estimated to see an increase in income of about 10% in 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower costs and the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM.  Dairy incomes are estimated to increase by 14% due to higher production.  Sheep family farm incomes will remain relatively stable.  I appreciate where Deputy Durkan comes from and note that tillage farm incomes are estimated to drop by up to 24% as a result of lower prices, despite higher yields.  <\/p>  <p>  Teagasc further states that prospects for 2020 are forecast to see an increase for dairy, sheep and tillage, while beef farm income will be stable. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, &euro;1.93 billion was paid to farmers by my Department.

They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and in providing an alternative market outlet for farmers.  My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its importance to the agrifood sector, while placing a strong emphasis at all times on the welfare of all animals being transported.  In 2018, total live exports of cattle, including calves, increased by over 30% compared to 2017, to 246,000 head.  This growth trend has continued into 2019, with live exports already totalling 266,000 up until the week ending 19 October.  This is up from 221,000 for the same period in 2018, a 20% increase.  This increase is in part due to my decision in 2017 to reduce the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves less than three months of age from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20.  This has brought greater equity to the inspection fee regime.  Since then, there has been continued growth in the export of calves, rising from 102,000 in 2017 to 159,000 in 2018.  We have already surpassed this figure in 2019, with 194,000 calves having been exported in the year to 19 October.<\/p>  <p>  The transport of calves poses some additional challenges associated with journey times and feeding requirements, which require the use of lairage facilities at Cherbourg.  The Deputy will appreciate the development of additional lairage capacity in Cherbourg is a commercial matter for the export sector.  However, officials from my Department met their French counterparts in the summer of 2019 in Cherbourg and, during these discussions, the French authorities indicated they would be willing to consider applications submitted for additional lairage capacity should they arise.  Officials from my Department are in ongoing communication with Irish exporters on the need for co-operative management between each other to ensure the lairage capacity at Cherbourg is optimised.  I have urged the live export sector to consider developing an additional lairage in Cherbourg or to engage with the owners of existing facilities to explore the potential for additional capacity.  This has proved possible, as evidenced by the French authorities approving an increase of the holding capacity of the Qualivia lairage in Cherbourg earlier this year.

It illustrates the degree, as I am sure the Taoiseach will accept, to which violence, death, intimidation, stealing and spreading fear across every community in Ireland is now a feature and a consequence of a rampant drug trade that is extremely valuable.  The scale of what is revealed in the report is genuinely frightening and suggests that the State's and the Government's response to date, notwithstanding the good work of garda&iacute;, is not at a scale or not comprehensive enough to deal with what we are currently facing and will face if this is allowed to continue into the months and years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Provincial towns are now considered most attractive, with direct access to local users and new customers, and with very little competition, apparently, for the big gangs in those provincial towns.  Young people and children are being particularly exploited.  The scale and severity of drug debt intimidation is clear and is much highlighted in the report, with the intimidation of communities, of families and of individuals, including children, as a result of this activity.  It is something that, collectively in this House, we have to be extremely concerned about.<\/p>  <p>  The report talks about three tiers: the leaders, the intermediaries and the bottom tier, which the report states involves a large number of highly disadvantaged young people, who are often addicts themselves.  It is this tier which carries out the bulk of the intimidation.  According to Europol, typical activities are bullying, assaulting, stealing, vandalising and spreading fear on behalf of the network.<\/p>  <p>  This phenomenon is already widespread in the United Kingdom, where the term used is \"county lines gangs\", so they have now moved out from the big cities into the county towns and so on.  It is teenagers who are recruited and who then face daily threats and intimidation from their superiors.  It is extraordinary that towns across the UK previously unaffected by criminality have seen dramatic increases in violence, with an 807% increase in the number of victims of child slavery since 2014 in the UK.  Some 27,000 children in the UK now identify themselves as gang members.  The point is we are now beginning to see this in Ireland, no question about it, and we need to deal with it.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, while I genuinely say this has to be an all-party approach, I do not think we are getting to grips with the scale of this issue.  Deputy John Curran has a Bill ready, First Stage of which will be moved next week.  The Bill proposes to create two new offences in regard to young people, first, to make it a criminal offence to purchase drugs from a person under the age of 18 and, second, to create a new offence of causing a child to be in possession of drugs for sale or supply.  In a spirit of co-operation, I ask the Taoiseach to agree with us to accelerate that Bill, which is straightforward in its impact, and also to meet with the other parties.  We need a comprehensive approach to resourcing, rejuvenating and revitalising the partnerships that already exist in the cities and throughout the country, and to restoring resources to the RAPID programme.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach will respond to both those questions in the spirit in which they have been tabled. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700012#K00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1574856000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>First, I welcome the publication yesterday of the EMCDDA - the European drugs agency - and Europol Drug Markets Report of 2019.  As the Deputy knows, the report relates to all of Europe, including Ireland.  The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs is part of the mission of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other State agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard.  While we seek to help people who use drugs using a health-led approach, we will continue the relentless pursuit of drug dealers using a criminal justice approach.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, GNDOCB, was established in 2015 and tackles all forms of drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs in Ireland.  Since its establishment in 2015, it has had significant success.  It has seized controlled substances with an estimated street value of &euro;167 million, seized cash believed to be the proceeds of crime to a value of &euro;10 million, and seized 108 firearms and 3,000 rounds of ammunition.  In 2019 alone, the GNDOCB has been responsible for seizing controlled substances to the value of &euro;20 million, cash believed to be the proceeds of crime of &euro;2.4 million and 17 firearms.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a lot of co-operation involving the GNDOCB and the National Crime Agency in the UK under the auspices of the cross-border joint agency task force.  We are very much co-operating with law enforcement in other countries, recognising this is a cross-border crime and an international crime.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to families who are being intimidated, often for drug debts, there is a drug-related intimidation reporting programme in place that has been developed by the Garda in co-operation with the National Family Support Network.  It has been in place since 2013 and responds to the needs of drug users and family members experiencing drug-related intimidation, particularly in regard to drug debts.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Family Support Network have each concluded evaluations of the programme and have jointly agreed a number of actions to enhance the effectiveness of the programme through training, knowledge sharing and awareness raising.  As the Deputy will be aware, there are now armed support units operating in every Garda region, which is a new development.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to Deputy Curran's Bill, the Government will certainly examine it in an open-minded way and in a spirit of co-operation with the Opposition - if that comes in one direction, it should go in both directions.  We have some concerns about the legislation in that, the way it is written, it may actually criminalise some children in certain circumstances, but we will be happy to work that through. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700012#K00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1574856000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>The first issue is the scale of the problem as revealed by Europol.  That is the bit I do not think the Government has got yet, to be honest, in particular given the fact nine Ministers of State signed a document on the reduction of resourcing of community partnerships and the whole loss of multidisciplinary impacts on the ground in certain disadvantaged communities.  It is very clear from the Europol report that large numbers of disadvantaged teenagers and children are being targeted, exploited and used in this lucrative drug trade.  That requires a multidisciplinary response involving the Garda but also involving education and resourcing people on the ground, in particular community leaders on the ground.<\/p> <p>That has been lost in the past eight to nine years.  That is what motivated former Ministers of State with particular experience in this area to come together to say we need to change and turn around what has happened over the past eight or nine years on the community front and to deal with this.  It is a fair point that has been well made.  Anyone who saw \"Prime Time\" last night will have seen Fr. Bryan Shortall making similar points about the need to get onto the ground in these communities to deal with this.<\/p> <p> Deputy Curran is a former Minister of State in this area with considerable experience.  His Bill is the first step to target this issue as it relates to children and young people and to create offences of using young children to deal drugs and of purchasing drugs from young children.  These are straightforward provisions that we should accept.  Again, we do not want the Bill to disappear somewhere in the ether.  We want it fast-tracked and accelerated to start the fightback.  It is the scale of the response that is the issue.  There is no doubt but that the Garda is doing great work, and it is very difficult dealing with really dangerous criminals.  This report tells us that the Kinahan gang is leading in Europe on this, so it is a very serious challenge to our society and our democracy.  It needs a response on a scale we have not witnessed to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700012#K00700","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574856600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Kinahan gang no longer operates from Ireland but from the United Arab Emirates.  That is one example of the success the Garda has had in getting some of these gangs out of the country altogether.  To answer the Deputy's question, I do not think anyone needed a Europol report to understand the scale of the problem of drug-related organised crime we face across Europe, including in Ireland.  We need only look at the response we have seen in recent years.  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, GNDOCB, established in 2015, is an Irish equivalent of the FBI and did not exist previously.  Armed support units are now available in every Garda region, which was not previously the case.  There are record resources for the Garda, the budget for next year being almost &euro;1.9 billion.  The strength of the force is above 14,000 for the first time in a very long time, with 200 more joining this Friday.  This is having an effect.  I mentioned earlier the amount of drugs and the firearms that have been seized as well as the seizure of cash believed to be the proceeds of crime.  While there have been a number of murders that have caused enormous concern in recent weeks, we should not forget the fact that homicide offences are down 40% quarter on quarter and murders down 25% year on year.  This is proof positive of the success the Garda is having in tackling the most grievous form of crime, which is murder related to organised crime.<\/p>  <p>  We would be very happy to engage with Deputy Curran on his Bill.  The last note I saw on it indicated that it contained some flaws which may not have been intended but which may result in the criminalisation of children, and that is not part of the solution.  We are, however, absolutely happy to engage with Deputy Curran on the Bill and fast-track it if it is good law.  I do not think anyone would want to fast-track bad law, but if we can make good law we will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700013#L00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1574856600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>This morning's newspapers are once again filled with horror stories of the impact of the Government's housing policy on children.  Yesterday's Social Justice Ireland conference was told of toddlers' inability to walk, crawl or chew because of prolonged stays in emergency accommodation.  The conference heard from one expert who said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTime lost in the first five years of a child's development is not easily recovered.  It requires wraparound supports, including physical and speech therapies, counselling services and dieticians. <\/blockquote>  <p>At the launch of its annual report this morning, Respond said just 8% of families in its hub units were able to exit homelessness into social housing last year.  This is the lived reality of Fine Gael's failed housing policy, which continues to survive only at the behest of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and Fianna F&aacute;il.  Rebuilding Ireland is now in its fourth year, and what have been the results?  Homelessness is up 67%, with more than 10,000 people officially homeless, according to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Child homelessness is up a shocking 81%, and tonight more than 4,000 children will sleep in hotels, hubs and hostels.  Some will spend their fourth year in emergency accommodation this Christmastime.  As we know, rents are up a staggering 39%, and new rents across the State are almost &euro;5,000 more expensive this year than they were when this Government took office.  In Dublin city they are &euro;7,500 per year more expensive than in 2016.  As we all know, house prices are up over 20%, resulting in a whole generation of young people locked out of home ownership.<\/p><p>Today the Social Democrats announced they will table a motion of no confidence in the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, next week.  They have said enough is enough, and I wholeheartedly agree.  Sinn F&eacute;in will fully support the motion, and I urge all Opposition Deputies, including those in Fianna F&aacute;il, to do likewise.  It is no longer credible for parties to attack the Government's housing policy and record while propping up that very same Government.  It is time for Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin to declare whether he is on the side of homeless children or the side of Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  Importantly, next week's votes will also be the first for the four newly elected by-election Deputies when they enter D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

Quite a few NGOs working in the housing and homelessness sector have published their annual reports in recent weeks.  These reports are very useful and help add to our understanding of homelessness and the impact it has on those who experience it.  The Deputy mentioned the Respond report, for example.  One thing that report points out is that the average stay in a family hub is six months.  Yes, for various reasons some families may end up in emergency accommodation for a prolonged period, and I accept that six months is six months too long, but this is very different from the narrative that suggests that the majority of people in homelessness are growing up in or spending years in homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700013#L00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1574856600,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Most people are not in hubs but in bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700013#L00700","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1574856600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Respond's report says the average is six months.

I draw his attention to the extent to which things have changed since Rebuilding Ireland was published.  In the year before it was published and implementation began, and before the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, became Minister, family homelessness increased by 60%, a huge increase.  In the past year, thankfully, we have seen a negligible or no increase in family homelessness.  I think the figure for the past year is 0.17%.  No increase in family homelessness for one year is not something to be proud of and not something I am bragging about, and I do not want anyone to misrepresent what I am saying.  However, before Rebuilding Ireland was published and before we started implementing it, family homelessness was going up by 60%.  It has levelled off in the past year.  That is the difference it has made.  It has only started, though.  It is a five-year plan, not a two-year plan.  We have got to the point at which the figure has levelled off.  We now need to see reductions in the coming months and years.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about growing evidence.  There is now growing evidence of housing supply being delivered, with 50,000 houses and apartments built since I became Taoiseach, including 20,000 in the past year, which represents a 22% increase on last year, according to the CSO.  There has been an 80% increase in the number of apartments built.  More social housing is being provided than at any point in this decade, and the number of people on housing lists is going down.  We are seeing progress.  Yes, it was a slow start - of course it was going to be a slow start.  One cannot rebuild a construction sector overnight.  However, the plan, which was published two years ago and has now been implemented for two years, is showing results and we now need to build on them.  One thing that will not make a difference, I guarantee the Deputy, is a motion of no confidence and a general election in Christmas week or the following week.  That will not build any houses.  It might get Sinn F&eacute;in publicity, but that is about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700013#L00800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1574857200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has learned from his Minister how to misread figures because that very same report he quotes tells us more than half of the children who are currently homeless are spending more than one year in emergency accommodation when we combine hotels and hubs.  If we take figures from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, it tells us more than 20% of the children in emergency accommodation have spent more than two years in it.  The idea that somehow people are moved on within six months is simply misleading the House.  To say that since Rebuilding Ireland was produced family homelessness has not increased simply is not true.  Since it was launched child homelessness in this State has increased 81%.  There are more children today sleeping in emergency accommodation than when this Government was formed.  Those are the facts from the Minister's Department.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to increasing supply, the Government is 30% shy of the overall targets for Rebuilding Ireland and its investment in social housing is only half what is required.

The motion that will be tabled next week will send a clear signal to the Government that the plan is not working, that the people do not support, and that we want change.

Four of these killings were of men aged 22 or 23, including the latest murder.  One of the 22 year olds was shot in the head by a gunman as he was pushing his baby son in a buggy.  Some of these young men were not believed to have been involved in gangs, except that they owed them money.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside the murders, there has been a succession of attempted murders as well as well-documented evidence of intimidation and severe violence carried out by criminals involved in drug selling.  There have been other high-profile murders in other parts of the city and in Meath and Louth.  Seven killings in one year is an extraordinary level of violence on the northside of Dublin.  If there was this level of killings elsewhere, I genuinely believe there would have been a swifter reaction.<\/p>  <p>  There is a serious problem with how some of these killings are now reported.  It is repeatedly reported that people are being murdered in a gangland area.

We cannot have a situation where murders are somehow diminished because the term \"gang\" or \"gangland\" is attributed to the incident.  We must not be allowed to become so used to violence that we are undermined in our determination to take absolute and robust action to stop criminal murders.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically, we need a ministerial task force for Dublin's Northside Partnership area with the same level of commitment as was given to the north inner city ministerial task force, chaired by Mr. Mulvey.

There are places where crimes occur and those crimes may involve gangs, but it is pejorative to suggest that entire area is therefore gangland. I know large parts of my constituency, including Blanchardstown, where I grew up, is often referred to as gangland.  It is no such place.  It is a decent place with a decent community and decent families, and just because crimes or murders may occur there does not make them gangland.  The same applies to Darndale, Coolock, the north-east inner city and other parts of the country.  The same also applies to referring to criminals using the terms of comic book heroes, which glamorises them and should not be done either by us or by people in the media.  Deputy Coppinger or somebody else also made that case very strongly yesterday.  We as politicians and the media need to mindful of those sorts of terms.<\/p>  <p>  The north east inner city project is one in which I am involved, one I know well, and one about which we often talk during Taoiseach's Questions.  There have been some very positive outcomes from that, and while it has not yet, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has pointed out to me on a number of occasions, resulted in a decrease in crime in the area, it has resulted in many good outcomes.  It was a unique approach, one that required many resources, both personnel and financial.  I am not sure if we are in position to replicate that in many other areas.  There have been calls for a similar approach to be taken in Coolock and Darndale.

We need to look at it in the round to see if there are a certain number of areas we can identity in the country that are areas of significant disadvantage and significant crime, target those, assess them on an objective basis, and perhaps take five or six and have a special approach to them and do it in that way rather than one thing after another being called for and us not being able to put the personnel and the resources behind it, if that makes any sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700014#M01000","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1574857200,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach's openness to consider it.

There are now 14,200 garda&iacute; in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is more than it has had for a very long time, as well as 2,900 Garda staff.  I am confident that we will meet our target of 21,000 by 2021.  A decision has been made in consultation with the Garda Commissioner, and taking into account the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, to recruit more civilian staff.  By doing so, we have been able to move about 500 garda&iacute; who were largely doing administrative-based desk jobs into front-line policing.  That is what people want.  Instead of the previous approach of taking on more garda&iacute; without reforming the Garda organisation, we are bringing more civilians into the Garda staff, thus freeing up hundreds of garda&iacute; for front-line policing operations.  Approximately 500 garda&iacute; have already been freed up in this way.  We are ensuring that there are more garda&iacute; on the streets, in vehicles, on bikes and in communities where people want to see them, both by recruiting more garda&iacute; and by reforming the Garda.  I support the Commissioner's work on this.  Bringing in more civilians will free up garda&iacute; to move into front-line duties, and restructuring the Garda regional structures will result in fewer chiefs and more everyday policemen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700015#N00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1574857800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>There has been some debate in this House recently on the proposed liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal at Shannon, which would use fracked gas imported from the US.  I want to talk about the proposed LNG facility which would store imported fracked gas from the US at Cork Harbour.  The US-based company Next Decade wants to import the fracked gas, and signed a memorandum of understanding on this with the Port of Cork in 2017.  Next Decade plans to frack gas at the Rio Grande in south Texas near the Mexican border from 2023 onward, liquefy it and export it to Cork through the Texas port of Brownsville.  Earlier this month, a Sunday newspaper reported that Next Decade intends to submit a planning application before the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Millions of people have marched to demand action on climate change, and this Friday, school students will strike again.  Only yesterday, the UN's annual report on climate change found no sign that carbon emissions will peak soon.  The Government, under pressure, agreed to ban fracking in Ireland.  Will it now allow fracked gas in through the back door?  Fracking is more harmful for the climate than the burning of coal.  The methane emitted from fracking is second only to carbon in the damage it does to our environment.  Yet, the Government has not closed the door on using fracked gas at Shannon or Cork.  The Taoiseach even held that door open when he said that fracked gas could be part of the answer to Ireland's energy security needs.  The Taoiseach knows that if these projects go ahead, the State will be locked into the use of fossil fuels for another 40 years.  He also knows that substantial use of fossil fuels in the EU's energy system for even another 15 years is incompatible with the commitments given under the Paris Agreement.  The Government faces one way on peat but seems to face another way on fracked gas.  Why is that?  Why does the Government not state clearly that fracked gas will not be allowed to be part of the Irish State's energy mix?<\/p>  <p>  Have the Taoiseach, the Government, any Ministers or Government Departments been lobbied on this issue by Next Decade, the Port of Cork, or any of the corporate entities involved in the Shannon project?

I do not think the Deputy expects me to do so; his question is more of a rhetorical one.  I wish to state very clearly that lobbying is not a crime.  It is part of what happens in a democracy.  Politicians, Ministers, and those in Opposition are constantly lobbied by all sorts of interest groups, including commercial interest groups, trade unions and NGOs.  We listen to what they have to say and then we come to a decision as to what we believe is in the best interest of the public.  That is how democracy works and how it should work.  The lobbying legislation which we and the Labour Party introduced as part of the previous Government ensures transparency and that such bodies must declare any lobbying they carry out.  It would be entirely normal for lobbying to have taken place on this matter.  In a democracy, one would expect commercial interests to lobby the Government just as unions, NGOs, and individual members of the public do.

It is part of the transition to net-zero emissions in 2050 and the vast majority of climate scientists accept that we will need to continue to use gas as a transition fuel during that period, as it is a much cleaner fuel than coal or oil.  I would prefer to use our own natural gas from the Corrib gas field, if we can find more, as well as biogas.  Gas Networks Ireland has very interesting plans to develop its network for biogas as an alternative.<\/p>  <p>  The Government banned fracking in Ireland, through a Private Members' Bill introduced by my colleague, Deputy McLoughlin.

If Next Decade submits a planning application for a floating storage regassification unit at Whitegate in Cork Harbour while this review is taking place, will the application be processed or frozen?  The Taoiseach should be able to answer that because it is a Government review.  Unless it changes course, the Government will walk into a storm on this issue.

The Litter Pollution (Amendment) (Dog Litter Control) Bill 2019 amends section 22 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 to make it an offence for a person in charge of a dog in a public area to fail to produce a suitable bag or instrument to dispose properly of dog faeces when requested to do so by a dog warden, litter warden or member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is proactive legislation to tackle the problem of dog faeces litter in our communities.<\/p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to impress upon those in charge of dogs the importance of picking up their pet's faeces when in public by making it an offence not to produce a suitable bag or instrument when in control of a dog.  This would make the possession of a dog litter bag a similar requirement to that of a leash when one is in control of a dog.  <\/p><p>Some people have said that this is not a serious issue.  For me, it is a public health issue and we need to change behaviour regarding dog litter.  The issue of dog litter left by a minority of irresponsible dog owners is repeatedly raised with me by constituents and residents' associations in Dublin South-West.  I am sure it is the same in other areas.  It is a serious public health issue as dog waste carries disease.<\/p><p>Toxocariasis is an illness caused by the parasitic roundworm which lives in the intestines of dogs and cats.  Human contact with the eggs produced by the roundworm and excreted in a dog's faeces can cause fever, cough or wheezing, enlarged liver, rash, swollen lymph nodes and even blindness.  It is life changing and almost impossible to become free of.  It is particularly dangerous for children and pregnant women or those with a low immune system.<\/p><p>Despite the introduction of the law making it an offence not to pick up after one's dog, our parks, footpaths, beaches and community areas are still littered with dog excrement.  Current legislation is not fit for purpose.  This is partially because wardens must actually witness a dog fouling and the dog owner leaving behind the dog's waste in order to pursue a prosecution.<\/p><p>A small minority of dog owners simply do not give a damn what their dog does and have no real fear of being caught or penalised under current legislation.<\/p> <p>This new legislation we are introducing is proactive and makes it easier for wardens and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to impose fines on irresponsible dog owners.<\/p> <p> This is not anti-dog owner legislation.  It is about being proactive and introducing legislation that is pro-health and trying to eliminate this practice.  This is just one step, but it has the potential to be transformative for our community.  We need to ensure that local authorities hire more dog and litter wardens and that they are more proactive in our communities.  It should also be about providing more bins in which to place the dog litter.<\/p> <p> This issue is raised in all constituencies so I hope all parties will see the serious public health implications involved and support this legislation.  It is time to clamp down on irresponsible dog owners who continue to pollute and foul our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700019#R01100","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574860800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700020#S00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1574860800,"counter":356,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700020#S00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574860800,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1574860800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700020#S00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1574860800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700020#S00600","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574860800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1574860800,"counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700020#S00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1574860800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Frank O'Rourke - to discuss the refurbishment of Celbridge health centre and the provision of a dental clinic;

This second report by the group outlines progress on the seven recommendations contained in its first report published in July 2018, which are to expedite the establishment of an electoral commission; advance the modernisation of voter registration; regulate the transparency of online political advertising; reform of legislative provisions concerning funding of election and referendum campaigns; assist the EU Commission's work in tackling online disinformation; continue to advance national level media literacy initiatives; and also enhance cyber security measures around the electoral process, including providing advice to political parties.<\/p><p>The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will lead on drafting the heads of a Bill to make provision for the regulation of transparency of online paid political advertising within election periods.<\/p><p>The overarching policy objectives are to protect the integrity of elections, ensure they are free and fair, and not captured by a narrow range of interests; to respect the fundamental right to freedom of expression and the value of political advertising and its importance to protect democratic and electoral processes, while ensuring that regulation of expression meets the requirements of lawfulness, necessity and proportionality; and to respect the role of the Internet in the public sphere of political discourse and ensure that the public have access to legitimate information required in order to make autonomous voting decisions.<\/p><p>The proposal was formulated following a public consultation and open policy forum with participation from media and Members of the Houses, online companies, the advertising industry, academia, civil society and the European Commission.<\/p><p>The Government approved the establishment of a statutory electoral commission<b><\/b>on 17 July 2019.

Today, he tells us that it will be finished by the end of the year, and we are talking about the middle of next year before any substantial progress is made.  That is not a surprise to anyone in the House because, as the Taoiseach is aware, the interdepartmental group's first report found that the absence of an electoral commission is a matter of concern and recommended that it should be established.  The Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that the heads of the commission Bill are expected next year yet the status of the Bill in the Government's autumn legislative programme provides no date as to when the initial stage of the legislative process will be completed.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth remembering that the establishment of an electoral commission was first raised in the Oireachtas in 2004 and has been agreed in consecutive programmes for Government since 2007.  Neither Fine Gael nor Fianna F&aacute;il has demonstrated any real commitment to this key piece of reform.  Establishing a commission is not only a long overdue modernisation reform; it opens up important opportunities to increase voter participation in elections.<\/p>  <p>  Four by-elections will take place at the end of this week.  The current Administration is on its last legs, and we face a general election in the coming months.  The Taoiseach has been a member of two Cabinets and over the course of the past eight years has failed to deliver on his commitment to introduce this much-needed and long talked about reform.  Is it the case that the electoral commission legislation will not be in place before the next general election?  That seems to be what he said in the past few minutes.  It is probably a hallmark of this Government, and we had it here yesterday evening also regarding the issue of health, that everything is on the promise but very little is delivered.  This issue has been talked about since 2004.  It is beyond impossible to consider that we cannot get this commission delivered quicker than this timetable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700020#S01700","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1574860800,"counter":372,"content":"<p>During Taoiseach's questions yesterday, I said to the Taoiseach that democracies across the world are struggling to deal with the problem of fake news spread by social media, often by anonymous third parties.  Last weekend, the actor and comedian, Sacha Baron Cohen, accused the Silicon six, the big six social media companies, of spreading \"hate, conspiracies and lies\" by facilitating this material online.  Specifically, he said that the Silicon six determine much of the information that the world sees and collectively amount to \"the greatest propaganda machine in history\".  When we reflect upon that, it is a reflection of truth.  He said that this is resulting in a type of \"ideological imperialism\" where \"unelected\" companies \"were imposing their vision on the rest of the world\", unaccountable to any government, and outside of the reach of most law.<\/p>  <p>  I said to the Taoiseach yesterday that we have to defend our democracy.  Our democracy is not for sale.  We must have strong regulation of not only what goes on the Internet but also of political campaigning and advertising.  We need to urgently update our laws to ensure that money spent on clear and obvious lies and disinformation can be counteracted and not allowed to contaminate our elections, as they manifestly have influenced elections in other jurisdictions in recent times.  When I asked the Taoiseach about this yesterday, he seemed to be unconcerned whether the necessary law would pass before next year's general election.  I believe it is of vital importance that we collectively regulate in this area because once an election is in process, it is too late to try to regulate or control an external influence on our democratic system.  Has the Taoiseach had time since yesterday to reflect on this matter?  Will he work with us, collectively, to have laws in place before the next general election?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700020#S01800","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1574861400,"counter":373,"content":"<p>It will soon be three years since Deputy James Lawless published Fianna F&aacute;il's Bill to introduce transparency and protections for the public in respect of political advertising.  The handling of this issue has become a classic case of how the Government is failing to address important public issues.  The initial response from the Taoiseach and his party was to reject the idea that something should be done.  When the D&aacute;il passed the legislation anyway, the Government worked to block it and set up its own internal group to consider it in December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In spite of many media briefings claiming action is under way, the latest progress report shows that not a single recommendation made by the internal Government committee has been fully implemented.  In fact, it is much worse than that.  The Cabinet blocked the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill because it said the definitions in it were unusable while the interdepartmental group on protecting our electoral process has now said Fianna F&aacute;il's definition should be used in Government legislation.  The problem, of course, is that the legislation has been delayed so much that it cannot be in place before the next general election.<\/p>  <p>  There are two things at stake.  The first is the right of the people to know who is spending money to influence their vote.  No one is proposing to limit legitimate speech but transparency is essential.  Second, there is an urgent need to protect the limits on donations and spending that are a core part of legitimate democratic competition.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the Government has accepted it will not produce legislation on time, should we not now agree at least to proceed with Deputy Lawless's legislation?  The Government has produced a policy outline and accepted key definitions.  The legislation is ready for amendment on Committee Stage.  It could become law early next year with Government support and, indeed, amendments.  Where there is a will, there is a way.  Deputy Lawless's Bill is the basis of ensuring that, in the next session, after Christmas, legislation could be passed and commenced in advance of the next general election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700021#T00100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1574861400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The drafting of the general scheme of an electoral commission Bill is under way in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.

The electoral commission's establishment is guided by several recent reports and public consultations.  These include the 2016 report of the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and Gaeltacht on the consultation on the proposed electoral commission and the regulatory impact assessment and public consultation concerning the establishment of an electoral commission that were completed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government earlier this year.  Submissions received as part of this consultation expressed broad support for the establishment of an electoral commission on a statutory basis and initial assignment of a limited number of functions with a view to assigning functions over time.<\/p>  <p>  While the statutory functions for the initial transfer to the electoral commission have not yet been finalised, proposed functions for the initial transfer include responsibility for the register of political parties, responsibility for the reviews of the national and European electoral boundaries, currently conducted by the Constituency Commission, and responsibility for the consideration of local area boundaries, which are currently reviewed by the local area boundary committees.  It is also intended that the electoral commission will include a new research and advisory function to inform the Government and Oireachtas in their consideration of electoral law reform.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is very conscious of the discrepancy that now exists between print broadcast media and online platforms when it comes to political advertising.  There is an obvious gap in safeguarding the electoral process from online disinformation as the area is entirely devoid of regulation.  The current proposal to regulate for transparency in online political advertising would make provision in legislation to mitigate this gap.  The regulation of political advertising in broadcasting media is part of a wider regulatory framework for advertising.  Advertising in the print media is subject to a self-regulation code of the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland but political advertising is not within the scope of this code.  It is our view that overhauling the regulatory provisions across all platforms is therefore a more significant task, requiring a comprehensive review by the electoral commission when established, in consultation with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, as a priority, it is intended to press ahead with legislation to cover online advertising owing to the absence of regulation in this area.  A general scheme will be prepared for quarter 2 of 2020 in line with the Government decision of 5 November 2019.  The general scheme will be prepared in consultation with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and other members of the interdepartmental group, as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700021#T00800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1574861400,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Why does the Government not want to do it before the general election?

The services currently available on request to former taoisigh from 2019 include access to briefing material on the Government's policy position on matters of public debate; assistance, when required, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the use of private facilities at Dublin Airport when travelling abroad to carry out work associated with their former role; and the invoiced cost of secretarial assistance to assist them to carry out work associated with their former role, excluding any associated office costs.  The provision of secretarial assistance is linked to willingness to assist the Government if requested in the future, and secretarial assistants may not engage in constituency work or party political work.

It is quite extraordinary that the Taoiseach would add to this by granting very significant amounts of money to former taoisigh, in addition to the pensions, for secretarial support.  What possible justification is there for reinstating the supports?  Does the Taoiseach not believe the former officeholders are already in receipt of extremely generous pension packages?  Hundreds of thousands of euro have been given to former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in secretarial support.  I just do not see how the current Taoiseach could possibly justify that.

The Taoiseach said former taoisigh have been involved in campaigning for our seat on the UN Security Council.  That is a good idea.  There are other roles former officeholders can play, not as active politicians but as experienced former politicians, particularly in their family groupings within the European Union.  I have no difficulty with any of that.  All the supports given to anybody from the public purse should be transparent.  That was always the way it was.<\/p> <p>Up to 2016 a detailed breakdown of what everybody earned, including former taoisigh, in terms of pension, allowances or any supports was routinely published by the Department of Finance.  The Government decided to end the practice in 2017, citing the right to privacy outweighing the right of public interest.  The entire thrust of public policy for the past two decades and more has been for openness and accountability for every cent of expenditure that falls to the taxpayer.  I do not understand why that would not be completely transparent.  Public scrutiny, transparency and maintenance of standards are something we expect when it comes to the public domain.  If there is a continuance of payments to anybody, that should be a matter of public knowledge.  Will the Taoiseach restore the automatic full disclosure of all issues concerning anybody who is getting emoluments or funding of any description from the public purse?  It may be completely and entirely justifiable in every instance, but we need to know.  Otherwise, there is a feeling that undermines public confidence in the transparent expenditure of public funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700021#T02100","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574862000,"counter":395,"content":"<p>It is the near universal practice in democratic states that former Heads of State and Heads of Government receive continued support and protection after leaving office.  That reflects the fact that they continue to be a potential focus for people who might want to cause harm.  They also have ongoing calls from the public both here and internationally.  They do not suddenly disappear from public life when they leave office.<\/p>  <p>  I thought the decision of the previous Government to withdraw nearly all support without notice in 2011 was both unfair and damaging, in particular to the late former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, and to the late former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, who at an advanced stage had to make alternative arrangements almost overnight.  Given that both held the office of Taoiseach at times when paramilitaries were actively seeking to undermine the State, there had always been an acceptance that basic, ongoing security was reasonable.  People might forget, but they were quite dangerous times when one needed a bulwark for democracy to stand up to those who were clearly intent on undermining the authority of the State and very tough and hard decisions had to be made by officeholders.<\/p>  <p>  Instead of making up policy on the run, does the Taoiseach not think it would be better to undertake a process of looking at international practice and then setting up our policy accordingly?  In particular, some form of review of the ongoing public contacts and engagements of former Presidents and taoisigh should be undertaken.  For example, I am struck by the work of former President Mary Robinson in terms of climate change, which I think reflects very well on this country.  Given that we are an outward looking country, we are global and internationalist, the fact that we have former officeholders who can participate on fora all over Europe and globally on international issues concerning security, climate change, energy and a range of other political issues is advantageous to the country and it is something we should support not undermine.<\/p>  <p>  I have one caveat to make.  I note that in his reply the Taoiseach said the secretarial allowance is dependent on a willingness to assist the Government.  That is a danger in that former officeholders cannot become appendages of the Government.  I do not say all of them would anyway, but they must be allowed independence of thought and mind and if they disagree with the Government line on Northern Ireland, for example, or on other issues, that should not be a basis for not giving a secretarial allowance to assist with their work.  By and large, I favour the utilisation of former Presidents and taoisigh on international fora in particular, which can help influence matters to a certain extent to the benefit of the country.  We should not always seek to undermine politicians.  There is a great tendency to do that in public debate.  It is the easiest thing in the world just to have a go, but politicians do some good work too.  Democracy is in retreat, big time.  One only has to look at the geopolitical state of the world to see that.  It is evident even in Europe when one looks at what is going on in Hungary and in Poland, not to mention other places.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700022#U00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1574862000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I agree to a certain extent with all speakers.  We are all aware that democracy has a cost attached to it.  It is not for free and it must be paid for and looked after.  People deserve to get a remuneration reflective of what is required for them to live their lives normally.  Dr. Garret FitzGerald was mentioned.  I remember being with him in Glencree when the peace negotiations and discussions were ongoing.  He was a vital participant.  He had a particular perspective with which I did not always agree but he was part of the process.  Many others who had previous political involvement played a role at that time and since then, which is vital and it must be appreciated, recognised and acknowledged.  However, we also have the other side of that.  For example, the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, receives a pension of more than &euro;135,000 a year.  Most people out there who are struggling in their lives feel that is hugely excessive and we must acknowledge that also.<\/p>  <p>  Tens of thousands of families remember the austerity years and the Government which presided over the mismanagement of the economy and it jars with them that they had to endure such problems and their children had to emigrate and yet they see senior people from that time getting very handsome remuneration in the form of a pension etc.  It also jars with them that post-2012 many senior civil servants were given golden handshakes and large lump sums to retire and then they were re-employed, sometimes even within the Civil Service.  There are many things with which we all have huge problems.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, recently discovered in a freedom of information request that the former Minister, Ray Burke, received &euro;48,850 in a pension this year while the same man went to prison for tax evasion and corruption.  The public have a problem with large sums of money going to politicians they perceive as people who did not do everything in the best interests of the public.  That is something that needs to be acknowledged and on which we need to work.  Is there any action the Taoiseach could take to restrict some of that and to rein it in to some extent?  If he were to do so, it would be extremely popular with the vast majority of ordinary people who are struggling to manage on a day-to-day basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700022#U00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1574862000,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their questions and contributions.  Former taoisigh and Presidents have an ongoing role.  It was mentioned that such an ongoing role can be beneficial to the country.  Former President Mary Robinson was mentioned, for example, for her role in climate action and climate change.  That is not just good for the world, it also reflects well on the country and we should be cognisant of that.  It makes sense that if we have former officeholders - former taoisigh and Presidents - we should ask them to assist the country.  They are people who are generally held in good standing internationally, who have good contacts, who know things and have great experience.  We should see them as an asset to the country, not to the Government, if they are willing to continue to do things for the country.  I should point out that they are also members of the Council of State for life so they do have a formal role under the Constitution.  Being a retired Taoiseach is not a formal role but being a member of the Council of State is.  Former officeholders continue to receive a significant amount of correspondence, media queries relating to their work, queries from historians and even queries from inquiries.  They receive a huge amount of correspondence and queries, even unwanted correspondence and queries.  They have been asked to assist in our UN work, in particular in the campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council and on European issues such as Brexit, to explain our case and issues in fora around the world and also, on occasion, in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, has a role in monitoring the referendum in Papua New Guinea.  It is a really important role and we should be supportive of him in that.  I had a very brief phone call with the new Prime Minister of Australia and one of the first things he mentioned to me is that our former Taoiseach is involved in the referendum in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea.<\/p> <p>It was not something I brought up.  It was something the Australian Prime Minister was aware of and volunteered.  That just gives an example of the benefit of that sort of soft power of having our citizens around the world doing this kind of work.  The former T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, has a role with the EU around human rights which has been very effective.  While it is an EU role, the fact it is being done by an Irish person reflects well on us.  Everyone will be familiar with the ongoing engagement of the former Taoiseach, John Bruton, in European affairs and US relations, given his role as EU ambassador to the US in the past.  I know there was mention of large amounts of money and hundreds of thousands of euro.  I would say once again that the secretarial assistance is vouched and the total cost of this scheme so far this year has been &euro;21,190 for all officeholders combined.  The previous scheme, which was abolished in 2012, cost about &euro;168,000 to &euro;183,000 a year.  It really is very modest compared to what was there before.  All four former taoisigh were contacted to make them aware of the assistance available, the rules and specifically that any work had to be associated with their former role.  The decision to avail of supports is entirely at the discretion of each individual and they are under no obligation to make use of it.  So far, only one former Taoiseach has elected to recruit a secretarial assistant and the same individual has made one request for detailed briefing material on Brexit.  I take Deputy Howlin's point on transparency and I am absolutely willing to be as transparent as we possibly can but the general data protection regulation, GDPR, did actually change things.  Our privacy laws in Ireland are different from what they were a few years ago.  While it was possible in the past to disclose, for example, how much every individual officeholder got in terms of his or her pension and so on, under the GDPR there are new privacy rights that apply to every citizen.  It is no longer possible for a Government to disclose what any individual public servant gets paid in terms of their pension or salary.  We could remove that for everyone or no one but that previous system where it was transparent for some and not others no longer applies.  The GDPR has changed that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700022#U00400","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1574862600,"counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700023#V00200"},{"type":"question","time":1574862600,"counter":400,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[47391\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700023#V00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent engagement with the DUP.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1574862600,"counter":401,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[48731\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700023#V00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent engagement with the DUP.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1574862600,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.<\/p>  <p>  I last met DUP leader Arlene Foster at the annual Remembrance Day ceremonies in Enniskillen on Sunday, 10 November, when we both participated in the laying of wreaths at the cenotaph and attended a remembrance service in St. Macartin's Cathedral.

In terms of Enniskillen, it was my second year to attend and the eighth year in a row that the Irish Government has been represented at Remembrance Day ceremonies to remember the men and women from the island of Ireland who died in past conflicts and to remember those who lost their lives in the Enniskillen bombing in 1987.<\/p>  <p>  My most recent engagement prior to that was a meeting with the leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, in Government Buildings on 18 September where we discussed issues relating to Brexit and ongoing efforts between the two Governments to restore the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700023#V00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1574862600,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I want to raise two matters with the Taoiseach.  In respect of his ongoing contact with the DUP, I have discerned and maybe others in the House will have noticed a significant shift in the view of the DUP on the whole Brexit issue.  It was a campaigning party in favour of Brexit and in fact was a conduit of a lot of money into England in support of Brexit.  I think the reality of Brexit is a different proposition for its members.  Certainly the presentation of their position, although I do not want to misrepresent them, that I discern in the general election campaign now under way is that in certain circumstances, they might favour a second referendum because the various forms of Brexit negotiated and the difficulties for the island of Ireland in any form of Brexit have dawned on people.  Has that been explored in any way with the DUP by the Taoiseach and his officials?<\/p>  <p>  Second, I want to return very briefly to the debate we had yesterday on advance preparation for future constitutional arrangements on this island.  It was a useful start for a discussion.  The Taoiseach made a very valid point when he said that he did not want to have a forum in which 1 million unionists would not involve themselves and which in effect then would be simply a pan-nationalist forum.  I think most of us would agree with that but it is not the point.  We need to start to begin to think of what the future might bring in terms of a future constitutional arrangement and begin to see what sort of forum would allow people in some shape or form to be included in that discussion, including the unionist community.  That is what we need to do.  The notion that it is too difficult or we will not get people now or that it is not the right time will mean we will postpone the beginnings of shaping a dialogue until we are faced with an issue like the Brexit vote itself.  We will not have thought out the consequences of a democratic decision and I would like to have years of conditioning and preparation for this, for all of us to see what it means for us.  In the context of the suggestions I made yesterday, I hope the Taoiseach would think this through, perhaps over the Christmas period, and have scoping exercises with the democratic parties in this D&aacute;il as a beginning basis for a broader discussion on the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700023#V00600","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1574862600,"counter":404,"content":"<p>The breakdown of key relationships has been central to the ongoing crisis in North-South relations in recent years.  I am sure the Taoiseach would agree that his statement last year that his relationship with the DUP was fine because he had Arlene Foster's mobile number was not really a reflection of reality.  When the DUP went off with the European Research Group, ERG, Tories in their Brexit fantasies, it was never going to end well for them.  However, the entire point of the peace settlement is that the betrayal of the DUP by the Tory fundamentalists is not something in which we can rejoice.  What we are left with is the need to pick up the pieces of a badly damaged relationship.  The peace settlement cannot work without cross-community and cross-government co-operation.  The failure to show urgency on this in the past three years has done real damage.  Should the withdrawal treaty be ratified, and all indications are that it will be, we need to move quickly to demonstrate our goodwill and the fact that we are sincere in saying that the special economic arrangements for Northern Ireland are not a threat to the constitutional rights embedded in the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  In the last two weeks, all parties and governments have said they will engage in trying to re-establish the assembly and the Executive.  We need something concrete in terms of a new process and new dynamics in the discussions or we will end up back with the two largest parties jockeying for who can declare victory over the other.  What actions are proposed to build cross-community confidence in the new economic status of Northern Ireland?  What specific efforts are proposed to get the democratic institutions restored before the need for yet another assembly election arises? <\/p>  <p>  I would reiterate what I said yesterday in terms of what Deputy Howlin and others have said.  I find it extraordinary that there is a framework there but it is deliberately not being used.  The framework was deliberately collapsed.  Everybody wants to go off again and have another discussion for the next ten years.  A lot of people want people to work the institutions.  If people are elected, they are expected to take their seats in the assembly or Executive and work for the benefit of the people.  It is an extraordinary failure and an indictment of Sinn F&eacute;in initially, as it collapsed the assembly and the Executive, and of the DUP, which should have worked with Sinn F&eacute;in to restore it.  Sinn F&eacute;in took a premeditated decision on the renewable heat incentive, RHI, scandal.  We now learn from the inquiry that Sinn F&eacute;in was slow to close it down because unelected officials said the Minister for Finance in the North had to bow to them, to unelected officials within Sinn F&eacute;in.  The emails are there.  He sends emails to them.  An Executive and an assembly is collapsed.  If there is a scandal in the Republic we do not collapse the D&aacute;il.  We do not collapse the Government.  We have an inquiry and try to get to the bottom of it.  That is what should have happened.  At a time when there was a huge threat economically to Northern Ireland I find it just incomprehensible that people could still try to justify not having an assembly and an Executive.  Before we go anywhere else, will people in the North for God's sake demonstrate that they can work the institutions that are constitutionally there to be worked?  That is a basic prerequisite for anything.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700023#V00700","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1574862600,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I want to give the Taoiseach time to respond but I will allow Deputy Martin Kenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700023#V00800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1574863200,"counter":406,"content":"<p>The difference between the DUP leadership in place now and the one that was in place when the assembly was working well is that everyone saw, and we have seen around the world people looking on in awe at, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness working so well together and being able to find an accommodation despite being people who had held totally opposite positions.  They were able to come together and find a way forward because there was a genuine commitment to make that happen.  That is the difficulty we have at the moment.

We do not want to have a conversation that excludes people who have a unionist or British identity.

To do that, we have to work the institutions but we also have a responsibility here.  The Ireland's Future initiative is probably the start of something whereby, if we all work together on it and try to bring as many people as possible with us, we can come to a situation in the coming year, and certainly in the coming decade, such that it can be a decade about making change happen in an agreed and inclusive way.

We need to explore it, but this is where I strongly disagree with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  We have elected representatives in the North, and as much as everyone welcomes the peace in the North as an alternative to sectarian warfare, the fact is that the political structures within the Northern Ireland Assembly institutionalise sectarianism.

I watched \"Newsnight\" last night, which was broadcast from Belfast.  I think many people did, and maybe they detected subtleties that I missed.   Listening to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, he very much made the case that the DUP is for Brexit, is opposed to the withdrawal agreement, and would not support a Corbyn-led government, although it would consider its options if Corbyn was removed as leader of the Labour Party.  We are very much in an election phase.  The election is happening on 12 December in United Kingdom and also in Northern Ireland.  I look forward to resuming talks with all of the parties in Northern Ireland next month.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin is correct to say that the special economic arrangement that is envisaged for Northern Ireland under the withdrawal agreement is not a threat to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and certainly is not intended to be.

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, for coming in.  I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Harris, who has responsibility for this area, is not here, especially given that he is such an advocate for primary care.  He has spoken in this House on many occasions about the good services that primary care operates.  On this occasion, I will highlight the disappointment where he has promised a service for at least four years and has pulled back from that commitment.  The Minister visited this primary care centre and was advocating how good it was to have it as a centre of excellence with all of the appropriate facilities and services, but he is now rowing back from that, which is very disappointing.<\/p>  <p>  I will highlight the fact that since the service is not currently available in Celbridge, my home town, people have to travel to Naas for this service.  It is approximately 30 km away and Celbridge has no direct public transport link to it.  I have been raising this issue for the past 12 months.  I will walk the Minister of State through what has happened to date with regard to different correspondence.  This has been as a result of parliamentary questions that I have tabled and general representations to the HSE.  In January 2019, I raised the issue with the HSE, the Minister and the Department.  There was concern that the dental service was being lost from Celbridge to Maynooth.  The HSE confirmed to me in a letter, dated 28 January, that Celbridge primary care, a very large, modern primary care unit, was going to have dental services set up in it for Celbridge.  That was going to become a centre of excellence for Celbridge and the surrounding area.  The dental services for Maynooth were going to be relocated to Celbridge.  That was all very positive since we were getting information into the public domain about what was happening and what the plan was for this much-needed service for the general area.<\/p>  <p>  In April, I followed it up again and I got another confirmation from the HSE that the new dental clinic in the Celbridge primary care centre was still a priority and was progressing, which was all good news.  In August of this year, I asked a parliamentary question and the HSE confirmed that works for the dental clinic in Celbridge had gone to tender.  The tenders were being reviewed and the HSE was not able to give me a timeline for when this project was going to commence and be completed, but it was all positive.  Every answer is subject to funding, which we know, but it was still being progressed.  This is a large new primary care centre in Celbridge.  Many primary care providers do not have the needed services or facilities and many only work at a quarter or half rate.  It is important to bring in the needed front-line services there through the public health system.  This was all positive and was being accepted.<\/p>  <p>  In October, I was disappointed to get correspondence to tell me that the works would not commence and would not happen until 2023.  Everything had changed and had gone back by four years.  This was very disappointing, not just for me but for the people of Celbridge and the surrounding area.  There was promise after promise that this dental clinic would come to the Celbridge primary care centre, having been identified as being much needed and urgently required.  It was to become the centre of excellence for the area.  The Minister of State can understand our disappointment and frustration.  I have outlined in writing everything that I have said about the full sequence of events from the past 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  I have a few statistics to put on the record.  The population of Celbridge is 22,500.  Land is owned and planning permission has been granted for 3,500 houses.  We have no direct public transport access from Celbridge to Naas.  People cannot afford taxis and have no way to get there.  This situation is completely unacceptable and it needs urgent attention.  I hope that we will be able to progress it today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700025#DD00300","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1574863800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising the issue of the refurbishment of Celbridge health centre and the provision of a dental clinic at the centre.  The provision of services, including dental services, is an operational matter for the HSE.  The HSE has advised that it has a modernisation plan for the dental service in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7.  The existing location is a three-surgery clinic that requires upgrading of decontamination facilities, administrative space and other infection prevention and control upgrades.  The dental location in Celbridge acts as a hub for dental services in north Kildare due to the larger population of schoolchildren being served by that location.  The location has already been upgraded to provide extra oral radiographic services to patients attending other clinics in the north of the county.<\/p>  <p>  The Celbridge clinic closed in June 2018 for refurbishment to enable it to comply with new regulations.  Refurbishment work has been tendered and tender returns are being reviewed by HSE estates.  The HSE capital plan for 2020 is being developed.  Funding will be dependent on the capital available and competing priorities.  Routine dental services are being provided in the HSE dental clinics in Naas while emergency services are available from all HSE dental clinics located across the dental area as per normal.  The HSE is also engaged in a recruitment process to replace dental staff that have recently retired.  While the dental clinic in Celbridge is closed, all patients are being offered services as close as possible to Celbridge.  The HSE is actively monitoring this service and will ensure that all patients will continue to be offered appointments.<\/p>  <p>  The Celbridge primary care centre became operational in 2017.  It is a vital resource to the growing population of Celbridge and its surrounding area, serving approximately 23,000 people.  It delivers a comprehensive range of services through Centric Health GP Practice, Mangan's Pharmacy and Riverside Dental.  Primary care team services, including public health nursing, adult and paediatric occupational therapy, adult and paediatric physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and much more are also delivered on site.  The network disability teams services and child and adolescent mental health services are also part of the services being delivered.  The provision of these different services at the one location is designed to benefit the patient, but I know that it also gives practitioners an invaluable opportunity as professionals to work together and learn from one another's experience, which is so important.  The Health Service Executive will develop its capital plan for 2020 having regard to the available funding, the number of large national capital projects under way, and the cashflow requirements and priorities attaching to each project.  All projects are considered as part of this process.  Once the HSE has finalised its capital plan for 2020, it will then be submitted to the Minister, Deputy Harris, for consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700025#DD00400","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1574863800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>That answer is the stock answer that we get on what is happening overall.

It is not true to say that the dental service is being offered as close as possible to the people of Celbridge.  The closest possible service being offered at present is 30 km away and there is no direct public transport link from Celbridge to Naas.

We need that because families currently cannot access the services and get to their appointments, with 30 km being a step too far.  Attention for this needs to be prioritised to get this project, which was committed to a year ago, back on track.  It has been pushed out by four years by the Minister and the HSE.

A good number of them either did not complete the form or submitted forms that were ruled ineligible.  When I announced the reopening of the existing scheme - it is not a new scheme - I said it was on foot of the organic strategy's recommendations that it be targeted at the areas of deficit, which were cereals, dairy and horticulture.  Deputy Eamon Ryan asked earlier how many horticulture applications were refused.  One was refused out of two applications submitted.  The majority of applications were in the beef and lamb sector, where there is already an oversupply, and only up to 30%, or perhaps slightly more, of organically produced beef and lamb is sold in that way.  One of the reasons for this is that there is not enough feed in the system at an affordable price.  This is why cereals were prioritised.  We need to get more cereals into the system in order that beef and lamb producers who are already registered as organic farmers have an affordable source of supplementary feed.  That is the reason cereals were prioritised.  It was on foot of the recommendation of the strategy group, which involves all stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700027#FF01200","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","time":1574865000,"counter":463,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700027#FF01300"},{"type":"speech","time":1574865000,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I must again express my fury that, given the shocking content of two reports published this week about the scandalous situation of children and families in homeless accommodation, the senior Minister is not here to respond to this debate.  Perhaps it is just indicative of the fact that the situation has become completely indefensible.  What the State is now guilty of is nothing short of criminal neglect and child abuse.  There is no other way to describe it.  When a report suggests that hundreds and hundreds of infants in emergency accommodation are unable to learn to crawl, chew or speak or to have anything like a normal developmental pathway, that is criminal abuse and child abuse.  It is the Magdalen laundries of the 21st century waiting to happen.  If it continues, we will be looking at redress schemes such as those we saw for the women and girls of the Magdalen laundries.  It is utterly shameful.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's attempt to address the homelessness and housing emergency, which its policies have largely created, is now beyond failure.  According to the Respond report, only 8% of those entering emergency accommodation - 15% of whom are there for two years or more, 45% of whom are there more than a year, including, I repeat, in excess of 1,000 children - move on to secure social housing.  The rest end up in insecure HAP tenancies and are liable to end up homeless again in the near future.  The other big cohort end up having to go home into overcrowded conditions with their families or into other emergency accommodation, where the torture, hardship, neglect and abuse continue because of the failure of the Government to provide secure, affordable public housing on scale to address this housing crisis eight years after Fine Gael came to power.<\/p> <p>It must be remembered many of these children are now facing into Christmas.  The Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, and Focus Ireland have had to distribute a resource guide to teachers to deal with homeless children in school because of the stigma they face and the mental trauma they suffer by having to go into school every day in this situation of homelessness and where they cannot bring their friends home or have sleepovers.  It is obscene but nothing seems to change.  Nothing seems to move the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700027#FF01400","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574865600,"counter":466,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, could not be present but I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for raising the issue.

The developmental issues in children that have been highlighted need to be addressed and are not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting individuals and families experiencing homelessness is a priority for the Government.  Over the course of Rebuilding Ireland, the Government is committed to meeting the housing needs of more than 138,000 households, with 50,000 homes to be delivered through build, acquisition and lease.  The implementation of the plan is well under way and is making progress.  We can see this reflected in social housing waiting lists, which have reduced by 26% nationally between 2016 and 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to delivering homes for all of the families currently experiencing homelessness.  However, until a home is provided, it is also critical that we provide the appropriate accommodation and supports to households experiencing homelessness.  To minimise the use of hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation for emergency accommodation, the Government has provided local authorities with capital funding to develop family hubs. There are currently 30 family hubs in operation nationally, with a total capacity to cater for almost 690 families.  Additional hubs will be delivered in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  Hubs provide more security and stability for homeless families than is possible in hotel accommodation.  Families in hubs are supported by the local authorities and their contracted non-governmental organisation service delivery partners to identify and secure appropriate long-term accommodation.  The supports available in family hubs assist families to move from emergency accommodation to a home within a shorter timeframe.  The annual report released this morning by Respond, for instance, confirms that, on average, families move out of their hubs within six months, with a range of housing responses being provided.  These include local authority owned properties, approved housing body properties and housing assistance payment, HAP, supported tenancies in the private rented sector.  The objective is to secure a home for a family within a six-month period, although obviously we work to try to ensure that a home is provided within the shortest period possible.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, 5,135 individual adults and their associated dependants exited homelessness into homes, an increase of 8% on the 2017 figure.  In the first half of this year, 2,825 further individual adults and their associated dependants exited homelessness, up 21% on the comparable period in 2018.  Next year, it is expected that we will see in excess of 5,500 adults and their associated dependants moving out of homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  The HAP placefinder service plays a vital role in preventing families from entering homelessness in the first place and in housing those families who find themselves in emergency accommodation.  Under the placefinder service, all local authorities are now being provided with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation in order to secure accommodation via the housing assistance payment scheme.  Local authorities may, dependent on local demand, offer households in emergency accommodation the option to source accommodation themselves or with the assistance of placefinder officers. These officers are being funded by the Department.  Some 23 local authorities have such officers in place.  More than 9,300 households have been supported by the homeless HAP scheme nationally up to the end of quarter 3 of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting a household to exit from homelessness often requires more than a house; sometimes it requires a broader suite of social and welfare supports.  In that context, it is vital that the range of State bodies act in a co-ordinated fashion and a high level inter-agency group, including representatives from key Departments, local authorities, Tusla and the HSE, is in place to support this critical co-ordination objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700028#GG00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1574865600,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Honestly, for the Government to say council housing lists have reduced makes me want to scream.  Does the Minister of State know the reason they have reduced in large part?  It is because the Minister has refused to lift the income thresholds.  Therefore, every week people are coming into my clinic who have been lopped off the list.  They are still desperately in need of housing but because their income has crept up a few euro over the income threshold, which have not been raised for about a decade, they have been knocked off the list.  The Government&rsquo;s new plan to reduce the housing lists is to chop people off the housing lists, and for fewer people to be entitled to social housing even though there are no other options available to them, dragging a whole new cohort of people into the housing crisis.  Similarly, the Minister of State mentioning of the HAP scheme makes me want to scream.<\/p>  <p> I spoke to an person in the HAP placefinder office in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, which is supposed to find HAP tenancies, and she confirmed, not that I did not know this, that one-bedroom apartments in Sandyford are now going for &euro;2,000 a month.  The homeless HAP limit for one-bedroom accommodation is &euro;975.  People can forget that.  Nobody is moving out of homeless accommodation because the money being provided by the State is not enough to bring a person even halfway towards meeting the level of rent required.  Even if one managed to get a HAP tenancy, one could be homeless again in six months' time because there is nothing secure about them.  Meanwhile in O'Devaney Gardens and sites all over the country, the Government is selling off public land that could be used for public housing to provide secure affordable housing.  That is why we are in this mess.<\/p>  <p>  A demonstration of housing protestors will take place on 5 December to coincide with the anniversary of the death of Jonathan Corrie.  Those protestors have asked that there would be a debate on solutions to the housing crisis in here on the day of that rally, and I am glad that the D&aacute;il Business Committee has agreed to that.

It did not happen for a decade because there was a decade when incomes were fairly flat but they are starting to rise, and the Deputy was right to point out that aspect.<\/p>  <p>  I do not like to comment on individual cases but the Jonathan Corrie case was horrific.

I work closely with the Business Insurance Reform Group, which is led by Michael Horgan in Newmarket and Declan Ryan from Kenmare in County Kerry.  They have put in a great deal of work along with other groups to bring about change to the insurance industry.  Business is severely affected by the spiralling cost of insurance.  This year more than any other year, people have contacted me who are genuinely concerned about the cost of insurance and have indicated that for the first time ever, they are facing the possibility of having to close their doors in the new year because they cannot sustain the level of insurance premiums being sought to cover their businesses.  That is because underwriters are leaving the market and there is a lack of transparency.<\/p>  <p>  I remind the Minister of State that the European Union raided and examined insurance companies some months ago to determine if a cartel was operating within the industry.  <\/p> <p>At the time, there was much fanfare and co-ordination of reports stating that the Government was making a serious attempt to tackle the spiralling cost of insurance.  Where has that gone?  What has happened to that European investigation?  To where has it drifted off?<\/p> <p> Many motions on insurance reform have been moved in this D&aacute;il, and the Minister of State and every other public representative in this House encounter this issue on a daily basis.  A huge number of centres are closing, including many play centres, which made it very clear last summer that they would not be able to continue to sustain their businesses due to the spiralling cost of insurance.  There was much talk of what insurance reform had done to reduce the cost of car premiums, but that is no longer the case because it is continuing to spiral out of control.  Many voluntary organisations, community initiatives and organisations providing services to the State under section 39 have seen their insurance premiums escalate.  The problems faced by St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, the insurance premium of which went from &euro;140,000 to over &euro;500,000, has been brought to the Minister of State's personal attention.  That organisation provides services for the whole catchment area, including both my county and the Minister of State's.<\/p> <p> What has happened with the European Commission's dawn raids for tackling insurance?  What are the Government's real targets in this area?  We have heard many contributions, both in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere, about targets and initiatives tried by the Government.  Does the Government accept that many businesses will be forced to close their doors in the early part of 2020 because of the lack of coverage for insurance?  Many in the catering industry in particular are considering going without insurance, which is a very dangerous precedent.  I ask the Minister of State to address those issues. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700028#GG00600","speaker":"1283","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574866200,"counter":472,"content":"<p>First, I apologise for the absence of the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, who is responsible for this area.  I am a neighbour of Deputy Michael Moynihan's and many of the issues to which he has referred are familiar to me.  I know that this issue concerns him and he has raised it previously.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, to correspond with or meet the Deputy about it.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is very conscious of the cost and availability of insurance for those in small and medium-sized businesses across the country.  However, while the Minister for Finance is responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, neither he nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  Another constraint the Government faces in addressing this issue is that it is not in a position to direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.  Unfortunately, therefore, there is no policy or legislative silver bullet which would immediately decrease the cost of insurance.  This has also been recognised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in its report on motor insurance.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, the cost of insurance working group, CIWG, was established to try to improve the environment within which insurers conduct their business.  It has produced two reports, one on motor insurance and another on employer and public liability insurance.  While significant progress has been made in implementing its recommendations, including amendments to the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, and the establishment of the national claims information database in the Central Bank of Ireland, it is clear that the single biggest existing challenge impacting businesses is the level of awards given for relatively minor injuries compared to other jurisdictions, which must be addressed.  In this regard, the key recommendation arising from the CIWG reports was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC, and the publication of its two reports.  The PIC conducted a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time, which has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem.  This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland are 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales.  The PIC recommended that a judicial council be established which would compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  In carrying out this exercise, the PIC believes that the Judiciary will take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal, the result of its benchmarking exercise, etc.  On foot of this recommendation, the Government, with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas, prioritised the passing of the Judicial Council Act 2019.  This Act provides for the establishment of a personal injuries guidelines committee upon the formal establishment of the judicial council.  This committee will be tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the book of quantum.<\/p>  <p>  While some provisions of the Judicial Council Act have been enacted though statutory order by the Minister for Justice and Equality in order to allow background preparations to take place, the judicial council itself has yet to be established.  However, the Minister was pleased that the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Frank Clarke announced at the recent Insurance Ireland fraud conference that he has selected the personal injuries guidelines committee designate and that this committee will meet shortly to commence work on an informal basis.  He also noted the balanced composition of the committee, which reflects all court levels.  He believes this demonstrates that the Judiciary is giving this matter the priority it deserves.  The Government also notes the interim Insurance Ireland CEO, Mr. Gerry Hassett's statement at the same conference, which noted that if award levels come down, premiums will as well.  Both the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, consider this a very reassuring commitment, to which they intend to hold the insurance industry.  I also note that the insurance reform agenda continues to be a major priority for the Government and we believe a recalibration of award levels will go a significant way towards addressing the current affordability and availability of insurance impacting businesses.<\/p>  <p>  I will ask the Minister to revert to the Deputy directly on the European investigation to which the Deputy referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700029#HH00200","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1574866200,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I was going to note that the Minister of State's reply did not address the issue of the European Commission's investigation.

When, in the name of God, can we put that out there?  Businesses are grinding to a halt because of insurance.  The issue of insurance has come up repeatedly over the last while, more than any other.  We often talk of premiums and claims, but it also came out through the Houses of the Oireachtas this year that insurance companies are making massive profits.  I have met with many high street businesses attempting to keep their doors open and time and again they mention the crippling cost of insurance.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board was established a number of years ago.  However, the legal profession seems to have bypassed it as it is no longer the panacea it was 15 or 20 years ago.  Young people are paying through the nose for car insurance.  When will the book of quantum be replaced?

In his various roles in recent decades, he brought a focus to bear on housing problems in Ireland.  He provided an insightful voice to guide policy discussions and was always generous with his time to those of all parties and none who sought his assistance.  I wish to express my deep condolences and those of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to his family, friends and former students, who will miss his learned company.  The national conversation on this most pressing issue will be all the poorer for his passing.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam uasal.<\/p>  <p>   Fianna F&aacute;il believes home ownership is good for individuals, families, communities and the country.  For decades, that guiding thread linked housing policy across the State.  By 1991, we had become world leaders in terms of home ownership levels, with 82% of households owning their own home and the average age of a first-time buyer standing at 26.  With Government help, a household on a modest income could achieve ownership at a reasonable cost, enjoy their home and ultimately pass it onto the next generation if they so desired.  The path to realising that basic, decent and honest ambition is now being closed by the policies of the Government.  The rate of home ownership has plummeted to 67%, below the EU average of 69%.  Germany and Austria are often held up as exemplifying the type of rental policy Ireland should follow, yet they are seeing increases in home ownership rates while ours is reducing further.<\/p>  <p>  The aspirations and hopes of a generation are being stymied by a rent trap.  Unaffordable house prices and unprecedented rent levels are locking them into a rip-off rental market.  The cost of renting is 26% above the previous peak in 2008, with people in Dublin spending 55% of their net take-home pay on rent.  The dream of owning the roof over one's head or having a place of one's own is disappearing for a generation.  The ultimate reason for that is the failure of Fine Gael policy.  It is most evident in the flagship Rebuilding Ireland programme and Fine Gael's abandonment of home ownership as a primary goal for the State.  It is deliberate Fine Gael policy to push people into the private rental market which is becoming further commercialised and institutionalised, facilitated by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  In defending Rebuilding Ireland, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, has become the Minister for gaslighting.  For example, he has welcomed what he refers to as boutique-style hotels, but which are, effectively, bedsits with a price premium whereby the rent per square foot is higher in the Liberties than in Los Angeles.  He has attempted to depict missed targets and pushed-back deadlines as progress.  There is blatant manipulation of figures as basic as the number of homes to be built.  Rebuilding Ireland set a target of doubling output such as to deliver more than 25,000 units per annum on average over the period from 2017-2021.  That is set out in black and white on page 18 of Rebuilding Ireland.  In reality, it has delivered an average of 16,239 new units for 2017-2018 or 65% of the target to date.  In response, the Minister stated that the target is reaching 25,000 by 2021.  That is not what was set out in the announcement of the flagship plan.  The result of this cynical exercise in spin is a deepening social housing emergency, shocking numbers of homeless people on our streets, unprecedented rent levels and a profound home ownership crisis.  We have the highest rents ever, the highest homelessness levels in generations and the lowest home ownership rate in more than 50 years.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill forms part of a suite of measures Fianna F&aacute;il has worked on to build a ladder of opportunity for young people to achieve home ownership.  We have fought to retain the help-to-buy scheme to support buyers.  We have secured a new affordable housing scheme that will initially build on State-owned land 6,200 affordable units for purchase.  The difference is that if Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, it would implement and expand that scheme.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to the hard work of implementing policy and putting forward practical solutions, rather than grandstanding on motions that will not build an additional unit.  We have produced more than a dozen housing Bills in slightly more than a year, along with a costed and workable affordable purchase scheme and a plan to expedite house building and social housing by lifting the discretionary cap, which the Minister resisted doing all year.  Fine Gael likes to criticise Opposition housing policies but our housing policy can be seen on the D&aacute;il Order Paper and in the hard-won gains in budget documents.  The Government's policy can be seen in the cruel work of fiction that is Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to address the bulk buying of estates by real estate investment trusts, REITs, cuckoo funds and the State which prevents them being available to first-time buyers.  The State should be building rather than snapping up homes from under the noses of first-time buyers who are being squeezed in a vice grips by cuckoo funds and the State.  The Bill will allow local authorities to earmark a certain percentage of zoned land - up to 30% at the discretion of the planning authority - for first-time buyers.  It will operate on a similar basis to the current Part V provisions which ensure that 10% of units are set aside for social housing.  Under the Bill, each local authority will be required to review its housing strategy and set out its requirements for rental units over the lifetime of its housing plan.  This will ensure a full picture of the housing market is considered when a council sets out its future plans.<\/p>  <p>  The specific goal of the Bill is to prevent the bulk buying of entire developments by investment funds or the State which freezes out first-time buyers.  As part of an overall housing strategy, it contains exemptions to allow build-to-rent developments that would otherwise not be given the go-ahead, while preventing developments already in place being snapped up by investors at the last moment.  Investment in new build-to-rent developments will be facilitated, but such developments must be earmarked as being for rental only as part of an overall housing plan in appropriate areas.  Planning authorities will have the power to look at the concentration and proportion of build-to-rent units in communities and refuse or alter planning as required.<\/p>  <p>  At the core of this issue are competing visions for our housing system.  On one side, Fine Gael has abandoned the goal of supporting home ownership and instead embraced a tenure natural approach with a view to moving towards more and more rental.  On the other, Sinn F&eacute;in and others criticise home ownership and just want social rented housing.  Between those ideological extremes is what people actually want: to own their own home.  Even surveys carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have shown a significant preference for ownership.  Fianna F&aacute;il is clear on where it stands.<\/p> <p>We will fight for those ordinary working men and women who want something to show for their efforts, something that they can enjoy into retirement and pass on to their children should they wish.  This Bill marks another round in that fight and I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700030#JJ00500","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574867400,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for introducing this Bill, which forms another significant element of Fianna F&aacute;il's practical, radical and evidence-based policy measures, designed to produce an emergency-level response to the ongoing crisis in housing.  A generation faces being left scarred by a Government still not admitting the scale of the crisis or making the necessary decisions.  Hearing that a toddler faces development challenges in walking and eating as a result of homelessness should make every Deputy in this Chamber ashamed and should mandate us to seek radical yet responsible policies to get a grip on our housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Regrettably there are too many politicians in this Chamber and outside it, whose sole concern is to maximise the politics of Ireland's housing crisis and not offer solutions to it.  We have even seen Fine Gael D&aacute;il candidates state publicly that there is no homelessness crisis outside Dublin and that many of those who are suffering from homelessness are addicts and have made bad life choices.  Political rhetoric designed to play down the Irish housing and homeless crisis is as inexcusable as populist stunts designed to make political capital out of the suffering of thousands of Irish families, our fellow citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Those politicians who think that a general election in December or January will help ease the housing crisis at one of the most dangerous periods for homelessness should also reflect deeply on the politics they are promoting.  These politically motivated tactics are disgraceful and bring shame to the responsible, mature yet radical actions that need to be enforced to address the Government's failure to provide homes for our people.<\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to use the vast amount of expensive spin and public relations statements to attempt to convince us that the housing crisis is getting better.  However, we know that it is worsening and an entire generation of Irish people face never being able to afford a home in the Taoiseach's so-called republic of opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that the elephant in the Chamber tonight is how to increase the supply of affordable homes for sale and rent.  Fianna F&aacute;il has innovative, radical and purposeful policies in this regard such as this Bill, which will allow local authorities to earmark up to 30% of zoned land for first-time buyers.  It will operate on a similar basis to current Part V provisions which ensure that 10% of units are set aside for social housing.<\/p>  <p>  For example, a development of ten units must have up to three units available for first-time buyers to purchase.  Each local authority must also review its housing strategy to set out its requirements for rental units over the lifetime of its housing plan.

It contains exemptions to allow build-to-rent developments that would otherwise not be built to go ahead as part of an overall housing strategy while preventing developments already in place being snapped up by investors at the last moment.  In this way investment in new build-to-rent developments will be allowed but they must be earmarked for rental only as part of an overall housing plan in appropriate areas.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland needs around 35,000 new units a year and is building less than 20,000.  This is driving up rental prices, overcrowding and ultimately homelessness.  New investment that boosts badly needed supply should be welcome.  However, it should be part of a proper planning process that builds sustainable communities along with social and economic infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that we are heading towards a general election in late spring or early summer.  That gives this current D&aacute;il just over 40 sitting days to pass this Bill and to bring in many measures that will provide solutions to increase the supply of homes.<\/p>  <p>  I implore colleagues on both the Government and Opposition benches to use the remaining time to prove that representative politics can rise above tactical manoeuvres designed for a media agenda and vote for this Bill and other actions that this D&aacute;il can still ensure are introduced.

There is no worry about housing when they are merely worried about their 30 seconds on the news tonight.  In that respect the core component of home ownership needs to be addressed because we have multiple aspects to the debate on the housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  While the homelessness figures are increasing, there is a failure to provide an adequate supply of social housing through our local authorities and the HAP scheme has now become a scheme that has taken our housing policy in a completely different direction that is going to be very hard to undo, we rarely hear debates in this Chamber about the young people who actually have got the money together to purchase a home or an apartment but who, through a combination of lack of supply and not being able to compete in the marketplace with investment funds or ironically being up against local authorities which are buying up homes through their acquisition funds as their way of supplying houses, find that they cannot purchase a home as if there were not enough hurdles in their way to begin with.  While the frustration experienced by these young couples rarely gets aired, I know their anger.  Apart from them coming into my constituency office, I also meet them in my GAA club or out socialising at the weekend and they recount what is the main topic of debate for them.<\/p>  <p>  Why do we find ourselves having this debate?  It is because Government policy has feathered the nest of developers who favour these build-to-rent projects, resulting in a dearth of properties for first-time buyers to purchase.  Developers who are now building again are trying to squeeze the last drop out of every square foot and the same old problems are coming up, only this time it is worse.  The yield that developers are getting on these build-to-rent schemes are the highest in western Europe.  As there is no requirement to provide for a mix of different unit sizes naturally developers put in many more smaller units.  With developments being swallowed up by investment funds which seek only to maximise their return even further, the challenge that was already daunting for young couples becomes insurmountable.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to address these challenges by earmarking up to 30% of zoned land for first-time buyers, a very welcome initiative.  This is needed because, as Deputy Darragh O'Brien said, the rate of home ownership in Ireland has dropped like a stone over recent decades.  I purchased my home 15 years ago in the mid-2000s.  The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and I are from the same part of the world and are roughly the same age.  We both bought our homes and started families at the same time in our mid to late 20s.  Just over a decade later home ownership has slipped to that low of 67% - the lowest since 1971.  Instead of people buying in their mid-20s as we were able to do back then, the average age for a first-time buyer has now risen to 35.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from the fact that the act of purchasing is now so difficult, what is depressing is that even the hope or the dream of owning a home or apartment is evaporating and people are resigned to renting, with the cost of rent now 26% in excess of the peak in 2008.  Last year we heard in this Chamber that this was being tackled and there was no need for towns to come in under the rent-pressure zones and yet we have seen a huge swathe of new towns added this year, including my town.<\/p> <p>In analysing this crisis, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>yesterday described the Minister as an earnest Minister but stated that a <i>laissez-faire<\/i>attitude was still at work just like the attitude of W.T. Cosgrave back in 1924.  At that time, in the throes of an even worse housing crisis, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>reported the grumbling of the said Mr Cosgrave when he said it was up to private enterprise alone to build homes.  As we all know, things did not happen until the 1930s, when as the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>reported, it was &Eacute;amon de Valera who had the sense and decency to clear the slums and build thousands of homes.  We might not have the slums now.  Instead we have people who do not even have a roof over their heads but what does remain constant some 90 years later is the need for a Fianna F&aacute;il Government and Minister to come in and sort out the housing crisis.  The people of Ireland know that, that day is coming and I look forward to seeing our housing sector put back on the right track.  This Bill will form one part of that process as we deliver the homes for first-time buyers and give them a fair shot in the market place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700031#KK00500","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574868000,"counter":486,"content":"<p>A lot of history was mentioned in the Chamber but we do not need to go back to the 1920s or 1930s.  We can go back to very recent history and see the legacy of Fianna F&aacute;il in the housing sector and how it destroyed it, outsourced the provision of social housing to the private sector and managed to destroy the private housing sector in its entirety.  We are recoiling from that.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier, Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked that we might take a couple of moments in this debate to speak in memory of Simon Brooke, the chair of Cl&uacute;id Housing Association, and I thank him for that suggestion.  Simon Brooke and Cl&uacute;id were a force for the delivery of homes and helping people in housing insecurity.  He was a person who I thought was a leader who was interested in solutions and delivery.  I know he will be very much missed by his wife and son and that staff in Cl&uacute;id will feel a great loss today and into the coming weeks.  On my behalf and that of the Department, which worked so well with him and Cl&uacute;id over the past number of years, I extend my sympathies to all of the staff in Cl&uacute;id as well as to Simon's family and friends.  <\/p>  <p>  I also believe in home ownership and I share the objective of increasing the supply of housing for first-time buyers but this will not be achieved by measures set out in this Bill.  In fact, this Bill, if enacted, would only delay new homes for first-time buyers and others.  To be kind to Deputy Darragh O'Brien, I feel something got badly lost in translation here in terms of what he has been saying publicly and what is actually contained in the Bill.  I am surprised and concerned that Fianna F&aacute;il would bring forward a Bill that would intentionally reduce the social housing obligation on the private sector and reduce the potential for other forms of social housing delivery.  I am also surprised that after continuous criticism from Fianna F&aacute;il about too much \"red tape\" in the system, it would seek to put in place additional obstacles to the delivery of housing as well as unverifiable restrictions on general housing supply.  However, I am not surprised that this Bill is unworkable nor am I surprised that it betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the dynamics of the housing sector.  I am not surprised, although I am quite worried, that this Bill, if enacted, would actually do the opposite of what it purports to achieve.  This Bill would deliver fewer homes to buy for first-time buyers and drive even greater institutional investment in build to rent.   I will explain why.  Under this Bill, the social housing obligation on the developer is taken away in build to rent developments so there would be less social housing from the private sector, no public gain from zoning and other development and no mixed tenure on these sites.  While I support institutional investment in the build to rent sector to a degree, the removal of Part V would make such development the most profitable way to deliver a site.  Fianna F&aacute;il would do the exact opposite of what it claims it wants to do.   It would supercharge institutional investment in build to rent to the detriment of all other delivery.  <\/p>  <p>  The zoning of land for first-time buyers would be an unworkable restriction on development.  The proposal makes a very simple mistake in its assessment of the first-time buyer demographic.  The approach assumes that first-time buyers constitute a homogenous group and that they seek only new homes.  However, first-time buyers also gain access to housing in the second-hand market through older people downsizing or people moving to larger new homes as their family or income increases.  Furthermore, not all first-time buyers are in the same income bracket so how would these homes be priced?  The nature of their preferred home may depend on their income, length of time in the rented sector, household formation patterns and whether they are returned emigrants or migrants with capital to invest.  Therefore, public policy to support first-time buyers must focus on the issue of affordability and housing typology rather than on the particular status as a first-time buyer or otherwise.  This Bill, by contrast, is likely to restrict mobility within the market reducing choice and market access for first-time buyers and others.  How are first-time buyers to afford these homes?  Our first-time buyer measures are linked to prices and affordability, not zoning.  Let us look at it another way.  A builder builds 100 homes, of which 30 must be for first-time buyers under this Bill, so the builder builds 70 houses and 30 apartments to suit the new regulations.  The 30 apartments can be sold only to first-time buyers but what if an elderly couple wants to downsize?  What about someone who has previously owned a home but is now separated?  Fianna F&aacute;il should think of all the restrictions it is putting in place and the extra risk to the builder if the builder cannot dispose of all of the apartments to first-time buyers.  What does one do if one wants to provide a mix throughout the site instead?  What are the price points?  How does one regulate this?  Who would monitor these transactions?  How would we ensure that they were to first-time buyers?  Who would enforce these new regulations?  Has any of this been discussed with industry?  A basic examination would tell one that this is unworkable and would involve more red tape that would hinder the supply of new homes.  This is the point I keep on making with regard to housing.  It is complex.  Fianna F&aacute;il cannot just throw ideas from its friends down on paper and call it a Bill - one that, if enacted, would damage social housing supply and general supply and do nothing for first-time buyers and affordability.<\/p>  <p>  Home ownership is in decline and has been since 1991.  Let us not kid ourselves.  It is not because of what has been happening recently.  It fell more under a Fianna F&aacute;li Government than it did under a Fine Gael Government over the last period of time.  Nothing in this Bill halts that trend and, as I said earlier, it is likely to make it worse.  How should we address affordability?  How are we addressing it?  This Government is taking a multi-stranded approach to support home ownership for first-time buyers.   A combination of investment, access to finance, fast-track planning and changes to apartment and heights guidance has resulted in significant increases in supply.  It is expected that some 20,000 new homes will be completed this year, up from 18,000 last year.  We have already reached that in terms of the 12-month rolling total.  Social housing output next year will be the highest at any time this century, including any time during the boom years when Fianna F&aacute;il was last in Government.  We will build more social housing homes next year.  Between this year and next year, 21,000 homes will be added to the stock of social housing.  I see Deputy Darragh O'Brien laughing.  It is probably because he does not understand the facts of the matter.  <\/p>  <p>  Affordable housing output will steadily increase with the commencement last year of the relevant provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 to provide a statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase.  The new Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which was introduced by this Government in February 2018, has seen a draw down of 1,253 loans with a further 979 loans awaiting draw down.  Total scheme funding has reached &euro;563 million.  A total of &euro;310 million will be made available from 2019 until 2021 under the serviced site fund, SSF.  The SSF was established to provide key facilitating infrastructure on public lands to support the delivery of affordable homes to purchase or rent.  At a maximum funding rate of &euro;50,000 per affordable home, at least 6,200 homes will be facilitated in total for affordable purchase or cost rental.  This is a shared ownership scheme with sites already underway in Cork.  In Boherboy, the first of the 116 two-and three bedroom affordable homes will be sold next year at a discount of up to 40% on market rates.  This project is supported by some &euro;5 million from the SSF.   Deputy Darragh O'Brien might tell his leader that we have this affordable purchase scheme and shared ownership scheme because last weekend, he seemed to know nothing about it and yet today Deputy Darragh O'Brien claimed Fianna F&aacute;il delivered it.  I am not sure what is happening when it comes to housing policy development in Fianna F&aacute;il but this Bill tells us that it is not very much.  <\/p>  <p>  The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, is another key element of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  The objective of the fund is to provide public off-site infrastructure to relieve critical infrastructure blockages.  This will enable the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites in Dublin and in urban areas of high demand for housing.  LIHAF supports the delivery of up to 20,000 homes, 40% of which will be delivered through an affordable or cost-reduced scheme.  Cost reductions have been applied to 150 homes in County Kildare and another 336 in Adamstown in Dublin using LIHAF funding.  By the end of 2020, almost 1,800 homes will be delivered under LIHAF with a cost reduction.<\/p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency, LDA, which was established by the Government in support of Project Ireland 2040, is advancing a number of projects on State lands with a minimum requirement that 30% of the housing to be provided is affordable.  If we look at the first four sites being progressed by the LDA, we can see that a minimum of 60% of that land will be for social and affordable housing so we are going above the targets we set ourselves with this newly created agency.  <\/p>  <p>  What does this mean on a practical basis?  By the end of next year, some 2,000 affordable and cost-reduced homes will have been added to the  housing stock supported by various affordability initiatives.  Through these measures, we are seeing overall supply of housing increase.  We are placing a particular emphasis on affordable housing.  This is the way we address the needs of first-time buyers who currently face difficulty in getting affordable housing.  There is enough flexibility within the current provisions of Part V to allow local authorities to zone land appropriately to meet their local housing need, taking account of both the current stock and new requirements.  <\/p> <p>To aid this process, following on from the national planning framework, my Department is producing development plan guidance for local authorities to ensure new plans are aligned with these objectives and new methodologies to support the evidence base for housing strategies, including a new tool being developed to assess housing demand and need based on work already advanced in Scotland in this area.  By contrast, the provisions of this Bill are not grounded in any evidential base.  The provisions will not assist in improving the viability of housing construction, increasing overall housing supply or improving affordability and access to housing for first-time buyers.  The impact will be hugely disruptive to the building of new homes and, therefore, I cannot support this Bill.<\/p> <p> I do not mean to be dismissive but Deputy Darragh O'Brien is the main Opposition party spokesperson on housing and this is a bad Bill.  It is not good enough.  The Deputy has been talking about this Bill for three months and it will do the complete opposite of what the Deputy claims it will do.  That is a mistake.  Rebuilding Ireland is working and producing results and only exists because of the support of the Deputy's party.  Rebuilding Ireland is being supported by Fianna F&aacute;il and it is time to be honest with the public about the support that Fianna F&aacute;il is giving to our housing policies in this Chamber and in the Oireachtas committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700032#LL00200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574868600,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Ellis.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to join with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and Deputy Darragh O'Brien in expressing my deepest sympathy to the family, friends and colleagues of Simon Brooke, who passed away yesterday, and to offer condolences to his partner, Anna Heussaff, and his son, Conall.  Simon was a well-known figure in housing policy circles, having worked for Focus Ireland and Cl&uacute;id, and having taught at the school of social work and social policy in Trinity College Dublin.  He worked as a housing policy consultant for many years, producing important research and publications for the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  A tireless champion for social justice in housing, Simon was a strong advocate of public housing as a means of meeting social and affordable housing need.  Indeed, he was the first expert to make the case for cost rental accommodation in Ireland.  He was generous with his time and expertise and will be sorely missed by all of us who knew and had the pleasure of working with him. <\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in will supporting Deputy Darragh O'Brien's Bill, albeit with a significant degree of hesitation.  We share the Deputy's concern about the distorting impact of short-term institutional investors on our housing system and we look positively at all proposals that seek to assist first-time buyers.  Having said that, I believe the Bill as it stands is deeply flawed and would need serious scrutiny and significant amendment on Committee Stage if it is to have any positive impact on those locked out of the option to own their own homes.  <\/p>  <p>  Before outlining those concerns, I will make a few general remarks on the issue of home ownership.  Contrary to the views expressed by some, the preference for home ownership is not the result of some cultural attachment to property ownership in Ireland, it is the consequence of a century of bad Government policy.  The under-provision of public housing, particularly for middle-income households, coupled with the weak regulation of the private rental sector, has meant that for the majority of people, long-term security of tenure can only be guaranteed by owner-occupation.  Council housing is beyond the reach of the majority and a mixture of insecurity of tenure and rent in the private rental sector and weak pension provision has pushed people into home ownership.  It was the failure of successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments to provide a genuinely tenure-neutral housing system, in which public housing, private rental accommodation or home ownership could provide an equal measure of security, that has led the vast majority of people to prefer owning their own home.  <\/p>  <p>  Contrary to Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien's assertion, the decline of home ownership is not a recent phenomenon.  It started during the 1990s when his party was in government.  The toxic tax incentives that underpinned the property boom during the Celtic tiger, which included cuts to capital gains tax, cuts to stamp duty and section 23 tax reliefs, caused the first wave of institutional investment in residential housing.  This priced out an ever-greater number of first-time buyers, as the growing number of landlords snapped up an increasing number of homes.  Worse still, it pushed up house prices forcing tens of thousands of first-time buyers into excessive and, in some instances, unsustainable levels of debt.<\/p>  <p>  Policies pursued by Fianna F&aacute;il during the 1990s and 2000s saw home ownership decline from 79% in 1990 to 70% in 2011.  The consequent growth of the private rental sector did not represent a choice but rather the reality of ever-greater unaffordability.  As it was with Fianna F&aacute;il, so it is now with Fine Gael, although instead of incentivising small-scale, semi-professional landlords, Fine Gael has shifted the incentives to large scale global equity investors.<\/p>  <p>  I am not against all forms of institutional investment in our housing system.  Long-term, low-yield investors, such as pension funds or the credit unions, could play a valuable role in stabilising our housing system.  Unfortunately, the tax incentives for Irish collective asset management vehicles, ICAVs, and real estate investment trusts, REITs, introduced by then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, have brought the wrong kind of investor into the market.  Short-term, high-yield funds availing of incredibly generous tax breaks are driving up prices and pushing first-time buyers out of the market.  If structured in certain ways, these funds can avoid tax on their rent roll and on capital gains when they flip the development.  Moreover, in many cases their investors can avoid paying any dividend withholding tax whatsoever.  Just as with Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s tax breaks of the 1990s and 2000s, Fine Gael&rsquo;s tax breaks are pushing up the price of renting and buying while crowding out first-time buyers.  In turn, home ownership has continued to decline and was at 67% in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  It is little wonder that Fianna F&aacute;il said nothing about these so-called tax efficient property investment vehicles.  In fact, under the confidence and supply agreement, Fianna F&aacute;il has facilitated them in budget after budget.  It is therefore a little bit rich of Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien to complain about the impact these funds are having on first-time buyers when his party was for so long complicit in the very tax laws that brought them into our housing system in the first instance.<\/p>  <p>  If Fianna F&aacute;il was really serious about ending the distorting role of vulture funds in our housing system, it would start with recommending reform of the tax code rather than the planning code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700033#MM00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1574868600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I will deal with that point at the end of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700033#MM00300","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1574868600,"counter":490,"content":"<p>That brings me to the Bill.  Let me very clear that, contrary to the claim of Deputy Cassells, I, and Sinn F&eacute;in, support tenure neutrality.  We believe that a housing system should allow people to freely choose whether they want to own or rent a home and should allow them to make that choice not out of fear of rising rents, insecure tenure or affordability after pension age, but because their choice best suits their interests.  That means making both renting and owner-occupation affordable and secure.  The big concern I have with this Bill is that it does nothing to address these key issues.  While it would allow a local authority to prescribe a portion of a development for first-time buyers, it does nothing to ensure that these properties are affordable.  It could also have the unintended consequence of pushing up the cost of rents in the remaining 70% of any development, as the developer seeks to recoup revenue lost in the sale of a proportion of the properties to first-time buyers.  That could result in increased rents for the renters in the remainder of a development.<\/p>  <p>  I agree fully with the Minister's concerns over the impact of this legislation on Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and, particularly, the exclusion of Part V from build-to-rent developments.  I hear what Deputy O'Brien has said, but it is not dealt with in the Bill with sufficient clarity and that is a concern that the Minister and many others share with all sincerity.<\/p>  <p>  The real issue facing us today is how to ensure a substantial supply of affordable homes to rent and buy for those not eligible for social housing.  This is where our primary focus should be.  This means dramatically increasing investment by the Government in public housing on public land to meet social and affordable housing need.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the legislation this evening as we agree with its intention but it has a long way to go and requires much amending before it actually offers first-time buyers what they really need, namely, access to good quality, secure and affordable homes.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to respond briefly to some of the Minister's claims about affordable housing.  One of the real concerns that many of us have with the initiatives that the Minister listed is that the homes to rent or buy that he is talking about will not be affordable to the households which so desperately need them.  For example, we are currently looking at the first affordable cost rental scheme in Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown coming in with rents of &euro;1,200 per month.  For those households whose incomes are above the threshold for social housing eligibility, &euro;1,200 a month is not affordable.  It is significantly above 30% of their take-home pay.  We need these schemes to deliver rents between &euro;700 and &euro;900 a month to particularly target those households in the income categories between &euro;35,000 and &euro;55,000.<\/p>  <p> Likewise, with the purchase homes, one of the aspects many of us cannot understand about the final proposal that has come back from Dublin City Council on O'Devaney Gardens is that whereas in Poppintree, in Ballymun, &Oacute; Cualann, using an equivalent of the serviced sites fund and land from Dublin City Council, was able to sell good-quality, affordable homes to working families priced between &euro;180,000 and &euro;225,000, the purchase price of the majority of the homes in O'Devaney Gardens would be &euro;310,000.  However, there also will be a &euro;50,000 clawback whereby if the affordable purchaser, as they are called, ever sells the house or passes it on to family, he or she will ultimately pay upwards of &euro;360,000.  That is not affordable for working families on &euro;45,000, &euro;55,000 or &euro;65,000.<\/p> <p> The same is true with the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF.  If the Minister looks at his Department's spreadsheet that was published last year he will see that in the majority of cases where private developers have secured funding from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, often to the tune of &euro;10 million to &euro;20 million, the properties they will then sell have no affordability discount of any meaningful kind.  In some developments they will come in at or above market prices at the time the funding was agreed.  In some cases, this fund was made available to some of the largest and most cash-wealthy developers who did not even need it.<\/p> <p> It is all very well for the Minister to come into the House and tell us he has a serviced site fund, an infrastructure activation fund and the Rebuilding Ireland home loan but, increasingly, we are finding in our constituencies large numbers of modest income working families who cannot access homes.  When those homes about which the Minister is talking become available, they will still not be able to access genuinely affordable homes to rent or buy, which is the reason he must seriously revisit both his understanding of, his price range and his investment strategies in respect of affordable housing because unless we start to deliver thousands of genuinely affordable homes to rent or buy, preferably by building public homes on public lands, the affordability crisis will get worse, contrary to the claims the Minister made here today.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill but we believe it needs a great deal of work.  We are happy to work with other Deputies in the committee to try to meet that end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700033#MM00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574869200,"counter":492,"content":"<p>While I welcome an opportunity to speak on this Bill, which purports to give first-time buyers an opportunity to buy a house, I agree with Deputy Darragh O'Brien's comments made in the media that it is not acceptable that whole developments and estates are being bought by investment groups and similar to the detriment of first-time buyers.  The question the Minister must ask is why that is happening, especially as such investments are clearly impacting on the housing market.  It is happening because this Government, with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, introduced big incentives and cut-price sell-offs of large quantities of estates and properties to such investment groups and cuckoo funds.  The Minister cannot have it both ways; he cannot run with the hare and chase with the hound.<\/p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Bill is an anomaly in that it objects to a situation which Fianna F&aacute;il supports and has helped create.  The Bill will require substantial changes as it raises several discrepancies that would need to be addressed later in committee.  The Bill does not sufficiently address the housing crisis or the difficulties people face when trying to get into the housing market.<\/p><p>I will address some of the problems the Bill raises.  While the Bill would provide for a percentage of a development to be set aside for first-time buyers, there is no cap on the cost of the properties for first-time buyers, nor is there a clear indication of the percentage that would be set aside.  Buying a house, particularly in Dublin, has been made increasingly more difficult as house prices continue to soar.  More people are being excluded from the housing market, putting the prospect of owning a house out of the reach of most people.<\/p><p>I find it difficult to understand how Fianna F&aacute;il supported a position to change the Part V provision whereby private developments had to give 20% to social and affordable housing and then supported a position which reduced that to 10% without any provision for affordable housing.

I have to say at the outset that, as a former Minister of State for housing, I was well acquainted with the late Simon Brooke.  He was the driving force behind the Cl&uacute;id Housing Association and he made a stalwart contribution towards trying to achieve solutions to significant issues as an approved housing body.  I offer my sympathies and that of the Labour Party to Simon Brooke's family and the staff of the Cl&uacute;id Housing Association throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  As somebody who came from a local authority house, and was very proud of it, I always knew that our party was very committed to the construction of local authority housing.  I only have to go back to the time of former Members Jim Tully, Liam Kavanagh, Emmet Stagg and Liz McManus.  When I came into this House in March 2011, there was not a shilling available.  I remember the few shillings we had for the local authority small schemes.  That was threatened to be taken away.  If there was a shilling in a pot, I would have been delighted to devote it to local authority housing because I know the value of getting a local authority house.  I was always proud to say where I came from, to pay rent and not run up arrears.  I was always delighted to pay.  My parents struggled to pay but they always paid.  I am very proud of that fact, and it is important.<\/p>  <p>  What I saw when I came into this House was that, unfortunately, the previous Government had moved into the sphere of dependence upon the private sector in all aspects of housing provision.  It privatised the provision of housing.  To reverse a policy that was going well was foolhardy in the extreme.  The height of the Celtic tiger period, when huge resources were being generated, was an opportune time to make sure the local authorities continued along the same vein and provided local authority houses.  Someone was blinded by the mirage of Celtic tiger growth.  A lesson all of us can take away from that is never to go down that road again.<\/p>  <p>  We will support anything that improves the provision of housing.  We will support this Bill in principle but as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, a number of issues will have to be addressed on Committee Stage.  I have no doubt Deputy O' Brien will be up for that to achieve his purported objective.<\/p>  <p>  I salute people who bring forward Bills in this House to address very important issues.  It is a worthy effort at this stage to address the need of first-time buyers but there is a number of issues that need to be addressed in the Bill to make it fit for purpose.  It should be noted that, while the Bill would allow for lands to be designated, it does not address the principle issue of affordability, which is the key point, for first-time buyers.  This is anathema to me.  I know the private sector has to have some role but I am opposed to depending on the private market to resolve a problem.  The State must be the primary driver.  The private sector is like the hungry pig at the trough.  The snout is always in if there is something in it for him.  As I said this morning when I spoke about the beef processors, of whom I have a lot of experience, they only worry about bottom lines, the margins and who they can squeeze to achieve, maintain and increase margins.  They do not care who is injured in the process.  That is the reason we have to refocus on this area.  I know we are coming from a place where no houses were built.  I am not totally agnostic in respect of this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill gives the local council the power to designate land for the purpose of developing housing to be set aside for first-time buyers by amending Part V of the Planning and Development Act and would seek a certain amount of between 0% and 30% to be earmarked for this purpose.  There are concerns about the way that would be applied.  The level would be informed by the assessment to build or to rent requirements of the local authority areas, which would mean rental requirements would be calculated separate from other housing requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Rental developments will proceed only if they are in line with the housing strategy requirements.  While it is a proposed solution, I am sure I am not the only one who believes it is a complicated way to seek to address the problem of affordable homes.  The Bill defines eligible individuals as those who have not previously bought a home.  As a barrister, I have identified one small flaw, it would not exclude those who have inherited or have been gifted a property.  In that regard, the definition of a first-time buyer, as described, would need to be expanded or some other definition devised.  <\/p>  <p>  We have heard many times from Fianna F&aacute;il about the affordable housing proposals it secured in government with Fine Gael but we have not seen any evidence of those yet.<\/p> <p>I will welcome them whenever they do emerge.<\/p> <p> One of the biggest problems faced by young people who want to buy their own home is the record level of rent they must pay.  People are paying substantially more in rent every month than they might on a mortgage.  Meanwhile, they are unable to save for a deposit.  I have experience of the Rebuilding Ireland programme because I was filling out a couple of forms for Westmeath County Council.  One of the partners in a certain couple whose case I dealt with was made bankrupt a few years ago.  The couple are back on their feet but the black print, that is, the small type, excludes them.  They would be paying less on a mortgage than on rent but they are encountering difficulty because one of the partners was bankrupt three or four years ago.  Thankfully, he availed of my legislation, on the one-year bankruptcy period, to get out of his circumstances.  The banks were so greedy they wanted to press everybody.  The individual in question is again being punished, this time by the State.  We have to consider cases like that.  We have to take the opportunity.  Why not take a chance on our own citizens?  We have done that for the vulture funds, with their tax-free-haven status.  Why not take a chance on a citizen who is paying income tax and rent?<\/p> <p> Rents have continued to increase well ahead of the growth in wages.  This means people who cannot afford to buy are being squeezed, and squeezed further.  It is welcome that Fianna F&aacute;il recently did an about-turn on rents and has converted to the side of those of us who want a rent freeze.  That is what should be put in place.  Let us test the Constitution in this regard.<\/p> <p> For the record, it was Fianna F&aacute;il that allowed Fine Gael put in place the disastrous rent pressure zone model, which has 4% annual increases for tenants.  This is far ahead of the rate of inflation.  Unfortunately, the damage has been done to the incomes of people in the rental market.  Rents are now at a record high and will continue to grow unless we intervene.<\/p> <p> It is crystal clear that the market created the housing crisis.  There is no way it can solve it, nor should we even contemplate it solving it.  The State must step in and reassert its role in the provision of housing.  If we want to provide affordable housing for first-time buyers, young people, renters and those who need it, we can do so if there is collective political will.  The Labour Party wants this to happen.  It is why we published last year our comprehensive strategy, Affordable Housing for All, produced by my colleague Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.<\/p> <p> Our aim is to deliver 80,000 units over five years, at a cost of &euro;16 billion, with the source of the money identified &ndash; it is not phantom money but real &ndash; to deal with the most significant social problem of our time.  These would be homes built on public land.  To achieve this, we propose the creation of a housing development bank that would incorporate the expertise and resources of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency and would also incorporate the Land Development Agency, which the Government has set up but which is going nowhere.  There is no reason the Government cannot mandate the Land Development Agency on this day to ensure any housing built on its lands will be affordable and reserved for first-time buyers.  Under Labour's plan, the combined remit of the bodies would be to act as a State-owned commercial housing developer with a remit to produce social housing and affordable public housing on publicly owned land.  This is radically different from the current policy of providing a large proportion of State-owned land to the private sector to build for profit and what the market would allow, with even so-called affordable homes linked to the market rate, rather to what a household can afford.<\/p> <p> We are all aware that, under the &Oacute; Cualann model, homes in the Dublin area were built and can be built for less than &euro;200,000 per unit.  There is no shortage of ideas or solutions to the housing crisis.  What has been lacking is political will on the part of the Government.  That the Government relies on developers to provide solutions to the greatest social problem of our time is mind-boggling.  We have to ensure a social democratic model of housing provision will become the bulwark in addressing the problem of social housing.  By giving local authorities a pivotal role, we can start addressing it.  It will take time but with the political will in this House, it can be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700034#NN00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574869800,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I am sharing my time with Deputy Barry.  There is an horrendous housing crisis.  It is a crisis of massive unaffordability.  Half a million young people are stuck at home unable to afford to move out.  We are aware that over 10,000 people are homeless.  This is a significant understatement because of the cooking of the books by the Minister.  There are those who face rent increases, with the average rent in Dublin now being over &euro;2,000 per month.  It is going only one way.  It is an absolute crisis for ordinary people.<\/p>  <p>  What is the answer of Fianna F&aacute;il?  It is to abstain next week on a motion of confidence in the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, who is responsible for this crisis, thus allowing him to continue with the same policies.  It is to vote at Dublin City Council and other councils to privatise public land to be used by private developers as opposed to using it for the building of public housing.  It is to bring forward proposals like this that will fundamentally make no significant difference by way of making homes affordable.  It is tinkering around the very edges of a system.  Why?  It is because Fianna F&aacute;il is locked into the same market mentality as Fine Gael.  The thinking is that the private sector can best deliver housing and other services and facilities despite all the evidence to the contrary.  The mentality is, of course, informed by unprecedented rent going to developers and landlords, including corporate landlords, and unprecedented profits going to developers.  These are the people whom Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il represent.  They are the ones benefiting from this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal creates the illusion of doing something but it would make no difference in making housing more affordable.  There is nothing in the Fianna F&aacute;il proposal to reduce housing prices or provide affordable housing for purchase or rent.<\/p>  <p>  About 64% of the workforce is on less than the mean income of approximately &euro;38,000 per year.  Approximately 1.2 million workers are on &euro;30,000 are less.  These people simply cannot afford the Minister's so-called affordable price of around &euro;310,000, a figure the developers set to ensure they can generate a profit.  This is a principle that Fianna F&aacute;il also supports.<\/p>  <p>  These Fianna F&aacute;il proposals would do nothing to reduce prices for first-time buyers.  If Fianna F&aacute;il genuinely wanted to make housing available and make it available in the area of zoning in the novel way in question, it would propose that the council zone significant, strategic plots of land for public housing to form a core of mixed-use, higher-density sustainable developments that would have public transport integrated into the design.  I refer to sustainable settlements along the lines of the Vauban and Rieselfeld districts in the city of Freiburg in Germany.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need for 500,000 new housing units by 2040.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are committed to having the private sector simply deliver these.  It will do so in a dysfunctional, unplanned way without proper public transport and infrastructure, and without building the communities in which people want to live.  The only answer is to break out of the market straitjacket that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are determined we should be in.  The answer is to develop a green new deal with socialist policies on public housing that set out to de-commodify housing as opposed to making it something that the rich can profit from and that represents a crisis for ordinary people.  The caps on access to social housing should be abolished.  Anybody should be able to gain access to social housing.  That means that a massive programme of building genuinely affordable social housing is needed.  Some 100,000 homes are needed over the course of the next three years.  They should be built to a passive standard.  This means proper rent controls.<\/p>  <p>  In order for any of this to happen, the rule of the landlords and developers in this country needs to be broken.  The starting point for that is mobilisation.  Mobilisation is required to demand that these things happen.  It is clear that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael will not do it of their own volition.<\/p>  <p>  Those who are planning and organising for the demonstration on 5 December at 12.30 p.m. in the Garden of Remembrance are stating in the Facebook group today that they should be doing what the farmers are doing on the streets, that is, mobilising in big numbers and showing their power.<\/p>  <p>  I encourage those looking at what is happening this week and what will happen again next week, with Fianna F&aacute;il allowing these policies to continue, to get out on the street, mobilise on 5 December to build a housing movement and argue for socialist policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700035#OO00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1574869800,"counter":496,"content":"<p>More than 5,000 applicants are currently on Cork City Council's housing waiting list.  It is not unusual for people to be on that list for ten years or more.  Behind the numbers lies many a story of human misery.  One piece of good news for the more than 5,000 came recently with reports of plans for 54 social houses on a 2.1 ha site alongside St. Dominic&rsquo;s retreat centre, Montenotte.  Scandalously, this proposal has been opposed by the Fine Gael Party.<\/p> <p>At first, it was opposed by one councillor, but at a recent public meeting the leader of the Fine Gael group on the council, Councillor Des Cahill, announced that all Fine Gael councillors would oppose the development.  This stance has rightly earned widespread condemnation in the city.  With a by-election under way, the Fine Gael position is widely seen as an attempt to cadge a few local votes at the expense of people in real social need.  One of the voices condemning the Fine Gael position is that of the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  Deputy Martin said Fine Gael members are looking down their noses at social housing projects.  He said their position is completely over the top.  He said that it seems to him that this is a class thing.  I do not disagree with any of that.  However, last night on RT&Eacute; Radio One's \"Late Debate\" programme Fianna F&aacute;il by-election candidate Councillor P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan said there are issues such as public access to the estate that people have genuine concerns about that could lead to anti-social behaviour.  He added that if we cannot build 54 houses, we have other massive projects.  Presumably he meant where people could be housed in an alternative location.  In other words, the Fianna F&aacute;il candidate pulled his punches and backed down from unequivocal support for the project.  I have a simple question for Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700035#OO00300","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574870400,"counter":498,"content":"<p>He is not here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700036#PP00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1574870400,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Is Fianna F&aacute;il committing itself, unequivocally, to 54 social houses at the site in Montenotte or, after all the fine talk, is the party following the lead of its by-election candidate and pulling its punches on this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700036#PP00300","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1574870400,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700036#PP00400","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1574870400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Joan Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700036#PP00500","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1574870400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

They are attractive for developers.  Some developments are being entirely bought up by investors, even during the construction phase.  It is not surprising that the word \"cuckoo\" is being used to describe those funds because we know the reputation of the cuckoo which pushes the eggs of other birds out of their nests and moves into the nest.<\/p>  <p>  I accept there is a different view that Dublin, for one area, needs to build tens of thousands more rental homes, but we do not have the type of rental system of fair rents, fixed rents and long-term leases other cities have so it is no wonder that people want to buy and own their own home.  I am talking about a single person or a couple on the kind of salary that would have ensured they would be able to buy a home previously.  I refer to those working in the Civil Service, teachers and nurses.  Many of them are paying exorbitant rents today, much more than a mortgage repayment and with the substantial deposit needed to comply with the Central Bank regulation, even if they did get mortgage approval and to put in a bid for a property, the reality is that they would probably be outbid by an investment firm.  What chance does an average first-time buyer, working and paying their taxes, have of buying a home?  I hope the Bill will give the average earner a fair chance because the average earner cannot compete with investors and their level of capital.  The Bill recognises that and the fact that they deserve a fair chance of access to the housing market.<\/p>  <p>  The growth of buy-to-let properties is a very worrying trend.  I will just give a prime example of the North Lotts in the docklands area where ugly towers are going up, swamping the communities that are there for generations and depriving them of daylight and quality of life.  It is not doing anything to alleviate the housing situation, nor is it doing anything for the average first-time buyer.  A 10% allocation of social housing is not even being provided in the area.  Who benefits?  It is the developer, the investment firms and the companies bulk-buying and renting to their employees.  The first-time buyer who wants a home, not an investment property, does not have a chance.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill proposes that one third of new development land would be set aside for first-time buyers.  We know we live in an unequal society.  We know that people who have access to finance will be able to put down any deposit they want on an apartment or a house so the first-time buyer I want to see being helped is the average earner, not those who have access to the big deposits.  The situation must be clarified in the Bill by means of amendment if need be.  When I started teaching in the early 1970s, after a struggle, my colleagues were able to get a deposit and to buy a home.  When I talk to young people who work with me today, who are also average earners, they are so pessimistic about ever having a chance to own their own home unless there is a drastic change.<\/p>  <p>  I looked at Respond's annual report earlier today.  It acknowledged the significant challenges and outlined its own contribution.  Its vision is that every family and individual would have high-quality housing but the point was made that a holistic approach is required.  Numerous agencies are involved in housing: the Department, local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the HSE, among others, but we do not see a holistic approach.  In the meantime, as one person or family is housed, another person or family is evicted and in need of emergency accommodation which is costing a fortune.<\/p>  <p>  I had the opportunity to attend part of the Social Justice Ireland, SJI, annual conference yesterday.  It went through the five pillars of Rebuilding Ireland and analysed them.  Its analysis was very critical.  The first pillar is to address homelessness.  The view is that it is very ambitious and is a very worthy objective, but it is not being delivered.  The second pillar is to accelerate social housing.  The 2019 European Commission country report summed up how this is not being achieved.  We see it in the waiting lists and the length people are waiting.  The third pillar is to build more homes.  There has been an increase since 2013 but it is just not enough.  The point made by SJI is that the increased construction alone will not solve the housing crisis as affordability remains an issue, which is my concern about the Bill.  The fourth pillar is to improve the rental sector.  We know rents are increasing and the only answer seems to be to build more student accommodation and I just do not know about that.  The fifth pillar is to utilise existing houses.  We know that more could be done in that regard.  The UN special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing refers to the financialisation of housing.  I question whether the Bill will make a difference and I hope it does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700036#PP00700","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1574870400,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Private Members' Bill.  Like other speakers, I would not block a Bill that is trying to deal with this specific area but I am concerned that it does not address the fundamental issues facing first-time buyers and it will not make a difference to them.<\/p>  <p>  I will follow on from what Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said about the UN special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing.  She sent a group of guidelines to all countries on housing and the right to housing.  She made the point that the new set of actors, namely, the vulture funds and equity funds, entered the market in 2008 and made a quick killing.  They were effective in not alone getting houses but in extracting the profit out of them.  She mentioned a figure I consider to be of the utmost importance and which I wish to put on the record of the House.  She said the global value of residential real estate is $163 trillion.  She said that is three times the value of the combined GDP of every country in the world.  That is how much wealth those funds are making, yet the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said he welcomed the vulture funds because they pick the carcase and that helps the situation.<\/p>  <p>  The fact of the matter is that the average three-bedroom semi-detached house in Dublin is priced at around &euro;430,000.  The average salary in Dublin is about &euro;36,600.  The mortgage on the average house is more than ten times the average salary in Dublin.  That is where the issue of affordability arises, not just in Dublin but all over the country.<\/p>  <p>  The problems in the housing crisis, whether it is affordable mortgages for first-time buyers or unaffordable rents in the private sector, will not be solved by tinkering with the issue rather than by dealing with the fundamental problem.  We have had a number of initiatives of this character from the Government.  I refer to the help-to-buy scheme, the local infrastructure housing activation fund, fast-track strategic housing development legislation, changes to the planning laws and reductions in the building standards of apartments but none of them has made the fundamental difference that is needed to address the housing crisis we face as a country.<\/p>  <p>  The Government strategy outlined in Rebuilding Ireland simply repeats the mistakes from the 1980s on the withdrawal of the State from building public housing and policies of subsidising private landlords with the housing assistance payment, HAP, pursued for 14 years by Fianna F&aacute;il in government and for the past eight years by Fine Gael in government.  The Labour Party was involved in the Government for five years and a Labour Party Minister introduced HAP, which is abominable.<\/p>  <p>  The key is public housing.  We know that we already have enough State-owned zoned land to build 100,000 units.  That should be based on 30% traditional council houses and 70% European cost-rental model housing to achieve mixed tenure and to accommodate those on council waiting lists and those whose income makes them ineligible for council housing but who cannot afford to buy their own homes or rent in the private sector.<\/p> <p>This is a key question.  If such a policy had been adopted at the start of this current crisis we would be a lot further down the line now where people could be in homes and have security of tenure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700036#PP00800","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574871000,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Next is Deputy Michael Collins, who is sharing time with his colleagues if they come.

It has come to the point that renting can often be more expensive than a monthly mortgage repayment.  Why is the Government not doing more to promote people to be able to afford their homes?  The homelessness figures have reached an all-time high of more than 10,000 people.  Does this Government really realise that these numbers are more than just a statistic?  They are real people who deserve the fundamental human right to safety and shelter.  In this very Chamber we have debated over and over ways to relieve to current housing crisis.  I am baffled as to why, after all the hours of discussion and hope-filled promises, every year more and more people are becoming homeless.  It is beyond time that this Government delivered on its promises and stopped its illusions that it is dealing with this crisis.  Many of these people have become homeless simply because they cannot afford hiked-up rents although they would have been able to afford mortgage repayments through an affordable home scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In the program for Government we were promised rural renewal, but in many of our small villages and towns we are seeing shops closing, units left idle and the local economy left decimated.  There needs to be more funding available to renovate long-term unoccupied houses in our rural areas to give more options for people to rent or buy.  Rural Ireland is crying out to be populated and wants to see its deteriorating villages and towns restored to their former glory.  There need to be plans in place to source and build affordable housing in rural communities, enabling urban-based families to move to rural areas through a rural resettlement scheme.  The benefits of country living are endless.  Those who live in small rural communities tend to have a strong sense of identity and pride of place.  Taking all this into account, we must also think of the public services.  When housing is being built, public services cannot be forgotten.  With any influx of new people to the community, upgrading the capacity of schools, doctors' clinics and public transport must be taken into account, or we will have more situations like that in Bandon where demand for school places has surpassed availability.<\/p>  <p>  Another point I want to make concerns the housing on our islands.  The eight picturesque islands off west Cork are very busy throughout the summer season and it is great to see, but during the off-peak season these people are forgotten about.  Social housing should be made available on our islands so the community and economy can remain viable all year round.  The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste were very welcome visitors to Sherkin Island over the weekend to launch the island strategy.  There was a very valid point made that going back not so long ago, it was in 2016, the school was closed on Sherkin Island because there were no children.  Now about seven children have been born on the island.  We are looking at a little bit of a turnaround there, which is very welcome.  We have the same situation on Bere Island.  There is a lot of life in those islands.  I refer also to Whiddy Island, Long Island and Cape Clear.  These islands want to have good, vibrant life on them all year round and they want people to live on them.  However, people cannot afford to purchase a house and in most situations will not get planning permission to build one.  They are left in a very difficult situation.  There have not been any great funds available for social housing in islands for many years.  There has to be more of a focus going forward for these islands if there is to be any hope.  Instead of islands being forced into a situation of having to close their schools, maybe we can be looking to reopen the schools, like on Sherkin Island.  That might be their focus going forward.<\/p>  <p>  Each time I have constituency clinics, whether in Kinsale, Skibbereen or Bantry, I am inundated with people trying to get on the housing market.  Many people are falling between every stool, unfortunately.  No matter what scheme is put before them, they are always finding it very difficult.  There might be a couple and both of them might be out working but they might not be on very big incomes.  They are struggling severely.  Most of them really do not want to have to go on the social housing list but are forced onto it.  The banks will not give them a loan and they are left in a very precarious situation.  They want to buy their own home and rear their family in their own locality but unfortunately they have been let down by banks.  There is a very cruel misunderstanding.  It is a disconnect, basically, between the people and the banks.  No matter what programmes the Government puts in place, many of them have severe criteria that these people cannot meet.  I urge the Minister of State and the Government to look at that.<\/p>  <p>  We are looking at more than 10,000 people on the social housing list and many of them do not want to be on it.  Many people have no choice and I accept that.  We are working on that in our constituency.  Each week when I meet people I nearly set aside one person in our office to deal with housing.  It is a massive crisis that is before us every day of the week.  People are extremely stressed.  I have come across situations in Clonakilty where people are sleeping in vans and cars.  It is happening in other parts of west Cork, too.  It is of very serious concern to me as a public representative that we have failed these people and that they are in this situation.  It is a terrible plight.  We are going to have to look at how people can access more funds and make those funds more freely available, especially to people who are genuine applicants looking to get a mortgage and to put their feet back on the ground again in places like Dunmanway and Drimoleague, out as far as Innishannon and all the way out west to Castletownbere.  These people are genuine in their attempts and they are being scuppered in every which way.  I urge the Minister of State and the Government to look into this.  If they did, we might see with the 10,000 people who are on the housing list that the numbers might start to dwindle.  I say we should give a little to people.  People out there are great and if we give a little bit of assistance they will certainly meet it with open arms and go forward to build their own home.  All people want in life is to have their own home and live happily there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700037#QQ00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1574871000,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughten is next on the list but I understand he is held up.

It used to be that commodities were mobile but property has also become mobile in recent years.  That has changed the dynamic very considerably.  Deputy Joan Collins referred to the extensive amount of property that is now held by various entities and is mobile.  Really when people think about housing, the vast majority do not think about property but about buying a house to make a home in.  That has increasingly become impossible for a very large cohort in society.  A whole generation is locked out of choices that were available to people even a couple of decades ago.  There have been falling numbers in terms of home ownership while the options that are available to people are not permanent.  It used to be that renting a house was a temporary thing because it did not provide security of tenure or certainty in respect of rent.<\/p> <p>The problem is that has become the only permanent option available to many people.  Indeed, it is heavily supported by State intervention by way of the housing assistance payment, which is a very expensive way of providing housing to people who really should have the benefit of a permanent house through directly built housing.<\/p> <p> We have to change the terminology and stop using terms like \"property ladder\".  The vast majority of people do not want to get on to a property ladder.  They just want a home.  I hear young people saying, \"I want nothing more than you wanted\", whether that is a home that is provided directly by the State or one that people provide for themselves by taking out a mortgage.  It is a question of reframing our thinking on this.  Obviously this Bill is in response to some of the institutional investors that are very much in evidence at the moment.  It used to be that Part V required in the region of 20% of a housing development to be set aside, and within that was an affordable component and a social housing component.  That was amended by way of legislation in recent years, if not by this Government then certainly the previous one.  Essentially, that removed the affordable part of this and focused on the social element.  Part V was far from perfect and any of us who were on local authorities would know that deals were done whereby houses were not directly provided and money changed hands instead to buy houses in other locations.  I have often wondered if a proper balance sheet was kept on the delivery of the number of houses that Part V promised.<\/p> <p> While I certainly have some problems with aspects of this Bill, I see nothing wrong with allowing it to go through to Committee Stage to have it teased out and amended in a way that improves the situation.  There are certainly issues that need to be flagged in terms of how the number of houses that come into the system by way of council or social housing will not be diminished.  There is a cohort of people, and I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan on certain income cohorts that are caught in the middle, who do not receive any public support, who are not in a position to buy, and yet renting is costing way more than a mortgage would cost them.  We have to look at that cohort.  Part of the reason people bought in the past was that they wanted to put down roots, have a place to rear their children, and have certainty about where their children went to school.  Buying a house gave them that certainty.  For a large cohort of people now, they do not even have the certainty of being sure from year to year whether they are going to get an eviction notice, or where they are going to find alternative accommodation.  Indeed, sometimes I am seeing people in my office with good jobs saying that homelessness does not happen to people like them.  These are people who would have been, even 20 years ago, in a position to purchase a home for themselves.<\/p> <p> We have to rethink our approach towards public lands.  I have serious problems with the Land Development Agency because it is not going to deliver affordability.  Affordability will be delivered if public lands are used and project managed for the delivery of houses that are affordable for sale and to rent, in addition to council houses or houses run by approved housing bodies.  If those very valuable sites are handed over to the private sector, what inevitably happens is that we end up with something that is not affordable.  We are seeing this at O'Devaney Gardens, and I am not one bit happy about what is happening there.  We have to look at the income of the average person to decide what is affordable.<\/p> <p> We can do way better than this.  The housing crisis is impacting on the quality of people's lives.  People are leaving the city, for example, not because they cannot get good jobs but because they cannot afford to live.  Housing is the greatest driver of the cost of living for many people.  We have to put this centre stage if we are going to deal with the cost of living and quality of life, and deliver a degree of certainty for people who are crying out for it.<\/p> <p> There are problems with this legislation as I see it, but we will certainly not be opposing it going to Committee Stage where it can be amended.  I am certain that there will not be a monopoly on wisdom when it comes to the proposers of the legislation taking amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700037#QQ00500","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574871600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Deputy Scanlon is sharing time with Deputy O'Loughlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700038#RR00150","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1574871600,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this.  I also compliment my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on bringing this legislation forward.  I listened attentively to the Minister, Deputy Murphy, when he was speaking.  I respectfully suggest to him that he should read the Bill.  I listened to his contribution very attentively, and he said that this could have an effect on social housing and on Part V planning.  This has nothing to do with social housing or with Part V.<\/p>  <p>  I raised an issue in the D&aacute;il in March 2018 concerning 178 houses being built in Lucan.  A friend of mine told me that every house in the development was bought by vulture funds.  People were queueing at the offices to rent these houses.  The houses were finished on a Friday evening and people were in them on a Monday morning paying &euro;2,200 a month in rent.  This is what happened in March 2018.  Since then, thousands of houses across Dublin city have been bought by vulture funds because of the return they are getting.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is trying to curtail what is happening.  It does not affect social housing anywhere or any public lands that are available for building social housing.  This Bill tries to give an opportunity to young people to get a house and a roof over their heads.  This is not too much to ask for in this day and age.  It is crucial that young people have an opportunity to purchase a home for themselves.<\/p>  <p>  Since I raised this issue, 3,000 houses have been bought by vulture funds across Dublin city.  This means that young couples and young people, even if they had the help of their parents and had funding from banks, could not have bought the houses because the houses would not have been available to them.  These people have been wiped out of the market.  I hope that this Bill will ensure that at least 30% of the many thousands of houses that I am sure will be built on private sites will be available for these people to purchase.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue arises with the national housing agency in respect of my own county.  I checked the figures today.  Seventy-two applications were made to the national housing agency for loans up to October 2019.  Of these, 35 were refused.<\/p> <p>These applications are not going in willy-nilly.  Council staff are looking after these applications, which are 100% correct before they go in, but yet 35 people were refused because the same commercial criteria are being used as do the banks.  If we are serious about helping these people who want to buy or build a home of their own, we have to loosen the criteria and give these people a little headroom.  I know of families who are paying more in rent than they would pay for a mortgage.  There is something wrong.  These people have been paying rent for the last seven or eight years and in our part of the world, the houses are half the price of what they are here in Dublin.  People would be taken off HAP or the housing list.  They should be given a bit of support because this national Housing Agency system is not working for people.  I ask the Minister to look at this and see what can be done.  There are many issues that I could raise but I do not have much time.<\/p> <p> In 1947, after the war, the Government of the day was able to build 58 houses in my home town.  That was replicated across every town in the country.  Here we are today, supposedly one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and we cannot build a house.  We need to get serious.  This will not be solved in just one way.  Many issues need to be sorted out.  Hundreds of units of accommodation across this country in town centres, over businesses, are not being used.  If those people had any sort of incentive to make that accommodation available, I think they would do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700038#RR00200","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574872200,"counter":514,"content":"<p>In the wise words of Maya Angelou, &quot;The ache for home lives in all of us, the safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned.&quot;  Home ownership is the ultimate ambition of nearly every young working person.  To think that home ownership rates have plummeted to the lowest ever level shows us in a really stark way how many people are locked out of the housing market.  When we think of first-time buyers, we might think of young couples at the start of their lives together or of young professionals getting their first home.  The age profile has crept up just as steadily as home ownership figures have plummeted.  Behind those statistics, we have thousands of families, couples and single people living in uncertainty, locked out of the security of home ownership and dependent on others for the roof over their heads.  I have met many people in their 50s, 60s, 70s and even their 80s who do not have their own home and live in fear from day to day of their rental home being taken from them.  Every citizen should know that certainty and be able to aspire and work towards it, and not have the untold stress of an uncertain future.  To these families, homelessness is never an abstract concept.  It is a threat that hangs over their heads every day and every night as they put their children to bed in homes that are not their own.  This mental burden, stress and struggle impacts negatively on couples, families and their children.  It is not something that society can or ever should tolerate.<\/p><p>There is a critical imbalance between numbers looking for housing and the rental sector, with professionals who cannot buy their own home because many of them are paying up to 50% of their income in rent competing against those seeking rental accommodation with HAP, which pushes the rent up for everyone.  What hope do third level students in the middle of that have?  We need to take people out of this tortured equation, including the people who want to buy houses but are not in a position to do so because of affordability.  We need to free up the rental market for those who are only in a position to rent.  People who want to buy houses and who are financially in a position to do so should be given every assistance and help.  I believe that this Bill, introduced by my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will change things radically for first-time buyers by ring-fencing a certain number of homes in every new development and essentially taking the pressure off everyone looking for a home, whether it is a rented house or a home of their own.<\/p><p>We hear from local auctioneers in Kildare that single property investors come through their doors and sell their houses because of the taxation system and no more investors come after them.  Cuckoo funds come in and try to take really big blocks.  We hear about young couples who want to buy but who do not have a hope of saving 10% of the purchase price, let alone 20%.  They are watching on from the sidelines as the chronic lack of new investors drives up rents.  In Kildare at present, only 138 homes are available for rent.  The average monthly rent in Kildare is 92% higher than a decade ago, at &euro;1,350, and the rent for a one-bed apartment is &euro;988.  Would-be home buyers already face substantial competition in the rental market as they try to save a deposit to get on the property ladder.  We have to protect them as best we can from unscrupulous market forces seeking to make a quick profit from the most fundamental of assets that a person can ever hope to possess, namely, a key to one's own front door.  I remember the excitement and pride when I got the key to my front door.  To think that so many people are denied that is appalling.

Like everyone in the House, I share the objective of increasing the supply of housing for first-time buyers and indeed for all buyers in the Irish housing market.  I share with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the view that the Private Members' Bill that we are discussing would delay the delivery of new homes to first-time buyers and indeed to others in the sector.  I know that the Minister has already spoken about some of the issues.  This Bill would intentionally reduce social housing obligations on the private sector.  I draw Deputy Scanlon's attention to section 4 of the legislation, which specifically refers to Part V and the potential removal of the obligation with regard to the rent-to-buy sector.  That would have the effect of reducing social housing delivery if it was enacted.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the Bill would have many other unintentional consequences and would serve to do the opposite of what the Government and, I believe, the Opposition are working to achieve, in that it would restrict the availability and supply of a range and choice of housing for people to purchase or rent.  Currently, derogations from Part V are only available for small-scale housing, at less than 0.1 ha and less than ten units.  To give that advantage to a particular class of developer engaged in delivering build-to-rent units would make such development the most profitable way to deliver a site and would therefore see movement of finance into build-to-rent as opposed to build-to-buy.  It would be unequitable and would run counter to the arguments made before the Supreme Court when the Part V provisions were tested for their constitutionality.  The central plank of the Bill, requiring up to 30% of residential lands to be reserved for housing for sale to first-time buyers, would be counterproductive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700039#SS00600","speaker":"1265"}]
