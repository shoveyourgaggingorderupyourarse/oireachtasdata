This has come as a devastating blow to the Finucane family.  Pat's widow, Geraldine, and his three children, Michael, Catherine and John, have fought for three long decades for truth.  They had hoped that this week the British Government would finally seize the opportunity to do the right thing and grant the necessary inquiry, but yesterday's announcement shattered that hope.<\/p><p>The Finucane family have rightly described the decision as &quot;astonishing, arrogant and cruel&quot;.  Instead of granting a public inquiry, the British Secretary of State proposes to leave the case in the hands of the PSNI and the Police Ombudsman.  This ludicrous proposal flies in the face of the British Supreme Court ruling of 2019.  That ruling made it crystal clear that none of the previous investigations, including police investigations, were capable of uncovering the truth as regards the extent and level of British state collusion in Pat Finucane's murder.  The court ruled that these investigations failed to meet the standards of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>Given the incontrovertible evidence that the British state and its agents were directly involved in the authorising and planning of the killing of Pat Finucane, it is utterly farcical that the British Secretary of State should advise the Finucane family to seek truth and justice in this way.  The family knows all too well that this is not a genuine avenue to truth and justice.  It is, in fact, a cul-du-sac, at the end of which is only more bluff and more delay.  They see it for what it is: another confidence trick.  The only reason to take this approach is to continue with the cover up and to ensure that those agents of the British state responsible are never ever held to account.  In the words of Geraldine Finucane, this decision &quot;is yet another insult added to a deep and lasting injury&quot;.<\/p><p>It is clear that the British Government is determined to keep a dark cloak over the extent and depth of state collusion in the targeting and killing of nationalists in the North of Ireland.  It seems that far too many powerful people have far too much to lose from the Finucane family and so many others having justice for their loved ones and peace for themselves.  The British Government has set itself against the Finucane family and against the highest court in its own jurisdiction.  The British Government has also set itself against the Irish Government and this Oireachtas in its call for a full public inquiry.  Speaking on radio this morning, Geraldine Finucane said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI will never run out of road as long there&rsquo;s breath in my body.  Today is a new day.  We shall take stock and move forward. <\/blockquote>  <p>It is vital that everybody in the Oireachtas moves forward together with the Finucane family in their fight because we are all united in our stance that the demand for a public inquiry is a just one and a necessary one.  The family are counting on all of us to continue with our support for them.  What, in the Taoiseach's view, can we now do together to ensure the British Government ends it resistance to the truth and grants a public inquiry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100003#A00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1606831500,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue this afternoon.  It is deeply disappointing and very annoying that the British Government has not committed to holding a proper public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  I know the disappointment is keenly and painfully felt by the Finucane family, by Geraldine, the late Pat Finucane's wife, and his sons and daughter.  I utterly concur with the Deputy's remarks.  The decision was arrogant and cruel.  The references to a potential PSNI review or the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland were disingenuous.  It is very clear that the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is not at present reviewing the case, so the Secretary of State's position there will require further explanation.<\/p><p>I thought that the statement of Chief Constable of the PSNI,  Simon Byrne, was particularly interesting and significant.  He described the murder of Pat Finucane as &quot;a truly horrendous crime&quot; and referred to the work of Judge Cory, Sir Desmond de Silva and others and the apology of a former Prime Minister in relation to the murder of Pat Finucane and the State's involvement in it.  He also said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is our view that there are currently no new lines of inquiry.  We now need to decide if a further review is merited given all the previous investigations into this case. <\/blockquote>  <p>He went on to say:<\/p> <blockquote> \tA review itself is not an investigation.  Any decision to investigate would only be made following the review process.  Again, it is likely that any new investigation would need to be independently led.  We would also need to be satisfied that given the extensive work of Lord Stevens, Judge Cory and Sir Desmond de Silva, that a further investigation has a reasonable prospect of furthering this matter either by bringing more persons to justice or answering the unanswered questions of the Finucane family and their ongoing search for justice. <\/blockquote>  <p>In a sense, that goes to the heart of the matter.  I listened to former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on &quot;RT&Eacute; News at One&quot; just before I came in here.  He spoke about his talks with then Prime Minister Tony Blair and the identification high-profile cases such as the Finucane case and others, and that the respective Governments would pursue them.  The Irish Government established the Smithwick tribunal, pursued it and upheld its side of the deal reached at Weston Park.  The former Taoiseach was very clear that he understood an inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane would follow.  It seems to me that there has been a consistent effort to undermine any progress towards the truth.  Some dark secrets are being hidden and it is time they were revealed in the proper forum of a public inquiry.  The necessity to do that is to restore confidence in the broader objective of restoring confidence and reconciliation across the board and enabling proper truth recovery across the board.  This decision only delays that.  The delay corrodes public trust in the British state's capacity to deal with issues it committed to dealing with.  Proper relationships between two Governments and two states must be founded on the principle that agreements that are entered into are followed through on.  The Irish Government followed through on its commitments.  The British Government has not followed through on its commitment to a full public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  It is extremely important that it does so. <\/p><p>I spoke with Geraldine Finucane at midday to make it clear to her and to her family that the Irish Government will continue to work with them to keep the pressure on and ensure a public inquiry is eventually held.  It is my view it is inevitable that at some stage a public inquiry will have to be held into this heinous crime.  We will work with other colleagues in the Oireachtas to pursue this agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100004#B00100","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1606831500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.  His reiteration of the position of the Irish Government, the Irish State and the Houses of the Oireachtas that there must be a public inquiry into the killing of Pat Finucane is absolutely essential.<\/p> <p>I join the Taoiseach also in reiterating the fact that agreements entered into must be honoured and delivered on.  As he rightly points out, at Weston Park and following on from it there was an acceptance that a number of cases required special investigation.  As the Taoiseach rightly says, successive governments in Dublin have held up to our side of the bargain and the British Government has fallen very short - not alone that, but it has adopted a strategy that is very explicitly and obviously designed to block a public inquiry.  For the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland yesterday to dangle the prospect - perhaps - of a public inquiry at a later stage more than 30 years after the killing of Pat Finucane is particularly unforgivable.  Does the Taoiseach have a view as to what we can do collectively as an Oireachtas, perhaps in partnership with international figures, including President-elect Joe Biden, who has, as the Taoiseach knows, for a very long time supported the Finucane campaign for a public inquiry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100004#B00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606831800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I think that, collectively, we as an Oireachtas can with one voice articulate to the British Government again the view that a full public inquiry should be held.

We have support in the United States from people such as Richie Neal and others, and we can of course enlist the engagement of the President-elect, Joe Biden.  Fundamentally, however, it is really in terms of the relationship between Britain and Ireland that this case assumes such importance.  As for the broader legacy issues, momentum needs to be injected into legacy generally.  It has been stop-start for a long time now, going back to 2014 and the Stormont House Agreement.  Commitments were entered into.  Their progression has been very slow.  The British Government is indicating that it wants to have a fresh look at legacy.  My position in response was very clear: that the murder of Pat Finucane had to be dealt with as a catalyst to a broader approach to legacy.  It is important, however, that the Irish and British Governments and our respective political communities resolve to get this issue dealt with, as originally committed to by previous British Governments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100005#C00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1606831800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Today is a good day for many businesses and people going back to work as we re-enter level 3 of the plan for living with Covid-19.  I am glad our party suggested some time ago that we endeavour to have an opening up for the Christmas period.  In fairness, the Government has followed that, so today is a good day.  However, the critical discussion around kitchen tables at Christmas will be about vaccines.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach some questions about this.  In America, Food and Drug Administration, FDA, approval for the Pfizer-approved vaccine is due on 10 December.  I presume European approval will happen in a similar timeframe.  We have a number of other vaccines coming on stream, with various press statements saying they have certain success rates, etc.  They all need to be validated, but this is very positive and let us talk about it in a positive way because I feel there has been some negativity towards this in the past few days which has not been helpful.  We need to plan for this in a fairly detailed manner.  We need a comprehensive roll-out strategy that will deal with all the vaccines that will be available to us.  We need to know which vaccines we are purchasing through the European model and we need to know distinctly the plan for the roll-out.  I appreciate that Brian MacCraith is being brought in to co-ordinate the new team that will look after this but I feel we need to go broader than that.  I am concerned.<\/p> <p>This is not something the Taoiseach or the Government can get wrong in any way, shape or form.  I believe we need outside expertise.  If we take on board what happened in relation to the roll-out of the flu vaccine, a repeat of that situation would leave a lot to be desired.  Last year, the Labour Party made suggestions very early about purchasing flu vaccines but we were ignored.  We need outside expertise.  We need logistics expertise.  Clearly, we need a Minister who will be accountable to this House and who will be responsible for vaccine roll-out.<\/p> <p> I am asking the Taoiseach clearly whether he will consider putting one Minister in charge of the most important thing in our country for the next 12 months.  I appreciate that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, will be very busy with other things, but we need one person who will be at Cabinet.  Obviously, the Taoiseach can decide who he feels is best for that role, but we need one person who will be responsible for the roll-out of the vaccines which are going to change the lives of everyone in this country.  That person should be responsible for procurement, logistics, roll-out and everything else.  Will the Taoiseach please consider that?  Given the change in tone in some quarters, the absolutely ludicrous commentary on social media from certain anti-vax quarters and certain polls regarding how supporters of various political parties will or will not support vaccine roll-out, I think we really need somebody who is actually going to be the person responsible for the most important thing in this country over the next 12 months.  Will the Taoiseach please consider that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100005#C00300","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606832100,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  The Government is absolutely and wholly committed to the timely implementation of a Covid-19 immunisation programme once the vaccines are approved for use, particularly the vaccines that are in the European Union portfolio.  In this regard, I have established a cross-Government high-level task force to oversee the development and implementation of a programme for the roll-out of vaccines.  As the Deputy is aware, that is being chaired by Brian MacCraith of Dublin City University.<\/p><p>We are involved in a European Union procurement exercise.  In fact, it is the first manifestation I have seen for a long time in the public health arena of a really good, co-ordinated and European Commission-led approach to the procurement of vaccines which gives all the smaller states a good opportunity.  We have opted in to six advance purchase agreements with Moderna, Janssen, Pfizer-BioNTech , Sanofi Pasteur, CureVac and AstraZeneca, which was involved in the Oxford trial.  The EU is still in advanced negotiations with Novavax, another pharmaceutical company, and is also looking at other possible additions to the EU vaccines portfolio.<\/p><p>The European Commission is seeking to develop a portfolio of vaccines with various vaccine developers.  This serves to spread the risks relating to the development and procurement of Covid-19 vaccines from vaccine developers and member states respectively.It facilitates through collective purchasing power access for all member states to safe and efficacious vaccines that they would not otherwise be in a position to procure if they were operating in an individual capacity.  It is a very significant advance for Europe to be able to behave in this way.  Europe is also contributing to COVAX in terms of making sure that developing countries and others in less fortunate positions around the world can also gain access to the vaccines.  Ireland will receive vaccine doses, subject to market approval being granted by the regulatory authorities, on a population <i>pro rata<\/i>basis of 1.11% of the total European Union delivery.<\/p><p>The task force has met twice so far.  Complex logistical challenges have been identified, including storage and transport requirements, and it is clear that the roll-out of a vaccine will require very careful and detailed whole-of-Government planning.  The high-level task force will work with the Department of Health and the HSE to develop a national Covid-19 vaccination strategy and implementation plan for consideration by the Government and the chairman has undertaken to me that it will be ready by 11 December.  We still do not have a vaccine approved but it is moving quickly, as the Deputy stated.  I suspect the European Medicines Agency, EMA, which is the European approval authority, will work almost in tandem with the FDA in terms of the respective timelines.<\/p><p>The arrival of vaccines is a moment for doubling down on vigilance and social distancing and continuing to do everything we have to do to prevent the spread of the virus, but it does present a horizon and an opportunity to move on from this era of Covid-19 eventually.<\/p> <p> In terms of the issues the Deputy raised, communications will be key to the roll-out of the vaccine.  Historically, vaccines have eliminated some of the most devastating viruses that have killed many people.  In that context, the Government, working with the authorities, will be promoting strongly the take-up of the Covid-19 vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100006#D00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606832700,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I attended the European conference on vaccinations last year.

We probably will have up to ten options, from what I am hearing.  That is all very positive.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are a number of issues to consider.

The third issue is one that is not being discussed.  What are we talking about in terms of IT?  How are we going to generate passports for people?  Fourth, will people who get the vaccine be distinguished from those who do not?  What will the former be allowed to do?  Will those who do not get vaccinated be allowed to go into certain public events?  In other words, what will the rules be?

There is a work stream currently operating in regard to information technology, for example, because IT will be key to this in terms of recording and so on.

We all hope it can be done safely.  There has been a welcome reduction in Covid numbers but it is fair to say that they are not as low as many of us would have liked.  Therefore, there is an even greater challenge in keeping the numbers as low as possible in the coming period.  I have heard a great deal in recent days about personal responsibility and the need for people to be sensible in the precautions they take.  I certainly echo that.<\/p>  <p>  However, there is another side to this and it is the role of the State and State agencies.  We have got to know a lot about the virus over the past year.  We know it is airborne and that good ventilation plays a significant role in reducing risk.  Now that the winter season is here and people are far more likely to spend time indoors, it is critically important that there is good advice and guidance, communicated by Government, in respect of ventilation.  None of us wants to face a further lockdown in January.  The public and business owners will heed good, practical advice but, as I said, the lead has to come from Government.<\/p> <p> At the outset of the pandemic, the advice was: \"test, test, test\".  Every evening we can see in the figures that when the number for Covid-19 incidence falls the number being tested also falls, so there is spare capacity.  Is it intended to use that capacity and, if so, will the Taoiseach outline a strategy in terms of the numbers now involved in tracing?  Is the full complement of tracers now in place?  Are there new strategies relating to community transmission?  There have been a number of large outbreaks in hospitals, such as in Letterkenny, Limerick and Naas.  This has posed challenges for the operation of those hospitals.  Indeed, many healthcare workers have become sick and have had to isolate.  Routine swabbing in the nursing homes has helped to control the virus in that setting, but there is no similar routine system for staff in hospitals.  Is that being considered?  Are there other settings that could be considered in a preventative way?<\/p> <p> How is it planned to manage international travel, particularly from countries where there is a high incidence of the virus?  There is an EU-wide traffic light system, but each country is required to put its own system in place.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the risks here will be addressed, given that there is likely to be a larger number travelling at Christmas than is currently the case?<\/p> <p> We are told that a major factor in the Government making the choices it made was that there was compelling information and evidence on adverse mental health issues.  Does the Taoiseach intend to make that information available?  Like all Deputies, I hear from people who are in serious distress.  We hear about people who are anxious and fearful.  It is not just the result of isolation.  People are worried about the virus itself and others are in distress because of the loss of jobs, uncertainty about the future and unpaid bills.  For some there is a sense of frustration with the restrictions and not having anything to look forward to.  Essentially, does the Taoiseach intend to use that information for other mental health strategies?<\/p> <p> To recap, will the Taoiseach share the information?  Is there spare capacity in testing?

The current epidemiological status is relatively good from a European perspective.  We now have the lowest 14-day incidence rate in the 27 European Union member states at 89 per 100,000 people.  That is a result of the people of Ireland working with level 5 over six weeks.  The people deserve considerable credit for adhering to the guidelines.  It is interesting that in the most recent survey of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, more than 73% of people felt that the level 5 restrictions were appropriate.  We hear many complaints about the restrictions but the CSO study, which is released this week, suggests that the vast majority of people want to work with the guidelines and restrictions and want to be protected and stay safe.  That must be said.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, we must watch it, as the virus spreads very quickly.  The CSO data is also important in that it measures the high number of people who feel that they are experiencing a low quality of life at present as a result of Covid-19.  The number has gone up to 30% since April, which is a worry.  The number who are downhearted on a continuous basis has doubled since April from 5% to 10% or 11%.  That speaks to the need to give people a lift and some quality of life.  One always has this balance between severe restrictions and quality of life for people.  That is why, for example, we made some modifications to level 3 by opening museums and galleries.  We felt the threat is not great in those locations, so people can visit them, the public libraries and so forth.  It was likewise with the restaurants, to allow people to get out for a night.  That is important for mental well-being.<\/p>  <p>  On the testing, we have significantly expanded the permanent capacity in the testing and tracing system.  We have on-island capacity to test up to 126,000 people per week, but that can be increased to 140,000 per week by utilising available surge capacity with the HSE's German laboratory partner.<\/p> <p>We offer automatic testing of close contacts.  Serial testing will continue in high-risk environments and there will be large-scale testing in outbreak situations.  Serial testing has been important in nursing homes.  It has been an important extra check and control over the spread of the virus in those situations.  Some 92% of GP referrals are provided with a Covid-19 test appointment within 24 hours, while the median time from swab to laboratory result is 25 hours.  The average time to complete the contact tracing calls is 1.1 day from when the detected result is communicated.  We have carried out approximately 2 million tests in laboratories across Ireland to date.  We consistently rank among the countries performing most tests.<\/p> <p> In terms of the recruitment issues, more than 700 people currently work in contact tracing centres, of whom 530 are newly recruited.  The HSE is building a contact tracing workforce of approximately 800, while more than 1,000 people work in swabbing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100008#F00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606833600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100009#G00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1606833600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>There is an issue around antigen and rapid testing.

There are probably other settings where the spare capacity could be used in a preventative way as a means of keeping the numbers low.  That is going to be the object of the exercise.  The public have to play their role and they will pay a great deal of attention to the guidance they are given, but there is a role for the State, and it is that systematic preventative role.  I am looking to see what is being done in that regard.  I do think people see international travel as a big risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100009#G00600","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1606833600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>As a country, we are particularly dependent on international travel connectivity, but the numbers travelling have dropped significantly on an annual basis.  I think it is down 96% or 97% annually.  We know from the airports how desolate they are.  That said, we are conscious coming into the Christmas period that we need to be particularly vigilant.  As a Government, we decided on the framework for international travel in the context of Covid-19 in line with the European Union traffic light system, which will involve Covid-19 testing at pre-departure or on arrival.  From 29 November, this will include availability for testing post-arrival from day five for passengers who have arrived from a location that is not on the green list.  The testing regime will be implemented through the private supply of testing availability in Ireland.  At this stage, the PCR test is still the only test type considered acceptable by the HSE.  The Dublin Airport Authority will scale up capacity to meet testing demand, rising to approximately 10,000 tests per day at weekends.  The Minister and the HSE are looking at the potential application of antigen testing as a complementary tool to the PCR test at airports and in other settings, especially healthcare settings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100009#G00700","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1606833600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>People Before Profit has been unique, clear and consistent in arguing that to deal with Covid-19 we need a strategy to eliminate community transmission, so we can avoid a constant cycle of going in and out of one lockdown after another, which is what we believe the Government's strategy is inevitably going to result in.  We think the Government is wrong to ignore critical parts of the advice given by the public health experts in their letter of 26 November.  In rejecting some of their key advice, in particular around the reopening of the hospitality sector, the Government in fact is endangering Christmas itself and risking the family gatherings, which is what most people want to protect.<\/p> <p> If we disagree on these matters, and we do, I hope we are wrong about where the Government's strategy will lead us.  One thing is absolutely clear from the public health advice and the letter of 26 November, namely, that its caution about the strategy being pursued and some of the decisions being made by the Government is related to the ability and capacity of our health service to cope with further outbreaks and waves and particularly the resourcing and staffing of our public health teams.  It seems there is absolutely no dispute about that.<\/p> <p> In this regard, the Government is singularly failing.  It is not just that we believe it is wrong in the strategy being pursued but it is failing to provide the resourcing, support and staffing that is necessary for our public health teams and health services generally to be able to deal with further waves of infections and outbreaks.<\/p> <p> The public health teams that we praised and applauded are going on strike in January.  These are the people on the front line.  If we are to deliver an immunisation programme, we will do so with public health teams at one third of the recommended level of staffing and where we have treated them as second class citizens in term of their status as medical specialists.  We have recruited contact tracers and testers, who we need to deal with outbreaks, on the worst temporary agency contracts, where they do not even get sick pay and they are essentially in a \"hire 'em and fire 'em\" position.  It is not exactly the way to implement what the public health experts are saying is the much greater capacity, integration and cohesion that is required in public health teams in order to deal with Covid-19.<\/p> <p> Finally, there is the utterly disgraceful treatment of thousands of student nurses and midwives.  NPHET has also expressed concern about the high level of infections in our hospitals but the Government has removed payment for these student nurses and midwives.  They are working on the front line with no payment whatever.<\/p> <p> At the very least, will the Taoiseach accede to the demands of public health doctors?  Will the Government put contact tracers and testers on decent contracts, pay and conditions?  Will the Government pay the student nurses and midwives something instead of exploiting them and paying them nothing when they are working on the front line for all of us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100009#G00800","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606833900,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The Deputy is wrong in his various assertions.  In the first instance, I do not believe in the Deputy's zero-Covid approach.  It is not viable in terms of our membership of the European Union, our relationship with the United Kingdom and the seamless interaction of people.  We also have the Border between North and South and the fact we are not in charge of the jurisdiction public health wise in Northern Ireland.  We have seen the overlap and impact there in terms of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  The bottom line is that in tackling the second wave, we are one of the best-performing countries in Europe.  The strategy that has been pursued has worked so far.  It is not a matter of being in and out of lockdown.  There have been two phases of very severe restrictions since the Covid-19 outbreak.  The very first, as the Deputy knows, was in spring and it was very severe.  The second, which ended recently, was less severe because we kept schools open.  Contrary to the Deputy's comments, we also kept health services open unlike in the first phase.  In the second phase, the non-Covid health services were kept open.<\/p>  <p>  The second phase did not have anywhere near the same impact on hospitalisation, mortality or intensive care unit occupancy rates as the first phase.  The evidence from a variety of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, NPHET and others confirms all of this.  The second wave has been different.  We have had the best performance globally in relation to mortality in the second wave through the various measures we introduced.  That said, there can be no room for complacency.<\/p> <p>In respect of public health, for example, in September the Minister committed to doubling the workforce in public health.  There were about 254 people working in public health pre-Covid, and the Government has provided resources to double that number, and hiring has already started in relation to that.  In terms of the consultant status, the Crowe Horwath report is there and the Government is acting on it.  There are ongoing discussions between the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, and Health, but consultant posts will be created.  The manner and framework through which all of that will happen is an important issue and there is much detail involved in that, which has to be worked out, but the resources are there.  More than &euro;4 billion has been put into the health service this year, which is a record figure - &euro;2 billion for Covid, and &euro;2 billion non-Covid - and quite extensive and significant.<\/p> <p> On the issue of student nurses, again, it is not the same as the first phase.  It is not the same at all.  When the nursing degree programme was brought in in 2002 - I brought it in as Minister for Health - it was seen as a radical transformation of nurse education at the time, to put student nurses on the same par with other university students in terms of their degree and so forth and investment in facilities in all of our universities and institutes of technology.  All of that happened.  Negotiations and work are ongoing between the Minister for Health and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, on a variety of issues in terms of trying to support student nurses in the current climate within the hospitals, particularly, for example, the application of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, to student nurses who understandably have lost the jobs that they would have had at weekends because of Covid restrictions.  That has now been made available to student nurses, but crucially their clinical placements in fourth year and their internships must also be protected from an education perspective.  That is something that is uppermost in terms of the HSE's objective in this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100010#H00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606834200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that the intense hardships people have suffered, and the collective solidarity people have shown have helped staved off the worst disasters in respect of Covid-19.

That is a serious gamble.  However, when it comes to something that should be less controversial, namely, the support of our front-line healthcare workers and the resources, etc., that they need, the Taoiseach is clearly failing, because he did not answer the obvious question.  Why are 98% of public health doctors threatening industrial action?  Why are we in a situation with one third of the recommended level of staffing?

In respect of the point I was about to make, we took a more conservative approach on the household visits, and then traded that off with visits to hotels and restaurants, which, by the way, has a twofold dimension to it.  The first is there is the issue of mental well-being and people needing to get out of their homes.  There is only so much any Government can do in a democratic society in respect of imposing severe restrictions on its citizens.<\/p> <p>Government has to take a measured and balanced approach.  One cannot simply lock people up forever.  Balance is required.  We did not reject advice.  We took a balanced, measured approach, which is difficult and challenging and which we are going to monitor.  We appreciate very much the advice from NPHET but there was a trade-off.  The impact of loosening restrictions on household visits would be equivalent to that of opening the hospitality sector to the degree we did.  We decided to maintain household restrictions as they are until 18 December.  We cannot, however, get away from the fact that it really is down to personal behaviour and personal responsibility from here until Christmas.  We need to send that message through our own behaviours and otherwise and we really need to work to keep this virus at bay.

That constitutional right is being denied them by this specific interpretation of Standing Orders.  That is why we are objecting to the Order of Business.

I will restate the essential point that the Standing Order very clearly does not envisage a situation where an Article 35 motion could be put, would simply sit on the Order Paper and would then lapse after a period.  It is clear that it envisages a situation where there are two options at that first stage.  Either the motion is rejected and that is the end of the process or a motion to adjourn the debate is passed and then, within five days, a select committee has to be appointed.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn's point is crucial because if we did not happen to have Private Members' time within five days of putting the motion, or if a Member was not part of any grouping, as is his or her right, or if it was a back bench Government Deputy, then, according to the interpretation that you have, a Cheann Comhairle, and I accept that others are informing you but ultimately it is your decision in terms of the interpretation and it is our right to challenge it, there is no mechanism for them to seek to initiate a process to remove a judge, and that is a very problematic interpretation.

Sometimes that adjudication does not find favour with some in the House, but that does not mean that those some can then dictate debates and dictate the agenda because it does not suit.  It is not fair to say that the motion lies on the Order Paper.  It is a matter of considerable import, and one would have thought that any person tabling a motion of that kind, given the constitutional nature of it and given its profound implications, would be quite prepared to use their Private Members' time to dispose of it and deal with it one way or the other.

Since 2012 a number of countries have passed laws providing for financial sanctions against the officials of other states who have committed human rights abuses or have been involved in significant corruption.  These are collectively referred to as Magnitsky law, named after Sergei Magnitsky, an accountant who made serious accusations against Russian tax and law enforcement officials and was in turn accused of aiding tax evasion, was arrested and jailed in Russia and, after being allegedly beaten by police, died in prison.  In 2012 the United States Congress passed the Magnitsky Act, which imposed sanctions on officials involved in that case.  Laws along similar lines have subsequently been passed in the United Kingdom and in Canada.<\/p><p>In this State powers under the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 to 2016 to seize and dispose of assets may be available against corrupt foreign officials who have assets within this Jurisdiction.  However, in order to apply the 1996 Act, a dual criminality test would need to be satisfied.  The conduct giving rise to the acquisition of those assets must be such that it would constitute an offence both under Irish law and under the law of that foreign state.  The purpose of this Bill is to make the Proceeds of Crime Acts more easily available to deal with such cases.  The Bill provides that certain conduct occurring outside of our State is described as criminal conduct for the purposes of our Proceeds of Crime Acts, notwithstanding that it does not constitute an offence under the law of the foreign state concerned if the conduct constitutes or is connected with a gross abuse of human rights.  Conduct is stated to constitute a gross human rights abuse if it is carried out by, at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of public officials or a public official of the national regional or local government or public administration of a named foreign state in the performance or the purported performance of official duties, or if it involves the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain or suffering or the cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of a person who has sought to expose illegal activity carried out by a public official or to obtain, exercise, defend or promote human rights and fundamental freedoms.<\/p><p>This legislation mirrors legislation being enacted in progressive countries across the world.  I have instanced that it is mirrored in a number of jurisdictions already and there is an initiative now on the part of the European Parliament to encourage all European Union states to mirror this type of legislation in order that if foreign governments and officials involved in corrupt practices or gross violation of human rights have assets in this State, we can act against them in order that they cannot stash ill-gotten gains in jurisdictions such as our own.  In our Jurisdiction, where we now have very extensive inward investment in our financial services, this sort of legislation is urgently required.

I raised it in a non-political way and I hope the Taoiseach appreciates that.  I think the people the Taoiseach referenced earlier are very eminent people, all of whom will make a significant contribution.  However, I have a serious concern about co-ordination.  I have a serious concern about leaving it to the current structures of the agencies we have and their capacity for the most important thing facing us as a country.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to the Cabinet committee on Government co-ordination, we now have a task force and a Cabinet subcommittee.  The reality is that somebody needs to be in charge of vaccine roll-out.  Somebody needs to be in charge of rules by which each and every agency and organisation act.  It is not a case of whether Martin Shanahan of the IDA, who is an excellent chief executive, is responsible to his parent Department or to a task force.  That cannot be the issue.  They cannot be second-guessed.  They have to know that they are putting aside whatever they are doing or their priorities in order to deal with this issue and that accountability is linear up to the Government.  I genuinely do not mean that in a political sense.  The Taoiseach does not have time to do this as well dealing with all the rest of us in here.  We need one person to be responsible for this and to sit at the Cabinet table.  It will probably only be for a year.  I really urge the Taoiseach to reconsider this.  In fact, that is not right.  I am just asking him to consider it because, in fairness, he cannot reconsider it until it has been considered.<\/p>  <p>  I am asking the Taoiseach to take up my suggestion because logistics will be a massive issue.  The rules around who will get what and when will be a massive issue.  I refer to the whole issue about mandatory versus non-mandatory.  For instance, if vaccination is not mandatory, will people who do not get vaccinated be allowed into public events or public spaces as we open up the country?  How would one have rules around that?  I cannot even imagine it.  I refer to the whole issue relating to ICT.  What is going to be done about passports?  I have had a number of Covid tests.  I have seen passport technology and how it goes on one's phone.  There will be a need for rules around how long that lasts.<\/p>  <p>  The actual work of this committee is not just going to be for the roll-out and then everyone gets vaccinated and we are all happy.  There are legacy issues that will have to be politically managed.  We need somebody at Cabinet who will say \"I am in charge.  This is my job.  This is my role.\"  That person will be doing the State a serious service and will report to the Taoiseach and at Cabinet.<\/p>  <p>  I know what is going on in other jurisdictions.  I think the UK has been miles behind anything we have done on this issue since last February or March, but it has done this.  I think it is right on this singular issue.  I appreciate all the work that is going on with regard to vaccines, the number of vaccines coming through, all the work liaising with the Taoiseach's European colleagues and everything that is going to be done there.  I understand all of it.  I take an intense interest in detail on this.<\/p>  <p>  I come from an IT background.  There is a significant amount of logistics in terms of dealing with this issue.  A significant amount of analysis will have to be done through a health passport.  That will have to be done using PPS numbers and will have to take in a whole load of various other aspects and nominate by field with regard to people with various vulnerabilities.  There is a range of other information.<\/p>  <p>  This issue needs co-ordination.  There is a co-ordination group in place.  Its chairman is an eminent person.  I have dealt with him in the past, both in government and in opposition, and he is well capable of this.  However, there needs to be somebody who is politically over all this and all the agencies and groups and who will not be second-guessing in the context of their other work which obviously they have to do as well.  I actually plead with the Taoiseach to do this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100020#S00800","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1606838400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>To be helpful to Deputy Kelly, I think one answer to how we deal with the vaccination roll-out is to have our public health teams at a level such that they are capable-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100020#S00900","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1606838400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I agree with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100020#S01000","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1606838400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>They are the people who deliver immunisation programmes.  As I mentioned to the Taoiseach on Leaders' Questions, they are taking industrial action.  At a time when they have never proven their value to society more, they are being forced to take industrial action because the Government has shown them zero respect in terms of their status and giving them status as consultant specialists, but also in the fact that we have one third of the recommended public health staffing complement.  How on earth are they supposed to deliver a vaccination programme as well as the contact tracing and testing that is necessary?  To my mind, that is sort of indicative of the wider need for co-ordination in order that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing and they have joined-up priorities.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of graduate entry medical students at a time when we desperately need more doctors, such as for our public health teams.  I met them last week.  They are paying &euro;15,000 in fees.  They cannot manage it and are all saying they may have to drop out and so on.  They are experiencing major financial difficulties at a time when the State should be assisting them to qualify so that we have more doctors.<\/p>  <p>  I raised a similar issue with regard to student nurses and midwives.  The Taoiseach did not really respond on this issue.  When I met several hundred of them in an online meeting last week, one after another, the student nurses and midwives who we need and have been holding together the front line said they would not work for the HSE in a blue fit once they are qualified because it is treating them so badly.  They said they will be leaving as soon as they are qualified.<\/p>  <p>  The State is haemorrhaging the nurses, midwives and doctors it needs because it is treating them so badly.  When will there be a moment of enlightenment, as we face a pandemic, when it becomes obvious we need more health professionals, including more doctors, nurses and midwives?  When will there be joined-up thinking and a realisation that we should stop putting obstacles in the way of these people actually training, completing their education and then wanting to work in our public health services?  That is the sort of co-ordination that I think is very sadly missing at a time when we need it most.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100020#S01100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1606838400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>As the Taoiseach is aware, responsibilities for domestic violence supports and services are spread across multiple Departments and State agencies.  Safe Ireland has called for the urgent roll-out of a funded national service development plan as the start of a comprehensive and long-term response to the enormous everyday problem of domestic violence.  Domestic and gender-based violence services are to be commended for developing a structure within which they work together to share experience and develop policy, but it is clear that the disjointed provision of these services is failing victims and their children.  I previously raised with the Taoiseach the issue of the lack of refuge places.<\/p> <p>I have called for a Government strategy to deliver additional refuge places with trauma-informed wrap-around supports and services.  Ireland is currently failing to meet its legal obligations under the Istanbul Convention regarding the provision of domestic violence refuge places, and no additional funding has been providing in next year's budget to remedy the situation.  Worse still, the Minister has confirmed that no single Department or agency is responsible for ensuring Ireland meets its legal obligations in this regard.  It is my strong view that this perennial challenge to front-line service provision will not be addressed until such time as the Government commits to a national service development plan, as called for by Safe Ireland.  Implementation of this plan should be overseen by the Department of An Taoiseach, working with the coalition partners to ensure there is a cohesive and comprehensive policy and service delivery response for victims and their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100020#S01200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606839000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Regarding Deputy Kelly's question, I said to him earlier that I appreciate the constructive way in which the question was put.  I established a task force and asked my Department to co-ordinate its work in order to give a sense of the national priority that attaches to what will be a very significant logistical undertaking in regard to the procurement, storage and distribution of the vaccine, and IT infrastructure to back that up, and proper protocols around the administering of the vaccine, including deciding, in the first instance, who will administer it - it could very well necessitate additional personnel, over and above GPs, given the scale of the undertaking - and also the prioritisation of who receives the vaccines and the sequence of that.  To be fair, there are structures already in place in the Department of Health around immunisation and we already have people with considerable experience in this area, including the national immunisation advisory committee.  The HSE will be the operational delivery arm of all of this.  Already, four significant streams of work have been established, covering the areas I have identified.  A key additional piece would be on communications around the vaccination programme itself and the value and importance of vaccines in dealing with viruses of this nature.<\/p>  <p>  That said, I will reflect on what the Deputy said.  Those on the task force are well aware that it was established by the Taoiseach, will have to report back to the Taoiseach and we want to keep it at that level in terms of making sure it gets prioritisation across Government and across the different agencies.  The Department of Health and the HSE will play a key role in the health dimension of this but will draw upon expertise in other Departments and from the private sector in terms of the logistics side and ensuring we can get the vaccines rolled out as safely and efficiently as we possibly can as they come on stream, if they get authorisation from the various authorising bodies.  The Deputy's suggestion is that a Minister or Minister of State be put in charge of delivery of all of that.  As I have outlined, it is being co-ordinated by my Department and that will continue.  However, I will give consideration to what the Deputy said.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, I already said that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who is in office some five months, has secured significant resources to transform public health.  That is known and the funding has been secured.  The Minister announced plans in September to double the workforce in public health.  It is currently at approximately 254 people and the plan is to double that.  The hiring process has already begun.  The Minister, the Department and the Government have been very clear in their support for the creation of consultant posts in public health medicine.  I do not agree that now is the time for strike action, in the middle of a global pandemic.  I believe the issue can be resolved through ongoing talks and engagement with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, under the public service stability agreement.  That is the forum for resolving these issues.<\/p>  <p>  The creation of consultant-level posts and roles in public health medicine is a priority for the Government and we are fully committed to delivering on it.  Obviously, much detailed work goes into that, as everybody knows.  The HSE has put a substantial amount of work into it and the Department of Health has developed a detailed framework for the future public health model that includes consultant-level roles.  The business plan seeking consultant status was submitted last week to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for consideration.  That will be the basis for the engagement with the IMO on the matter.  People in the public health arena are aware that this kind of progress has been made.  There is a process that has to be followed.  We believe in a consultant role but how that all works out and how people apply for the roles and posts that will be created is the type of detail that needs to be worked out with all concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Deputy McDonald's questions, we dealt with this issue last week.  I agree with her on the need to provide additional resources for more refuge places and to deal with domestic violence on a co-ordinated basis.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, has been proactive, and remains proactive, in this regard.  She is committed to expanding services and dealing with issues that have arisen and have been brought to her attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100021#T00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reform","time":1606839000,"counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100021#T00250"},{"type":"question","time":1606839000,"counter":181,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[36606\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100021#T00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the policing reform implementation programme office.

There are two ways to deal with that.  We can blame the young people and take a coercive approach, which I do not believe works.  On the other hand, we can recruit people directly from the community to work in community and youth outreach projects.  This is an area in which we have failed spectacularly.  In fact, I believe we have gone backwards and made situations worse when we could have improved and dealt with them in a way that does not cause problems and conflicts in the community.<\/p>  <p>  I can think of several such youth outreach projects in our area that were simply closed down.

It was designed to transform.  I believe the most important areas are recruitment and education.  That is in the next phase and needs a radical change, in my view.  We must broaden the experiences of people who apply to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>On the other questions, the recruitment is ongoing.  A report from the future of policing implementation group was put before the Cabinet today.  For example, there will be a greater emphasis on diversity in recruitment and recruitment from minority communities to serve in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is important as well.<\/p><p>Regarding anti-social behaviour, I believe the operational plan is working and appears to be developing.  We are recruiting continually to increase the numbers and, to be fair, the numbers working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have increased significantly over recent years.  A significant allocation was made in the budget for hundreds of additional recruits for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2021 and beyond.<\/p><p>I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett's analysis regarding the community dimension to this.  First, the Covid-19 pandemic has been a very difficult time for young people in this country.  The report just published by the Central Statistics Office shows that the lowest levels of satisfaction with the quality of life are in the 19 to 24 year old age group.  If a person was a leaving certificate student last year, his or her year was undermined and upended.  On moving to college, that person's first year was not what he or she expected it to be and he or she is approaching January without having had a proper college year.<\/p> <p>No one has travelled this year because of Covid.  It has been difficult for all age cohorts, but it has been particularly difficult for young people.  Jobs have not been as available either because of the various lockdowns and severe restrictions, so outlets where people could get work have not materialised.  If one is young, one wants to be out and about.  Therefore, there has to be a very multifaceted approach to helping young people to get through this period.<\/p> <p> To be fair to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in areas where we had anti-social behaviour or difficulties in the past we got the best results by adopting a community-led approach with community garda&iacute; on the ground working with young people and youth workers.<\/p> <p> I recently met Deputies McAuliffe and Lahart and the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, on the issue of scramblers in certain communities in Dublin.  The Deputies propose to introduce legislation.  It reminded me of a period 20 years ago when we had difficulties in communities with joyriding and so on.  The development of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's community model helped to deal effectively with situations in communities.  We must reinvest in communities and rebuild the infrastructure in certain communities to support community development.  Something like a modern version of the revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, RAPID, programme is required.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Brien, is keen on that.  There was a meeting yesterday of the Cabinet subcommittee on social affairs and equality and we identified areas like that for further work and development.  We need to build up a multidisciplinary team of supports in communities that have challenges to help those of all ages to deal with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100022#U01300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committees","time":1606840200,"counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100023#V00200"},{"type":"question","time":1606840200,"counter":198,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[38078\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100023#V00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet Committee on social affairs and equality is next due to meet; and when it last met.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1606840200,"counter":199,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[38622\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100023#V00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet Committee on social affairs and equality will next meet.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1606840200,"counter":200,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[40167\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100023#V00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet Committee on social affairs and equality is due to meet next.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1606840200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality was established in July 2020 and oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments in the areas of social policy, equality and public services, including matters relating to justice, policing reform and community safety.

It was that those without children or with grown-up children would cover the Christmas period for people with young children and that they would have the New Year period off.

She was put on a waiting list for surgery to correct the curvature in her spine last March, but her doctor has warned that she might not get a date for surgery until late next year.  She also needs urgent surgery on both her knees, as they can easily dislocate.  The delay in Sophie's surgery means that the double curve on her spine is twisting into her lungs and pelvis.  She used to play Gaelic football and she loves hip-hop but she had to give it all up because of her condition.  She is an incredible young girl and her family are wonderful as well.  They are sick with worry and concern.  This is an issue that has been raised, not just on the Taoiseach's watch but on the watch of previous Governments.  I implore him to provide us with a roadmap so that Sophie and other children and young people awaiting this surgery can have some hope and relief and some prospect of early surgery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100023#V00800","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1606840200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>One of the key areas that it is necessary to address if one is to really try and strive towards equality is education.  I wish to continue to put to the Taoiseach certain points I was making earlier, but just to focus them a little bit more.  Fees are increasingly becoming a major barrier to equality of access to education.  That is bad, not just for the people who have financial impediments put in front of them in terms of accessing higher education, but also for society because we are not going to get the talented, qualified professionals in key areas that we need if we continue to make life very difficult for them financially because of fees.  I referred earlier to the graduate entry medical students, where people, in particular from less well-off backgrounds, have the potential to access medical training and to become doctors.  What they tell me is that they are paying &euro;15,000 in fees a year, so that by the end of their training, along with their living costs, they qualify with a debt in excess of &euro;100,000.  By the way, they can only get a loan from one bank, namely, Bank of Ireland.  The rest of the banks will not even lend them the money to do it.  That is crazy when we need doctors but, equally, the student nurses and midwives that we have talked about quite a few times, as well as not getting paid for working during their placements, also have to pay for the privilege of being exploited by paying &euro;3,000 in fees or &euro;7,000 if they previously did a degree.

One is also drawing children from different communities and backgrounds to the one centre, so one is potentially facilitating the spread of the virus.  As I stated in my address on Friday, we are prepared to go so far but no further.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, quite a number of groups were left out in the modifications to level 3.  The objective was to try to limit the spread of the virus and that was our motivation.<\/p> <p> There is a limit of 15 people meeting outdoors, which is to prevent congregation.  We have already seen with the takeaway phenomenon that unacceptable practices were building up in the cities, to be frank, and this was becoming a scene in itself.  We were seeing significant outdoor congregation, which is not good if we are looking to stop the spread of the virus.  The policing of it is difficult if there are three pubs in a row on a street, for example, with potentially three blocks of 15 people.  It would be very difficult for garda&iacute; to police it.  Garda&iacute; have said to us that level 3 is more difficult to police than level 5 as there are more grey areas than at the higher level, which leads to a challenge.  I am not blaming the Garda for any of this and it is a decision we took but it is an important insight.  When we open up, we allow more activities, creating a more difficult scenario all around, whereas level 5, because of its crude and blunt nature, can be much clearer.<\/p> <p> On 6 January, we will assess the position, and we will assess it on an ongoing basis with respect to numbers of cases, hospitalisations, people in ICU beds and so on, which will tell us where the virus is at.  As I said before, level 5 was different from the first lockdown in that we kept schools, the construction sector and non-healthcare services open.  Any new restrictions that may emerge in the new year could be different as well.  It does not mean all sectors will fall victim, to use the term, of a new set of restrictions.<\/p> <p> Deputy McDonald raised her correspondence with Sophie Redmond.  I pay tribute to Sophie Redmond and her courage.  It is very difficult not to have a clear timeline for an urgent operation.  I will certainly inquire of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to see what we can do in Sophie's case.  Covid-19 has made an impact on the capacity of our children's hospitals to do surgery.  On top of that are the delays that had been improving, although they had not met four-month targets.  I will engage with the hospitals to see what can be done to accelerate the surgery.  Every effort must be made to facilitate children like Sophie, who need their surgery, to get it when they need it.<\/p> <p> With scoliosis it is a matter of skilled personnel being available and the right people doing the surgery.  It is an important consideration.  There are other complications arising from a requirement for knee surgery.  I will certainly check that out for Sophie if the Deputy sends the details to me.  We will certainly do everything we possibly can to help her and her family.<\/p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about education and fees in general.  I take his point on postgraduate courses but that specific route was created some years back, over a decade ago, and at the time it was considered radical in itself to create new entry routes into medicine.  It had been fairly difficult to access but this route has an additional cost element.  I will ask the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to review the matter but one of the biggest matters overall with third level is access to finance.  The Cassells report has been published and we have frozen fee levels at the current undergraduate level for quite some time.  Postgraduate fees have gone up a little too much and we gave additional supports in the budget for postgraduates, particularly those facilitated with grants and so on.<\/p> <p> It may be better to deal with the area by giving greater supports to students via income thresholds as those who need it most should get greater supports going through college.  This is in preference to, for example, an abolition of fee structures.  I would prefer to support the colleges in the first instance and try to give additional core funding to colleges, as they need it to provide quality education.  We should give further supports for inclusion in third level education, especially around people with disabilities and who are disadvantaged.  We provided additional funding in the budget this year for both those categories.  We should also provide funding in the broader SUSI grant structure for students for whom education is too much of a financial burden.<\/p> <p> That said, participation rates in Irish third level education are probably the highest in Europe, particularly over the past 20 years from the late 1990s onwards.  I was involved in that process as a Minister with responsibility for education.  We dramatically expanded third level education and created far more places.  We now need to continue to resource it as it is key to economic development in the country.  I will ask the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to examine the medical graduate entry programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100023#V01200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1606840800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.25 p.m. and resumed at 4.45 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2020: Motion","time":1606841400,"counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100025#Y00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1606841400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Regulations in draft:<br \/><br \/>Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2020, <br \/><br \/>copies of which were laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the 13th November, 2020.&rdquo; <\/blockquote>  <p>An important part of Government policy is to ensure that the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve their maximum potential and, in so doing, contribute to a balanced economic and social development across a wide geographic swathe of the country.<\/p><p>The horse and greyhound racing industries make a significant and valuable contribution to our economy.  It is estimated that the thoroughbred industry has an annual economic impact of &euro;1.9 billion, with direct and indirect employment of 29,000 people, while the greyhound sector provides an estimated 12,000 people with economic benefit.  The thoroughbred industry, in particular, brings a high level of international blue-chip investment to Ireland.<\/p><p>Government funding, in addition to supporting these key industries, also presents an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for its investment, leading to a flow of income right through the economy.  Support for certain strategic industries is important for future economic growth and can provide widespread benefits to our society as well as for our economy.<\/p><p>The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is extremely competitive at a global level.  We are the third biggest producer of thoroughbred foals in the world, and estimates place Ireland only behind the USA as the biggest seller of bloodstock by public auction globally.<\/p><p>Successive Governments have acknowledged the importance of these industries and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives.  The support provided by public funds through investment in these industries has enabled Ireland to develop a world-class reputation for excellence in horse racing, greyhound racing and breeding. <\/p><p>The current Covid-19 pandemic poses particular challenges for Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, RC&Eacute;, and industries as a whole.  The Government plan entitled Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19 does not provide at any of the levels for a return to full commercial operations.  This impacts significantly on the finances of HRI and RC&Eacute;, both this year and up to the end of the time span of the plan in June 2021.  It is essential, in these circumstances, that the additional Covid-related supports are made available to HRI and RC&Eacute;, reflecting costs incurred in changes to the trading environment.<\/p><p>These industries received financial support from the State through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  My Department makes payments from the fund to HRI and RC&Eacute;.  In the period from 2001 to date, a total of &euro;1.36 billion has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries, in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund, provided for under the relevant regulations, has therefore been reached.<\/p><p>Exchequer funding provided from the fund is crucial to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.  In order to give effect to the provisions of budget 2021, this cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulation.  The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of budget 2021, include an allocation of &euro;96 million for the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.<\/p> <p>In order to allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2021, it is necessary to comply with a technical requirement to increase the cumulative limit.  This is achieved by way of the regulations submitted to the House today.<\/p> <p> The 2017 Deloitte report into the economic impact of Irish breeding and racing commissioned by Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, indicates that the total direct and stimulated expenditure of the Irish breeding and racing industry was &euro;1.84 billion in 2016.  In addition, it is estimated that there are 15,200 jobs at the core of the racing and breeding industry or in directly related industries.  Horse racing generates a very significant return for the rural economy in Ireland and a positive international profile for our country.  HRI's 2019 annual report indicated a successful year.  The focus on ownership leads to a further increase in the number of horses in training and more horses competing.<\/p> <p> With regard to the greyhound racing industry, according to the 2017 Power report, the greyhound industry provides and supports considerable employment both directly and indirectly.  It is estimated that the industry supported 5,000 full-time and part-time jobs in the economy in 2016.  In addition, there were 7,313 active greyhound owners. <\/p> <p> There is a very valid and strong rationale for funding both industries in the way we do and for the increase this year, given the particular pressures Covid has placed on these industries.  This will support them in their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100025#Y00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606841700,"counter":213,"content":"<p>This issue was debated at length at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine last week.  The debate was comprehensive.  During that meeting I put on the record, as I will today, that Sinn F&eacute;in absolutely supports maintaining vibrant horse racing and greyhound racing sectors in Ireland.  We recognise their value, in particular to many rural communities, and the great contribution they make to local economies which are, in many other respects, bereft of investment.  That is not to say that we support the signing of blank cheques for any organisation.  The Minister proposes that we increase funding to the horse and greyhound racing fund to &euro;96 million.  By any measure, that is a substantial investment on the part of the State.  In 2014, the level of funding to these organisations was &euro;54 million, which shows how sizeable the year-on-year increase has been.<\/p><p>At last week's meeting, I said that, while our support for the horse and greyhound racing fund was absolute, we also had questions in respect of the accountability and transparency mechanisms put in place.  The Minister seemed to suggest that there is a contradiction in that.  I do not believe it is contradictory for elected representatives to support a sector while wanting to ensure that the money provided to it is fully accounted for.<\/p><p>A number of questions still have not been resolved with regard to this funding.  Why is this amount of funding to be provided next year?  Why is increased funding being given to these organisations when so many other organisations in a variety of sectors are also struggling as a result of Covid-19 and would very much appreciate a similar and proportionate increase in their funding?  Why is this level of funding required this year?  Was the 2020 funding fully expended?  Is the Minister satisfied that it was spent in the way that delivers the greatest benefits for our economy and our rural economy, the cited reasons for this funding?  Is this to be the new baseline figure for these organisations' funding streams or is it simply emergency funding provided in the context of Covid?<\/p><p>The Minister has not indicated whether he is satisfied that the maximum benefit is derived from the way in which the money is spent.  Last year, approximately &euro;67 million was allocated to Horse Racing Ireland, which paid out &euro;68 million in prize funds.  Breeders, trainers and horse lovers in my county tell me that this prize money does not trickle down.  A disproportionate share goes to those who are already successful in the industry.  Has the Minister carried out an appraisal as to whether this is the best use of funds by Horse Racing Ireland?<\/p><p>Over the last week, the Minister was asked a number of times whether it is prudent simply to divide this funding in the ratio of 80:20 between the horse racing and greyhound sectors.  He essentially told the committee that this is simply how it has always been done.  I note, however, that in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>, his Department confirmed that it had sought legal advice as to whether this should be the case.  Rather than the Government being fully supportive of the greyhound sector, it was actually looking for a way to reduce the level of funding, or at least the increase in funding, for that sector.  It is disappointing that the Minister did not inform the committee of that fact last week.  I would like him to elaborate on his intentions in that regard.<\/p><p>If we are going to pay close to &euro;100 million to one particular sector at a time when even the sectors that come under the auspices of the Minister's own Department, such as beef farming, sheep farming and dairy farming, are struggling, we have to be absolutely sure that the money will be well spent.  There must be absolute transparency and full accountability.  A full appraisal must be carried out to ensure that the money being invested is invested in the right way to ensure proper regional balance among the beneficiaries of the fund and to ensure that the principle of animal welfare is supported.  We must ensure that we can stand over everything we do and every cent of taxpayers' money we spend with regard to many people's real concerns about animal welfare, particularly in the greyhound sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100026#Z00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1606841700,"counter":214,"content":"<p>We will be supporting this increase for this fund for both the racing and greyhound industries, although it may be slightly wrong to describe the greyhound industry in that way as it is really more of a hobby.  We give this support with many qualifications.  I will speak on both horse racing and greyhound racing.  The first qualification is that I do not have confidence in the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, and have not had for years.  The board was before a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts attended by the Leas-Chathaoirleach and myself and it was an absolute circus.  Not much has changed.  Some of the same people are still there.  I will mention one thing at the very outset.  We did not support the Social Democrats motion last week but neither could we support the Government's countermotion because it was effectively written by the IGB, in which we do not have confidence.  I have never implored the Minister but I implore him to look at the board of the IGB for us.  It needs a complete overhaul.  I know the Minister has a lot going on as regards Covid, Brexit and so on but the IGB needs a more hands-on approach from Government.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to greyhound people, many of whom are working-class people, greyhounds are effectively their horses.  These are some of the most decent and honourable people one will ever meet.  There are some bad eggs who need to be removed.  The comments made by a member of the board of the IGB regarding our colleague, Deputy Cairns, are absolutely disgraceful.  They do not give the greyhound racing industry a good name.  I presume the board and the Minister will deal with that matter.  The Deputy can speak for herself but one cannot make comments like that no matter one's view on a given sector.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of welfare is very important.  The idea is that 10% of funding, which would be at least &euro;1.5 million, goes towards welfare but that is not happening.  Will the Minister show me that is happening?  I do not compliment British authorities often but a greyhound trust needs to be set up.  This should be separate from the IGB, although board members might sit on it to allow for crossover.  The volume of greyhounds that needs to be rehoused is much larger than the volume spoken about.  There is only one centre.  I know where it is as it is in my county.  There needs to be 15 to 20.  That needs to be rolled out.  When such centres are rolled out, people will be able to see that progress is being made in the area of greyhound welfare.  That really needs to happen.<\/p> <p>I know many people who work with greyhounds, who are active in this sector and who have put proposals to Greyhound Racing Ireland and the previous Minister that were never acted on.  These proposals need to be acted on.  This is a central issue.  People cannot mistreat dogs.  There has to be a proper welfare system in place that is funded.  It is critical.  Greyhound Racing Ireland gets a significant volume of funding but this does not transpire to the ordinary man and woman working in the greyhound area.  That needs to be dealt with as well.<\/p> <p> I have a range of issues relating to GRI and how it does its accounts, historical issues relating to the Indecon report and the whole issue of liquidising assets.  The Minister will know about this industry.  I do not want to see several racecourses getting liquidated to ensure current funding can go on.  It is not good when a body is liquidising assets to fund current activities.  In fact, it is awful.  This needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p> I will say something about the horseracing industry.  It is a critically important industry throughout the country.  It employs many people, especially in rural Ireland, and it has tangibility in so many other sectors where other people are working.  I wish to say this clearly: issues have been raising their heads.  We need a sectoral employment order for people working in this industry.  Too many people are not being well-paid.  In some cases, they are not being treated well.  They love horses and the horseracing industry.  We have a good name abroad but we need to treat workers right.  I implore the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to work with his colleagues in government to bring in a sectoral employment order in that sector alone to ensure all people who work in the industry are protected, paid proper wages and treated properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100026#Z00300","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606842300,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Since our motion last week to reverse the increase in funding for the commercial greyhound racing industry I have heard little legitimate defence of the sector from its proponents.

He is paid by the taxpayer, by all of us.  I was not deeply hurt or offended by the man's comments - I will not say his name from now on.  My initial reaction was to ignore it.  I instinctively felt it did not deserve any energy or thought.  Indeed, I did not want to waste my speaking time addressing it today.  Yet, when a Fine Gael Deputy apologised for liking these sentiments I could not avoid the volume of calls I was getting from the media for a response.<\/p>  <p>  The unfortunate reality of this situation is that I was not deeply hurt or offended because I am used to these kinds of gendered comments.  Rightly, I do not take personal offence.  Yet, in reality too many women are subject to too many comments which seek to demean and belittle.  This offends all women.  In the past week, in the context of the Social Democrats motion to reverse the increase in State funding to the industry, I have been referred to as \"airy fairy\", \"a dangerous, dangerous woman\" and \"a fool\".  It would not be appropriate in this Chamber to recite some of the other language used.  Women everywhere experience the same kind of everyday sexism in different ways every day.  We are tired of it.  As the only female Deputy in all of Cork city and county I feel the need to address the sexism that we are all so used to.  I feel the need to put it on the D&aacute;il record that a board member of a State organisation spoke about elected women in that way in 2020.  I feel the need to say there can be no excuse for this because there is no excuse.<\/p>  <p>  I have no wish to use my speaking time on this issue addressing this everyday sexism.  Women all over Ireland, including myself, wish we did not need to address this at all.  Yet, there is no alternative when we cannot ignore it.  When we address this everyday sexism, we are often met with more of it.  We hear things like \"angry feminist\", \"you are too emotional\" or \"you should calm down\".  When we think about it, we should all be angry, emotional and uncalm about the reality that half of the population are still disregarded, patronised and condescended in so many ways.  Instead, many of us are numb to it and that is even worse.  The House needs to send a clear message to everyone that there needs to be zero tolerance for sexism.<\/p>  <p>  The member of Greyhound Racing Ireland also claimed my remarks were \"waffle\".  I wish to put on the D&aacute;il record that none of my remarks were waffle.  The opposite applies: they were all fact, based on research, much of which was done by Greyhound Racing Ireland.  He has not challenged any of those facts; he has only challenged my personality and pointed out my gender.  I wish to take this opportunity to invite this member of the Greyhound Racing Ireland to take part in a debate about the facts I have raised relating to the greyhound racing industry, the viability of the industry, the animal welfare issues associated with the industry and the public disquiet about the State funding.  I imagine a broadcaster would be happy to facilitate this and I would be happy to arrange it.<\/p>  <p>  One important thing to note is that although the Social Democrats motion was defeated last week, we have another opportunity to finally put an end to the State turning a blind eye to the industry's flaws and more money at its failings.  It says a great deal that the industry and public representatives simply do not have a legitimate argument - I have yet to hear one from any Member.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, I highlighted many concerning aspects about this industry, including the frightening levels of animal cruelty, the extraordinary cost to the taxpayer and the staggering loss-making nature of the industry.  There is extraordinary public support for an end to the State propping up this highly problematic industry and shielding it from commercial realities.  The industry receives extraordinary sums of money from the public purse while breeding 6,000 dogs annually to kill them.  The vast majority of the general public cannot understand why Government continues to blatantly ignore common sense on this issue.  Not only does our Government plan to continue funding it - to my surprise this plan was supported by all Government parties, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party - it is also increasing funding by &euro;2.4 million.  This will bring the total allocation in the 2021 budget to &euro;19.2 million.  It does not have to be this way.  It is scandalous, unacceptable and indefensible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100027#AA00400","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1606842300,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Anyone who watched the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme on the treatment of greyhounds and the greyhound industry last year would have been rather sickened at the way greyhounds were treated.

The proposal is for &euro;96 million to go to the Horse and Greyhound Fund.<\/p> <p>One fifth of that money goes to the greyhound industry, which is a little over &euro;19 million.  This industry cannot be separated in its format from cruelty to animals.  Some 6,000 dogs are culled every year because they are not able to race at the level which the owners want them to and it is not therefore profitable.  I understand that all but eight countries worldwide have banned it at this stage.  We are one of those eight laggards which have not done so.  What is the Government proposing to do?  It is proposing to give the industry more money and increase its funding by &euro;2.4 million.  That will be &euro;280 million since 2000 which has been given by the taxpayer and the State to the greyhound industry.<\/p> <p> While State funding is going up, the industry itself is going down and is greatly waning in popularity.  The figures I have for 2010 to 2017 indicate that the turnover of the industry went from &euro;32.9 million to &euro;22.7 million.  It decreased, therefore, by about one third.  From 2010 to next year, however, State funding will go from &euro;11.9 million to &euro;19.2 million, and that is an increase of more than 50%.  The industry would not be able to continue if was not being propped up by the taxpayer and the State.  An industry within which cruelty to animals is inherent should no longer be propped up by the State.  There are issues concerning jobs in the industry.  It is an important issue and the State should intervene there to provide training, the development of skills and alternative employment for people currently employed in the industry, if it is to go by the wayside.

Those industries have served to deliver prestige to Ireland and they are recognised brand ambassadors in developing Irish tourism abroad.  They have created economic ties and have allowed Irish people to forge international links which have serviced us through good times and bad.  Through the generations, committed and passionate animal lovers and sports enthusiasts in the horse and greyhound industries have developed in Ireland, through years of selective trade, international centres of excellence which have become known throughout the world.  State funding directed through Horse Racing Ireland and Greyhound Racing Ireland is designed to support these two sectors and provide for continued development in both industries.<\/p>  <p>  The benefits of this are evident from a 2017 Deloitte report, which demonstrated that total direct and stimulated expenditure within the horse breeding and racing industry was estimated at &euro;1.84 billion in 2016.  This revenue supports more than 15,000 jobs in racing, breeding and related industries.  Horse racing, in particular, generates significant returns to the rural economy.  Many farmers are also owners of broodmares.  I will introduce anyone who comes to my county of Waterford to the farrier, the vet, the fence builder, the tillage farmer, the tractor mechanic, the stable lads and ladies and the jockeys who depend greatly on this industry for their occupation and, for many, their sole income.<\/p>  <p>  The greyhound industry also provides considerable economic benefits, along with direct and indirect employment.  A 2016 survey reported more than 5,000 full-time and part-time jobs in the sector, with more than 7,300 active greyhound owners in Ireland.  Greyhound ownership and racing, although most active in the rural heartlands of Ireland, also has urban-based breeders and supporters.  I am sure most people in this House have at some time in their lives enjoyed a night at the dogs.<\/p>  <p>  Both industries have been concentrating on furthering activities to improve and maintain the highest levels of animal welfare and care.  There are always some people for whom profit is the only objective, even to the detriment of animal welfare.  In greyhound racing, however, where this can be a more significant problem due to the lower cost of ownership, the sector is fighting back.  Provisions in the new Greyhound Racing Act 2019 seek to improve standards on traceability and transportation and to provide financial support for injured animals, as well as promoting a new scheme to look at rehoming greyhounds after their racing careers are finished.  The sector has been tasked with providing demonstrable change in respect of animal welfare and has appointed a new director of greyhound care and welfare to oversee these industry improvements.<\/p>  <p>  New technologies are also creating new audiences for Irish horse racing and greyhound racing.  Some parts of Asia have discovered Irish greyhound racing via satellite TV, following the success of Irish horse racing in developing a global following.  This increased interest is delivering direct income to the Irish Exchequer through online betting tax receipts.  This is, in turn, supporting the development of regional economic diversification in Ireland through beneficial income, enterprise and tax measures.  The financial supports being announced to support these industries are entirely appropriate, given the decimation of income and gate receipts caused by the ravages of Covid-19.  These industries provide long-term income to the State and the Government, in turn, will be a long-term beneficiary through the recovery of increased tax revenues from these sectors in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The cultural implications in respect of supporting these sectors must also be kept at the forefront of our minds.  Ireland is a world leader in these sectors, and as well as world-class standards in animal welfare and husbandry, we must also consider the welfare of the people who depend on these industries for their livelihoods, in addition to their amenity value.  Too often in this country we speak about the cost of everything and we fail to recognise the value of anything, at times.  The global leading position which these industries have developed for this country must be maintained and supported so that once Covid-19 has been consigned to the past, these industries may again flourish and contribute to the advancement of rural and regional Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100028#BB00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1606842900,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I support this motion and compliment the Minister for putting forward this fund.

Notwithstanding the figures of more than 15,000 jobs in the horseracing and breeding industry, and the 5,000 jobs associated with the greyhound racing and breeding industry, this fund underpins world-class and world-leading industries, as alluded to by many speakers here, which are the envy of many competing countries.

The R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann member who made those comments has apologised and withdrawn those comments.  They were sexist and offensive.  Deputy Cairns should not have had to experience them.  I certainly will be writing to the chair of the board to express my repugnance at those comments, to remind all board members of their responsibilities for high standards, and to ensure there is no repeat of such instances in the future.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a healthy debate.  In my opening comments I outlined the fact the horse and greyhound racing industries support significant employment.  The thoroughbred industry is worth &euro;1.9 billion to the economy, with some 29,000 direct and indirect jobs benefiting from it.  Nearly 12,500 people derive economic benefit from the greyhound industry.  This is the fourth time in the course of one week that I have debated this particular fund and issues raised in both Houses of the Oireachtas and at the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine.  It has received thorough interrogation, and rightly so.  I am aware Members have varying views on the matter.  Due to the time today, I cannot address all the comments, but the issues received a very thorough airing in the committee.<\/p>  <p>  Members on different sides of the House have different views House, and I come back on Deputy Carthy's view.  There is a well-known saying, \"To run with the hare and to hunt with the hound\".  That certainly represents Sinn F&eacute;in's view on the matter.  After he voted against last year's level of funding, Deputy Brian Stanley said, shame on Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party which were successful in having the motion passed.

Contrary to what the Deputy said, this guidance has recently been reviewed and was circulated to the education partners.  The updated guidance has now been published.<\/p>  <p>  As regards good ventilation practices in schools, it is important, particularly as we get further into winter, that we achieve an appropriate balance between good ventilation and comfort.  The overall approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use, for example, during break times, lunchtime and at the end of each school day, and partially open when classrooms are in use to achieve appropriate airflow.  It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy or colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom.  This will assist in managing comfort levels in classrooms, including those in prefabricated accommodation, during periods of colder weather.<\/p>  <p>  As part of managing comfort levels in classrooms, schools should check that their heating systems are set at the recommended manufacturer's guidance levels to maximise the heat available to the school.  In addition, heating should operate for extended periods during colder weather to counteract, as best as possible, the impact of windows being open in order to maintain an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort levels.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has reviewed the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, guidance recommending that consideration be given to installing indoor air quality monitors in classrooms.  The purpose of a monitor in this context is to assist in determining when windows should be opened.  It should be noted that an air monitor would not increase the air temperature in a classroom.  As reflected in the updated guidance, my Department has concluded that it will likely be necessary for windows to be open at the frequency I outlined earlier to ensure appropriate levels of ventilation in classrooms, irrespective of whether the opening of windows is prompted by an indoor air quality monitor, which is a reactive approach, or through the proactive approach outlined in the guidance.  While this matter, as well as supporting data, will be kept under review, the Department does not consider it necessary for schools to install such monitors in classrooms where the practical steps outlined in the updated guidance are applied.  However, it is a matter for individual schools to consider whether they wish to put in place mechanisms of this nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100030#DD00600","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1606844100,"counter":238,"content":"<p>That is an interesting reply and there is much in it to consider.  I would make one point, of which I am sure the Minister is very aware as principals certainly raise it with me.  I am aware of the updated guidance but it is still the case that windows must be open, although the guidance states the times and extent to which that should be done.  Older buildings, examples of which the Minister can think herself, such as those in Christian Brothers schools, were built in the 1950s and 1960s and were not designed for these situations, even if they were renovated.  Children sit next to the window in coats and with hot water bottles and so on.  It is a real dilemma for principals, even in the current context.  Air monitoring is essential.  It would assist in keeping budgets down by ensuring schools strike the right balance between windows being open and heating.  It would ensure windows were not open unnecessarily and that schools get that balance right based on the information available.  It sounds like the Minister is not ruling air monitors out.  I welcome that but will she state if that is the case?  If I am right about that I welcome it, but it is a pity given that the ideal opportunity to install such monitors is over the Christmas break, when schools will be closed in any event.

In the interest of balance and proper context, no building has been built for a Covid-19 environment.  This issue is not unique to what is happening in the school environment.  It is happening in every building of which we are aware.  I again emphasise that air monitors do not increase the air temperature in a room.  They merely monitor when one should open or close a window.  Significant practical guidance has been given to schools around measures of that nature, such as opening windows before classes commence, during break times, lunchtimes, in the evenings, and so on.  I appreciate that such measures are reliant on an abundance of practical common sense and practicality but, in my experience, there is an abundance of that in schools as is.  Schools have the freedom to use the minor works grant to address this issue but as I have said to the Deputy, I will keep everything under review.

I will take it from her answer that the Minister is not ruling such measures out but I ask her to go back to the HPSC and to continue to examine this.  Air monitors would be of value and the perfect opportunity is there over the Christmas break for people to go into the schools and install them.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised my final point with the Minister previously.  It seems inevitable that additional money will be required for the ordinary school budget and the capitation grant early in the new year.  Heating costs are going up and so are refuse costs, due to PPE, wipes, sanitiser and so on.  Fundraising has inevitably fallen, and there is also the cost of room hire to consider.

As he is aware, the management of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in schools is led by the HSE's departments of public health.

The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, has published a definition of a close contact in an educational setting, which was communicated to all schools and their partners in education.  I will outline that definition.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with current Health Protection Surveillance Centre guidelines, a clinical public health risk assessment will be undertaken for all educational settings where a confirmed case has attended whilst infectious.  A public health risk assessment defines a close contact as any person who has had face-to-face contact within less than 1 m of a confirmed case of Covid-19 for more than 15 minutes in a school day, or any person who has been in contact between 1 m and 2 m of a confirmed case of Covid-19 for more than 15 minutes in a school day.  Other mitigating measures including face coverings, pods, ventilation, infection prevention and control measures or uncertain compliance with other mitigating measures are also considered.  Contacts are assessed from contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19 during the infectious period, 48 hours before the onset of symptoms if symptomatic or 24 hours before the test for Covid-19 was taken for those who are asymptomatic.<\/p>  <p>  This definition is based on international public health guidance.  It is the view of the HSE's departments of public health that the evidence available to date shows that schools are proving to be safe spaces for children and their staff.<\/p> <p> The department of public health has also facilitated webinars for school leaders on this and other public health messages.  Furthermore, dedicated school teams have been enhanced to provide specific and dedicated supports to schools where there is a confirmed case of Covid-19.<\/p> <p> The Department will continue to work closely with all the education partners and the public health system in order that schools can continue to be supported during this very challenging time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100032#FF01600","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606845900,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I am glad to see the Minister engage with this - other Ministers would have taken the attitude that it was nothing to do with them - but I would like to see her engage with it more.

It was welcome to see her on the After School Hub, but I wrote to her a few months ago about some of the weekly briefings.

The overall approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use - for example, during break times, lunchtimes and at the end of each school day - and partially open when classrooms are in use to achieve appropriate airflow.  It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy or cold weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom.  This will assist in managing comfort levels in classrooms, including in prefabricated accommodation, during periods of colder weather.<\/p>  <p>  As part of managing comfort levels in classrooms, schools should check that their heating systems are set according to the recommended manufacturer's guidance levels to maximise the available heat to the school.

I will also work with colleagues in the Government to ensure there is a joined-up approach and a continuum of support for all children with special educational needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100034#HH01100","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1606846500,"counter":299,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State mentioned, some aspects of the Act were commenced, such as that providing for the establishment of the NCSE.<\/p> <p>I understand the NCSE prepared an implementation report back in 2006 that set out the sequence in which the remaining provisions of the Act should be commenced and estimated a level of investment, at that time, for their implementation.

The premise of the review is that in the 16 years since the enactment of the Act, we have moved substantially away from the diagnosis-led model to a needs-based model.  One of the reasons that some provisions of the Act were not commenced was a cost consideration.  The NCSE and the Department estimated that, over a period of years, it would have cost some &euro;235 million per annum to implement and commence all Parts of the Act that have not yet been commenced.  My review will involve an assessment of the areas where special education needs policy has evolved since the introduction of the Act and a consideration of how best to progress aspects of the Act on a non-statutory basis.

We need to provide a more inclusive society in all aspects of life and that includes education.<\/p>  <p>  The new Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters, which was established last month, has a very important role of overseeing the full implementation of the convention.  At a recent meeting of the committee, I asked a question about the future of the EPSEN Act.

The representative of the National Disability Authority, however, said that the Act needs to be fully implemented in order to fulfil our role under the UN convention.  Which view is correct?  I accept that the provisions of the Act will need to be updated to reflect, as the Minister noted, that 16 years have passed since its introduction.  However, it remains the case that, where it is practical, we need to integrate children with disabilities into mainstream education.

It was previously the case that if a child with autism joined a class, he or she would be guaranteed to be assigned an SNA.  That does not seem to be the case at the moment.

In the 2019-20 school year, more than 120,000 children were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, covering more than 100 million km at a cost in excess of &euro;219 million in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for children with special educational needs and this is reflected in the approach that is taken.  In the current school year, there are more than 14,500 children availing of special needs school transport, which is an increase of 5,300 children since 2013.  The Department funded the school transport scheme in 2019 in the amount of just over &euro;219 million, with 53% of that allocated to the transport scheme for children with special needs.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the special needs transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs.  Under the terms of the scheme, children are eligible for transport where they have special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability and are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school, special class, special school or unit that is, or can be, resourced to meet their needs.  Where practicable, my Department will consider the provision of specific or individual transport arrangements in circumstances where travel in the company of other children is not deemed feasible.  In addition, there is a facility within the special needs transport scheme for the appointment of a school bus escort where a child's care and safety needs while on school transport are such as to require that support.<\/p>  <p>  All eligible children are exempt from school transport charges.  A special transport grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements may be provided at the discretion of the Department in certain situations where, for example, the child's care or medical needs are such as to make the provision of a transport service impracticable.  While the closing date for receipt of applications for school transport in general is the last Friday in April of any given year for the following school year, my Department accepts applications all year round for the special needs transport scheme.   As the Deputy may be aware, public health advice issued to my Department in late August recommended that all post-primary transport services operate at 50% capacity.  That recommendation is being implemented across all special education services on which post-primary children travel.

Unfortunately, due to the child's needs, the arrangement did not work out and the parents have been doing the school run themselves.  They have tried to switch from the taxi service to the special grant that is available for children with special needs but are finding it hugely difficult to get their application processed and obtain clear guidance on the matter from the Department.

The person's doctor, principal and the board of management agree that it is not safe for the person to return to school.  However, due to the process in place, the person must go in every day and potentially risk the person's health in doing so or the person would have to take the decision to take a leave of absence.  The principal was more than happy for the person to be paired with a medically vulnerable student - it would have suited everybody in the equation - to learn from home and for the learning to continue online in the instance of high infection in the community.  I believe there is a rigidity in that regard.

The fact that somebody gets a review does not necessarily mean that it takes an overall view of this individual member of staff and says it would probably be better, in the circumstances, if the person was at home.  It only refers to whether the person has one of the conditions that qualifies the person as very high risk.

Attitudes towards gender are primarily explored in the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum.

There is therefore not one preferred educational approach for autistic students and rather there is a range of provision, sometimes described as a continuum, which takes into account the assessed educational needs of individual students.  All students with special education needs are served by this continuum of provision, ranging from full-time enrolment in classes in mainstream schools with or without additional supports to a special class in a mainstream school to full-time enrolment in special schools.<\/p>  <p>  This continuum is supported by significant investment by the Government at &euro;2 billion or 20% of the total education spend.  This funds the provision of additional teachers, special needs assistants and other supports required to enable children with special needs to access education.

We want to see workers have the right to retire at 65 with their State pension, the pension for which they have worked all of their lives.  It is not good enough to defer or postpone the rise in the pension age.  I am glad the Minister has repealed this measure and that she has listened to an Teachta Kerrane and the Stop67 campaign.  Workers deserve better than to be told that they must go on the dole, although they do not have to seek work, which is what the Minister has tried to tell them.  That is the dole queue by another name and the Minister knows it.  Sending people who have worked hard for all of their lives to the dole queue is not right.  It is unfair and it is wrong.<\/p><p>If I were a Minister, I would ensure that workers would have the right to retire with their State pension at the age of 65.  I have spent the vast majority of my working life defending workers and their rights.  I came to the D&aacute;il to continue that work.  I sometimes wonder how connected to the real world this Government actually is.  It does not seem to understand what it is like to have to work all day on one's feet or in a manual job before coming home from work physically exhausted.  It does not seem to understand the dignity the old age pension gives people who have worked all their lives.  These people can now say, that is it, their shift is done, they are going to get the pension they have earned and enjoy the time they have left because they are finished working and finished with any prospect of being unemployed.  They have retired.  That is why this motion is so important.<\/p><p>The pension age was one of the biggest issues in the last election in February.  Voters across the State expressed their opposition to the increase in the pension age throughout the election campaign, so much so that they forced Fine Gael into a U-turn.  I welcome the publication of the legislation, which was clearly a response to this motion.  I welcome the repeal of the rise in the pension age to 67 and I commend the work of an Teachta Kerrane and the Stop67 campaign.<\/p><p>Workers make a considerable tax and PRSI contribution throughout their working lives.  They should have the right to retire at 65.  Some workers will not take that opportunity to retire.  Some will want to remain at work because they are able and willing to do so.  These workers should be allowed to keep working.  The mandatory retirement age should be abolished so that workers would have the choice to work or retire as they wish.<\/p><p>Take, for example, plasterers, carpenters, cleaners, waitresses or barmen who have worked their whole lives.  Their bodies are ready to retire at 65.  They have been on their feet for all of their working lives.  Their bodies have been through enough.  This is the fundamental point of this debate.  It is about the right to finish working after a lifetime of work.<\/p><p>At 65, one is finished working.  One is not unemployed.  In February, I spoke to workers on the doors in Fingal.  They did not feel able to continue working but did not want to be sent to the dole queue or any queue like it.  I spoke to a builder in Balbriggan.  The conversation I had with him has stayed with me.  I was thinking about him tonight while writing down a few notes before this debate.  He was 64 and said that he was tired.  He did not feel able to work to 66, much less 67.  He should not have to draw on the dole or anything like it.  This man has since turned 65 and has finished working.  He has had to sign on.  He paid every shilling, penny and cent he was supposed to.  As my mother always says, workers of her generation paid tax when tax was tax.  The Government is now saying thanks to them for everything they have done but telling them that, although they helped the State and worked hard all their lives, the State is not going to help them now.  It is asking them to sign on for the next two years.<\/p><p>If people like this man want to retire at 65, they should be entitled to their pensions.  They have earned that right.  Sending people who have worked hard all of their lives to a dole queue at 65 is wrong and unfair.  Unfortunately, due to pension changes over recent years, there are now more than 4,000 65-year-olds in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or benefit.  These workers are retired, not unemployed.  Telling them that it is okay because they will be given the dole, although it will not be called that, is not right.  There is a difference of &euro;45.30 per week between these payments.  That is a hell of a lot of money.  The Minister knows what the right thing to do is.  Workers will not be fooled.  They want the pension they have earned and the right to retire at 65.  Giving it to them is the right thing to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100040#PP00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1606849800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>The Minister will know well that there is not a country in the world that moves retiring workers onto a jobseeker's payment and which treats them as someone who is unemployed.  Since 2014, more than 35,000 65-year-olds have been forced onto a jobseeker's payment at retirement.  Not only did Fine Gael and the Labour Party abolish the State pension transition payment provided to 65-year-olds at retirement, but they also announced increases to the pension age.  These increases go further and faster than equivalent increases in any other country of the EU, despite Ireland having the youngest population in Europe.  Let us not pretend that these pension age increases were about ensuring the State pension remained sustainable or ensuring that we were protected against demographic changes.  They were part of a deal done with the troika to save a few pounds.  This deal told workers approaching retirement age that they could not continue at work because their contracts did not allow them to while access to the State pension into which they had paid for decades was cut.  It was taken away and they were told that they should instead join the dole queue and seek new employment at 65 years of age.<\/p>  <p>  A number of commitments on pensions were made in the programme for Government.  I have read them many times.  They might make it look as though the Government is actually doing something, but it is not.  An example of this is its commitment to replace the jobseeker's payment for 65-year-olds with what it refers to as an early retirement allowance.  This makes it sound almost as if the Government is doing people a favour when, in fact, it is nothing more than a name change.  This allowance will be paid at the same rate as jobseeker's allowance.<\/p>  <p>  This same commitment refers to the removal of the requirement for people to partake in job activation measures, a requirement that simply does not exist.  Once a person turns 62, they are no longer required to partake in job activation schemes.  In recent months, Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies have been submitting questions asking where the State pension transition payment is.  It is not coming.  Despite being a commitment in Fianna F&aacute;il's election manifesto just a few months ago, it has fallen by the wayside to be replaced by the promise of a name change.<\/p> <p> In preparing for this debate earlier I was reminded of my parent's generation, including those who are seven or eight years off pension age.  My father began working at 15 years of age for a local butcher.  His parents thought he was in school until his father spotted him at the butcher counter one day.  When he reaches 65 years of age he will have worked for 50 years.  There are thousands more like him.  Yet, in not one part of the Minister's long-winded amendment to the motion does she acknowledge that contribution of a lifetime of work.  Some of those affected went out to work when they were only teenagers.  They paid their taxes with the promise of a pension at 65 years only to have the rug pulled from under them.  People from that generation do not now have the security or certainty they had once of a pension at 65 years, or of knowing that they would get the pension at 65.  In fact, after a lifetime of work that certainty no longer exists.  The pension age might be 66, 67 or 68 years.<\/p> <p> Restoring the State pension transition at 65 years is the right thing to do.  Failing to support the motion is to say to 65 year olds that their place is on jobseeker's support after retirement.  My party and I believe that 65 year olds who have made such a contribution to our society and communities deserve far better when they hit retirement at 65 years of age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100040#PP00300","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606850400,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues, Teachta&iacute; O'Reilly and Kerrane, for bringing this motion to the House.  In 2011 in their first year in coalition Government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party legislated for the phased increase in the age at which people could access the State pension.  The age was increased to 66 years from 2014.  It was planned to rise to 67 years from 1 January 2021 and to 68 years from 1 January 2028.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  We now have a Pauline conversion by the Labour Party, which seems to be opposed to the Government policy that it was happy to implement in 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The 30,000 people who have reached 65 years of age this year must now apply for jobseeker's benefit before they can access the State pension.  This is a payment available to people who are unemployed but have a consistent PRSI record.  I have been assisting many people in recent months whose work record pre-1979 is incomplete through no fault of their own.  This needs to be addressed urgently.  To qualify for jobseeker's benefit, a person must be capable of work, available for work and genuinely seeking work.  This is now what most people retiring are expected to have to do.  If people wish to work, even part-time, while in receipt of the pension, they are allowed.  With jobseeker's benefit, this is not an option.  The maximum weekly payment under jobseeker's benefit is &euro;203.  That only lasts for nine months.  After that, the payment is means-tested and with the State pension a person can receive up to &euro;248 per week.  The difference between jobseeker's benefit and the State pension is &euro;45 per week or more than &euro;2,300 per year.  By not being able to access the State pension, a retiree is losing almost one fifth of the income he or she could expect to get.  This is a great deal of money when a person is 65 years and struggling to make ends meet.<\/p>  <p>  If a person retiring has an adult dependant, it gets worse.  The maximum allowed for a dependant under jobseeker's benefit is &euro;134.  With the State pension it is &euro;165.  That rises to &euro;222 if the dependant is 66 years of age or over.<\/p>  <p>  Many people have worked all their lives without needing to rely on welfare.  They do not see why they should be forced onto the dole and, frankly, I do not either since they have paid PRSI all their lives.  I appeal to all Deputies to support this motion so that our older people can get what they deserve when they retire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100041#QQ00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1606850400,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I commend my party colleagues, Deputies Louise O'Reilly and Claire Kerrane, on submitting this important motion which I am delighted to support.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of increasing the pension age energised people during the election campaign in February and that energy is still evident.  Raising the pension age affects thousands every year.  This number will continue to increase if it is not rectified.  First, mandatory retirement at 65 years, except perhaps in some security-related employment, should be abolished.  Everyone should be allowed to choose to continue working, if willing and able, past 65 years of age or, alternatively, people should be allowed to retire at 65 but with a pension.  I am calling for the restoration of the State pension transition payment.  No one should be forced to claim jobseeker's benefit after years of hard work.  Older people in our society who have given so much over the years deserve better.  They have worked hard and paid their taxes.  They have had a particularly hard year this year.  Older people were hardest hit by Covid-19.  They were also discriminated against since employees and the self-employed over the age of 66 were not allowed claim the pandemic unemployment payment.<\/p>  <p>  The plan to increase the pension age to 67 years may have been deferred but the Commission on Pensions that has been established to look at this issue does not have the confidence of the people affected by this since they are not represented on the commission.  The commission should include people with the lived experience of being forced to retire without the security of a pension.<\/p>  <p>  I want to refer specifically to carers and the need to find a pension solution that recognises their valuable work.  Many carers, the majority of whom are women, most often fall into a pension gap.  They do not qualify for the contributory State pension as most gave up work to care for a loved one and do not have the necessary credits.  They do not qualify for a non-contributory State pension as they will be means tested and often, due to a partner's income or land, if living on a family farm, they will not receive it.  After years of caring they are then told at pension age they do not qualify for a pension.  This is an insult and is most hurtful.<\/p>  <p>  The total contributions approach due to come into effect next year is welcome and will see the introduction of up to 20 years of credits for caregiving, but it is only granted to those who have accumulated 520 paid contributions.  A person who has perhaps given up a job to care for a child with a disability or an illness may not have 520 paid contributions.  I am calling for the issues around carers and access to a State pension be examined and rectified.  I am calling for the pension age not to be increased to 67 years and the State pension transition payment to be restored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100041#QQ00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1606850400,"counter":364,"content":"<p>This year, during the election, I met a man who told me that he had his first job when he was 14 years old.  After working for 51 years, the Government put him on the dole, or the exchange as he called it.  After 51 years of work, that was what the Government did to him.  He was angry.  He said the lack of respect shown to him demonstrated that all his years of service, his work and his contribution to his family and the State were not appreciated.<\/p>  <p>  When people reach the age of 65, they want the choice to be able to retire if they wish.  After working all their lives, people should have the right to retire at 65.  They should be shown the respect they deserve.  It really goes to show how out-of-touch the last Government was and this Government is.  The Government does not understand what it means to ordinary people to have that right to retire at 65.  How dare the Government take that away from people after all their years.  These people have contributed.  They have worked hard, many of them in hard manual jobs.  This shows the broken promises of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party after the election.  It shows how, at the first opportunity, they turned their backs on the promises made.  They are selling out workers' rights.  There is no problem finding money for their pay increases, but when it comes to other people, workers and those who want to retire at 65 years, the money cannot be found.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe it is right for a person to have to join the dole queue at 65 years and I hope the Minister and the Government feel the same way.  What they have created is an us-versus-them situation where cronyism and politics do not respect ordinary people and families.  People came out and voted for change this year.  They wanted change because they were sick and tired of watching out-of-touch politicians make decisions that hurt ordinary people and families.  I wish to support my colleagues.

Throughout people's working lives, they knew the pension age always to be 65 years.<\/p> <p>More than that, people were mentally geared up to retire at 65.  The social contract which the State had with its citizens was broken by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government when it brought into law increases in the pension age to 66 in 2014, to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  It was a cruel twist of the knife in the backs of those who had worked all their lives, paid their taxes and followed the rules, only to be shafted in their autumn years.  We see now that this law crafted by a Labour Party Minister is being stopped in its tracks, but only temporarily.  We must now restore the broken social contract and remove the cruel unfairness from the future of our senior citizens.<\/p> <p> When the pension age was first moved from 65 years old to 66, it was claimed that this was for budgetary reasons and financial hard times.  Public service sector pay was also impacted at this time.  Despite improvements in the economy, however, there was no talk of changing the pension age back to 65.  Not only that, but it happened at the time when the Government also raided the private pension fund, which brought about a double whammy against older people who had worked all their lives trying to save for retirement.  The Government put its hands in people's savings.  One constituent wrote to me to say a massive lack of respect had been shown to people who had stayed at home and helped to build the economy through the bad economic times.  It must be remembered that during the 1980s there were high incomes taxes and that during the crash of 2008 people like me were requested to take pay cuts, the universal social charge, USC, was introduced and part of our private pension fund was raided.  <\/p> <p> The reality is that our pension age of 66 is two years above the EU average of 64, despite us having nearly 30% fewer older people than other EU countries.  In 2016, we spent 8% of our national income on public pensions, and this is to rise by less than 3% over the next 50 years, with us spending less on public pensions than most eurozone countries.  Several months ago, an older man in my estate in Mervue in Galway city told me he had been working since he was 16 years old.  He told me was in his 60s now, having worked all his life and he was being told, as he put it, by politicians in comfortable seats that he would have to continue to work for a few more years or go on to jobseeker's allowance.  That man told me that had been running up and down ladders and doing hard physical labour.  He had enjoyed it, made great friends and achieved a comfortable life for his family, but he said that he could not keep doing that now, because that level of physical labour takes its toll.  The Minister is now asking that man to go on the jobseeker's allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100041#QQ00500","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606851000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;notes that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; has committed to maintaining the State Pension as the bedrock of the Irish pension system;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; this includes a commitment to establish a Commission on Pensions and pending the report of that Commission to maintain the State Pension age at 66;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government has already established this Commission on Pensions;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Commission on Pensions has already conducted its first meeting, its second is scheduled for tomorrow the 2nd December, its third is scheduled for later this month and it will meet approximately every fortnight in the new year until it concludes its work;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government has approved the Social Welfare Bill 2020, which in addition to giving legislative effect to a range of social welfare measures announced in Budget 2021 on 13th October, 2020,  includes specific provisions to repeal increases in the State Pension age ensuring that it will remain at 66 pending the report of the Commission on Pensions and consideration of that report by Government;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Social Welfare Bill 2020 was published on 24th November, 2020;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; as set out in that Bill the Government is also repealing the planned increase from 67 to 68 which is scheduled to happen on 1st January, 2028, thus ensuring that the Commission on Pensions can consider matters in relation to the State Pension age unfettered by any prospective changes;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government has noted the Minister for Social Protection&rsquo;s proposal to sign regulations to formally remove the requirement for 65-year olds to be actively seeking work and to &lsquo;sign on&rsquo;, formalising an administrative arrangement which has already been in place for some time;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; persons aged 65 or over who retire and qualify for a Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit payment may retain that payment in full until they reach the State Pension age of 66 assuming they don&rsquo;t return to work;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the payment rate of &euro;203 is in fact higher than the rate available for the full State Pension in other jurisdictions such as Northern Ireland where the state pension age has been increased from 65 to 66;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Terms of Reference of the Commission on Pensions includes consideration of a range of pensions matters including sustainability, eligibility and cross generational equity issues, and consideration of options for the Government to address issues including qualifying age, contribution rates, total contributions and eligibility requirements;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in addition, the Commission on Pensions will consider the issue of retirement ages specified in employment contracts that are below the State Pension age, including where contracts stipulate a retirement age of 65;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Act 1998 (as amended) already provides that an employer has to prove a contractual retirement age that is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary, with recourse for employees to the Workplace Relations Commission in the event of breaches; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; to assist employers and employees in this regard and in respect of retirement ages, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the rate for the State Pension (Contributory) in Ireland compares very favourably with neighbouring jurisdictions where pension rates are significantly lower.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>  <p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the State pension age.  I am proposing this amendment, because the simple fact is that Sinn F&eacute;in has put down a motion calling for legislation to stop the increase in the State pension age to 67 when the Government has already approved and published legislation to do just that.  It was done last week.  As part of the Social Welfare Bill, which will come before the Houses next week, the pension age will be kept at 66 and the planned increases in the age, to 67 in January 2021 and to 68 in January 2028, will both be repealed.  This will allow the Commission on Pensions, recently established by Government, to do its work and produce its recommendations independently.<\/p><p>From an adequacy point of view, the Irish State pension is excellent at protecting pensioners from poverty.  Pension rates in Ireland compare favourably with other jurisdictions.  For example, the contributory State pension here is more than &euro;248.  In Northern Ireland, it is considerably less, at &pound;175 or about &euro;195.  In any discussion on pensions, we must look at one simple, inescapable fact - people are living longer.  In 1971, the average life expectancy was 71, but by 2016 that had risen to 81.  A person who reached 65 years of age in 1971 could expect to live to age 77, but in 2016 that has, thankfully, increased to about 84.  It is hugely welcome of course that people are living longer, healthier lives, but it presents its own challenges.  In 1997, spending on pensions was &euro;1.7 billion.  By 2010, this had increased to &euro;5.8 billion, and by 2019, the cost had increased to more than &euro;8.2 billion.<\/p><p>This expenditure increase is due in no small part to the ongoing increase in the number of pensioners.  Approximately 743,000 people over 66 are expected to benefit from State pension payments next year.  This is an increase of more than 150,000 people in ten years.  As a result, spending on pensions accounts for about 26% of all income tax and PRSI receipts.  About 40% of the total social welfare budget is spent on pensions, up from 28% in 2010.  Whether we like it or not, this has obvious implications for the ability of the State to not only fund pensions but also to allocate resources to other priorities.  It also has implications for inter-generational equity and fairness.<\/p><p>The Social Insurance Fund, SIF, operates on a pay-as-you-go basis, with today's pensions being funded not by past contributions but by the current contributions of today's workers.  What this means, and what is often overlooked, is that the group in society which will be most impacted by the decisions which must be taken regarding the future structure of the State pension are not, in fact, current pensioners, or those approaching pension age, but the younger workers and students of today.  For the sake of future pensioners and workers, we must strive to ensure the long-term sustainability of the pension system so that today's workers will be able to avail of an adequate pension when their time comes to retire.  I was also a PAYE worker all my life before I entered politics and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  As a working woman and a member of a trade union, I also understand the difficulties workers face.  No party has a monopoly on the understanding of workers and the issues they face today.<\/p><p>The Commission on Pensions has been asked to examine a range of issues, including the State pension age, eligibility conditions and payment and contribution rates.  The commission will also consider the issue of retirement ages, specified in employment contracts, which are below the State pension age and how the pension system can provide adequate cover for carers.  It has been tasked with producing its report by June of 2021.  The membership of the commission has been carefully chosen so that it can address these questions with an open mind and with the expertise and experience necessary to meet this deadline.  Its members are drawn from trade union and employer bodies, civil society, academia and those with technical and policy expertise.  <\/p><p>The Government was also keen to ensure that the commission had strong female representation in its membership, and I am pleased that the majority of members - six out of 11 - are women, including a female chairperson.  I am confident, therefore, that the commission is well equipped to grasp the potential impacts of any pension reform options on affected groups, such as women, workers, and older people.  In addition, and in order to give other interested parties an opportunity to contribute to the process, I have asked the commission to seek submissions from stakeholders and representative groups.<\/p><p>In addition to repealing the increase in the pension age, I will also shortly be introducing regulations which will formally remove the current requirements for people aged 65 and over to sign-on, participate in activation programmes or give an undertaking that they are genuinely seeking work.  The idea, therefore, that any 65 year old will have to stand in a dole queue is absolute nonsense.  I am formalising an administrative practice which has already been in place for some time.  While the payment rate of &euro;203 for 65 year olds is less than the full contributory pension rate, it is worth bearing in mind that a 65 year old receiving &euro;203 per week here is still better off than any pensioner in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>I assure the Deputies that the fundamental objective of Government pension policy is to ensure that pensions remain affordable, sustainable and retain their value into the future.<\/p> <p>We want to maintain a fair balance between those who are contributing to the system and those who are drawing from it.  The need to protect current as well as future pensioners, while at the same time protecting the most vulnerable pensioners, will remain at the forefront of any reforms in this area.<\/p> <p> Rather than allow the Commission on Pensions the time and space in which to do its work, Sinn F&eacute;in has sought to politicise the pensions issue.  The pension age was never 65.  There is no mandatory retirement age.  Retirement is a matter for individual contracts between employers and employees.  This motion is another example of Sinn F&eacute;in saying one thing in this House while doing the exact opposite in Northern Ireland.  I have asked the Deputies who spoke so passionately earlier if they had relayed those same comments and concerns to their colleagues in Northern Ireland.  I do not believe their colleagues are listening in Northern Ireland where Sinn F&eacute;in is in government and where the state pension age has recently been increased from 65 to 66.  Maybe before coming in here, the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies should speak to Michelle O'Neill or Conor Murphy.  While they are at it they can ask them if they have any plans to increase the pension in the North.  The fact is that the maximum rate of pension available in Northern Ireland equates to about &euro;195.  As I have said, that compares with a contributory pension in the State of more than &euro;268.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to say that the Social Welfare Bill, which we will debate next week, also provides for an increase in the living alone allowance by &euro;5 per week at a cost of more than &euro;57 million per year, and in the fuel allowance by &euro;3.50 per week at a cost of &euro;36.8 million annually.  These are all measures that will improve the welfare of pensioners and, in particular, those who live alone.<\/p> <p> I am a firm believer that actions speak louder than words.  This Government is supporting our older people and our actions clearly demonstrate that.  I ask Sinn F&eacute;in to reflect  on the adequacy of the supports they are providing for older people in Northern Ireland.  I hear it regularly from people in Fermanagh, Armagh and Tyrone when they say to me that pensioners are far better off south of the Border and I have to say to them that I agree with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100042#RR00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606851600,"counter":369,"content":"<p>We look forward to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100043#SS00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1606851600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in would be better served working constructively to improve the conditions of those people rather than tabling motions on issues that this Government is already dealing with comprehensively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100043#SS00300","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1606851600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I am not going to engage in some of the Minister's shenanigans here this evening.

If the Minister's planned hike proceeds in January, retirees will be forced onto a jobseeker's payment for two years.  This is a ridiculous and totally unacceptable situation for people who have worked hard and paid taxes for their entire lives.  Retirement should be about choices.  People should be entitled to the full State pension at the age of 65.  People should also have the choice to continue to work if they wish to do so.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016 I brought forward legislation to abolish the mandatory retirement age but the Minister's Government blocked that legislation.  The pension age was one of the biggest issues in the election in February.

We did not politicise the issue of pensions.  That issue has long been politicised.<\/p>  <p>  The facts are that the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government of 2007 and the Government in 2011 made a decision with their friends in the troika to increase the pension age to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  The subsequent Fine Gael and Labour Party coalition put this into law in 2011.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael supported the increase in the State pension age and the parties were left scrambling on the issue during the election.  As a result of how big an issue it has become, they have tried to kick it down the road with the establishment of the Commission on Pensions.

People made it very clear how they felt about their right to retire at 65.  My constituency office was inundated with calls and emails on the issue.  There was significant union support for our proposals.  Our position remains the same.  People who have worked and paid taxes all their lives deserve the option of drawing down their pension at the age of 65.  Some people will choose to remain in work, but we want to ensure that those who wish to retire at the age of 65 can do so.  This is so important for those who have worked in hard, physical jobs for decades.  It is also important for the worker who wants to retire and enjoy time with his or her family and friends while he or she is still in good health.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's policy of having people sign on the dole for a year when they reach the age of 65 is, frankly, insulting and demeaning.  It has to stop.  Deputies can retire and draw down their pensions at the age of 50, so it is quite unbelievable that people in the Minister's Government, with those terms and conditions, seek to ensure that others cannot receive a pension until they are 66, 67 or perhaps even 68.  Government Deputies and Ministers are happy to have one rule for themselves and another rule for everybody else.  They have no respect for working people who look forward to their retirement at the age of 65, in particular those in physical jobs.  The Minister wants to make their working lives even longer without giving them any options around their own lives and their own pensions.  This is nothing other than a political decision.  The Minister's Government and the parties involved need to stop flip-flopping and changing their minds.  The Minister needs to stop referring the issue on to commissions and kicking this down the road.<\/p>  <p>  Rather than keeping the retirement age at 66, I ask that the Minister brings it back down to 65 by way of the transition pension.  We know what people want as does the Minister.  We choose to act on what people want while the Minister chooses to ignore it.  People made it crystal clear during and after the election that they want to be able to choose when they retire.  That choice includes drawing down a State pension at the age of 65.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government would do precisely that.  If the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, will not listen to the people, we certainly will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100043#SS00700","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1606851600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>The vast majority of people at the age of 64 and 65 are not going to get another job.  Earlier today I talked to Tommy Nolan from Pearse Street who said his heart was broken from applying for jobs.  It is demoralising for him.  He knows he is being rejected for jobs because he is 64 years of age.  At a time when citizens should be able to take the foot off the gas, this Government wants them to sign on the dole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100043#SS00800","speaker":"1555"}]
