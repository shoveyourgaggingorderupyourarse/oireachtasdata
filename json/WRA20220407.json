Exports to Great Britain in 2021 were valued at &euro;14.4 billion, an increase of 17% compared with 2020. Exports to Great Britain accounted for 9% of total exports in 2021.

While the UK will remain a major market for Irish companies, expanding the Irish export market in markets beyond the UK will continue to be a priority. The long-term response to Brexit is for companies across all sectors to become more competitive, more innovative and to diversify their export footprint into more international markets. Given the pressures of COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine on trade and supply chains, it is also not possible to accurately forecast how Irish trade will develop with EU countries and non-EU countries over the next five years.

We will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Each year, Enterprise Ireland offers a programme of trade missions, trade fairs and knowledge events which give their client companies based in Ireland the opportunity to connect with existing and new customers, access key decision makers, increase sales in international markets and exchange ideas.  In recent years, the majority of Ministerial-led trade missions have taken place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represented the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies. These trade missions focused on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently working closely with its agencies on a trade mission schedule for Q2 of 2022 which will maximise opportunities to help Irish companies to access new markets and to increase the levels of foreign direct investment into Ireland.

However, Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine has sparked further energy price increases and brought unprecedented volatility to international energy markets. This is feeding through to retail price increases for all households and businesses.  I understand that these rising costs, including fuel costs, have placed an additional burden on enterprises trying to get back on their feet in the aftermath of the COVID-19 shock. <\/p><p>Recently, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) published its &lsquo;HEAT Study Report&rsquo;, which noted that the Industry Sector in particular was already facing cost and competitiveness challenges because of the need to decarbonise and move away from fossil fuel usage. The report pointed out most industry sectors use gas to meet their heat demand needs. In Ireland, sectors which are relatively energy intensive include the Cement sector, the Commercial Activities Sector (which includes hospitality and retail), the Food and Drink Sector, and the Electrical and Optical equipment sector. However, businesses across a range of sectors are likely to be impacted by increased fuel prices through their reliance on the logistics and distribution sector to deliver their raw materials and inputs, and to bring their final products to market. <\/p><p>Ireland imports over 70 per cent of our energy use and the Government cannot fully insulate individuals and businesses from developments in international energy markets that are outside of our control.  However, Government has put in place a suite of targeted measures aimed at reducing the burden of these cost pressures, both for businesses and households. Given the volatility of fuel prices, it is important that measures are sustainable and targeted. <\/p><p>To support businesses as well as households, in March the Government approved a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel, and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil. The Government also launched an emergency support measure for licensed hauliers to address cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices. The targeted and temporary grant scheme will provide a payment of &euro;100 per week for every heavy goods vehicle (over 3.5 tonnes) in the country. It will operate for a period of eight weeks and will be reviewed. The Government also agreed a temporary, targeted intervention package for the tillage sector to the value of &euro;12.2 million. The agriculture sector has been significantly impacted by higher input prices for fuel, animal feed and fertilisers. <\/p><p>The Government will keep the energy situation under close review and we will continue to examine what measures are possible to manage the impact of rising energy prices for households and businesses. My Department is leading consultations with business and industry to learn about the specific impacts of higher energy costs on Irish businesses, and to hear their concerns and perspectives on the appropriate and most effective tools for policy action.<\/p><p>The European Commission recently launched its Temporary State Aid Crisis Framework for businesses affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This opens the way for Member States to consider what specific instruments might be needed in the near-term in order to help vulnerable but viable businesses to overcome the acute impacts of the current crisis in particular with liquidity, and to gear up for meeting their longer-term investment and transition requirements. As part of the Framework, low-cost loans and grants may be made available in order to meet liquidity needs and facilitate the necessary investment.<\/p><p>In terms of short-term temporary supports, there are already a number of effective schemes in place resulting from Government&rsquo;s response to the Brexit and Covid-19 crises, and the Government will consider whether, and to what degree, such schemes might be pivoted to firms impacted by the Ukraine crisis in particular. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700064#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700064#WRC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[18627\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700064#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"his views on delivering a living wage, calculated through the Living Wage Technical Group&rsquo;s minimum essential standard of living formula, as a way to help workers in the face of the cost-of-living crisis.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":155,"content":"<p>I have acknowledged the pressures people are feeling as the rate of inflation and the cost of living increases.

Pumping more money into the economy could lead to further inflation. <\/p>  <p>  That being said, I have been clear in my commitment to improving pay and terms and conditions for everyone, but particularly for those on low pay. <\/p>  <p>  Last year I asked the Low Pay Commission to examine and make recommendations on the best approach to achieving the Programme for Government commitment to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues examined by the Low Pay Commission, and the research team commissioned by them to produce a technical research report on the progression to a living wage, was how a living wage should be calculated. The Commission considered whether the Minimum Essential Standard of Living or fixed threshold approach should be recommended. As part of its deliberations, the Low Pay Commission met with a number of stakeholders in this area, including the Living Wage Technical Group. <\/p>  <p>  Last week I received the Commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations on the progression to a living wage. Along with my officials, I will review the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations and consider next steps.<\/p>  <p>  While the living wage initiative is being considered, the Government will continue to be guided by the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission with regard to any future changes in the minimum wage. The Low Pay Commission is required to submit its annual recommendation on the National Minimum Wage to me on or before the third Tuesday in July. <\/p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission in 2015, the national minimum wage has increased from &euro;8.65 per hour to &euro;10.50 per hour between 2016 and 2022, a 21.4% increase. This compares with an increase in consumer prices of 7% in the 6 years to December 2021. The Minimum Wage has increased substantially in real terms over recent years. <\/p>  <p>  The share of workers on the minimum wage in Ireland has also fallen consistently since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission.

In addition, the establishing legislation requires the Low Pay Commission to give consideration to a range of issues when arriving at a recommendation for the appropriate National Minimum Wage rate. These issues include the cost of living, competitiveness and the likely effect that any proposed recommendation will have on future levels of employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700064#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Development","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700064#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[18797\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700064#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the position regarding the appointment of a regional director of the IDA in the south east given that the position has been vacant since December 2021 and the importance of regional business development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>The appointment of a Regional Manager for the South-East Region is an operational matter for IDA Ireland, though I understand the recruitment process for the position of IDA Regional Manager for the South East Region is currently underway. <\/p><p>I am also informed that the IDA Team in the South-East Region is, on a temporary basis, reporting to the Department Manager- Regional Development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700064#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700064#WRC03800"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[18760\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700064#WRC03900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which priority continues to be given to various enterprises affected by Covid-19 crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":161,"content":"<p>The Government has worked to support businesses through these challenging times with a wide range of measures for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, business continuity and trading online grants, Restart Grants, COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme, commercial rates waivers and warehousing of tax liabilities. <\/p><p>The breadth and variety of COVID-19 related schemes to support all kinds of businesses, but particularly small and medium enterprise, through the pandemic has been unprecedented, and their design and delivery has very much been a priority for the government. <\/p><p>Details of such assistance can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website.

Should a group of employees and employers wish to establish JLCs for any sector for the purposes of engaging in collective bargaining, I trust the Labour Court will consider the matter and, where appropriate, issue establishment orders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700065#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700065#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[18780\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700065#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the rationale for including only three statutory sick leave days in the Sick Leave Bill 2022 including lobbying by employers in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to introducing a statutory sick pay scheme and as such the Sick Leave Bill is being prioritised.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is an outlier among advanced European economies in not providing for any statutory employer paid sick leave. It is simply not right that people who are sick are often afraid to take time off for fear of a major reduction in their income and it's not good when it comes to public health. There's a risk of them infecting co-workers and customers as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is intended to provide a level of protection to low paid employees, who may have no company sick pay schemes and cannot afford to miss work. However, in developing the Bill, I was very mindful of the unique economic challenges faced by employers due to Covid-19 and Brexit related impacts. Imposing excessive new costs on businesses at this time could jeopardise jobs. As a starting point, this law will cover the three waiting days before eligibility for State Illness Benefit. This Bill will ensure that all employees are better off and will have financial protection from day one of a medically certified absence. <\/p>  <p>  I have given a lot of consideration to the pressures on business at the current time, and the design parameters and the incremental approach to be taken are in recognition of this.  Employers will have time to adjust to the associated costs.

I know these costs are increasing rapidly and that those on lower incomes are being disproportionately affected. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the minimum wage, since its establishment in 2015, the Low Pay Commission has been responsible for making annual recommendations to Government on the appropriate rate of the National Minimum Wage. <\/p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, the national minimum wage has increased from &euro;8.65 per hour to &euro;10.50 per hour between 2016 and 2022, a 21.4% increase. This compares with an increase in consumer prices of 7% in the 6 years to December 2021. The Minimum Wage has increased substantially in real terms over recent years. <\/p>  <p>  The share of workers on the minimum wage in Ireland has also fallen consistently since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission. The share of workers on the minimum wage or less as a percentage of the total labour force has reduced from 9.3% in Q4, 2016 to 6.8% in Q4, 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission is made up of an equal number of employer representatives, employee representatives, and independent members which helps to provide a balanced view when determining an appropriate rate for the National Minimum Wage. In addition, the establishing legislation requires the Low Pay Commission to give consideration to a range of issues when arriving at a recommendation for the appropriate National Minimum Wage rate. These issues include the cost of living, competitiveness and the likely effect that any proposed recommendation will have on future levels of employment.<\/p>  <p>  When considering increases in the National Minimum Wage during a period of inflation Government must be is conscious of the need to avoid second round effects. Pumping more money into the economy could lead to further inflation. <\/p>  <p>  That being said, I have been clear in my commitment to improving pay and terms and conditions for everyone, but particularly for those on low pay. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to progressing to a living wage over the lifetime of this Government. In doing so, we need to recognise that many businesses have been badly affected by the pandemic and are also facing rising costs. We need to make sure that we proceed in a way that does not adversely affect inflation or cause jobs to be lost, either in terms of the numbers of people employed, or the numbers of hours worked.  To do so would be counterproductive.<\/p>  <p>  While the living wage initiative is being considered, the Government will continue to be guided by the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission with regard to any future changes in the minimum wage. The Low Pay Commission is required to submit its annual recommendation on the National Minimum Wage to me on or before the third Tuesday in July. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700065#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Promotion","counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700065#WRD01800"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[18730\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700065#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the work that he is undertaking to promote new and existing trading links;

The\u00a0NBP\u00a0will provide a\u00a0high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in over 554,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with some 679 schools. The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. <\/p><p>A number of commercial operators have also announced further investment plans in high-speed broadband. Eir has said it will roll out fibre to\u00a01.9 million premises by the end of 2026, while SIRO has announced a &euro;620 million upgrade and expansion of its fibre to the home network to reach 770,000 homes and\u00a0business. Virgin Media has announced a\u00a0&euro;200 million investment to upgrade its\u00a0network for 1 million premises over the next three years.

We need to take into account the final report by ACER before considering any new measures in the wholesale electricity market design to\u00a0avoid the\u00a0risk of unanticipated or unintended consequences.<\/p>  <p>  The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Improving our energy efficiency, cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and generating power from our own renewable sources will ensure a cleaner, cheaper energy future in the long term. Electricity and gas retail markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700067#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Prices","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700067#WRF02000"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[18857\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700067#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the further steps that are being considered to mitigate energy price increases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":319,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Quality","counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700067#WRF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[18661\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700067#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the proposed establishment of dedicated resources within regional lead authorities to provide co-ordination, expertise and advice to support consistent enforcement of the new air quality regulations across the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[18788\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700067#WRF02500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the details of the additional funding and resources that he has allocated to enable local authorities to increase the enforcement and inspections of cross-Border fuel movements in respect of the implementation of the provisions of the new enhanced solid fuel regulations within their functional areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 142 together. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Local Government Management Agency are continuing to work together on a full assessment of the Local Authority air quality enforcement sector to scope out the resource requirements that will ensure that the most appropriate and effective enforcement structure is put in place with a view to supporting the provision of enhanced co-ordination, expertise and advice that will deliver consistent implementation of air quality legislation across the country. <\/p>  <p>  I have secured initial funding of &euro;1.2 million this year for the provision of additional supports in this regard, and while work is on-going to develop an enhanced co-ordinated approach, my Department continues to engage with enforcement personnel to develop guidance and training, and to support the sharing of best practice in advance of the introduction of new enhanced Solid Fuel Regulations next September. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700067#WRF02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700067#WRF02700"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[18845\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700067#WRF02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the position regarding maritime area consent applications; the timeline for when they will begin to be issued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 commits to the achievement of at least 5GW of offshore wind by 2030 and includes a suite of actions to realise the full potential of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore renewable energy resources.

The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is high international gas prices where we are a price taker. In Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have risen and remained high since the second half of 2020. Gas prices are now at\u00a0historically high\u00a0levels.\u00a0The increase in international wholesale gas prices, have continued to be driven\u00a0 by the volatility in the international gas market linked to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the on-going war. These gas increases feed directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.<\/p><p>  Government&rsquo;s\u00a0response to the current surge in international gas prices has been to utilise the tax and social welfare system in Budget 22 to counter rising costs of living for households. Additionally, and in recognition of the ongoing inflationary pressures on households, the\u00a0Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Act\u00a02022\u00a0provides for a credit payment to each domestic electricity account amounting to &euro;200 (including VAT). Approximately 2.1 million account holders will benefit from the payment in the coming weeks. This was one of a range of new measures as part of a &euro;505m package of measures to mitigate the wider cost of living increases announced by Government on the 10th February.<\/p><p>  The conflict in Ukraine has led to sharp increases on international oil markets from late February onwards.

The plan outlined renewed supports to help businesses deal with the direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as outlining the Government&rsquo;s medium- term approach to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery and crucially to ensure that these jobs are more productive, innovative, resilient and in new areas of opportunity.  <\/p>  <p>  The Plan is about the sustainable rebuilding and renewal of our economy, across four pillars: helping people back into work with supports, intense activation and accelerated reskilling and upskilling opportunities, through Pathways to Work 2021-2025, which includes provisions to invest in and increase the number of training and education opportunities to assist people without jobs and those in employment to retrain and reskill;  re-building sustainable enterprises by future-proofing enterprise to be more resilient, innovative, and productive;  a balanced and inclusive recovery through strategic investment in infrastructure and reforms that enhance our long-term capacity for sustainable growth, balanced regional development and by improving living standards; and ensuring sustainable public finances.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan is underpinned by a range of investment supports including funding to support the extended labour market and enterprise supports as well as the multi-billion strategic investment through the National Development Plan (NDP), which sets out a total public investment of &euro;165 billion over the period 2021-2030. <\/p>  <p>  Projects funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) are integrated into the Economic Recovery Plan, and reinforce the Government&rsquo;s approach, which is focussed on supporting recovery and job creation, advancing the green transition, and accelerating and expanding digital reforms and transformation.

As well as committing to a package of supports and investments to assist enterprise recovery, the Plan outlines a medium-term policy framework to rebuild sustainable enterprises, encourage job creation and sustainable and balanced post pandemic growth.<\/p>  <p>  The ERP set a target to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by having 2.5 million people in work by 2024 and in more productive and resilient jobs. This target has already been exceeded, according to figures released by the CSO&rsquo;s Labour Force Survey in February of this year, indicating the strength of Ireland&rsquo;s recovery and the improvement in the labour market in Ireland. The employment rate for those aged 15-64 has rebounded from the pandemic to 73.0% in Q4 2021 compared to 67.0% in Q4 2020 and has exceeded the employment rate of 70.1% in Q4 2019. Similarly, the unemployment rate fell over the course of 2021 as the economy recovered. It is now approaching the pre-pandemic rate of 4.5% as the recovery continues. <\/p>  <p>  Projects funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) are integrated into the Economic Recovery Plan, and reinforce the Government&rsquo;s approach, which is focussed on supporting recovery and job creation, advancing the green transition, and accelerating and expanding digital reforms and transformation. The initial allocation under the NRRP is &euro;915 million, with a further allocation to be made in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Government has been committed to helping the sectors and workers most impacted and has invested heavily in order to stabilise the labour market. Schemes such as the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) compare very well internationally and have been extended well beyond their original end dates. Since its introduction, the EWSS, an economy-wide support for enterprise, has made &euro;6.7bn in payments to support over 50,000 employers and nearly three quarters of a million employees. Under the CRSS &euro;727m was paid to 25,700 to businesses impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. As of the beginning of February 2022, over &euro;9.1 billion has been paid out through the PUP. <\/p>  <p>  The latest iteration of the national employment strategy &ndash; Pathways to Work 2021-2025 &ndash; will help unemployed people get back into employment through intense activation, upskilling and reskilling opportunities, and engaging with employers. It will have an overall target of over 100,000 additional caseloads per year, by expanding the caseload capacity of the Public Employment Service, reducing the risk of labour market scarring and long-term unemployment. There will be a particular focus on youth unemployment and working intensively with young people at greater risk of long-term unemployment, in recognition of the disproportionate effect of the pandemic on young people.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the work already underway, the Government is looking to prepare for the economy of the future. On 1 March 2022, Cabinet agreed to the development of a White Paper on Enterprise Policy in 2022, led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

Despite the global upheaval of the last few years, IDA Ireland continues to successfully attract inward investment to Ireland. Last year, IDA won 249 investments, 104 of which were from new companies. The number of people employed in multi-national companies grew to 275,384, including 29,000 new jobs created in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  While the competition may be stiff, what we offer companies looking to expand or establish new operations is world-class. To would-be investors, Ireland offers a stable macroeconomic environment; consistent pro-enterprise policies; high-quality education and skills development; an excellent track-record on ease of doing business and openness to trade; a stable, safe, and attractive living and working environment; availability of property; a competitive corporate tax regime; and an unwavering commitment to the European Union with access to the Single Market. Taken together, these factors all combine to mark Ireland as a stable and reliable location for investment. <\/p>  <p>  Investors&rsquo; confidence in Ireland remains strong. In 2020 and 2021, Ireland increased its market share of FDI into Europe in the face of global declines in FDI. Though competition is intense and global with countries around the world actively vying for new FDI investments, IDA Ireland have tailored their approach to reflect this increased competition. IDA targets certain sectors and continuously refines its offering to ensure that Ireland offers the most competitive, innovative, and relevant elements that targeted investments seek. This focus on the sectors that underpin a modern economy has been key to our success.<\/p>  <p>  Supported by my Department, IDA Ireland continues to engage with international clients from a range of sectors and will continue to attract job-rich investment from overseas firms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700070#WRJ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700070#WRJ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[19111\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700070#WRJ02200","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which Brexit continues to have a negative or positive effect in this jurisdiction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":467,"content":"<p>Since the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) came into effect in January last year, businesses have felt the realities of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU. In large measure, Brexit was not the calamitous event that we all feared. Businesses have navigated their way steadily through the new trading relationship which includes increased administrative burdens and non-tariff barriers. It is a tribute to the determination and resilience of the business community that so many have made it through these unchartered waters, adapting their business models and supply chains, allowing them to continue to trade and support the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, our export-led trading sector has proven to be very resilient. 2021 was a record-breaking year for Irish goods exports &ndash; rising to &euro;165 billion, the highest level on record, and over &euro;3bn higher than previous year.  While last year imports from Great Britain declined, our exports to Great Britain performed very strongly - up over &euro;2billion.  The introduction of further checks and controls for trade to Great Britain can be expected to have an impact in due course on these exports as the UK only postponed these checks and controls to allow technical discussions on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland to continue on finding durable and realistic solutions.  I have no doubt that Irish businesses can prove their resilience once again and my Department, and colleagues across all Government Departments, will continue to help companies diversify and discover new markets and reap the benefits of free trade agreements and work with them to adapt to new realities, both in relation to Brexit but also COVID.<\/p>  <p>  We have also seen a significant pick-up in trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It is clear that some readjusting of supply chains is taking place, to be expected in the context of Brexit. As an open, trading economy, the continued growth of our export businesses and diversification in our trading partners is an important driver for jobs and growth - both in Ireland and with our trading partners.<\/p>  <p>  While recognising the importance of our current markets, our focus is on deepening our reach into these markets while also opening up new trade markets between Ireland and the rest of the world. My department is working intensively with its enterprise agencies to help companies to diversify and discover new markets and to adapt to export challenges posed by both COVID-19 and Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to foreign direct investment, IDA has approved over 100 Brexit related investments since the Brexit referendum in 2016 with an associated job creation potential of over 6,500.  IDA&rsquo;s 2021-24 strategy, Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth, positions the Agency to leverage FDI opportunities arising from Brexit. The Agency seeks to capitalise on the expansion potential from new-name Brexit investments secured since 2016 as these companies build out their Irish operations.<\/p>  <p>  Financial Services continues to account for approximately two-thirds of the investments approved by IDA to date, driven by the end of passporting from the UK across the EU, in addition to Ireland&rsquo;s existing strengths as a location for financial services firms. The December 2021 EY Brexit Tracker continued to show Dublin as the top destination for Brexit related investments from financial services firms, based on projects; Dublin ranks third, based on jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the UK is no longer part of the EU Single Market or Customs Union, inevitably our trade with our nearest neighbour, and biggest trading partner, is not now as frictionless as it had been before. The TCA outlines the conditions under which UK goods can benefit from the zero-tariff rate when imported into Ireland or elsewhere in the Union. The conditions stipulate those technical issues such as preferential &ldquo;Rules of Origin&rdquo; now need to be considered.  It has brought new challenges for products that incorporate an all-island approach to its production.<\/p>  <p>  The UK postponed import checks on goods from Ireland due to come into effect from 1 January 2022. For this reason, the full impact of our new trading relationship with the UK has not truly been felt yet as full customs controls are not yet in place. This temporary reprieve for goods from Ireland allows for the ongoing technical discussions between the EU and the UK on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. These discussions continue and are focused on finding durable and realistic solutions under the Protocol to difficulties that present for businesses and citizens in Northern Ireland. The further introduction of checks and controls for trade with Great Britain can be expected to have an impact in due course on our exports but I have no doubt that Irish businesses can prove their resilience once again and my department, and colleagues across all Government Departments, will continue to help companies diversify and discover new markets and reap the benefits of free trade agreements and work with them to adapt to new realities, both in relation to Brexit but also COVID.<\/p>  <p>  Businesses were actively assisted in their Brexit preparedness by Government in terms of advance Brexit contingency planning, involving a range of State Agencies and Bodies, providing a broad range of support for businesses and traders throughout. Government continues to stand ready to assist with these and other challenges associated with Brexit with the continued availability of supports as businesses continue to adapt to post-Brexit realities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700070#WRJ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":468,"content":"<p>Question No. 178 answered with Question No. 176.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flexible Work Practices","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700070#WRJ02500"},{"type":"question","counter":470,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[19137\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700070#WRJ02600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if his Department plans to introduce further legislation in addition to proposed legislation allowing for a right to request remote working allowing for a legal right to work remotely to avoid situations in which employers can simply dismiss requests from employees; the additional steps his Department is taking to create more flexible work options for workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":471,"content":"<p>The Government knows that many workers place huge social value on workplace flexibility, and remote working plays a central role in enabling that increased flexibility to support a better work\/life balance.

In particular the Local Enterprise Offices offer Feasibility Grants, which help start-up companies or individual entrepreneurs with the cost of researching their proposed business or new business idea to see if it could be viable and sustainable, and Priming Grants, which aim to help with the associated costs of start-up. However, it should be noted that the Local Enterprise Offices do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services or local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. <\/p>  <p>  The above supports along with a host of others can also be found on the supportingsmes.gov.ie website.

Whether it is starting a business or growing a business there is something suitable for anyone exploring self-employment as an option.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, I would encourage any person starting a business to enquire about the Start Your Own Business Programme.

The Strategy is a whole-of-Government strategy to address the growing threat of cyber security incidents, to ensure Ireland can benefit fully from the digital transformation. The Strategy includes 20 separate measures to safeguard public sector networks and essential services, to support the development of Ireland's cyber security industry, and to ensure we play our part in defending a free, open, secure and stable cyberspace. Over the coming year, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) will continue to work with Government departments, critical national infrastructure, and other relevant stakeholders to implement these measures in line with the timelines set out in the Strategy. Progress on delivery is monitored by an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) which meets quarterly.   As part of the implementation of the Strategy, in 2021 external consultants were commissioned to conduct a Capacity Review and to benchmark the NCSC with similar agencies in Europe and internationally. On foot of the Review, in July the Government agreed a number of measures to support the continued development of the NCSC over the coming five years. The measures agreed include increasing the overall fulltime staffing complement of the NCSC to at least 70 over the next 5 years, with a first tranche of an additional 20 staff recruited by the end of the year bringing the serving complement to 45. A dedicated HQ facility will also be developed at my Department&rsquo;s future HQ in Dublin 4. In addition, the General Scheme of a Bill will be prepared for Government approval to establish the NCSC on a statutory basis and provide for related matters including clarity around its mandate. A set of priority actions have been identified for 2022 and progress will be monitored by the IDC on the National Cyber Security Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also identified the need to implement new measures to enhance the security of digital communications networks such as 5G networks. Following a public consultation on a set of Electronic Security Control Measures (ECSMs) earlier this year, legislation is being drafted to establish a legal framework for these vital controls. In addition, my Department is engaging with partners across Government to draft legislation to address the challenge of High Risk Vendors supplying 5G technology which I expect to be published later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the priority which the EU and its institutions affords to cyber security, Ireland will continue to play an active role in European Council discussions on EU cyber security strategy and legislation. The ongoing review of the Network and Information Security Directive is a major pillar of the EU&rsquo;s cyber security strategy and will have far-reaching implications for public bodies, essential infrastructure, and businesses, including digital service providers. My Department will continue to coordinate Irish policy positions on this and other matters including the Joint Cyber Unit initiative and the European Commission&rsquo;s forthcoming proposal for a Cyber Resilience Act. My officials will also continue to engage and share information with counterparts across the EU through the NIS Cooperation Group, the CSIRTs Network, and the CyCLONe Network.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, building on the success of recent campaigns, the NCSC will roll out a public awareness programme in October to coincide with European Cyber Security Month. The NCSC will work with the EU cybersecurity agency ENISA, partner organisations across the Union, as well as national partners including the Garda Cyber Crime Bureau to deliver an impactful and informative campaign to raise awareness of cyber security in businesses, educational institutions and at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700071#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1479"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700071#WRK02600"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[19075\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700071#WRK02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 171 and 173 of 10 March 2022, when the Inter-Departmental Group Report on the Post Office Network will be submitted to Government for decisions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":533,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to a sustainable An Post and post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure throughout Ireland and is committed to ensuring that An Post continues to play a strong role in delivering services to citizens.

The Act commits Ireland to achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050, and reduce\u00a0greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030 compared to 2018 levels.<\/p>  <p>  The significantly strengthened legally binding framework under the Act with clear targets and commitments set in law, including a process\u00a0for\u00a0setting\u00a0carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings, will help ensure that Ireland achieves its climate goals and obligations. Establishing these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this and future governments for sustained climate action. In order to deliver on this ambition, the Government published the Climate Action Plan 2021\u00a0last November. It\u00a0identifies\u00a0actions necessary to achieve our emissions reductions targets. The Plan sets out indicative ranges of emissions reductions for each sector of the economy based on their respective starting points, and the relative difficulty, cost, speed, and benefits, of reducing emissions. All sectors will reduce emissions by an ambitious and achievable percentage, each playing a vital role in meeting our targets.<\/p>  <p>  The 2021\u00a0Plan builds on the significant progress made since the 2019 Plan, in particular in the areas of climate governance, renewable electricity,\u00a0just transition, the development of a National Residential Retrofit Plan and the increasing levels of bio-fuels in the transport sector. The National Development Plan has allocated significantly increased funding to climate action, including public transport and retrofitting.Failure to rapidly decarbonise our economic model will have far reaching negative impacts on the economy and the public finances; undermine the long-term, sustainable competitiveness of the economy; and lock Ireland into a redundant fossil-fuel based economic model.

The National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) under a contract to roll out a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in the over 554,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with some 679 schools.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by NBI that as of 31 March 2022, over 312,000 premises have now been surveyed and over 169,000 premises are under construction or complete across 26 counties. I am further advised that almost 60,000 premises are now available to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 22 counties, with over 41,000 premises passed across 19 counties and available for immediate connection. In addition to the premises completed, build is underway on over 128,000 premises, demonstrating the project is reaching scale. <\/p>  <p>  In County Cork surveying is underway in the Deployment Area of Clonakilty, surveying is complete in the Deployment Areas of Templemartin, Tallow, Kanturk and Fermoy, main works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Midleton and Youghal and network build is complete in the Deployment Area of Carrigaline.\u00a0 To date over 39,100 premises in County Cork have been surveyed, with over 16,360 premises under construction or constructed and over 6,700 premises now available to order or pre-order. With regard to the areas referred to in the Questions, Beara Peninsula is in the Lauragh Deployment Area and NBI has advised that surveys will be completed in the area in May 2022. Sheep&rsquo;s Head Peninsula is in the Kilcrohane Deployment Area and NBI has advised that survey is due to commence in the area in H1 2023. Kinsale is in the Kinsale Deployment Area, and NBI has advised that survey is due to commence there in H2 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 31 March, 550 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cork 23 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed to date.\u00a0 The site at Riverstick Community Centre is now installed by NBI which is located 15km from Kinsale. Further details can be found at www.nbi.ie\/bcp-locations\/. <\/p>  <p>  In County Cork 40 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area.

The policy primarily focuses on measures to promote and facilitate active travel and public transport for all and, in doing so, encourage less private car journeys nationally to support our climate commitment.  <\/p>  <p>  The targets of the policy are aligned with the transport target metrics in the Climate Action Plan 2021 of 500,000 additional daily active travel and public transport journeys and a 10% reduction in kilometres driven by fossil fuelled cars by 2030.  <\/p>  <p>  A collaborative approach has been taken by my Department in developing the Sustainable Mobility Policy through public consultation and extensive stakeholder engagement.  The policy includes a comprehensive set of actions to be completed by 2025 to increase walking and cycling infrastructure provision and improve public transport capacity and services across the country.  These will be supported by behavioural change and demand management measures to make sustainable modes the preferred choice for as many people as possible.  A further action plan will then be developed to cover the remaining period of the policy out to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  The new policy is underpinned by capital funding under the National Development Plan which provides &euro;35 billion for transport over the next decade.  As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for Government has committed to Exchequer spending of approximately &euro;360 million per annum on walking and cycling over the lifetime of the Government.

Under the scheme, businesses can temporarily &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain tax debts on an interest free basis until the end of this year (or until 30 April 2023 for businesses most impacted by the most recent public health restrictions and are eligible for certain Covid-19 support schemes).<\/p><p>The scheme is automatically available to businesses and individuals that are managed by Revenue&rsquo;s Business and Personal Divisions.  Revenue&rsquo;s Business Division manages enterprises with an annual turnover less than &euro;3 million, which accounts for the majority of business taxpayers.  Revenue&rsquo;s Personal Division deals with all business entities with no trade or professional income such as trusts, charities, sporting bodies.<\/p><p>The scheme is available by agreement to larger businesses managed by Revenue&rsquo;s Large Corporates and Medium Enterprises Divisions, where such businesses were adversely impacted by COVID-19.  Revenue&rsquo;s Medium Enterprises Division deals with businesses with an annual Irish turnover of more than &euro;3 million (but less than &euro;190 million) as well as the subsidiaries\/parents of such companies.  Large Corporates Division deals with the largest companies with an annual Irish turnover of more than &euro;190 million per annum.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the total debt eligible for the Debt Warehousing Scheme since its introduction is &euro;30.9 billion, and 250,000 businesses were eligible to avail of the scheme.  However, 90% of that debt has been paid, with the balance of just over &euro;3 billion warehoused at the end of February 2022 in respect of almost 97,000 businesses.  This warehoused debt breaks down by Revenue Division as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Division<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>Total (&euro;m)<\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Business<\/td>       <td>1,625<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Medium Enterprises<\/td>       <td>1,005<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Large Corporates<\/td>       <td>392<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Personal<\/td>       <td>26<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Large Cases &ndash; High Wealth Individuals<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total <\/td>       <td>3,053<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that towards the end of this year, it will engage with all businesses availing of the scheme to agree suitable phased payment arrangements in respect of the &lsquo;parked&rsquo; debt. The payment arrangements will be flexible and tailored to take account of the financial circumstances of each business concerned.  Provided that in the intervening period tax returns are filed and current taxes paid as they fall due, and therefore a business continues to be able to avail of the Debt Warehousing Scheme, a reduced interest rate of 3% will apply to a payment arrangement.<\/p><p>I am advised that Revenue has not estimated the potential amount of warehoused debt that will not be paid as the expectation is that flexible payment arrangements will assist businesses in meeting their obligations over time and any payment difficulties will only become apparent in the context of the aforementioned engagement between each business and Revenue.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department makes certain assumptions and projections in preparing the annual Budget and in that regard, Budget 2022 projections made by my Department incorporated the prudent assumption that 25 per cent of the warehoused tax liabilities are not repaid, i.e., that 25 per cent of the businesses that have availed of the scheme will never be in a position to repay. This is a conservative technical assumption but it is considered better to err on the side of caution in this matter.  <\/p><p>The volume of money warehoused under the tax debt warehousing scheme by sector, at the end of February 2022, is as follows:  <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Sectors <\/div><\/th>       <th><div>(&euro;m)<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>%<\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Agriculture, forestry and fishing<\/td>       <td>28<\/td>       <td>1%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Manufacturing<\/td>       <td>191<\/td>       <td>6%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Construction<\/td>       <td>368<\/td>       <td>12%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wholesale and retail trade; Repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles<\/td>       <td>688<\/td>       <td>23%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Transportation and Storage<\/td>       <td>207<\/td>       <td>7%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Accommodation and food service activities<\/td>       <td>431<\/td>       <td>14%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Information and Communication<\/td>       <td>200<\/td>       <td>7%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Financial and Insurance Activities<\/td>       <td>61<\/td>       <td>2%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Real estate activities<\/td>       <td>70<\/td>       <td>2%<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Revenue recently published updated statistics on the Debt Warehousing Scheme and this report as well as further information on the Scheme is available on the Revenue website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700073#WRM03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":635,"content":"<p>Question No. 239 answered with Question No. 238.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":636,"content":"<p>Question No. 240 answered with Question No. 238.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":637,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700073#WRM03300"},{"type":"question","counter":638,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[19009\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700073#WRM03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost of reducing the non-carbon component on mineral oil tax on gas oil regarding motor fuel for agricultural, horticultural or piscicultural works and in forestry to 0% until the end of August 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":639,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to identify the volume of Marked Gas Oil (MGO) consumption in specific sectors of the economy.

Included in this publication are long-term simulations of the impact of age-related expenditure on the deficit and debt ratios under a hypothetical, no-policy change scenario. This exercise assumes non-age related expenditure as a share of GNI* remains unchanged, while total revenue is assumed to move in line with nominal GDP\/GNI*. As such, these simulations are not forecasts of the expected trajectory of the general government balance but instead show the potential impact of demographic change on the public finances in the absence of other policy changes over the coming decades. In addition, the starting point for this exercise began with outturn fiscal data from 2019 and the simulations do not, therefore, capture the significant increase in expenditure related to the support measures implemented by the Irish Government during the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>The results of the simulations, set out below, suggest that under this no-policy change scenario, and holding all other variables constant, age-related expenditure alone could result in a worsening of the general government balance of 3.4 percentage points of GNI* relative to 2019.

My Department is undertaking a review of the potential losses in tax revenues as the economy transitions to less carbon intensive consumption patterns. This analysis will form an integral part of the Department of Finance&rsquo;s wider economic analysis of the effects of the green transition. As part of this ongoing work, the Department published a <i>Review of Green Budgeting from a Tax Perspective<\/i>alongside Budget 2022. The review found that approximately &euro;5.7 billion of carbon-related tax revenues were collected in 2019, representing 9.6 per cent of total tax revenues. For comparative purposes, analysis undertaken by the UK government in the 2021 HMT Net Zero Review indicates that carbon-related tax revenues of &pound;37 billion, or 5.8 per cent of all tax revenues over the period 2019-20, are at risk of declining almost to zero by 2040, as the economy transitions away from carbon-related activity.<\/p><p>The fiscal challenges described above will add significant pressure to the public finances and highlight the importance of rebuilding our fiscal buffers. Last year's Summer Economic Statement set out a medium-term framework for the public finances, with public expenditure ceilings that are fixed for the next few years. Following this strategy will allow for the rebuilding of fiscal buffers while continuing to make significant capital investment, as outlined in the National Development Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700074#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":653,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700074#WRN00800"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[19065\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700074#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of introducing a new 30% rate of income tax by replacing the 40% rate or introducing a 30% rate with its tax rate band ranging from &euro;36,800 to &euro;40,000, &euro;50,000 and &euro;60,000, respectively.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":655,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the estimated first and full year costs to the Exchequer of the Deputy's proposals are set out in the table below.

It consists of a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts, generic template documents and procedures that cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their ongoing procurement requirements.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the policies and practices deployed in the procurement of public works projects commenced in March 2019 and is ongoing. The focus of the review is on improving the delivery of construction projects in terms of quality, timely delivery and cost outcomes. The review will deliver significant changes to the CWMF over the coming years. The review process involves extensive engagement, both with industry stakeholders, and with the public bodies charged with the delivery of public works projects on a broad range of issues such as:<\/p>  <p>  - inflation;<\/p>  <p>  - risk management;<\/p>  <p>  - creating a better quality: price balance in the award of contracts;<\/p>  <p>  - adoption of BIM on public works projects;<\/p>  <p>  - liability, indemnity and insurance requirements;<\/p>  <p>  - performance evaluation; and<\/p>  <p>  - encouraging collaborative working.<\/p>  <p>  A high-level strategy has been developed by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) with the Government Construction Contracts Committee (GCCC) that will guide the implementation and will be addressed primarily through the progressive refinement and enhancement of the CWMF.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 impacted the review in 2020 and 2021 as resources were redeployed to address the contractual and procurement issues that arose during construction lockdown. However, progress is being made on a number of fronts.<\/p>  <p>  - The initial focus is on the engagement of consultancy services, which is aimed at driving better project definition, in order to provide greater certainty for all those engaged in the construction stage.  Overall improvement in project definition is required through establishing minimum standards for information at the different stages of a project&rsquo;s development. Work is ongoing on the detailed implementation aspects of the review of the engagement of consultancy services, which will be delivered by means of changes to the template tender documents, publication of new guidance material and exploring digital solutions.<\/p>  <p>  - A review of the price variation mechanisms used in both the CWMF consultancy and construction contracts is currently underway. Initial research to review the inflation provisions in both the CWMF consultancy and construction contracts has been completed by consultants. Significant increases in construction material costs is affecting live tenders and contracts. Procurement guidance for &lsquo;live&rsquo; tenders was published in November 2021. Interim amendments to the provisions in the public works contracts to address inflation in construction materials were introduced in January 2022. Consultation on broader changes is due to commence with stakeholders in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  - Building Information Modelling (BIM) has the potential to transform the processes surrounding project and data management on construction projects and can drive significant efficiencies. The OGP is currently engaged with National Standards Authority of Ireland on preparing a national annex to the international standard (ISO) for BIM implementation. The aim is to ensure a consistent approach to its application across the public sector. An implementation plan for the adoption of BIM will be published later in 2022 setting out dates for a phased adoption of BIM. A series of masterclasses is ongoing to prepare public bodies for the implementation of BIM. In 2022, external advisers will be engaged to draft contract amendments to incorporate BIM into the CWMF and to prepare template procurement documents for publication.<\/p>  <p>  - The OGP is engaging with key stakeholders on the issue of liability, indemnities and insurance and is reviewing broader aspects of the required terms in the contracts used to engage design teams and contractors. Engagement with the insurance sector and construction industry stakeholders has also taken place on issues relating to cost increases on Professional Indemnity Insurance premiums and the reduction in cover available. Amendments to CWMF documents and additional guidance was published in February 2022.<\/p>  <p>  - Engagement is ongoing in developing standard metrics for life cycle costing and life cycle analysis that can be applied to the evaluation of projects&rsquo; cost of use in service and full life cycle analysis, including the carbon impact of individual projects. The OGP is liaising with the GCCC and the Irish Green Building Council in developing these metrics.  <\/p>  <p>  - The Cost Control Templates published under the CWMF are undergoing review to incorporate the International Construction Measurement Standard (ICMS). A working group has been established and revised templates will be published in 2022. ICMS is a global standard for benchmarking and reporting of construction project cost and covers both capital and whole life costing while providing a way of presenting costs in a consistent format.<\/p>  <p>  - A review into the performance of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provisions that were introduced in 2016 has also taken place in 2021. A final report on the review is being prepared by consultants, which will form the basis of a position paper in 2022 on ADR provisions in the public works contracts.<\/p>  <p>  Together these reform processes will lead to meaningful policy change and will assist in delivering better value for money for the taxpayer in the implementation of Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700074#WRN02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":671,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700074#WRN02600"},{"type":"question","counter":672,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[18995\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700074#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding a feasibility study (details supplied) which was carried out by the Office of Public Works; if it has been finalised; the outcome of the cost-benefit analysis that was carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":673,"content":"<p>Local flooding and coastal erosion issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address.

In 2020 we saw a fall in prices as a result of the pandemic.  As we emerge from the pandemic and the economy recovers we are faced with a new set of challenges including rising energy prices and transitory supply issues which are causing prices to increase, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the challenge that households face at the moment with rising energy costs, in particular those on low incomes, Government announced on 10 February a package of measures, bringing to over &euro;500 million the measures introduced post Budget day, targeted at mitigating the impact of cost of living pressures. This package included:<\/p>  <p>  - An increase in the energy credit to &euro;200 including VAT, estimated to impact just over 2 million households;<\/p>  <p>  - A lump sum payment of &euro;125 to be paid in March to fuel allowance recipients;<\/p>  <p>  - To reduce the burden on people returning to the workplace and other people using public transport, there will be a temporary reduction in fares of 20% on PSO public transport services from early May to the end of the year. This will impact approximately 800,000 daily users;<\/p>  <p>  - The Drug Payment Scheme threshold will be further reduced to &euro;80 per month, having been reduced to &euro;100 per month in Budget 2022. This will benefit just over 70,000 recipients;<\/p>  <p>  - The increase in the threshold for the working family payment announced on Budget Day will be brought forward from June to April; and<\/p>  <p>  - Reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children for the next academic year.<\/p>  <p>  This package builds on the range of measures introduced in Budget 2022 to help families with affordability issues, including Social Protection measures totalling over half a billion euro, health affordability measures and a funding stream for childcare providers. Budget 2022 also contained an income tax package of just over half a billion.<\/p>  <p>  In March, in light of the continued high fuel prices, an emergency support measure for licensed hauliers provides a payment of &euro;100 per week per heavy goods vehicle in light of the important role played by the sector in ensuring goods are available to families and businesses. The Department of Finance introduced a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil to 31st August at an estimated revenue foregone cost of &euro;320m.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the Cost of Living package was to provide temporary targeted measures to assist households on lower incomes and other families who are facing increased energy bills. This package sought to balance targeting the main underlying problem of higher energy prices with the need to operate with the fiscal framework set out in the Summer Economic Statement. Taken with the Budget 2022 measures and the excise duty cut, Government has committed significant resources to address cost of living issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700074#WRN03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":683,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700074#WRN03800"},{"type":"question","counter":684,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[19195\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700074#WRN03900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the total value of consultancy contracts awarded to an organisation (details supplied) for work with his Department and bodies under the auspices of his Department in each of the years 2017 to 2021, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":685,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department, including the Office of Government Procurement, has not awarded any contracts to the named company during the period specified.

This new regime will be administered in due course by the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA), and by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the coastal local authorities and will be replace the existing consenting regime for maritime development underpinned by the Foreshore act 1933.<\/p>  <p>  My Department currently has responsibility for assessing applications for a foreshore licence under the Foreshore Act 1933 for site investigations within the foreshore area linked to the proposed development of offshore renewable energy projects. The site investigations are critical activities developers undertake in order to investigate viability and prepare environmental impact assessments of potential future offshore renewable energy (ORE) infrastructure. The majority of these applications have been received in the last 12 months which is strong indication of the appetite and commercial interest in the developing ORE sector in Ireland. The Foreshore Section of my Department also assesses foreshore consent applications for a range of other proposed activities and developments relating to ports and harbours, strategic infrastructure projects like water and waste water infrastructure, local authorities&rsquo; infrastructural works such as bridges, marinas, coastal protection works, flood relief works, as well as strategically important telecommunications and interconnector projects. <\/p>  <p>  Each application must be assessed appropriately in accordance with the applicable requirements of domestic and EU law including the EIA Directive, Birds and Habitats Regulations and the Foreshore Act. Over the last eighteen months, my Department has more than doubled the staffing resources available within the Foreshore Section to address this increasing workload. In parallel, the processes underpinning the statutory assessment processes have been refined allowing the various procedures to run in parallel, where appropriate. This should reduce the average time taken to assess an application. In addition, a panel of external specialist environmental consultants is in operation to assist in the technical assessment of applications. Recognising the increasing complexity and volume of applications being received; the importance of expediting the advancement of activities to assist in achieving our Climate Action Plan targets, as well as the competition for what is a limited pool of technical expertise in this area, my Department is exploring how it can further expand the technical expertise available to it to meet these demands. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to foreshore licence applications from ORE related developers, my Department is continuing to prioritise site investigation licence applications linked to a set of seven qualified ORE projects, known as \"relevant projects\" or Phase 1 project, which qualify to make an application to the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications for a Maritime Area Consent (MAC) as part of the transition provisions in the MAP Act 2021. Any project in this category granted a MAC by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications must then apply for the necessary development permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the new marine planning system.<\/p>  <p>  The first phase of offshore wind development in Ireland will be necessary but not sufficient to reach our 2030 5GW ambition. An additional phase is required, comprised of projects which can deliver by 2030. The Minister for Energy, Climate and Communications is currently considering the Phase Two selection process, with a public consultation recently having been held on this matter. Applications for a foreshore licence for site investigations linked to proposed ORE projects outside of the first Phase are currently being processed in my Department on a chronological basis, with a degree of flexibility provided to cater for situations, for example, where a developer has several applications lodged and wishes to progress one ahead of the other for commercial or other reasons. The basis on which these applications are prioritised, and the public interest matters associated with the assessment process, will be revisited when the policy approach to the management of the Phase 2, including matters relating to grid capacity, have been settled.<\/p>  <p>  MACs for the Phase Two projects will be granted by the MARA. The aim is to have MARA established by Q1 2023 and, to facilitate this, a dedicated Unit has been set up within my Department to progress the Implementation Plan to establish this new agency. Extensive preparatory work will be required over the coming months to enable MARA to undertake the wide range of its statutory functions post-establishment. This work includes drafting commencement orders, and preparing a series of regulations and statutory guidelines as well as developing the processes dependent on same. The MAP Act will also introduce the possibility of applying for a licence for marine environmental surveys for the purposes of site investigations in the maritime area, without the requirement for a MAC, upon the commencement of MARA and its consenting functions. While I and Government colleagues are delighted to see the strong interest from developers in seeking to advance offshore wind projects and other strategically important infrastructural projects on the State&rsquo;s foreshore, it is Government&rsquo;s position that the continuing development of the ORE industry and related energy infrastructure must be progressed under a plan-led centralised approach as provided for under the MAP Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700075#WRO03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defective Building Materials","counter":720,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700075#WRO03200"},{"type":"question","counter":721,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[18947\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700075#WRO03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on the progress, if any, made by the working group examining building defects; when the working group is expected to finalise its report; when its recommendations are likely to be brought to Government for consideration; the position of residents in developments where necessary repairs have already been carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":722,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in respect of the important policy area of addressing building defects.

Should the PRA review reveal that no error was made in registration, then a Deed of Rectification or Court Order can be lodged to effect a change to the Land Registry map.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700076#WRP02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defibrillators Provision","counter":760,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700076#WRP02900"},{"type":"question","counter":761,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[19174\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700076#WRP03000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if defibrillators are installed in all offices and buildings accessible by the public in his Department and public bodies and agencies that operate under his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":762,"content":"<p>Defibrillators are installed in all departmental offices and buildings accessible by the public.<\/p><p>The information requested in relation to bodies under the aegis of my Department is a matter for the individual bodies concerned.

It is important to say that there has been a clear message from victims groups throughout this process that this cannot be the way forward.

It would also go against the conclusions of the UK Government&rsquo;s own extensive public consultation in Northern Ireland on legacy legislation in 2019. There would be very serious questions as to whether such an approach would be consistent with the obligations of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is itself a key element of the Good Friday Agreement. We believe it would face well-founded legal challenges, causing further years of uncertainly and pain for families.<\/p>  <p>  We have consistently said that we are ready to engage with concerns or issues to do with the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement but any such changes must be discussed and agreed by the parties and both Governments.

The Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 is a whole of Government strategy, which aims to reduce consistent poverty and improve social inclusion in Ireland, with specific commitments focusing on children and families. The Roadmap recognises the importance of child related services, working in conjunction with income supports, in reducing child poverty.<\/p><p>The most recent data from the 2020 Survey on Income and Living Conditions was published in December 2021.

The Government will continue to focus on measures aimed at reducing the number of children experiencing poverty.  <\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection offers a range of supports to children and families to alleviate poverty.  Recent Budgets have consistently targeted supports on reducing the number of children in poverty and deprivation.  This reflects the Roadmap commitment to continue to target a reduction in poverty among children and families on low incomes as part of the annual budget process.  In line with this approach, Budget 2022 included:<\/p><p>- an increase of &euro;5 per week to all Working Age payments with proportionate increases for qualified adults;<\/p><p>- an increase to the weekly qualified child payment by &euro;2 to &euro;40 for children up to age 12, and by &euro;3 to &euro;48 for children aged over 12;<\/p><p>- an increase of &euro;10 per week in the Working Family Payment thresholds for families of all sizes; and<\/p><p>- an increase of &euro;10 in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) for older and younger children, accompanied by an increase in the weekly income limit for receipt of BSCFA for a one parent household to match that of a two-parent household.<\/p><p>This has occurred alongside Roadmap commitments under the Department&rsquo;s remit to support children and families, such as the extension of Parent&rsquo;s Benefit; the provision of the School Meals programme; and the development and rollout of the Hot School Meals programme.  <\/p><p>The above-mentioned supports are accompanied by a range of measures delivered across Government, including:<\/p><p>- prevention and early intervention initiatives and supports for parents through the work of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, including implementation of the First 5 Strategy;<\/p><p>- the rollout of free GP care to children and the provision of medical cards to families on low incomes under the Department of Health and<\/p><p>- the continuing delivery of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) programme by the Department of Education.<\/p><p>Progress in relation to the implementation of Roadmap commitments over the period January 2020 to September 2021 was published in January.<\/p><p>The social impact assessment of Budget 2022, produced by the Department using the ESRI's tax-benefit model, SWITCH, found that the tax and welfare measures in Budget 2022 most positively impacted non-earning parents (both single and couples), who would be vulnerable to child poverty.  <\/p><p>Official poverty data from the 2021 Survey on Income and Living Conditions is expected to be released by the CSO in April 2022 and will provide a more up-to-date picture of poverty levels, including child poverty, in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700078#WRR04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":859,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700079#WRS00200"},{"type":"question","counter":860,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[18949\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700079#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of Ukrainian households that have entered the State since the start of the war; and the breakdown by household size, for example, no children, one child, two children, three children and four or more children.","asker":"1468","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":861,"content":"<p>To date my Department has allocated 19,545 PPSNs across 16,080 households to people coming into the State under the Temporary Protection Directive since February 24th 2022.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 1,025,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.<\/p><p>It is not possible for my Department to provide an estimate of the cost of extending the free travel scheme to persons who are diagnosed with epilepsy.  The HSE estimates that there are 40,000 people who suffer with epilepsy in Ireland, with between 12-15,000 of this cohort who have breakthrough seizures.  My Department does not retain data on how many epilepsy sufferers are already in receipt of DSP qualifying payments that entitle them to access the free travel pass or are aged 66 or over.  Furthermore, the additional cost to the scheme, should it be extended to all people with epilepsy, would also depend on factors including the type of travel pass issued (e.g., single or companion pass), the number of journeys made using the free travel pass, the prevailing fares, and the type of journeys undertaken, i.e., rail, bus or Luas.<\/p><p>I am aware of an ongoing campaign by Epilepsy Ireland and recognise the issues and difficulties that can arise due to a person being diagnosed with epilepsy.  I have recently met with representatives of Epilepsy Ireland to discuss its proposal in detail.  <\/p><p>Following the meeting I have asked my Department officials to examine the issues raised by Epilepsy Ireland and to explore options to help alleviate these issues.  Further engagement with Epilepsy Ireland will be arranged once this exploratory work has been concluded.<\/p><p>However, it is really important to note that, in general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  Crucially as many illnesses or physical conditions have an impact across a spectrum from mild to severe, entitlement to these schemes is not provided on the basis of a simple diagnosis but on the basis of the impact of that diagnosis on the individual concerned.  In this way resources can be targeted to people with most need.  Therefore, while a diagnosis of a particular medical condition will be required to establish if a person may be eligible for certain social welfare schemes, evidence of impact is also required before entitlement to the scheme or the related free travel scheme is established.  (The sole exception to this general approach is in respect of people who are blind.)<\/p><p>While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.<\/p><p>Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant. The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700079#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":865,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700079#WRS00800"},{"type":"question","counter":866,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[18624\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700079#WRS00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the plans she has to engage with various sectors and employers to accommodate Ukrainian refugees and create job opportunities for them; if she will provide further information on this process; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":867,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing emergency support to meet the immediate needs of those fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as providing employment advice and guidance.<\/p><p>In addition to a support centre established in Dublin Airport, three city centre hubs to support Ukrainian nationals have been established by the Government, in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.

It will operate alongside the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and in addition to the income that services receive from parents' fees.<\/p><p>Core Funding is designed to meet the combined objectives of:<\/p><p>- Improved affordability for parents by ensuring that fees do not increase; <\/p><p>- Improved quality through better pay and conditions for the workforce by supporting agreement on an Employment Regulation Order through the Joint Labour Committee;<\/p><p>- Supporting the employment of graduate staff; and<\/p><p>- Improved sustainability and stability for services.<\/p><p>Core Funding is a new and different way of providing substantial additional funding to the sector.<\/p><p>Extensive information was communicated to the sector on 7<sup>th<\/sup>March, including detail on the way in which Core Funding will be allocated to individual services.  A Ready Reckoner calculator has also been launched to assist providers in estimating the impact of Core Funding for their individual service.<\/p><p>Core Funding will address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022.<\/p><p>Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. It is based on operating hours, number of places offered by services and the age group of children for whom the places are offered, given the staffing requirements determined by the regulatory ratios for different care categories. <\/p><p>Services opening longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher. <\/p><p>ECCE is 15 hours per week over 38 weeks of the year this amounts to 570 hours per year and is equivalent to 23% of the annual hours of a full day service operating from 8am to 6pm for 50 weeks of the year. ECCE ratio requirements are 11 children to one adult. Services offering places for 2-3 year olds can have a maximum of 6 children to one adult.  ECCE therefore has less than half the hourly staffing requirement of a service for 2-3 year olds. Due to the nature of ECCE provision &ndash; 15 hours per week for 38 weeks per year &ndash; even a small Core Funding allocation can take account of increased delivery costs including staffing costs.<\/p><p>In fact, the value of funding offered is weighted in favour of sessional services for 2.5-6 year-olds. ECCE services receive proportionately more than other types of services relative to the staffing requirements of sessional pre-school provision. <\/p><p>Core Funding is equivalent to an increase of <i>at least <\/i>9.5% on the standard capitation for ECCE. At a minimum, for every ECCE child &euro;78.75 per week is now available (compared to &euro;71.90 previously from ECCE standard capitation and programme support payment combined).<\/p><p>Because Core Funding is paid in respect of places rather than children, effectively this often means a greater &lsquo;per child&rsquo; marginal increase if the service has unfilled capacity. With average ECCE occupancy of 9 children, Core Funding is equivalent to weekly per child capitation of &euro;80.92.<\/p><p>Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly.<\/p><p>No service will lose out.  I have issued a funding guarantee to ensure that no service will receive less in Core Funding that it previously received in higher capitation and programme support payments, if their circumstances remain the same.  An estimated 1% of services will be caught by the funding guarantee.  All other services will see increases in funding, and most substantial increases in funding.<\/p><p>The 1% of services for whom the funding guarantee will apply and those who will see just small increases from Core Funding are ECCE-only services in receipt of higher capitation for large groups of children and with high occupancy levels. Such services are currently in receipt of between &euro;110-&euro;120 per hour of service provided, which is the highest levels of public funding relative to the staffing levels required for operating those types of services and significantly in excess of average staffing costs required for this type of service.<\/p><p>I would also like to note that there is a sustainability fund in place where services are experiencing sustainability issues that can be availed of by services.<\/p><p>Core Funding is designed to facilitate a partnership between the State and early learning and childcare services for the public good.  Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a fair income to providers.

The Ready Reckoner is accessible to all and is designed to give an idea of what services can expect to receive based on their characteristics. It also allows different scenarios of provision to be tested. This will show the benefits of applying for Core Funding when it is possible to do so. <\/p><p>Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. Services opening longer hours or offering more places and places for younger children will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher.<\/p><p>Core Funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain staff, including degree qualified staff; establish career structures; introduce or improve other features of provision that are demonstrated to contribute to quality (e.g. non-contact time, planning, training, curriculum implementation). Staff costs comprise approximately 70% of a service's operating costs. Core Funding makes available &euro;138 million of new funding available to contribute to staff costs, which will be in addition to the existing income available to providers through the public funding through ECCE and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and parents' fees.<\/p><p>The precise implications of the funding for staff pay and conditions depends on the agreement of an Employment Regulation Order (ERO) by the Joint Labour Committee (JLC). However, the level of funding provided is significant enough to achieve a substantial improvement in levels of staff pay for the sector as a whole as well as the development of career frameworks. Improved terms and conditions,  opportunities for progression and greater rates of staff retention are important steps to improving quality in the sector.<\/p><p>Core Funding will also make a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (for example, utilities, rent) that make up the remaining 30% of providers costs. In a full year, there is an allocation of &euro;20 million for a contribution to non-staff overhead costs through Core Funding. This is the first time this type of funding has been provided.  <\/p><p>Extra funding to support administration costs is also contained within Core Funding. This means that the budget previously allocated to Programme Support Payments, with an increased allocation, is now incorporated into Core Funding. Core Funding will make &euro;25 million available to providers to support the costs of administrative time.<\/p><p>&euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The graduate premium aspect of Core Funding will encourage employment of graduates as Lead Educators across all ELC, not just in ECCE rooms as was the case with higher capitation payments.<\/p><p>Core Funding is equivalent to an increase of at least 9.5% in funding for ECCE services not lead by a Graduate Lead Educator. At a minimum, for every ECCE child &euro;78.75 per week will be available from ECCE and Core Funding, compared to &euro;69 in ECCE standard capitation only. As Core Funding is paid in respect of places rather than children, effectively this could mean a greater &lsquo;per child&rsquo; marginal increase if the service has unfilled capacity. For example, with an ECCE occupancy of 9 children per staff member, Core Funding and ECCE together will be equivalent to weekly per child capitation of &euro;80.92.<\/p><p>The overwhelming majority of ECCE-services with graduate Lead Educators will benefit substantially.  While the approach of providing funding for graduate Lead Educators is different, the increased base rate funding plus payment based on capacity rather than attendance means that most services currently in receipt of higher capitation will see significant benefits from Core Funding.<\/p><p>Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding.

A new funding model, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery so, for example, greater funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher than older children. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings.

Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS.  It replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022.<\/p><p>Core Funding is a payment to providers designed to meet the combined objectives of:<\/p><p>- Improved quality through, among other things, better pay and conditions for the workforce;<\/p><p>- Supporting the establishment of an Employment Regulation Order through the Joint Labour Committee;<\/p><p>- Supporting the employment of graduate staff;<\/p><p>- Improved affordability for parents by ensuring that fees do not increase; and<\/p><p>- Improved sustainability and stability for services.<\/p><p>On 7th March I announced the rates and values for the Core Funding, and launched the online Ready Reckoner tool. The Ready Reckoner is accessible to all and is designed to give an idea of what services can expect to receive based on their characteristics. It also allows different scenarios of provision to be tested. This will show the benefits of applying for Core Funding when it is possible to do so. <\/p><p>Of the total of &euro;221m in full year costs, &euro;138 million is intended to contribute to staff costs, &euro;25 million is for a contribution to administrative costs and &euro;20 million is allocated to contribute to non staff costs. &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The graduate premium aspect of Core Funding will encourage employment of graduates as Lead Educators across all ELC, not just in ECCE rooms as was the case with higher capitation payments.<\/p><p>The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed based on a service's capacity - opening hours, opening weeks and the age group of children for whom services are provided as well as the number of places offered.  The rationale for this is that these are the primary characteristics that determine the service's costs of delivery. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity will support sustainability and stability for services, since they will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children's attendance.<\/p><p>Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. Services opening longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher.<\/p><p>There have been suggestions that small services and services which only provide the ECCE programme will lose out under Core Funding. This is incorrect. <\/p><p>Core Funding is equivalent to an increase of at least 9.5% on the standard capitation for ECCE. At a minimum, for every ECCE child &euro;78.75 per week is now available (compared to &euro;71.90 previously from ECCE standard capitation and programme support payment combined).<\/p><p>Because Core Funding is paid in respect of places rather than children, effectively this often means a greater &lsquo;per child&rsquo; marginal increase if the service has unfilled capacity. With average ECCE occupancy of 9 children, Core Funding is equivalent to weekly per child capitation of &euro;80.92.<\/p><p>Core Funding will address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision.<\/p><p>Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly.<\/p><p>No service will lose out.  I have issued a funding guarantee to ensure that no service will receive less in Core Funding that it previously received in higher capitation and programme support payments, if their circumstances remain the same.  An estimated 1% of services will be caught by the funding guarantee.  All other services will see increases in funding, and most substantial increases in funding.<\/p><p>The 1% of services for whom the funding guarantee will apply and those who will see just small increases from Core Funding are ECCE-only services in receipt of higher capitation for large groups of children and with high occupancy levels. Such services are currently in receipt of between &euro;110-&euro;120 per hour of service provided, which is the highest levels of public funding relative to the staffing levels required for operating those types of services and significantly in excess of average staffing costs required for this type of service.<\/p><p>I would also like to note that there is a sustainability fund in place where services are experiencing sustainability issues that can be availed of by services.<\/p><p>Core Funding is designed to facilitate a partnership between the State and early learning and childcare services for the public good.  Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a fair income to providers.  I look forward to working together in partnership with the many providers who which to deliver services for the public good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700080#WRT04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":945,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700081#WRU00200"},{"type":"question","counter":946,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[19153\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700081#WRU00300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the payments, benefits and other supports issued by his Department which Ukrainian refugees are entitled to.","asker":"1525","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":947,"content":"<p>My Department is providing accommodation to people fleeing Ukraine where requested.

A National Awareness campaign is underway, and a new website has been launched (www.adultliteracyforlife.ie) which will act as central repository for literacy, numeracy, and digital skills resources with contact points available for services across the country. I secured funding of &euro;3m in Budget 2022 which will enable the establishment of the necessary partnership structures, such as the Adult Literacy for Life National Programme Office and a network of Regional Literacy Coordinators.<\/p><p>Work on the development of the new National Access Plan is at an advanced stage.

The expert group is expected to make five to ten high-level recommendations as to how, in their view, higher education institutions might enhance their equality policies and their implementation to support gender equality. I expect to be in a position to publish this report towards the end of 2022.<\/p><p>In addition to the submission of progress updates, the Governing Authority of each HEI must submit a statement to the HEA confirming that the Institution has an action plan in place and that this action plan is being implemented as part of its Annual Governance Statements.

This represents 8.5% of my Department&rsquo;s voted allocation for 2022. HEIs also fund R&amp;I from their block allocations, but have autonomy in how that funding is applied.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides funding for postgraduate research through both Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the Irish Research Council (IRC). Funding is also provided by other statutory funders and, of course, private funders.  Stipends are typically a feature of such funding globally, providing an income to the awardee in recognition of the need to devote themselves on a full-time basis to their research. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is monitoring the issue of stipends, in the context of the resources available to my Department and the competing needs to which they can be allocated. In this regard, I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding to the IRC in 2021 to enable it to increase postgraduate scholarships by &euro;2,500 per annum, or 16%. This was made effective from 1 January 2021 and, together with an increase to funding for postdoctoral salaries, benefited close to 1,300 early-career researchers in the system. The move also aligned the stipend level for both the IRC and SFI. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been undertaking am examination of the issues in relation to academic support activities of PhD students.

As part of this I am proposing that they undertake a gap analysis to determine the next steps in progressing towards greater consistency and transparency in arrangements for postgraduate researchers, in advance of the next academic year. I have also written to the sector&rsquo;s representative bodies, the IUA and THEA, requesting that they work in close partnership to ensure that the pathways scoped out allow for convergence of approaches across the entire higher education sector.<\/p>  <p>  I will be seeking regular updates on progress with this work at meetings of the National Advisory Forum for Ireland&rsquo;s Framework for Doctoral Education.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically, the Irish Research Council (IRC) does not implement means-testing for Irish Research Council PhD scholarships. Postgraduate scholarships are allocated solely on the basis of the quality of the research proposal as determined by independent international peer review. All successful applicants who meet the terms and conditions of the scheme are awarded a stipend of &euro;18,500 per year, up to a maximum of four years. Students in receipt of a stipend can also apply for SUSI grant support. <\/p>  <p>  The IRC has taken specific measures this year to enhance the support it provides to researchers of any career stage who are parents or carers. The IRC published a new policy in this regard effective 1 November 2021 which gives postgraduate awardees the entitlement to continuity of the stipend for approved periods of leave for purposes of maternity, paternity or the adoption of a child. This policy introduces a new and important level of support for early-career researchers that become parents, including lone parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700081#WRU03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further and Higher Education","counter":980,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700081#WRU03900"},{"type":"question","counter":981,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[18982\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700081#WRU04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if an appeal by a person (details supplied) will be allowed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":982,"content":"<p>The main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme where students are studying for the first time or are progressing to study at a higher level.

Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health.

The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard.

To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT patches has increased by between 77% and 117%, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of this patch in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019.<\/p><p>Regarding the HRT patches, the suppliers have confirmed that they have increased the planned supply of HRT patches to Ireland during 2022 in response to this increased demand. In the case of one brand (Evorel\/Evorel Conti), the supply of HRT patches has resumed. For another brand (Estradot), some strengths are available currently and, based on manufacturing availability, the re-supply of the full range is expected to be in July. With respect to the gels, Divigel was received by the wholesaler on 25th March and has been released for sale this week. An alternative gel product (Oestrogel) has recently gone short and is expected to resume supply in April. In the interim, the company is working to find solutions to the immediate supply issues.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>The current supply situation has arisen due to significant increases in demand for HRT medicines and is not linked to regulatory matters. However, the HPRA continues to review available options within our regulatory remit to facilitate increased supply where at all possible. In particular, the HPRA has advised the companies that we are open to providing accelerated regulatory approval to supply a product originally intended for other markets if available. We are awaiting further information from the companies in this regard.<\/p><p>The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.<\/p><p>The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700083#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":1033,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700083#WRW00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1034,"qnumday":373,"qnumall":"[18939\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040700083#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps his Department is taking to address the current issue of medical card patients unable to obtain a dental appointment since the pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1035,"content":"<p>I have acknowledged immediate issues of concern with the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTTS), which I am addressing as a matter of priority.

Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.<\/p>  <p>  In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact.

There are approximately 8,000 known rare diseases; 80% of rare diseases are of genetic origin and are often chronic and life-threatening.  Up to 1 person in 12 in Ireland may have a rare disease at some stage in their life.  Approximately 300,000 persons in Ireland are living with a rare disease.<\/p><p>Many of the recommendations of the <i>National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014 &ndash; 2018)<\/i>have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) and HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases which has now been  operationalised and incorporated into the NRDO which is the main contact point and driver for National HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. <\/p><p>The National Rare Disease Plan elaborates on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in European Reference Networks (ERN).  ERNs are virtual networks involving healthcare providers across Europe where the networking of knowledge and expertise through reference centres and teams of experts takes place.  These links are emphasized in the Plan to address the care of patients with rare diseases at both National and European levels.  Significant progress has been made with regard to participation in ERNs with Ireland&rsquo;s 15 applications for entry to ERNs recently being approved from 5 academic hospitals. Entry to these networks commenced on 1 January 2022 and represents a significant achievement for the Irish Health Service which will drive innovation, training and clinical research for highly specialised care. It is also a very positive development for individuals and families affected with rare diseases.<\/p><p>In order to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, in 2021 I met with the HSE, NRDO and the Rare Diseases Task force which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland (RDI), the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI). At this meeting priority areas for the future were discussed with a view to building further on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan.

Both Multi Species Swards and Red Clover Silage Measure can save farmers money while maintaining production levels and reducing the farm carbon footprint.
