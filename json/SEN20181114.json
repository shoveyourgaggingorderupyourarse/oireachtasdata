It is a vaccine for chickenpox and is not part of the national childhood immunisation programme at present.  The Minister should make efforts to include it in the national vaccination programme for children.  As I said, it is not part of the immunisation programme, although many parents are paying privately for this vaccine for their children.  It is administered in two doses and is very effective in children under the age of 13.  It can be given from the age of one year.  As I said, many parents are paying for this privately, but this means that children whose parents cannot afford to pay for it privately are being left at risk.<\/p><p>There are many risks associated with chickenpox such as pneumonia, meningitis and, in later life, shingles, all of which can be very dangerous in themselves.  It is part of the vaccination programme in many countries, such as the United States of America.  Since its introduction into the national programme of that country 15 years ago, hospital admissions and deaths due to chickenpox have dropped by 80%.  That is very significant.  There is a reason parents here in Ireland are taking up this vaccination if they can pay for it privately themselves.  It saves an awful lot of upset and discomfort for the children themselves and prevents parents having to take two or three weeks off work when a child has to stay out of childcare.  There are also very serious risks associated with the disease, as I have outlined.<\/p><p>Children who cannot afford this are not getting it and that is not acceptable in this day and age.  I understand that it is an expensive vaccination for children to get, but if it were included in the national vaccination programme, the cost for the State would come down dramatically.  I would also suggest that the costs imposed on other areas of the health service would reduce dramatically in line with it because many parents of young children end up going into accident and emergency departments with their children or attending their GPs on several occasions.  The saving would therefore outweigh the cost of the vaccination.  I would like the Minister of State to consider this seriously and, perhaps, to give an indication today of starting a pilot project in this regard or of including it in the overall national immunisation programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#A00700","speaker":"1376","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I apologise on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.  He is in a committee.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is at the Cabinet meeting.  I am standing in today.  I thank Senator Clifford-Lee on behalf of the Minister and the Minister of State.  I know how important this Commencement matter is to the Senator.  I will read the written reply and then come back in at the end.<\/p><p>Immunisation is a safe and effective way to protect children against serious diseases.  The national or primary childhood immunisation, PCI, programme covers immunisations between birth and 13 months of age.  Immunisations covered by the programme are free of charge and administered by general practitioners within their clinics.  The PCI programme provides immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, haemophilus influenzae type B, hepatitis B, pneumococcal disease, meningitis C, measles, mumps, rubella, meningitis B, and rotavirus.<\/p><p>Chickenpox is a common childhood infection.  In most cases, the symptoms are mild and complications arising from it are rare.  It should also be noted that all children develop immunity to chickenpox after infection.  However, the side effects of the disease can be more severe in adults.  Certain groups of people are at greater risk of serious complications from chickenpox.  These include people who have weakened immune systems through illness, such as HIV, or through treatment, such as chemotherapy.  Chickenpox can also cause a range of serious birth defects, as well as severe disease, when a pregnant woman catches the infection.  Where a child has chickenpox, their school, nursery or day care should be informed as there may be other children who need to inform their GP that they have been exposed.  They should be kept out of school until the last blister has burst and crusted over.  This usually takes five to six days after the rash first appears.  In 2017, 105 hospitalised cases of chickenpox were notified, most of which were in the group up to four years of age.  Males and females were similarly affected.<\/p><p>The chickenpox vaccine, known as VARIVAX, provides protection against the varicella zoster virus that causes chickenpox and is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule.  The vaccine is only offered to children who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox.  VARIVAX is also known as varicella virus vaccine live.  It is a live virus vaccine that is given as an injection.  VARIVAX works by helping to protect the immune system from getting chickenpox.  VARIVAX is given to people who are 12 months old or older.  If the chickenpox vaccine is required, two doses are given with four to eight weeks between doses.  The chickenpox vaccine, however, should not be given to pregnant women.<\/p><p>Although the vaccine is not part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule, it is in other countries such as the US and Germany.  In Ireland, the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, makes recommendations on vaccine policy.  These recommendations are based on the epidemiology of diseases in Ireland and international best practice in respect of immunisation.  The effectiveness and potential of the chickenpox vaccine and other vaccines to be included in the national childhood immunisation programme are kept under continual review by the advisory committee, the Department of Health, and the HSE.  The most recent additions to the programme were the meningococcal B disease, MenB, vaccine and the rotavirus disease oral vaccine, which were included in 2016.  I will come back on some points.  I am sorry about the mispronunciation of some of these medical terms.  They are not my favourite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#B00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State very much but my question was not really answered.

I realise that it is under constant review but I really want the Minister to suggest to the NIAC that it undertake a study on the feasibility of adding the VARIVAX vaccination to the national schedule for children.  I will write to the Minister in this regard because it is a very serious issue that certain groups of children in Ireland are getting vaccinated while other children from less well-off families are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#B00300","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>As a parent and grandparent I understand the importance of any vaccination given to children.

I thought they would break it or smash it or lose it or something else but they were so extraordinarily polite.  &quot;Please, Sir may I hold Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle?&quot;  There was not the slightest damage done.  They were so respectful.  They were so beautifully presented by their parents, so neat, so alert that and I thought how frightfully sad that without this school all these children in ten years time would be on the needle and on their way into the gutter and the grave.  We are talking here not just about the education but about the lives of children in the north inner city which is the most depressed area in educational terms in the city.<br\/><br\/>I have been contacted by the management of the school because there is a problem about the retention of an additional teacher.  Everybody agrees that good teacher&ndash;pupil ratios and early intervention are essential in helping these children.  The principal writes: &quot;The children in the school are losing out due to the disparity in teacher allocations that exist between this school and all the other DEIS schools in Dublin 1.&quot;  In other words, there is an anomaly.  There are other schools that have things they call &quot;legacy posts&quot;.  They managed to get in early and got extra teachers.  This school does not have those.  We cannot have a bureaucratic response when people's lives and welfare are at stake.  The principal continues: <\/p><blockquote>It is not without precedent that the provisions of circular 0010\/2018 are not being applied. The fact is that it is not being applied to any of the DEIS 1 schools in Dublin 1. The Central Model Infants School to name but one example has 21 teachers with 170 children. [We have] statistics of low ratios that apply to the other DEIS 1 schools in Dublin 1. Scoil Chaoimh&iacute;n is the exception in this case and the attached letter from the inspector will highlight this.  [I have the letter from the inspector for the area who is outside the situation and is looking at in a clinical way and it is extremely forceful on the side of Scoil Chaoimh&iacute;n.]  We would be grateful if the Department could approve the retention of the teacher we had on a temporary basis in order to bring about some level of parity with the other schools in the area.<\/blockquote><p>In other words, this school is accidentally disadvantaged within the system.  There are two opportunities - we can behave like the English at the time of the Famine and apply a rigid economic theory and practice to this situation or we can behave like Irish people with a little bit of flexibility in the known interests of the children in this area.  &quot;We would be grateful if this could be dealt with as soon as possible in order for us to hold onto the teacher we had as she is still available for the moment.&quot;  Here is somebody who is still available but who will not remain so for very long.  There is an urgency about this situation.  &quot;To this end we would be grateful if you could respond to the Minister&rsquo;s office without delay as the loss of the teacher to the school would likely become an issue with the parents of the school.&quot;  There is also a possibility that a real row and mess would be created from this and that the parents will go to the media.  I do not think any of us wants that.  I certainly do not after my experience of the media.  They are only in it for the story most of the time.  We have not yet reached the stage when the media should be involved by the parents but I cannot guarantee that the parents will not go to them.<br\/><br\/>Here is a quote from the letter from the inspector: &quot;As assigned inspector for the school, I am aware of the disadvantaged socio-economic background of the pupils almost all of whom Iive in an area which is characterised by high unemployment and deprivation.&quot;  I live in the middle of that in an area where I have struggled to support, improve and regenerate a beautiful 18th century street.  That puts me on an island of privilege in an area of gross deprivation.  The divisional inspector &quot;reported that a number of pupils in the school are currently resident in emergency and temporary accommodation and that this is presenting additional challenges for these pupils' learning opportunities and outcomes&quot;.  Can the Minister of State imagine that?  They are in emergency accommodation.  They are living in hotels.

The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts are published annually on the Department of Education and Skills website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.<\/p> <p>The staffing arrangements for the 2018-2019 school year are set out in circular 0010\/2018 which is available on the Department's website.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location.  The DEIS urban band I has a more favourable staffing schedule than other schools.  DEIS urban band 1 junior schools operate on a general average of one teacher for every 20 pupils.  Schools with senior classes with DEIS urban band I status operate on a general average of one teacher for every 24 pupils.  Schools such as Scoil Chaoimh&iacute;n, which is a school with vertical classes, operate on a general average of one teacher for every 22 pupils.  Scoil Chaoimhin had an enrolment of 59 pupils on 30 September 2017 which allows for an allocation of a teaching principal and two classroom teachers in the school for the current school year.

She was wearing a thong with a lace front.\"<\/p> <p>Those words were uttered in that trial and they are uttered in trials throughout this country on a daily basis.  This is how rape trials are conducted in this country and it is an absolute disgrace.  It is time we highlighted it, called it out and reformed the judicial process and the way trials are conducted in this country.  This did not come as a surprise to anybody working or advocating in the area of sexual violence.  It feeds into stereotypes, victim-blaming and victim-shaming.  This was a 17 year old girl, who claims this assault took place in a laneway in Cork.  These trials are run in such a way that defendants defend themselves by calling into question the evidence, motives or consent of the victim.  That is absolutely outrageous.  It is high time that we started to address it at a societal level and on a legislative level here in these Houses.<\/p> <p>It is no wonder that only 10% of rape victims come forward and report the crimes they have suffered.  An even lower percentage of cases go on to trial, and an even lower percentage get convictions in the end.  I know a review has been undertaken by Professor Tom O'Malley of NUI, Galway, in regard to reforming the way these trials are conducted.  Professor O'Malley started that in August 2018.  Perhaps the Leader could give this House an update on when we will see the conclusion of that review and when proper proposals will be put before this House.  For example, in England and Wales judges can give direction if such evidence is used and if such stereotypes are brought up by the defence during the course of a trial.  Let us be clear.  Rape is an act of violence.  It has nothing to do with sex or attraction.  It is an act of violence.  There are many instances of violence being perpetrated on women in this country and that is just one instance of it.<\/p> <p>I would like to add that there is an urgent need for a comprehensive national consent programme to be rolled out in national schools, and I would like the Minister for Education and Skills to come to this House for a debate on that matter.  It is clear that the senior counsel in question would not have used this line of questioning if she did not think it would resonate with the jury and feed into some stereotypes to the effect that victims are actually looking for this to happen to them.

We have seen a significant increase in the use of anti-depressants in this country, with one in ten people being prescribed them, not necessarily because they are depressed but because 80% of general practitioners who are the first stop in terms of primary care, have not been trained in mental health.  Those who are trained received only six months' training.  The easiest and cheapest solution to reduce queues is to prescribe anti-depressants.  There has been a 500% increase in the prescription of anti-depressants to 18 year olds, which is harrowing.  What does this say about our country?<\/p><p>There was an interesting article in yesterdays <i>Daily Mail <\/i>by a Dr. Max Pemberton which posed the question of whether as a society we are getting more depressed.  In theory, we are not.  Owing to poor primary care, doctors feel they can do nothing else but prescribe medication.  There are people who need medication but the reality is that medication comes with serious effects and we should not be dishing it out unless for a clear clinical need.<\/p><p>For example, everybody will have heard of the anti-depressant, Prozac.  Many countries will not prescribe Prozac to under 18s, but it is prescribed to under 18 year olds here even though one of its side effects is suicidal ideation.  We need a proper mental health service alongside a proper primary care service, which should comprise a mental health advocate who will help people who might have mental health issues.  Being upset, sad, grieving or unhappy when one does not do well in the leaving certificate examination have become mental health issues.  They are not mental health issues.  We need to monitor the prescribing of anti-depressants, to bring about a reduction in their use and to ensure they are not being prescribed to people suffering anxiety and other conditions that can be addressed by way of talk therapy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#H00200","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#H00300","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Yesterday, a draft Brexit withdrawal agreement was agreed between the British and EU negotiators.

The amount of properties these organisations own in every town and village in Ireland is phenomenal.<\/p> <p>The use of these properties is a great concern for many, especially those in the community sector.

That has to be a template for other towns and villages throughout Ireland.  For that to happen, the OPW must have a real strategic view and audit of its structures and buildings throughout the State.  Once the office does that, it can then look at the communities to see how the properties can benefit the communities by doing something like what we did in Kinsale.  Three organisations are based in one premises there.  The building is suitable and appropriate.  It is what the town was looking for.  This can happen everywhere but for it to happen the OPW needs to get involved and be proactive in this area.  A long-term lease was taken in this case.  It involved a small amount of money.

Thankfully, counties like Monaghan, Cavan and many other Border counties and other counties throughout rural Ireland have many indigenous employers that create employment in those areas.

When one sees what happened in Glasnevin, Islandbridge, St. Patrick's Cathedral, my home town of Boyle, Sligo, Kilkenny and Enniskillen, with Ministers in Belfast, Enniskillen and London, and the Taoiseach in Paris, these men who deserved remembrance after 100 years got it.  There were tens of thousands of people from across communities who turned out on Sunday.  I thank everybody.

They are a sister party of Fine Gael.  They are both members of the European People's Party.  We were there to talk about refugees and the detention of children.  It was an interesting series of meetings with Government representatives.  They cracked jokes about final solutions.  A senior minister told us that when someone climbs over their fence, they let the dogs deal with that person.  They proudly told us that they have replaced human rights policies with security policies and how their Christian heritage was under threat from foreigners even though in the 24 hours during which I was in Budapest, I did not see a single person of colour.  This is who we are dealing with in the sister party of Fine Gael, Fidesz.  We went to the transit zone where we saw children imprisoned in a 30 m by 40 m zone every day for 24 hours a day.  They are never let out of that cage.  When I remonstrated with the Government representative, all he would do was argue that the 14 year old was really 16 years of age and there was nothing to be seen there.  I was lucky enough to speak to a human rights representative from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, who told us of the damage to these children, the pressure and anxiety, and the fact that they are self-harming.  I could see the cuts on the wrist of the 14 year old.<\/p> <p>I have never seen such contempt for children in my life as I saw from the Fidesz politicians who came with us and were anxious for us to finish the visit.  They stopped us from visiting any more.  We could see other families and children trapped in similar cages for months at a time, not being able to leave that cage for one minute of one day.  This is being implemented by the Fidesz party, which is detaining children daily, and they will say it with pride.  I ask for an urgent debate on the issue.  The detention of immigrant children is a crime against humanity and we need voices from our Government to condemn it in the strongest possible terms.  I need to understand why Fine Gael is prepared to sit in the same party as fascists.  That is what they are - fascists.  This is a country that gassed 400,000 Jews in 1944.  They talk with pride about what they are doing to keep foreigners out.  I was never so disgusted with anything I have seen in my life.  Children the same age as mine were hemmed in and imprisoned without a second of relief and Fine Gael is sitting with them in the European Parliament.  It is a disgrace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#M00200","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I begin by mentioning the Oireachtas work and learn, OWL, programme.  Ten people here are supported by two disability organisations along with the Houses of the Oireachtas Service and the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.  They are here on work placement for nine months.  When the Ceann Comhairle launched the programme a number of weeks ago, he mentioned this is the first Parliament in the world to do this.  I want to mention that in particular because there has been some adverse media commentary on the programme.  I am pleased to see the response from the Oireachtas about it.  The last census showed that 22% of people with disabilities of working age are in employment and 53% of the rest of the population of working age are in employment.  We have a long way to go.  Programmes like this and having something such as this in the Oireachtas has to be a strong signal to the country in general, businesses and so on, to do their bit.  Many other things have to happen.  I ask that Members in this Chamber and the Leader, in whatever way is appropriate and possible, make sure that this programme goes from strength to strength.  I note a motion that was tabled in South Dublin County Council on Monday evening which was passed unanimously and which addressed, among other things, having a similar programme within the council.  It is important that we give support to these programmes to train people in the workplace.<\/p> <p>Senator Feighan talked about commemorations of the First World War.  I will quote the gravestone of an Englishman who was in the British army and whose surname was Kemp.  It was in Normandy.  He had just been married and had a young wife.  She inscribed on his headstone: \"O for the touch of a vanished hand.\"  I have been all over Normandy, the Somme, Passchendaele, Verdun, Gallipoli and so on for the last 30 years.  I have not seen a more arresting gravestone.  I saw an unmarked gravestone near the Somme which just read: \"An Irish soldier of the Great War\".  In commemorating them, we need, 100 years later, to have a greater sense of the meaning of our commemoration and what we learn from it about these horrendous events that started again in the late 1930s and in other places since then.  What learning have we from it?  It is one thing to say it was a senseless loss of life.  I am not sure that the world has taken the lessons to heart.  Senator Gavan mentioned Hungary.  My colleagues with disabilities in Hungary consider themselves and their organisations to be hounded.  We will see fewer of them on the streets.  I am not making a party political point but saying there are things in states in the European Union that are going terribly in the wrong direction.  We know what happens to disabled people in wars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#M00300","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I congratulate Senator Dolan, who has done much work on disability inclusion.

While people with disabilities represent 13.5% of the population they make up 27% of the homeless population.  Currently, when families are classed as homeless, they do not get additional priority if a child has a disability.  We must examine that to make the system more inclusive.<\/p> <p>Every Senator should get the report and fact sheet provided by Senator Dolan.  I am sure they will, as will local authorities.

I welcome her and wish her well in her new position.<\/p><p>I commend Senator Clifford-Lee on raising the matter of the court case.  I know you commented on that, a Chathaoirligh.  I also note that Senators &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, Mullen and &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke on the issue.  We should reflect, first, on the court case itself, second, on the actions of Deputy Coppinger yesterday, and then on the very sincere contribution of Senator Clifford-Lee this morning.  I completely agree with her.  We can reflect on the Taoiseach's remarks yesterday.  No person asks to be raped no matter what they wear, what they drink or where they are.  It is wrong.  It is a crime and the person who perpetrates such a crime is a criminal and should feel the full rigours of the law.  The sentencing should be 100% commensurate with the crime that has been committed.<\/p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality has appointed Tom O'Malley to chair the review body on the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences.  That work is not complete yet and I do not have a timeline for when the review will be published.  I hope we are all united in ensuring that the victims of sexual violence will not have to go through any further trauma.  We must support and embrace them and encourage victims of rape to come forward to tell their story by ensuring that the State and the judicial system will wrap its arms around them, so to speak, and give them full protection.  I respect Senator Mullen's right to have an option, but irrespective of what he said, we must be concerned at the way in which some of the trials are being handled and what is happening in them.<\/p><p>I will not stray into it but if legislation needs to be changed arising from the O'Malley review, then let us do it.  I do not think the review body has a timetable to meet but I know the Minister is very anxious that it would happen sooner rather than later.  I thank Senator Clifford-Lee for raising the matter.  We should not have to raise it in this House.  The fact that we do sends one message.  The Government is nearing completion of the actions relating to the Istanbul Convention and we have made significant progress through the Domestic Violence Act 2018, which significantly enhances the legal protections available to victims of domestic violence.  I hope the O'Malley review will be completed at the end of this year or the start of next year at the latest.  That is the intention of the Minister.<\/p><p>Senator Clifford-Lee also made reference to delayed discharges, which is one that is a source of frustration to patients, family members and those working in the hospital system.  It is important to put on the record of the House that &euro;10 million in additional funding has been made available in budget 2019 to ensure that hospitals get patients home from hospital or to an appropriate care setting quicker.  As a former Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health, I have been a long-time advocate of the focus being on primary care in terms of transition or step-down facilities, in particular for senior citizens aged over 70.  The Minister for Health has an action plan with 21 enhanced actions targeting nine identified sites in terms of improving primary care services, such as by increasing diagnostics, including making arrangements with private providers, among other services.  I think Senator Clifford Lee will agree with me that we must increase bed capacity and provide more long-term, step-down facilities.  That is the reason the Government opened 240 extra beds and that 79 additional beds will be opened at the end of this quarter.  For that reason it is important to recognise that work is being done.  There are no simple solutions.  Senator Clifford Lee's point is that if we can expedite early discharges more quickly, then we will see a change in the system to the betterment of all concerned.<\/p><p>Senator Freeman raised the issue of mental health, specifically the fact that &euro;10 million is being spent on talk therapy versus &euro;400 million on antidepressants and prescription medication.  The culture of prescribing medication in particular is one we need to change in this country.  For that reason a number of the points raised by Senator Freeman deserve to be debated, especially the training of GPs and also encouraging people to talk and to engage in counselling and to have a one-on-one relationship with a counsellor.  It is important to recognise that talking helps.  All of us recognise the importance of looking out for people and paying attention to their needs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Today is a very important day in the history of the European Union and of our country.  The Brexit deal or, perhaps, the lack thereof is the topical issue of the day.  I acknowledge the contributions of Senators Conway-Walsh, &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, Ned O'Sullivan, &Oacute; Donnghaile and Feighan.  Monsieur Barnier, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows well, has worked very hard and has presented what I hope will be an agreement to both Governments.  The Government has been very clear in its all-island approach.  That has been our policy from the first day and we have not demurred from it for one second.  I hope that the UK Government will recognise the importance of the backstop and of the Good Friday Agreement, which protects the constitutional rights of citizens in the North of our country and has received the international recognition of the United Nations.<\/p><p>The best thing we can do is to hope that common sense will prevail and that those who are advocating Brexit will listen to the needs of everyone, especially people of the North of our island.  I hope that we will have a resolution today.  It is far too serious a matter to play party politics with.  I appeal to the DUP to remember that the majority of people in the North voted to remain.  We are an island nation on the periphery of Europe but also at its heart.  The fact that the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, have secured this agreement today illustrates the work they have done and the profound impact that work has had on other EU member states.  I will have the T&aacute;naiste come to the House in due course.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in also made reference to BusConnects and the very important issue of public transport.  All of us recognise that we spend far too much time commuting.  More and more people are travelling to work, which is a sign that jobs are being created outside of Dublin.  They are spending inordinate amounts of time on public transport.  That is why Project Ireland 2040 is committed to developing and building a world class integrated public transport system not only for Dublin but also for the metropolitan around the capital and for Cork.  I would be happy to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport come to the House in due course.<\/p><p>Senator Lawlor raised the issue of insurance.

Let us be fair about this, however, because there has been a 19% increase in the workload of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of rent controls.  As she will recognise, the Government has brought in rent controls in certain parts of the country and they have worked in some places.  The problem is that we have some bogus landlords who are not willing to abide by the Government's decision.  The Government has given more power and teeth to the Residential Tenancies Board.  We must be careful not to work to curb the private rented sector further.  The Minister is committed to returning to the House for a debate on the issue, including on the points raised by the Senator.<\/p> <p>Senator Warfield raised the issue of direct provision.  I concur with the broad sentiment of his remarks.  People should not have to wait inordinately in direct provision.  The Senator will recognise that changes have been made in regard to direct provision on foot of the McMahon report.  That is a work in progress.  Some 72% of people are now waiting three years or less as opposed to 36% in 2016 but the points the Senator made are valid.  The length of time for some people is much too long.  We have changed the application procedure so that there is now one single application.

It will now read, in part: \"The object of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland is to improve, promote and protect the health, mental health and well-being of children\".

I take this opportunity to record the Government's appreciation of this valuable initiative.  In particular, I thank Deputy Pringle and his staff for their constructive engagement with officials in the Department of Finance, which led to substantial amendment of the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  I believe the Bill before us today is better and more robust for this process.<\/p> <p>The purpose of the Bill is, in brief, to restrict the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund from being invested in fossil fuel companies.  The direct scope of the Bill is, therefore, relatively limited.  However, it is part of a broader movement away from reliance on fossil fuel investment and on fossil fuels themselves.<\/p> <p>There is a market-making aspect to the Bill in that restricting fossil fuel investments may help to drive further investment in sustainable and alternative energy.  It is vital that we collectively work towards reducing the State's fossil-fuel dependency if we are to play our part in addressing the urgent problems of climate change.<\/p> <p>This Bill will amend the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014.  This is the Act under which the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, was established, and which sets out its investment mandate.  Senators will recall that the funding for the ISIF came originally from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The ISIF is partly invested in Irish banks under the directed portfolio.  The investment mandate for the balance of the ISIF is to achieve a commercial return in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment In the State.<\/p> <p>The Bill will operate by further developing the investment mandate to include an effective prohibition on certain investments.  This will be achieved by inserting a new section 49A into the 2014 Act, the text of which is set out in section 1, paragraph (b), of this Bill.<\/p> <p>Section 49A(1) sets out key definitions for the purposes of the section.  Notably, a fossil fuel undertaking is defined as an undertaking for which at least 20% of its turnover is derived from exploration for, or extraction or refinement of, fossil fuels, or a holding undertaking or higher holding undertaking of such an undertaking.  Where a fossil fuel undertaking is part of a group structure, the group is also a fossil fuel undertaking if the aggregate group turnover in respect of fossil fuel activity exceeds that 20% threshold.<\/p> <p>The State's climate change obligations and the national transition objective are defined as having the same meaning that they do in the Climate Change and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.<\/p> <p>Section 49A(2) contains the key provision of the Bill.  It specifically requires the NTMA, which is the custodian of the ISIF, to endeavour to ensure that the assets of the ISIF are not invested in a fossil fuel undertaking within the meaning of the section.  Where the NTMA becomes aware that assets of the ISIF are invested in a fossil fuel investment, it is required to divest the fund of those investments as soon as practicable.  This may arise if, for example, the fossil fuel aspect of a business or group increases substantially in value relative to the rest of the business, or where a business or group divests a substantial portion of non-fossil-fuel assets.  In that case, the NTMA will be required to divest from the business or group within a reasonably short timeframe.<\/p> <p>Section 49A(3) requires the NTMA to endeavour not to invest in indirect investments unless it is satisfied that those investments are unlikely to have more than 15% of their assets invested in fossil-fuel undertakings.  Indirect investments include investment vehicles such as pooled funds.  Where the NTMA invests in such instruments, it targets low exposure to fossil-fuel undertakings.  However, the nature of those investments means that the underlying asset pool and the value of individual assets within the pool is dynamic.  If the tolerance threshold is set too low, it may effectively lock the NTMA out of any such indirect investments.  Accordingly, a 15% limit has been stipulated.<\/p> <p>The 15% limit specified is very much an upper ceiling, not a target; it is set at that level to allow for the fact that short-term factors can cause significant fluctuations in the value of assets.  In practice, the target exposure will continue to be very much lower.  Provision is also made in this subsection that the Minister may, by order, decrease the maximum percentage exposure permitted.  When the NTMA has experience implementing these new rules, the Minister will be able to determine whether it is practical to reduce that 15% maximum.<\/p> <p>Section 49A(4) provides a limited exemption from the restriction on direct investment.  Direct investment in a fossil fuel undertaking may be permitted only if the NTMA has satisfied itself that the investment concerned is consistent with the achievement of the national transition objective, the implementation of the State's climate change obligations and Government policy as notified to the NTMA by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.  This exemption is provided to ensure that investment in a project is not automatically prohibited where its aim is to assist in transition or increase efficiency.  Subsection (5) puts in place a specific reporting obligation that the NTMA must report that it is using the subsection (4) exemption when it announces the investment in question.  This is a transparency measure to ensure that any such investment will be clearly identified and open to scrutiny.<\/p> <p>Finally, going back to paragraph (a) of section 1, this provision amends section 49 of the 2014 Act to require the NTMA to report on measures it takes in accordance with the new section 49A.  This will include the reasonable measures it takes to confirm that it complies with the restrictions on investment, the cases in which the investment has been used, if any, and what investments it has divested from.<\/p> <p>The Bill is relatively short, but will have a significant effect on how the NTMA invests the ISIF.  I understand the NTMA's preparations are already under way and I welcome this.<\/p> <p>I will also give the House an indication on timing.  The Bill itself does not have a commencement date, which means that it commences on enactment.  However, this will not give full force to the Bill's requirements.  This is because the new provisions are being inserted in an Act which requires commencement orders.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This means that to come into effect, the new amending provisions will have to be commenced separately under the 2014 Act.  As the provisions will have immediate effect, meaning that the divestment requirement will apply from the date of commencement, there will be a short delay before commencement.  The NTMA&rsquo;s preparations for full and meaningful implementation of the new provisions are well advanced, but they will need to be completed prior to commencement.  Therefore, the Minister intends to give full effect to the provisions of the Bill once the NTMA confirms that its preparations are complete.  He expects to be in a position to do so during quarter one of next year.<\/p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#Q00600","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for introducing this important Bill which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, Senator Horkan, who, unfortunately, is attending a committee meeting.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports the Bill which will obligate the National Treasury Management Agency to divest the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, of its assets in fossil fuel companies.  Like the Minister of State, I also thank Deputy Pringle, Tr&oacute;caire and the Department of Finance for the extensive work they have done on this issue.  While the initial form of the Bill might have had some unintended consequences, I am happy that in the constructive talks held with various parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il, these issues were ironed out.<\/p> <p>The ISIF has a reported &euro;133 million invested in at least 152 fossil fuel companies.  This amounts to 12.2% of all stocks owned by the ISIF.  We believe selling these stocks would send a clear message that Ireland was determined to rectify its recent failures to live up to its climate change commitments.  Furthermore, the Bill will put Ireland at the forefront of a global campaign to divest from fossil fuel companies.  Engaging with them to lower their emissions has, unfortunately, been unsuccessful.  Research from the University of Oxford shows that divestment would encourage a change in behaviour by undermining a key source of fossil fuel companies&rsquo; funding without having a significant impact on the ISIF.<\/p> <p>Divesting from fossil fuel companies actually makes practical economic sense.  An analysis has shown that had Ireland divested in 2015, the ISIF would have accumulated &euro;22 million more owing to low oil and gas prices.  The Minister of State also alluded to this in his contribution.  Oil, gas and coal are not the blue chip investments they once were.  It is estimated that retaining fossil fuel investments in the past three years may have cost Ireland in excess of &euro;100 million.  However, the Bill does nothing to address the fact that Ireland is wildly off target to meet its 2020 emissions targets.  Unfortunately, the Government has a lot to answer for in that regard.  The Seanad has been instrumental in challenging this failing.  The Bill should be passed without delay and the ISIF directed to swiftly divest its fossil fuel holdings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#R00200","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

I welcome the Bill in that regard.  We obviously want to move toward significant reductions in emissions across a range of areas.  I refer to the Strategic Investment Bank and the NTMA which the Minister of State also referenced.  In that context, I welcome the Bill.

I also welcome the Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in is fully behind the idea of exploring alternatives to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.  Using them is something we cannot do anymore.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, we are delving into this issue and meeting stakeholders and providers.  We will launch a report with our recommendations early next year and I hope it will dovetail with the provisions of the Bill when they take full effect.  Perhaps together they might make an important statement.<\/p> <p>When we speak about moving away from the use of fossil fuels, we also have to speak about alternative renewable energy sources.  As their use will help to protect our planet and the environment, we cannot just continue to explain the problems caused by the use of fossil fuels, we also need to provide solutions.  Varied alternative sources of energy must be developed.  Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward proposals specifying what exactly should replace fossil fuels.  The microgeneration support scheme Bill would allow people to feed into the national grid, as well as gaining some income from the excess energy generated.  The Bill lays out how this would happen and gives details of the scheme.<\/p> <p>We have put forward a paper on the use of biogas generated from waste, largely farm and animal waste, which can be combined with catering food waste.  The use of biogas as a renewable energy source would work to complement the intermittent nature of wind and solar energy and further help to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions which, as we know, are, unfortunately, rising.  We have an international obligation to reduce our emissions by 20% by 2020, but we will only reach a figure of about 6%, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  Other countries are way ahead of us and we will be sorely fined.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward the document, Powering Ireland 2030, in which it outlines a proposed energy mix for electricity generation.  Our priority is to ensure energy generation in Ireland will be sustainable and secure and that the supply of energy will be affordable for all.  No one in our society should struggle to heat his or her home.  Our vision for Ireland can be achieved by redirecting public, semi-State and private investment into developing and deploying new energy mixes.  I note that the Minister of State is proposing to set a 15% threshold for the ISIF.  That is unfortunate and we could be ambitious enough to go for a figure of 20%.  I would like the NTMA and the ISIF to publish what it is they are investing in and what investments are in fossil fuel companies because the more people are aware of the information, the greater the demand will be which will create an impetus for them to try to divest from such companies.<\/p> <p>There is a need for increased support for householders, communities, farmers and small businesses through a broader range of grants to reduce emissions and produce the energy we need.  We had a session of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee yesterday with small businesses and it was one of the attractions they wanted to create, especially in rural Ireland.  They wanted this support to be provided for small businesses to provide a skills mix and employ people.  It would bring not just specific expertise but also instil a culture of dedication to the use of renewable resources within small and medium businesses.  We have seen a cultural shift in this generation which might perhaps bear fruit in the next.  They are very aware and environmentally responsible.  They will question everything we do and make sure it is benchmarked and proofed against the pollution of the environment.  It is their future and the matter is in their hands.

It is very welcome and it illustrates the cross-party support and enthusiasm for this legislation.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Bill to the Seanad and express my strong support for its provisions and the principle of withdrawing investment in fossil fuel companies as a measure to combat climate change.  I congratulate Deputy Pringle on successfully steering the legislation through the D&aacute;il as a Private Members' Bill, which is not always an easy feat for those of us in opposition.  I also acknowledge the role played by Trinity College Dublin and its students in influencing and stimulating the divestment debate in Ireland.  When I was president of the union I was involved in navigating the discussions that led to the move by the college's board to become the first university in Ireland to divest itself of fossil fuel investments in 2016.<\/p> <p>I also pay tribute to the student activists involved in Fossil Free TCD and the incredible grassroots campaign, with Tr&oacute;caire, that spearheaded the movement's impressive advocacy for something that was not a mainstream political issue when they started.  Through their work, and the place that Trinity College occupies in Irish public debate, however, it became a mainstream issue.  The issue has gone from one campaign by a handful of students a few years ago to one which is the subject of an Act of the Oireachtas and I recognise the role of Trinity College students in making rapid progress happen in this area.  As a Senator who is not usually parochial, I am sure fellow Senators will forgive me for giving so many congratulations to Trinity College.<\/p> <p>As a public policy measure, divestment is important because it allows for a carbon bubble, which is when divestment in stocks and shares in fossil fuel companies reduces the value of these companies to the point that these companies will be unable to open more oil, natural gas or coal fields, making the fossil fuels themselves stranded assets, unable to be used or burned which, therefore, reduces CO2 emissions.  The value of fossil fuel companies is estimated in the market to include the value of the massive, untapped fossil fuel reserves that have yet to be fully opened up and extracted.  Through divestment, we can make sure these reserves stay as they are and do not support the often reckless behaviour of fossil fuel companies in terms of exploration.<\/p> <p>This Bill will represent an important part of the Irish efforts to contribute to the global climate justice movement, especially at a time when we are completely failing to hit our emissions targets and when even our Taoiseach describes Ireland as a laggard in European terms.  As a small, island nation off the coast of Europe with a temperate climate supported by marine trends, Ireland is, unfortunately, vulnerable to extreme changes in weather.  These extremes always disproportionately impact on disadvantaged and poorer communities, heaping additional pressure on us to make sure Ireland is pulling its weight.  This Bill is an important part of that but only a small one and I hope that, following the passage of this Bill, the Minister will use its climate justice principles to inform all his work in the Department of Finance.<\/p> <p>Climate justice is the ultimate cross-departmental issue and, as the holder of the purse strings, the Minister is in a unique position to orchestrate efforts across the State to reduce emissions and make the move to a just transition.

I wish to give the sincerest welcome to this Bill and I congratulate Deputy Pringle and his assistant, Jodie Neary, who did so much to bring this Bill through.  It was an example of an Independent politician taking a global perspective, rather than a local perspective.  I commend all parties, including the Government, on their support for and recognition of the value of this Bill.<\/p> <p>I am positive about some of the language I hear from the new Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, and I am happy that he has spoken of the need to address climate change with a revolution in how we live, looking towards circular economics and bioeconomics, with different economics and different assessments of costs.  That is the kind of leadership we need.<\/p> <p>Divestment does not mean a loss of income but massive savings for the planet and the environment, as well as in the practical costs of climate change.  Having a model of investment based on short-term metrics, such as quarterly reports, has blinded us to the long-term costs but we are freeing ourselves from that perspective with this measure.  At a European level, the 2020 targets were meant to incorporate a vision for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth but Europe has not yet fulfilled that vision.  As we set out our plan for a post-2020 world, this is an opportunity for Ireland to give leadership on the kinds of investment we collectively make.<\/p> <p>I commend civil society activists and the young people who have driven much of this campaign.  My colleague has spoken about the students in Trinity College and I was very proud to work with staff and students in NUI Galway last year, who succeeded in getting the university to divest from fossil fuels.  I particularly wish to commend Colm Duffy on his work in this area.  I was proud to launch NUI Galway's sustainability strategy following that.<\/p> <p>As we saw in our Citizens' Assembly, society is ahead of politics in this area, with 97% of the assembly recommending that climate change be at the centre of policy making while 100% believe the State needs to take a leadership role to address climate change through mitigation measures.  Many say they would be willing to pay higher taxes for this goal but an opportunity was missed in this regard in the Finance Bill.<\/p> <p>Divestment is a great opportunity and this is a moment for leadership.  I hope we can set an example around the world and it is important that we remember Ireland operates in a global context.  Next month the Conference of the Parties event, COP24, will take place in Poland.  I was at the last Conference of the Parties in Pozna which took place at a time when, though we were deeply concerned about the destruction of the environment, Europe was holding onto coal and other fossil fuels and their related industries.  We hope that, since Paris, there has been a shift and a willingness to make the difficult decisions and grapple with the difficult issues.<\/p> <p>This Government has shown some leadership with the ban on fracking, and it is showing some leadership today with its willingness to divest from fossil fuels but we need joined-up thinking which goes a little further.  We need to look at the LNG terminal which is due to be built in Shannon because we cannot facilitate the processes which we recognise as damaging.  We need to look at why we are building a terminal in Shannon which could import fracked gas.  I urge the Minister to engage on this issue with his colleagues across Government.<\/p> <p>I strongly commend this Bill to the House.  It is an exciting step forward but we have further to go.

I thank Deputy Pringle and his assistant, Ms Jodie Neary, for the work they have done on this Bill and guiding it through the D&aacute;il.  It is very important legislation and it has had an effect far and wide.  Tr&oacute;caire gave me a briefing note indicating 150 newspaper articles have been published internationally relating to this, reaching over 200 million people.  The change being initiated by this legislation in Ireland is having a far bigger effect internationally, as we can see the interest generated across the globe.  A video hailing this has been viewed 12 million times.  There is an important element relating to leadership in this legislation and I also praise the student union in Trinity College Dublin, which raised public awareness of this initiative.<\/p> <p>The previous Senator mentioned the public and it is far ahead of us with this.  People are demanding that we change and saying we need to take climate change seriously.  That is why there was such major disappointment when the carbon tax was not addressed in the recent budget.  The income from a carbon tax could have retrofitted many homes to bring a more beneficial impact on the environment and energy use.  That sum could have made an enormous difference to our carbon footprint.  We are laggards in that respect.  The expert advisory group on climate change set up by the previous Government as part of our climate change legislation has repeatedly told the Government it is not reaching its targets or advancing policies that would allow us to reach our targets for 2020 and 2030.  Unfortunately, we are failing and I take no glee in saying that.<\/p> <p>While Ireland may feel the impact of climate change in harder winters, warmer summers and a shortage of drinking water, people in the Third World are losing their lives.  There is starvation and drought, which are extremely serious impacts.  It is why we must demonstrate leadership, above all else.  We must accept responsibility for the acts we carry out.  We are increasing our carbon footprint because of our transport policy and that has not been addressed seriously.  That neglect is having a major impact in Africa and Asia through climate change.  We must take personal responsibility for this and that includes Members of both Houses because there has been a serious lack of action in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>This legislation is groundbreaking and visionary.  We must make consider the detailed legislative changes we need to make regarding how we build and retrofit homes, how we use our transport infrastructure and the lack of investment in public transport compared with the amount spent on roads.  All of these have an impact on climate change and affect Third World countries.  They are suffering because of the lack of action in First World countries like Ireland.  Legislation like this amounts to real leadership.  Deputy Pringle guided this Private Members' legislation through the D&aacute;il and one can see the global impact it will have.<\/p> <p>I commend Bord na M&oacute;na on its decision to accelerate the reduction in turf cutting, particularly in counties Laois and Offaly.  However, this decision also has an impact on the sustainability of rural communities.  The challenge we have as a nation is how to treat those communities.  We must ensure they are sustainable, while also moving away quickly from the burning of turf.  The idea that power plants will continue to burn wood and turf until 2030 must be examined.  The idea of keeping Moneypoint power station open is ridiculous and we must move quickly to close it.  The target we have set is not acceptable because Moneypoint is poisoning our climate.  As a nation, we must take responsibility for what is happening because of Moneypoint.  We must put the infrastructure and the finances in place to ensure the plant can close very quickly.<\/p> <p>With good legislation like this we should give deserved thanks to the Deputies who guided it through.  There are clear messages that we must do more.  The climate change legislation put in place by the previous Government clearly set out a programme for that.  It also set out an independent advisory group that would tell Departments when they were not reaching targets.  The group, in all of its reports, has said loudly and clearly that we are failing to reach our targets.  That is not acceptable to Irish people.  In many ways we may make excuses and say that people do not understand how this will affect economic growth and jobs, for example, but the public is saying loudly and clearly that we must take those decisions.  There will be unintended consequences and it will be difficult but the public, particularly after the recent budget, has said it wants to see change.  People want to see the carrot and stick used in equal measure.  We must change how we are treating our climate but we are failing to take on our responsibilities to the Third World because of our inaction.<\/p> <p>I commend this important Bill but we must do more.  I commend Deputy Pringle on his work, as well as the students from Trinity College Dublin who raised this as an issue in the first instance.

I thank Deputy Pringle for introducing the Bill and Tr&oacute;caire and the students from Trinity College and around Ireland who have campaigned to recognise the impact of burning fossil fuels, which creates global warming and leads to climate change.  The sooner we get on with this Bill and other legislation to help reduce our impact on climate as a nation, so we can become leaders in the area, the better.<\/p> <p>This Bill is an important step.  A recent United Nations report indicates we have a short 12 years to turn around this issue.  Otherwise, we will see a catastrophic butterfly effect from climate change.  We know three fifths of known fossil fuel resources can never be safely burned and if we do not take heed of the warnings, average global temperatures will exceed pre-industrial levels by more than 1.5&deg; Celsius.  All coal, gas and oil resources must stay in the ground, unburned, untouched and unused.  We must turn to the types of energy that will not cause a global catastrophe.  This Bill is a small step in that direction, dealing with divestment.  It is very positive and I welcome it.  I want to be part of a progressive Ireland and if we continue to be laggards in the area of climate change, we will be at nothing.

I hope the Bill will continue to have cross-party support as it progresses through the Houses to enable it to become law urgently.<\/p><p>Dealing with issues urgently is not something parliaments do well.  If we are serious about tackling climate change, we need to act quickly and radically.  The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report caused alarm around the world, as it should.  Scientists are doing their job in presenting the evidence that we are destroying our natural environment and citizens are doing their job in demanding action, in particular the fossil fuel divestment movement, which was initiated and driven by networks of student activists throughout the world, including in Trinity College.  I note Senators Ruane and Higgins were front and centre in this regard during their time in Trinity College.<\/p><p>It is time for politicians in Ireland and round the world to do their jobs.  Let this Bill be a watershed moment.  Let it mark the point at which the Oireachtas recognised the urgency of the situation and committed to radical changes in how we live.  Let this be the start of a series of Government Bills based on a just transition to a green economy and serious investment in renewable energy sources.  We have a moral duty to our children, grandchildren and future generations to move back from the brink and to safeguard our planet.  The Taoiseach famously stated that we are a laggard on this issue but we do not have to be.  Let us listen to the climate advisory committee and make the radical changes needed to hit our targets under the Paris Agreement.  Climate change is the biggest issue facing the world.  It threatens our very existence and also worsens global inequality in that its impact is felt most by poorer communities who have done the least to cause it and are least equipped to tackle it.  Let Ireland be a leader on climate change by taking this first step in divestment, but going much further as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#T00500","speaker":"1408","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Pringle and his guests to the Visitors Gallery and I commend the Deputy on the introduction of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#U00200","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the Bill.  I also welcome Deputy Pringle to the House and I commend him on being proactive.<\/p><p>I had not intended to speak, but I am anxious to respond to comments made by Senator Higgins in regard to a project on the Shannon Estuary, a project that I know more than a little about because I have been involved in it since its inception.  I was mayor of Kerry in 2004 when the project for a liquefied natural gas terminal was mooted.  I was also a director of Shannon-Foynes Port Company at the time.  This project was objected to by a minority group.  The group succeeded in holding up the project interminably with technical objections, resulting in the then main investor, the Hess Corporation, which had already invested upwards of &euro;15 million, pulling out of the project, to the detriment of an area devastated by unemployment, emigration, business closures and so on.<\/p><p>Fortunately, in recent times a new player, New Fortress Energy, has come on the stream.  This company intends to run with the project, in respect of which it had the support and backing of the former Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, and I am sure will have the support and backing of the current Minister, Deputy Bruton, but it is again subject to objections, this time from a group that as far as I am aware has no connection with County Kerry.  This group is objecting on new grounds.  The original objection put forward by Safety Before LNG was on the grounds of safety, with every possible scenario put forward, including that similar terminals in other countries had blown up.  On examination, however, the authorities were satisfied that there were no grounds for those objections.  The most recent objections are different.  I cannot comment any further because they are <i>sub judice<\/i>.  No project in the history of the State has been scrutinised as much as this and passed muster.  At the 11th hour, objectors from outside the area are making objections on totally new grounds related to fracking in Texas.  I am not an expert on fracking but I do know that without it we would not have petrol or diesel for our cars.  That is a wider issue which I do not propose to get into now.<\/p><p>As Senator Higgins raised the issue, which she is entitled to do, I wanted to bring balance to the issue.  A whole community is awaiting commencement of this project, for which they have been waiting for 12 years.  There are 500 valuable jobs at stake in an area that has been devastated by unemployment, with huge knock-on effects for the economy of Kerry, west Limerick and, possibly, County Clare.  As in the case of all issues, there must be balance.  I have been an environmentalist all my life, even though it suits smart alecs like <i>The Phoenix<\/i>to suggest otherwise.  I have a proven record in this area at home level.  There is balance to be found in every issue.  I encourage the Minister of State not to be too influenced by Senator Higgins's remarks.  The Senator is entitled to her opinion.  I am seeking to balance the argument.  I would be letting down the people of Kerry if I failed to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#U00300","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I do not propose to comment on the LNG facility, of which I have no knowledge or insight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#U00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I am sure we will have further opportunities to discuss it.

They are changing attitudes in boardrooms and insisting on change.  On this occasion, ISIF represents the State.

This is a very significant Bill providing for the establishment of Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, which will provide a much-needed boost to the availability of finance for residential development in the State.  The availability of appropriate development finance for commercially-viable residential projects has been identified as a key contributory factor for the ongoing shortfall in residential supply.  The introduction of HBFI will provide a crucial boost to the availability of this important source of finance.  In the absence of this key policy response by the Government there is a concern that these constraints could limit the market&rsquo;s capacity to respond to current and projected housing demand, particularly bearing in mind projected growth in the population and the positive outlook for the economy in the coming years.<\/p> <p>Development activity continues to be impacted by the legacy of the financial crisis.  While traditional banks are returning to providing senior debt financing for residential development, the number of active lenders in Ireland has reduced from 12 a decade ago to three today.  Furthermore, by the middle of last year land and development exposures across the main banks had reduced to just &euro;2 billion, or 1% of their total lending.  While this refocusing by the main banks is entirely appropriate, not least from a financial stability perspective, it does pose significant challenges to builders and developers seeking to fund viable residential developments but not possessing the levels of equity now required by the banks.  While alternative lenders have entered the Irish market to satisfy some of this excess demand, it is estimated that the scale of provision by both the banks and these lenders continues to be well below that required to fund the estimated annual shortfall of between 15,000 and 20,000 units.  <\/p> <p>HBFI is expected to provide finance to viable projects where developers are in a position to put up 20% or more equity into projects, thereby bridging the gap that exists in bank finance and increasing the pool of finance available from lenders in this space.  The problem of a shortage of access to supply of appropriate finance has been particularly acute for smaller development projects and those located outside the major urban areas.  HBFI will be established to address these concerns and will reduce this shortfall by focusing on those areas of the market that are currently under-served by the banks and alternative finance providers.  HBFI will target smaller builders and developers, with no one borrower to represent more than 5% of HBFI&rsquo;s lending capacity.  HBFI will fund of up to 80% of development costs, meaning that borrowers must still provide significant levels of equity or raise third party equity in the market to access HBFI funds. <\/p> <p>Thanks to the considerable efforts of NAMA in delivering more than 8,000 units of residential housing in recent years and its commitment to facilitating the delivery of some 20,000 units by the end of 2020, the State now has market leading expertise and experience in providing this form of development finance on a commercial basis.  It is expected that some staff will transfer from NAMA and this will be of great benefit to HBFI to allow it to be up and running in as short a timeframe as possible.  HBFI will be established as a private company under the Companies Act 2014 with the shares held by the Minister for Finance.  It will have an independent board, appointed by the Minister in compliance with State board appointment guidelines, with all of the powers necessary to conduct its business.  HBFI will be funded through the provision of debt and equity funding of up to &euro;750 million that will be made available from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  The redirection of this funding to HBFI from lSlF is a continuance of the refocusing of that entity towards projects of national strategic importance.  Funding for lending purposes will be provided by way of a repayable loan from ISIF to HBFI on commercial terms and the returns expected to accrue to the State from the funding of HBFI will be commensurate with the commercial returns for loans to entities with similar risk profiles.  <\/p> <p>It is important to recognise that HBFI will not provide low-cost or subsidised funding to developers or to the construction industry.  HBFI will charge commercial rates for its lending and establishing HBFI in this manner will ensure that it is compliant with state aid rules and provides an appropriate level of return to the State for the risk it is taking on.  A unique feature of HBFI will be its ability to fund smaller developments and with this in mind, it is expected that HBFI will provide funding for projects with a minimum capacity of only ten units, equating to a loan facility of approximately &euro;2 million.  Projects would be expected to have full planning permission and the sponsors to be fully tax compliant.  <\/p> <p>As an independent entity HBFI will have full flexibility to provide any type of funding which serves to increase the supply of residential development generally.  This includes projects that deliver social, affordable or low-cost housing and also to fund remedial works on residential developments, provided they are commercially viable and meet its eligibility criteria.  However, it is important to recognise that HBFI will not be directly involved in development.  Its role will be solely as a commercial lender and therefore it will not have any role in designing the housing mix contained in the schemes it funds.<\/p> <p>It is believed that with &euro;750 million available, HBFI will not be constrained and will fund any project that fits its eligibility criteria.  The key is for HBFI to fund all eligible projects and that, in turn, will have a positive impact on the supply of housing of all types across the market spectrum.  As indicated, HBFI will ensure that its total exposure to any one borrower does not exceed 5% of its total lending, ensuring that lending can be spread across as many developments as possible.  The specific interest rates charged by HBFI will be bespoke and will reflect the credit risk of each particular development project, the quality of collateral, the creditworthiness of the borrower and the track record of the borrower in the delivery of residential development projects to date.  In order to ensure compliance with state aid rules the lending terms and conditions will also be benchmarked to the market.  <\/p> <p>The Government recognises that the funding of residential development is clearly undergoing a temporal dislocation and for this reason a formal review clause has been included in the HBFI Bill.  The review process will commence in 2020 and subsequently every two years, whereby the Minister for Finance will assess the extent to which HBFI has made progress toward achieving its overall objectives and the impact HBFI is having on residential development funding in the State. <\/p> <p>A number of provisions have been included in the Home Building Finance Ireland Bill 2018 which relate to the local property tax, LPT.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It has been determined that provisions concerning the local property tax, LPT, are not appropriate for inclusion in the Finance Bill and as the proposed provisions must have an operative date of 1 January 2019, they need to be provided for in law before that date.  Hence their inclusion in the Home Building Finance Ireland Bill 2018.<\/p><p>The first set of provisions relates to a one year extension of the LPT mortgage interest deferral relief in respect of 2019 LPT liabilities.  Currently, the income threshold for deferral of LPT liabilities can be increased in the case of property owners paying mortgage interest.  This mortgage interest deferral relief provided for by section 133 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 is being extended until 31 December 2019 in line with the standard income threshold.  The next valuation date for LPT is 1 November 2019, which will determine tax liabilities for the years 2020 and 2021.  Arrangements for this are being considered as part of the review of the LPT being carried out by an interdepartmental group, as well as how payment deferrals will operate going forward.<\/p><p>The second set of provisions relates to continuing to provide for the administration and collection of LPT in line with PAYE modernisation changes that are due to come into effect on 1 January 2019.  These provisions are procedural in nature, do not make any changes to the LPT system and are necessary to facilitate the continued operation of the PAYE system, including the deduction of LPT by employers and its remittance to Revenue.  The legislative changes underpinning the continued administration and collection of income tax under PAYE modernisation were enacted in the Finance Act 2017.  The changes proposed here simply mirror for LPT the changes already enacted for income tax in the  Finance Act 2017.<\/p><p>In the interests of allowing adequate time for discussion of the Bill I will now turn to the detail of the main provisions.  The Bill has seven Parts.  Part 1 contains three sections and sets out the preliminary and general provisions.  It allows the Minister for Finance to commence the Bill or particular Parts at different dates and also provides that expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act will be sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and paid out of the moneys provided by the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>Part 2 provides for the establishment of Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, and sets out its functions.  Section 7 sets out the functions of HBFI which will be to lend on commercial terms for residential development in a manner that aims to contribute to the economic and social development of the State and enhance the competitiveness of the economy.  It also provides that HBFI will have ongoing regard to Government policy on housing when lending.<\/p><p>Part 3 sets out the funding arrangements for HBFI.  This Part provides for the initial issue of shares in the new company to the value of &euro;20 million to the Minister on incorporation.  This &euro;20 million of equity capital will come from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  This Part also sets out the limited circumstances in which the Minister can dispose of shares in HBFI and for the payment of any dividends from the entity to be paid into the Exchequer.  It also provides for the ability to raise limited funding on capital markets should it be required to meet demand.<\/p><p>Part 4 sets out the procedures for the preparation of financial statements and ensuring the public accountability of HBFI.  It provides that HBFI must submit its accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit and that those accounts will also be presented to the Minister and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It also provides that a senior member of the staff of HBFI will be answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts, where requested.<\/p><p>Part 5 sets out consequential amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 and the Freedom of Information Act 2014.  These amendments provide an exemption for withholding taxes to apply to HBFI consistent with other State-owned entities and also provides the Minister with the power to direct the ISIF to provide credit to the HBFI on commercial terms and to provide equity funding to HBFI.  The amendment limits the total funding, which must not exceed &euro;750 million.<\/p><p>Part 6 sets out a number of miscellaneous provisions, including the making of an offence to disclose confidential information of HBFI or to lobby the agency with the intention of influencing the making of a decision.  This Part also provides the basis for a biannual periodic review of the agency.<\/p><p>Part 7 provides for certain provisions in respect of the LPT, which I have already described in detail.<\/p><p>Addressing the shortfall in the supply of housing requires a broad cross-governmental response and a strategy to make best use of the resources available to the State.  While the establishment of HBFI will not solve this problem single-handedly, it will play an important part in the overall strategy to increase the supply of new housing.  While this initiative may have taken longer to bring forward than some may have hoped, I am satisfied that we have now provided a sound basis for the creation of this important agency to supply much-needed funding for residential development in a manner that delivers a commercial return for the State and is in full compliance with state aid rules.  I commend the Bill to the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#V00700","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>The execution of any housing policy by this Government is to be welcomed and everyone should give it a chance.  Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, was first announced over a year ago and it is fair to say the Government has been lukewarm in supporting it and lacked any sense of immediate purpose.  We applaud the purpose of the Bill, which is to lower the cost of funds for building by investing &euro;750 million from ISIF in the construction sector.  Currently, banks will lend only between 60% and 65% of the capital required at an interest rate of between 4% and 7%.  The developer must then borrow the rest from an international fund, often at rates of more than 10%.  When this is added up it makes any project totally unviable.<\/p> <p>Given the Government's tight-fisted track record, we have to question whether the HBFI will spend what has been promised.  The precursor of the fund, Activate Capital, has a total of &euro;500 million in State funding, yet it has contributed to the construction of only approximately 3,600 homes since January 2016.  We have every right to expect HBFI to be successful and it must not become a flop similar to Activate Capital.<\/p> <p>Homelessness has been allowed to reach unprecedented levels while the number of homes being built is tens of thousands behind what it should and needs to be.  Fianna F&aacute;il pushed a pro-social and affordable housing agenda throughout the budget process.  The Government has had six separate housing plans and more than a dozen launches.  We have yet to see any real substantial change for the 120,000 people on social housing waiting lists and the large cohort of people on average incomes who are unable to buy a home and see more and more of their income going towards servicing rent costs.<\/p> <p>While the Bill is a good first step and I welcome it and applaud everyone involved in it, the Government needs to be bolder in its approach.  Tinkering around the edge of this issue will not solve the problem.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to increasing the supply of homes by not only reducing the cost of finance but also by reducing development levies, introducing a new special saving incentive account, SSIA, scheme to help people save for their deposit and strengthening rental protections.  There is no silver bullet for this problem to which there are many facets.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Bill and its attempts to provide much-needed revenue for developers to get back to building houses.  However, more is required and I would welcome the Government taking more urgent action to do what is needed.

Building more houses is the answer to the housing crisis.  Anyone who has been trying to work to get builders and developers, those who have been pilloried over the years, off the ground knows that in the past couple of years these people were finding it extremely difficult to get finance.  Banks were not lending to them and are still not lending.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Anthony Lawlor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2283\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2283&amp;amp;pid=AnthonyLawlor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As mentioned, banks require at least 40% to 50% equity or capital before they will lend the balance.  Some builders were getting finance from vulture funds of up to 15% to 17% which was making it unviable for them to commence building.  They would sites not only in Dublin but also in various parts of the country.<\/p><p>We need to have an overall strategy for building houses.  We need all parts of the industry to be functioning, including the small builder who builds ten or 20 houses a year.  They need to be able to access finance, but they have not been able to do so heretofore.<\/p><p>When we look at the type of loan being made available, I ask the Minister of State to look at a couple of issues.  I refer to the overall package of &euro;750 million.  He says no one builder will have more than 5% of the pot.  If there were 20 builders each getting 5%, the chances of the small builder getting anything would be reduced.  There should be priority given to small builders because in the future they will be building in the areas into which the big builders and vulture funds will not go such as small towns and villages.  A certain percentage of the fund should be set aside for those with the capacity to build ten to 20 houses a year, not those who are building 200 to 300 houses.<\/p><p>I am also worried about the Minister of State's reference to a figure of 5%.  Five per cent of the pot amounts to &euro;37.5 million, which is a lot of money.  That means that the fund is only geared towards the builders who can provide an asset base.  The Minister of State might look at that issue and reduce the figure from 5% to 2% or 1%.  That would make more sense because it would give the small builder a chance, which I know was the intention behind the Bill.<\/p><p>NAMA is mentioned in the Bill, but this is a role it could have carried out.  The problem was that it only looked after the clients who were in it.  It did not provide funding for small builders who still had outstanding loans with various banks but who were not big enough to be in NAMA.  It should have provided the State funding that was in place to help in that regard.  It could have been done four or five years ago, but, sadly, that opportunity was missed.<\/p><p>The Bill has passed through the D&aacute;il and is now going through the Seanad.  How quickly does the Minister of State expect it to pass through this House?  He can see that there is very little interest in it, but it is an important cog in the overall process of building houses.  When does he expect the fund to be up and running in order that small builders can receive loans?  A couple of them have been in contact with me to ask me about the Bill because they would love to see the fund up and running as quickly as possible.  From a funding perspective, there will be a total budget of &euro;750 million, with &euro;20 million in the pot from the beginning.  Will that be the limit on how much can be loaned at the start or will the &euro;750 million be in it from the get-go?<\/p><p>I refer to the local property tax.  I know that next November we will again have a discussion on the serious increase in the valuations of properties.  Years back, this role was carried out by local government.  Councillors made decisions at the annual budget meeting as to whether they would increase rates.  The calculation of the local property tax involves the use of a multiplier.  The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong in that regard.  Perhaps it is the only thing that should be changed, rather than the valuation of a property.  The multiplier could be decided on by the local authorities.  I am fairly certain that a multiplier is used in the calculation of the local property tax.  It could be used by the local authorities and council members in deciding what the charges should be on the properties within their functional areas.<\/p><p>I again thank the Minister of State for coming into the House.  I am very much in favour of the Bill and surprised that it is not gaining more traction because it is a cog in moving forward with a view to generating more house builds.  As a result we will have fewer issues with affordability and homelessness and other such concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#W00300","speaker":"1438","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I address the question of the Government doing more.  I have to disagree with the Senator because the Government is fully committed to achieving the objective of building more social and affordable homes, as is obvious from the nearly 26,000 social units delivered in 2017, which represented a significant increase on the numbers delivered in previous years.  Further funds have also been provided in the budget for 2019 when &euro;2.4 billion will be invested, more than in any other year.  That is the pot for the provision of social and affordable housing in 2019.  There is a strong and growing social housing pipeline in place, as evidenced by the quarter two 2018 construction status report.  Since the end of 2016, the numbers of schemes and homes included in the programme have doubled.  The level of activity on site has also increased significantly, with work on 1,074 homes ongoing on-site in quarter two of this year alone.<\/p> <p>On affordable housing, there is a multistrand targeted approach being pursued in the counties most affected by the issue.  The measures are targeted at households earning a maximum of &euro;50,000 for a single applicant and &euro;75,000 for double applicants.  Significantly, in budget 2019 the Government has trebled to &euro;310 million the funding available in the serviced sites fund for key facility infrastructure on local authority sites to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent.<\/p> <p>Much has been done, including the establishment of the Land Development Agency.  I know that it is easy to say the Government is not doing enough, but that is not a fair criticism because we are doing a lot.  If the Senator had said we were not doing enough quickly enough, that would probably have been more fair, but we tend to not receive fair criticism when it comes to housing.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is doing a huge amount of work in what is a difficult area.  People forget that the State had closed down the residential construction sector.  It stopped operating five years ago because there was a massive oversupply.  In this Chamber Deputies were talking about knocking down estates.  Does Senator Wilson remember that?

The question was whether the Attorney General should be so restricted and whether this had the potential to be a measure that would lead us into unconstitutional territory, which is the argument Senator McDowell made.  This refers to the ban on canvassing later in the Bill, which I support fully as I think it is a very important reform.  Senator McDowell's point was that the ban on canvassing, coupled with the presence of the Attorney General on the commission, an issue that he supported, and I know he and the Minister were in agreement on that point, together with the prohibition on the disclosure of identities of unsuccessful candidates to the Government, could lead to an unconstitutional restriction on the powers of the Attorney General.<\/p><p>The continued presence of the Attorney General on the commission in a sense undermines at least some of the purported purpose of the reforms in the Bill.  There is this fundamental contradiction, if one likes, that while the Bill purports to be an attempt to reform the judicial appointments process fundamentally so as to render it less politicised, as with the ban on canvassing, which, as I said, I support, the continued presence of the Attorney General makes it clear the appointments process retains its political tenor.  That is not necessarily a bad thing and, indeed, under the Constitution, the Cabinet and the Government cannot be curtailed in their choice.<\/p><p>There is also an interesting academic debate about the importance of having a political voice in the selection of judges and that it should not just be, for example, judges choosing their own.  We are all conscious of the existence of affinity biases within selection and recruitment procedures generally, so I would be very much against any model that had judges simply, without any external influence, capable of choosing other candidates for the Judiciary.  That is important.<\/p><p>The difficulty is how the Attorney General's position will be left after section 27, in particular as amended by the Government amendments.  I want to say a little more about the constitutional function of the Attorney General as it will be affected by this section.  We know the principal constitutional function of the Attorney General is to act as legal adviser to the Government, in that capacity to attend all Government meetings and to advise the Government on all constitutional and legal issues which arise prior to or at Government meetings.  This would include whether proposed legislation such as this Bill complies with the provisions of the Constitution or with Acts and treaties of the European Union, the European Convention on Human Rights or other international treaties to which Ireland has acceded.  We are all well aware of these functions of the Attorney General.<\/p><p>There are other aspects to the role of the Attorney General, and this is where section 27 becomes significant.  For example, as the forensic representative, and this is topical in another setting, the Attorney General represents the State in legal proceedings.  The Attorney General is legal adviser to each Department and to certain other public bodies and, indeed, is the representative of the public in all legal proceedings for the enforcement of law and the assertion or protection of public rights.  The Attorney General defends the constitutionality of Bills referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution and in other constitutional proceedings.  I am reminded of being against Senator McDowell when he was Attorney General and I was arguing a case against the putting of a particular referendum to the people.  He won that case, but that is just an aside.  The Attorney General is an <i>ex officio<\/i>member of the Council of State, which the President can consult in regard to his or her exercise of certain powers and functions under the Constitution.  The Attorney General has functions in respect of the Law Reform Commission under the Law Reform Commission Act 1975.  As we know, as regards legislative programming, he or she is a member of the legislation committee chaired by the Government Chief Whip and also has a function under the Coroners Act 1962 to direct a coroner to hold an inquest where he or she considers that the circumstances of a person's death make the holding of an inquest advisable.<\/p><p>The Attorney General has other miscellaneous and limited statutory functions, for example, under the Geneva Conventions Act 1962.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Chief State Solicitor's office are constituent parts of the Attorney General's office and, accordingly, the principal legal functions carried out by the office as a whole include the provision of legal advice, legislative drafting, the provision of litigation conveyancing and other transactional services on behalf of the Government.<\/p><p>This is the point relating to section 27.  If the Attorney General is by statute appointed <i>ex officio<\/i>to membership of the commission, clearly he or she is so appointed in the capacity of the Government's legal adviser.  In that capacity, as in the other capacities I have outlined, a normal lawyer-client relationship has long since been recognised as arising.  This is the crucial point that Senator McDowell was suggesting when he spoke to the amendments to the section, although we have not yet had the opportunity to debate the section itself.  That normal lawyer-client relationship, as the Minister is aware, carries with it the normal principles of legal professional privilege.  If, as this statute purports to do, a statute appoints the Government's lawyer to be a member of a commission whose recommendations are brought back to Government to be discussed, it seems both unreasonable and unfeasible to seek to prohibit the lawyer from discussing with their client, that is, with the Government and the Ministers at Cabinet, what may have transpired at meetings of that commission.  That is the point about section 27.  It would seem to curtail the Attorney General from so doing.  This would be unreasonable because it encroaches upon the proper performance of the functions of the Government's legal adviser in regard to what is, under the Constitution, Government business.<\/p><p>To speak for a moment about the overall context, we are looking at legislation that seeks to reform judicial appointments fundamentally.  Of course, we still retain this political element in the appointment of judges, and that is the requirement under the Constitution.  However, any lawyer must be permitted to discuss fully and frankly the business of his or her client with the client.  This is the argument arising from the Attorney General's functions more globally and the role he or she has under other legislation, by convention and under the Constitution.  This facility to discuss fully and frankly the business of the client is all the more important if the lawyer is the Attorney General, the client is the Government and the business is vested in that client by the Constitution, as with the appointment of judges.  Any prohibition, therefore, is not just unreasonable but also unfeasible, and that is what would put the Attorney General in this invidious position.<\/p><p>Under the doctrine of Cabinet confidentiality, which was also raised in Senator McDowell's earlier discussion, details of what is discussed at meetings of the Government are inadmissible in any court or other proceedings.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This relates to section 27, but we will make a similar point about section 28.  Section 27 seeks to enact a rule in circumstances where it would be constitutionally impermissible to prove that the rule was ever breached.  We must recall how this section and section 28 fit within the existing provisions of the Constitution which provide for the concept of Cabinet confidentiality which were passed, as we know, in a referendum some years ago.  It is really where I would like to receive a response.  How can these points which are related to the putting of the Attorney General in an invidious position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>his or her client be addressed in section 27?<br\/><br\/>I looked back at what the Minister said in response to some of the matters raised by Senator McDowell on 6 November.  He said he had taken the opportunity to seek further advice on the status of the Attorney General.  He stated: &quot;It is clear from that advice that the Attorney General would not be at liberty to say that a candidate who was not the subject matter of a recommendation and whose name did not appear was, in effect, more suitable than any of the three people who were recommended.&quot;  It took me some time to unravel that sentence because there is a triple negative.  He is saying the Attorney General would not be free to say a candidate who was not the subject matter of a recommendation from the commission and whose name did not appear on a short list was more suitable than any of the three people recommended.  That is the point where we are saying the Attorney General's capacity to advise his or her client - the Government - in a full and frank manner is curtailed.<br\/><br\/>The Minister went on to say that when the Attorney General signed up to a report from the commission, &quot;it would be unlikely - in fact, it would be unacceptable - for him or her to say something completely different at a Cabinet meeting, or to do the opposite in practice.&quot;  Senator McDowell took issue with him on the point that the Attorney General should not be so curtailed.  He went on to say: &quot;To function properly as Attorney General, the individual in question should be free at a Cabinet meeting to express his or her views not merely as between the short-listed people, particularly when it is quite possible that he or she will not have agreed with the composition of the short list in the first place, but to indicate to the Government that there are other people who are interested in the job, have not been short-listed and, in his or her view, are more suitable for appointment.&quot;  That is a really fundamental constitutional point.  Does the Attorney General have this duty under the Constitution and does this function to be &quot;full and frank&quot;, as we might put it, derive from the constitutional relationship of the Attorney General as legal adviser to the Government and the normal rules of legal professional privilege?  If so, is that not a really problem with section 27?<br\/><br\/>In an attempt to be constructive, I looked at the Minister's responses to see if the answer had been given to the question.  I know that it was raised in the context of a debate on a group of amendments to section 27, rather than the substance of the section, but I cannot see a specific response to it.  I know that the Minister has said he does not see the position arising because if a Government were to choose not to go with a recommendation of the commission - I am paraphrasing a previous response - it would be rejecting a decision of the commission and also rejecting a decision to which the Attorney General was a party.  If I am correct, it is almost circular reasoning, as the Minister is saying that once the decision is made by the commission, there is an assumption that the Attorney General must have been a party to and, I presume, in agreement with it, but I am not sure if that is necessarily the case.  The argument is it would be invidious for the Government to refuse to follow the decision as it would go against the advice of its Attorney General, but I do not see how that can be the case.  The decision of the commission is not the same as Attorney General's legal advice.  Where the Attorney General gives advice to the Government, it is clearly a big problem if the Government fails to follow it.  It also demonstrates a lack of trust.  It is the fundamental issue of a breach of the relationship as the client would no longer be in a trusting relationship with the lawyer in refusing to follow the advice given.  It is clear if the Attorney General gives legal advice, but I do not see how the same conclusion can be drawn from a report of the commission just because the Attorney General is an <i>ex officio <\/i>member.  That does not necessarily mean that the Attorney General is in agreement with the decision or a party to it.  The Minister has said that in rejecting a decision or recommendation of the commission, the Government would be rejecting a decision to which the Attorney General was a party.  However, if I am right, that is the problem, as the Government would not know it because of section 27.  The Government would not know if the Attorney General was in agreement with the decision.  I would welcome an answer as I do not see it in earlier debates, but it is a very fundamental point.<br\/><br\/>There are related points and to be constructive I will mention a number of them.  The question was put as to whether the Attorney General could tell the Government if candidates recommended had previously been short-listed, rejected or turned down.  It is another question to which I could not see a specific answer.  A related question concerns the information given to the candidates who are short-listed.  If a candidate for judicial office has applied previously or been short-listed on previous occasions but turned down, can the judge be told?

Curiously, it looks like an insignificant section but it has interesting aspects.  One relates to the purpose of the section, which is to oblige the commission to keep a record of all applications made to it under section 39 and its deliberations and recommendations regarding appointments to judicial office.<\/p><p>Several issues arise in this regard.  Obviously, there is nothing wrong with the commission keeping a record of all applications made to it under section 39.  We will be coming to section 39 when we get to the later parts of the Bill - there are five parts to come.  One unusual feature of this statutory duty imposed on the commission is that in addition to its deliberation and decision, which would take the form of a recommendation, it has to record its deliberations as well.  That is an interesting point.  What are its deliberations?  In that context, what amounts to a proper record of deliberations?<\/p><p>Let us suppose there is a discussion about the suitability of a particular candidate and whether he or she should or should not be recommended.  Is what each person said in that discussion to be regarded as part of the commission's deliberations?  Are we imposing on the commission a strong duty not merely to say who it recommends and to keep a record of this, but to go the whole way and record its deliberations?  The term &quot;deliberations&quot; needs to be considered.<\/p><p>Let us suppose I was an applicant for a judicial position and my application was discussed and I was found suitable or unsuitable.  The process whereby I was determined to be suitable or unsuitable would have to be minuted.  This would include the conversations and a record of the persons voting this way and that way for my inclusion on the shortlist in the case of a vote or a lack of consensus.  From one view, the deliberations of the commission go further and require that the position taken by each person for or against any particular candidate and the basis of that judgment formed by each person, if it is articulated, should be recorded as well.  I find the idea that the commission should keep a record of its deliberations a particularly onerous obligation to be imposed.  I have asked myself to what end, <i>cui bono<\/i>?  Who will look at these deliberations?  Once the shortlist has come out, will someone go back afterwards and ask why the commission arrived at that particular shortlist?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Why should there be a record of the reasons they came to a particular short list which would necessarily involve reasons some people were not on it and others were?  Who will consult the record and who will have the right to consult it?  That is the big puzzle.  If the two previous sections, as amended, are enacted eventually, these deliberations will be confidential and it will be a criminal offence to disclose them, except as permitted by the two previous sections, as amended.  What I find difficult to understand is why it would be the case that the commission would be under a statutory obligation not merely to record who had applied to it and whom it had recommended but also its intervening deliberations.  If that statutory duty is cast on it, it seems that it must serve some purpose.  Given that there will be no accountability on the part of the commission for its deliberations, what purpose will the recording of deliberations serve?<br\/><br\/>The second thing that occurs to me about section 29 is that it is the first inkling we have had in the debate on the Bill so far of a distinction in procedure between applications made under section 39 for appointment to judicial office and a different, much narrower group of offices to which section 44 applies.  Section 44 deals with vacancies in the judicial offices of the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal and the President of the High Court.  The commission is obliged to keep a record of &quot;expressions of interest received by it under section <i>44(1)<\/i>&quot;.  It then states, &quot;and the particulars referred to in that section&quot;.  In that context, what are the particulars referred to?  They do not leap off the page as a particular category.  When one looks at section 44(1), there do not appear to be particulars which require recording.  What is meant by &quot;particulars&quot;?  In case it is argued that the phrases &quot;deliberations&quot; and &quot;recommendations&quot; are more or less the same, I draw the Minister's attention to the provisions of section 44(4) which distinguish between deliberating and making a recommendation.  I ask him to address these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#VV00300","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Section 29 reflects good practice across public bodies.  There is a requirement that records be kept.  As far as it is concerned, it will be for the commission to determine what those records will comprise.  It is regarded as proper practice for a body of this type across the public sector.  Public bodies are required to keep appropriate records, including minutes of meetings and important particulars about the manner in which certain decisions are arrived at.  Ultimately, the commission will determine what records it should keep.  I refer the Senator to section 53(5)(g) which stipulates requirements in the matter of keeping of records, referring to \"each step of the selection procedures undertaken and the retention of documentation supplied to the Commission\" and the need for good standards of communication, a matter with which we dealt.  They include records incorporated in section 29 that would accord with good practice across the public sector, including minutes, records of deliberations, recommendations and issues pertaining to appointments.<\/p> <p>Section 29(b), as the Senator, rightly, points out, relates to another method by which applications and expressions of interest will be put forward for three senior positions, those of Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal and President of the High Court.

Section 29(b) merely facilitates the keeping of records under section 44(1).  I do not see any mystery.  It is important in the context of good practice.

Subsection (5) states:<\/p><blockquote>In the preparation of the statement referred to in<i>subsection (1)(a)<\/i>, the Procedures Committee shall, amongst other matters, have regard to-<br \/><br \/>[&hellip;](g) the need for the keeping of records in relation to each step of the selection procedures undertaken and the retention of documentation supplied to the Commission in the course thereof.<\/blockquote><p>That is for the purpose of preparing a statement under that part of the Act.<br\/><br\/>This is a stand-alone provision which states that the commission shall - it is a mandatory duty - keep a record of its deliberations in addition to applications and recommendations.  It occurs to me that if, as the Minister accepts, the decisions of the judicial appointments commission are themselves susceptible of judicial review, on discovery it would be possible to find out the deliberations of the commission in respect of individual candidates.  It is not a very happy situation for people who apply, or for building up the confidence of those who apply, that somebody can apply for discovery and, for the purpose of making a case of bias or failure by the commission to follow its own criteria in making recommendations, may be able to sift through the records that are provided and then try to build a case that, say, it is not appointing enough women or is appointing too many middle-class people as opposed to other people to the commission, or whatever, and is failing to uphold its statutory duty, which is to take into account the need for diversity or something like that.<br\/><br\/>In that context, is it wise to require the commission to keep a record of its deliberations because deliberations are distinct from the decision to make a particular recommendation?  If they are going to be recorded and if there is an independent, free-standing statutory duty to record them, I keep asking who is going to look at these records afterwards.  Why are we requiring that the collective corporate thought process as to why one person should or should not be on the shortlist, rather than another, should be the subject of a record?  I wonder about that.<br\/><br\/>As there is a distinction between section 39 and section 44, will the Minister indicate whether it is his intention to keep in the text of the Bill the requirement that all sitting judges of the superior courts who want to be considered for promotion from the High Court to the Court of Appeal or from the High Court and the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court apply to the judicial appointments commission.  This is something that the Minister at one stage indicated he was open to persuasion on, that is, that existing superior court judges should not be required to engage in some kind of beauty contest in front of a group of others.  In my view, it has serious implications for their independence if they are looking over their shoulder at a group of laypeople to whom they must make a case for their own promotion.  Is the Minister still sticking to the proposition that existing members of the Judiciary must all make applications, be interviewed, provide character references and submit evidence of their suitability to be appointed to higher judicial office?  If it is still the Minister's intention to keep the distinction between section 39 and section 44, it raises questions about the whole architecture of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#WW00500","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>On the second point raised, there are a number of later amendments in this regard.

However, it occurs to me that, if we adopt the current wording of section 29, we are, in effect, approving in advance the distinction between certain senior judicial offices mentioned in section 44 as it now stands and all judicial offices insofar as section 39 applies to them.  I am very much opposed to section 44 as it stands and the requirement for all judges to submit their applications under section 39.  The Minister well knows the grounds on which I am opposed to that.  I think it is nobody's business at all on the judicial appointments commission, and I use those words very carefully, as to who the Government, in its wisdom, decides to elevate from the Court of Appeal or the High Court to the Supreme Court, whereas I have no problem with the Attorney General of the day sounding out the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal or whoever else about what kind of persons they need and how they think Joe Bloggs or Josephine Bloggs would function as a member of a collegiate court of that kind.  I have no problem with that; it is fine.  However, I strongly object to, and have always been opposed to the idea of, the Judiciary having a significant say in the promotion of judges from the High Court to the Court of Appeal, or from the High Court and the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court.<\/p><p>I do not want to stray into things we will be discussing later.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, I strongly believe that we cannot allow the Judiciary to become self-selecting by giving it the keys to the gate in terms of access to promotion within the judicial system.  That is one thing.  I believe even more strongly that it would be completely inconsistent with the function of Government if, in the case of a vacancy on the Supreme Court - such vacancies are very important in terms of the balance of that court, its collective outlook, its character and its composition - it was unable to appoint somebody because he or she was a liberal or a conservative, pro-European or moderately anti-European, or socially conservative or whatever.  These are issues which are entirely for the Government to deal with.  I do not see how the opinion of seven other people, some members of the Judiciary and a member of the Bar Council, expressed in a shortlist of three names, would be of any assistance to the Government if entirely different criteria are used in arriving at the composition of that shortlist.  If, for example, the shortlist is affected by the obligation to effect gender balance, social diversity or whatever, the Government may, in approaching a vacancy on the Supreme Court, simply say that it is not interested in whether the particular person it has in mind is a man or a woman and that it is much more concerned about his or her attitude on issues of social liberalism or social conservatism.  <br\/><br\/>Frankly, a shortlist from the group of people on this commission telling us that it has selected three people on entirely different criteria is of no assistance to us at all.  I am extremely sceptical in respect of judicial promotions and in respect of lay people and judges in combination making shortlist recommendations on the basis of criteria set out in this Act.  The Government must be free to choose whomever it wishes and must not be assisted by the judicial appointments commission's shortlist, which is designed to make it embarrassing for the Government to ignore the people on the shortlist because it would then have to signal to the public in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il <\/i>that the person it is appointing to the Supreme Court was not actually recommended by the commission.  People who read Iris Oifigi&uacute;il, and there are such people, especially intrepid reporters, will be able to work out whether somebody was or was not recommended by the commission by looking at the notice in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>.  If a particular lawyer or judge was selected for appointment to the Supreme Court by the Government, it would surely be a shadow on that person's appointment if it appeared, from careful examination of <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>, that he or she had not been shortlisted by a body on which the Judiciary and lay people were represented and which was charged with drawing up a shortlist of recommended persons.<br\/><br\/>Going back from that general proposition to this particular proposition, I know that the Minister has said that when he comes to my amendment, No. 90, he will engage with me on the subject, but it is not very satisfactory to think that we will engage when we get to that section of the Bill when this particular provision will have already cemented into place the distinction between section 39 and section 44 as they are currently constituted.  We will be on autopilot, so to speak, after that.  I ask the Minister to elaborate further on his thoughts now, before he asks us to make provision for section 44, as to whether he is happy with the present terms of section 44 or whether he is really open to amending it to make it so that promotional appointments in the superior courts are not covered by the Act.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#XX00300","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I note with interest that Senator McDowell warns himself against straying into further amendments and then proceeds to do so for a period of approximately 15 minutes.

In the event of the Bill being amended substantially later, we can of course revisit the sections under discussion on Report Stage.  Having been invited to make comment on later amendments, let me remind Senator McDowell of my disposition earlier in the legislation's progress, on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, when the Bill was very much reflective of Government policy and when I had in mind the existence of a senior judicial appointments committee which would deal exclusively with the three senior appointments of the Chief Justice, President of the High Court, and President of the Court of Appeal.  Senators will be aware that concept did not survive Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I attempted to garner sufficient support on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il for the reintroduction of such a body, but that again was defeated.  I indicated on Second Stage here in the Seanad that I was disposed towards looking at a type of configuration that would deal with the three top appointees for judicial office.  I note that Senator McDowell has included that in his later amendment and has, in fact, broadened it considerably.  I am reasonably favourably disposed towards it.  I hope that we can invite other Senators to participate in the debate at that stage.  I do not want to pre-empt a debate for later on but I assure Senator McDowell that in the event of an amending formula being found later in the course of Seanad deliberations on the Bill, we can revisit the section under discussion now at the stroke of a pen, as the Senator well knows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#YY00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I am glad to hear that hint of a hint that things might not be set in stone.

It is my very strong view that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board's system is far preferable to this one and if it needs a slight tweaking here or there, it will be far more effective than this one.<\/p><p>The Minister has stated that he believes his original estimate that it will cost &euro;1 million each year to have the judicial appointments commission function was perhaps too pessimistic from the point of view of the Exchequer and he hopes it might be closer to &euro;500,000 per year.  That is significantly more money than is currently spent on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  I cannot see for the life of me why we need a complicated bureaucratic structure involving not merely the commission, which is just an <i>ad hoc<\/i>group of people who meet from time to time, but now we are being told we need to set up a permanent institution, which will have permanent staff attached to it.  It is quite unnecessary.  <\/p><p>We have already had a discussion in the course of Committee Stage about whether the judicial appointments commission will require office accommodation, the word &quot;office&quot; in this case being with a small &quot;o&quot;.  That very much depends on how many people are to be attached to it.  As far as I can see, the commission will need to have meeting rooms as it will not meet in an hotel or whatever.  Unless it outsources to the private sector, it will also have interview rooms and committee rooms.  In addition, it will have staff.  If, as the Minister indicated, the commission will not be located in the same office as the Courts Service, one would imagine that it will have receptionists, telephonists and all of the usual panoply that goes with the establishment of a separate office.  That is a very significant expenditure to add to the public service bill. <\/p><p>Section 30(1) states that the office is to &quot;assist the Commission in the performance of its functions&quot;, while section 30(2) states the Office &quot;shall be funded by moneys provided by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.&quot;  Section 30(3) states the office &quot;shall be under the management and control of the Commission and subject to the direction of the Director.&quot;  We know that there to be a full-time position of director, under the commission, effectively to do day-to-day direction of the staff of the office.  Section 30(4) states the commission &quot;may, with the consent of the Minister for Justice and Equality given with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, appoint such and so many persons to be members of the staff of the Office as it may determine.&quot;  <i>Prima facie<\/i>, what we are dealing with here is a decision by an independent body as to what its staff requirements are and that filling those staff positions will be subject to obtaining the consent of the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform.  We should have a very clear picture of what we are authorising the commission to do.  How many people is it intended to have appointed under section 30(4)?  <\/p><p>I believe the Minister told us on the last occasion the proposed seniority in public service appointment terms of the director of the commission.

If it is too much for him to say it again, so be it.  I will consult the Official Report later to see what the answer was.<\/p> <p>There is a second point: the terms and conditions of service of a member of the staff of the office shall be determined by the commission with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Is it the case that the terms and conditions of a member of staff will be tied to those of public service grades?  Will the commission be free to employ part-time staff or hire whomsoever it wishes on whatever terms it wishes?  Will public sector pay policy be imposed by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform?  I note that a member of staff of the office is supposed to be part of the Civil Service of the State.  That is appropriate and I have no problem with it.  However, I have to ask whether somebody appointed under this section will have longevity of tenure on the same terms as a public servant.  Will he or she be there until the age of 65 years if he or she so wishes, or whatever the retirement age will be, or will he or she be on a short-term contract?  It is a matter of interest.  This quango should be the subject of a repeal as soon as possible because it is an expensive mistake.  I would not like a load of people to be appointed to it with the expectation that they have jobs for life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#CCC00800","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I take that as a statement of intent on the part of the Senator that he wants to be in the D&aacute;il at the earliest opportunity to exercise his power to support the repeal of the legislation.  In the meantime, I have to say again that this is an important pillar of Government policy.  Without repeating issues to which reference has been made by me and others, it is anticipated that the position of director will be at principal officer - higher - level.  A small staff is envisaged.  The reason for the lower estimate at this point in the debate than that initially given is the Bill was amended considerably in the course of its passage through the Lower House, with particular reference to the removal of a number of committees.  I will repeat that, as far as the comparison between the new commission and the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is concerned, we are not really comparing like with like.  The staffing costs of the JAAB are estimated to be in the region of &euro;50,000 per year, but much of its budget comes directly within the Courts Service Vote.  In this case, the commission's budget will come within the general justice Vote.<\/p> <p>On staff numbers, the issues of contracts for staff and whether they will be part-time or full-time will be determined by the commission as envisaged under section 30(4).  It is not really possible for me at this stage to be prescriptive in the actual operational cost down to the last euro.  I cannot say for certain where the office premises will be located or how much they will cost, but I point to similar bodies set up under enactments of the Oireachtas in recent years.  I refer, in particular, to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  I also note the importance of the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, particularly in respect of the terms and conditions of service of a member of staff and the need to ensure staff costs in this body will be similar to those in other public service bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018111400002#CCC00900","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>The comparison to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority is useful.
