The report of the working group released last week has caused an awful lot of distress to families in County Donegal and probably County Mayo.  The Minister is well aware of the mental health issues and grievances of and difficulties faced by families and this seems to be adding to them in terms of the sum of &euro;3.2 billion that has been put out there, which had not been discussed within that forum.

There is also mention of &euro;350,000 in the report last week.  Building costs in Donegal have increased by 40% to 50% in the last nine months alone.  If one were to incorporate that increase against the old ceiling of &euro;275,000, the sum of &euro;350,000 would not address the cost required in Donegal.  I hope any new proposals in the scheme take cognisance of that.<\/p><p>Could the Minister inform the House when he expects to meet the three party leaders?  Can he inform us of any timeline regarding any changes in the scheme that he intends to make and announce?  Will planning exemption be a part of the scheme?  If so and if a family wishes to downsize to a smaller scale of the same house within the original print of the house, will they be part of any such exemption?  With regard to the square footage caps of the old scheme, is there an intention now to set them aside and to go purely on a cost basis?

First, I commend the residents and their representatives on the input they had into the working group.  I inherited the original scheme.  The scheme was agreed and launched in 2020.  One of the first visits I made when I was appointed Minister in summer 2020 was to Donegal, where I visited homeowners.  I met residents in Buncrana, where I announced that the scheme the previous Government had brought forward would be a multi-annual scheme.  I want to assure people that whatever changes happen will happen across the board.<\/p> <p>I also said in Buncrana that day, and the Senator was there, that any scheme I have seen in the past has always evolved.  It is only by engaging with the scheme that we find out what the deficiencies are and, indeed, if there are positives in it in some areas.  That has occurred.  I said in a statement last week after I met the residents that the scheme as it is currently constituted does not work as intended and must be greatly enhanced.  As Minister, I committed to doing that.  When residents of Donegal and Mayo came to Dublin in the summer I met them.  I committed to setting up a time-bound working group, and I did that.  The working group was to get their views on board by meeting with the most senior officials in my Department, from Secretary General, assistant secretary general to principal officers, to go through every aspect of the scheme and the issues the residents had found with it.  We did that.  The residents asked for an extension to the end of September, which we were happy to give, to get separate engineering advice.  I brought the Housing Agency into the process.  I have said from the start, even in Donegal in July 2020, that I believe the Housing Agency should have a role in this, and I still believe that.  I believe it will.<\/p> <p>The working group report was published last Friday.  It was circulated to all Opposition spokespersons on Monday seeking the input of other parties into it.  I am acutely aware that residents have been disappointed with aspects of the report and some of the commentary on it.  I committed to the residents that their full request, as in the residents' submission, would be one of the options that would go to the Government as well and would be published as part of the working group.  The other aspect was effectively a summary of the discussions that were held to date.  That is there, and I wish to reiterate to all Senators that nothing is off the table.  Our job now, which I said directly to the working group when I attended the meeting on 29 September, is to work through the options and through the enhancements.  I will do that.  In what I will bring forward to the three party leaders and to the Government I will be proposing significant enhancements to the scheme that was brought forward by the previous Government, which committed at the time to a projected expenditure of approximately &euro;1.4 billion.  Any increases or enhancements to the scheme, and this is understood by the residents too, will lead to a further increase there, and I will have to get that agreed by the Cabinet.  I am committed to doing that.  We are working through the details now.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach is in Slovenia at present.  I expect to meet with the party leaders, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in the coming days.  We are preparing a submission and a memorandum to bring forward to the Cabinet.  There are a number of issues on which we have made real progress.  For example, removing upfront costs has been agreed, including rent cost, as well as clarifying storage.  Planning exemptions have also been agreed and, importantly, a guarantee on second grant access, something that was sought, and the role of the Housing Agency.  Very significant progress has been made on many of the serious issues that were raised directly by the residents and Members of the Oireachtas, such as Senator Blaney, in Donegal and Mayo.  I will bring the defective block arrangements for improvements for the scheme to the Cabinet in the coming weeks.  I have to get agreement for that at the Cabinet.  It is not a decision I can make alone.  However, I have kept the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform abreast of the work we are doing and they all have been very supportive of that.<\/p> <p>I want residents to be able to get on with their lives.  I want them to have hope and trust in a scheme that they can actually access, and for them to know that in the terrible tragedy that they have been living through, which is not of their making, the Government is here to help them to get their lives back on track.  I am committed to doing that.

It is important to know that we have a consensus on this and how we are approaching it because whatever scheme is put in place will be with us for a number of years and will endure past the term of this Oireachtas into the next one.

There are no upfront costs now.  I will take this opportunity to say that any changes we bring forward, which are going to be significant, will apply to anybody who currently has an application in the scheme and will apply to any county that comes into the scheme.  Finally, I believe this will also require legislation.  I have said that to the residents' group.  We cannot just keep adding counties to it.

The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, was unable to attend due to prior commitments in his schedule but I appreciate the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, taking this Commencement matter.  What I am proposing is a sensible, proactive and reasonable measure which would increase the supply of smaller homes to enable individuals and couples to right-size into them.  The Housing for All policy document commits the Government to, &quot;Increase the housing options available to older people to facilitate ageing in place with dignity and independence, including policies and operational supports for older people considering right-sizing to smaller housing homes&quot;.  It goes on to state that there will be a specific focus on the delivery of housing which is appropriately sized and in line with age friendly and universal design principles.<\/p><p>Naturally the policy position around right-sizing will be optional.  Unfortunately many scaremongering narratives seem to take hold when discussing this topic, which can be emotive for some people and understandably so.  Nobody will be forced to move homes but incentives may become available which would make it financially attractive for some to do so.  That being said, not everybody is interested in the financial side of things.  I have spoken to many older individuals and couples in recent times who have told me they are ready to right-size because the house they are in has become too big for them to manage and maintain but they cannot find a suitable smaller property to move into.  This has the impact of not being able to free up larger housing stock for families.<\/p><p>One of the barriers which has been brought to my attention by two builders in Waterford is the density requirement, which is being rightly requested by planners in line with national policy.  Waterford has been designated as one of the five main centres for 50% to 60% population growth out to 2040 and much of that will result in compact development within the outer ring road.  However, 35 units to per hectare is not always conducive to the delivery of appropriately sized housing schemes that are specifically geared at older persons.  That is why I am asking for a circular to be issued to all local authorities to inform them that the density requirements can be relaxed for land zoned for residential use when purpose built housing for older persons is being proposed.<\/p><p>I also want to acknowledge the Trojan work done by my Fine Gael colleagues, including former Minister of State, Jim Daly, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, for their work on the development of the Housing Options for Our Ageing Population policy document.  That policy acknowledges that as people age, their housing needs are likely to change.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tA key principle underpinning the Government housing policy is to support older people to live in their own home with dignity and independence for as long as possible.  The aim is to ensure that older people will have greater choice by developing a range of housing options that are suited to their needs, so they can plan ahead and, insofar as possible, choose the right home for them. <\/blockquote> <p>However, in order to achieve those goals we have to look at giving specific guidance to local authorities to relax the density requirements where such proposals are forthcoming, particularly for our urban areas.  I hope that request can be acceded to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#C00300","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  It is important to clarify that current planning guidance seeks to ensure that the diverse needs of our society are catered for by facilitating a greater mix of housing typologies.  This includes a choice of accommodation types for older people.  It is a key objective of Government to encourage a shift in the pattern and format of future development towards more compact urban growth to support proper planning and sustainable development and to address climate change.  Compact growth is the first national strategic objective in the national planning framework and the national development plan.<\/p> <p>Guidelines on sustainable residential development in urban areas were originally published by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2009 to build on density guidelines that date back to 1999.  This is to enable more sustainable patterns of development, also taking into account the critical need to ensure the availability and choice of housing, including for older people as the Senator said.  The efficient use of urban land, existing service amenities and infrastructure and issues such as traffic congestion, competitiveness and public health also need to be taken into account.<\/p> <p>In terms of the issues raised, it may be helpful to set out some key information.  Guidelines require net housing densities of more than 50 dwellings per hectare in central urban areas and 35 or more dwellings per hectare in larger towns, especially those close to cities and in the suburban areas of cities.  Achieving 35 dwellings and over per hectare is essential to cater for the needs of a more diverse range of households, including smaller households such as older couples trading down or younger people who may wish to live in apartments, thereby creating choice and flexibility for people to continue living in their communities as their housing requirements change.  The guidelines also provide scope for densities below 35 dwellings per hectare, especially in smaller towns and villages.  To emphasise this, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage issued a circular to all planning authorities early this year to provide clarity on the interpretation and application of the guidance and to enable lower residential densities in certain circumstances.  This is in advance of issuing updated density guidelines that will address sustainable residential development in urban areas and which is progressing in the Department.  Updated guidelines will allow for a greater range of densities and housing typologies relative to context and location.  This is to provide for greater diversity in urban and regional contexts as elements of the housing building sector have tended to remain focused on the more traditional housing formats, rather than developing new products tailored to changing demographic needs.<\/p> <p>Providing a range of housing options is a Government priority and for older people who are committed to ensuring that they are supported to stay in their homes and communities for as long as possible.  This is in line with the vision for an age friendly Ireland in which older people can live long and healthy lives, participate in their communities and have a range of housing options and health supports available to them to make this possible.  Housing for All, launched earlier this month, targets the delivery of more homes of all types for people with different housing needs.  The housing needs of older people are specifically addressed in several actions in Housing for All.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#C00400","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that densities of below 35 per hectare are permitted in smaller towns and villages and I welcome that circular the Department issued.

Curiously, several energy suppliers that claim to offer 100% renewable electricity are also raising their prices.  How are companies that are supposedly 100% renewable exposed to the volatility in the gas market?  At least part of the answer has to do with the fact that they are not 100% renewable at all.  For that reason, I will talk about greenwashing by electricity suppliers in this country.  When a person signs up with a 100% renewable supplier, he or she is probably expecting that his or her electricity will be generated from wind, solar or hydro power but in reality, 100% renewable involves suppliers getting electricity from whatever dirty fossil fuel source they like and buying pieces of paper to offset the non-renewable electricity.  These are called guarantees of origin.  One guarantee of origin corresponds to a megawatt hour of renewable electricity.  It is a financial document.  If a supplier wants 100% renewable electricity, it simply buys from a producer that offers the guarantees alongside the sales.  It seems straightforward, but it is not because there does not seem to be a link between the physical electricity and the guarantees.  An energy supplier offering 100% renewable can simply buy the guarantees from anywhere in Europe but the actual electricity delivered will still come from the power plants in Ireland.  For example, a consumer on a 100% renewable tariff could be getting coal-fired power from Moneypoint.  On paper, it will read as 100% renewable because the supplier has bought a guarantee from as far away as Greece, regardless of the fact that there is no interconnector between Greece and Ireland.  It is this unbundling from actual usage that lets companies greenwash dirty electricity.<\/p> <p>It is a hugely damaging practice because people have a right to know where their energy is coming from.  If they want to avoid fossil fuels, there is no way of knowing which energy company does not use them.  Several of the 18 suppliers whose fuel mixes were disclosed this week by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, claim to be 100% renewable but this is simply not true.  Customers are being misled.  This system disincentivises real investment in renewable energy.  Why would a supplier bother investing in actual renewable energy when it can invest buttons in pieces of paper in order to claim to be 100% renewable?  It can cost as little as 30 cent to greenwash a family's annual consumption of 3 MWh.  Some generators enjoy the trickle of income but according to the UK regulator Ofgem, there is no evidence that 100% renewable tariffs materially support the production of renewable energy over and above what is already in place so it is bad for consumer confidence.  We know we need a lot more renewable energy in this country but in many parts, its reputation is already in tatters so playing games with bits of paper brings the renewable energy industry into further disrepute.<\/p> <p>Big tech companies like Amazon are also buying these guarantees of origin to cover the non-renewable energy they use in Ireland while their web services support logistics for greater and faster extraction of fossil fuels.  These practices are also bad for those suppliers that are actually making a stand and buying more from renewables.  Regardless of what efforts they make to buy actual electricity from renewable sources, there will always be others that will simply greenwash by buying these certificates.  This is a murky problem that has to do with how energy suppliers are taking advantage of loopholes in the way they report their annual emissions in the fuel mix disclosure.

The CRU plays a very important role in ensuring that electricity companies are transparent on the source of their electricity through the publication of their annual fuel mix information paper and through the requirement that electricity suppliers publish their own fuel mix on all bills issued to customers.<\/p> <p>As we aim for a climate-neutral economy by 2050, the low-carbon transition has become a defining force for business.  For Irish companies, this means opportunities to compete and grow as global investment in a greener future accelerates.  Enterprises that make the move early to reduce their carbon footprint will be more resilient to climate change impacts, including the rising costs of mitigation against transition risks such as policy changes, reputational impacts, shifts in customer preference and evolving supply chain requirements.  Businesses that take action to mitigate the risks of climate change and those with environmental credentials can benefit from increased access to environmentally conscious customers, markets and workers; green equity and loan funding; and support from local communities.  The European Commission proposal in April 2021 to amend the non-financial reporting directive and to introduce a corporate sustainability reporting directive was welcome.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is engaging with the EU regarding these developments.<\/p> <p>Companies giving a false impression of their environmental impacts or benefits make it difficult for businesses and consumers to make informed decisions and increase the uncertainty about how to best tackle the climate crisis.  The 2009 internal market in electricity directive contained a provision, which, following transposition into Irish law, required the CRU to ensure electricity suppliers provide reliable fuel mix information on all bills and promotional materials issued to customers.  The 2019 internal market in electricity directive underpins the fuel mix disclosure.  The CRU publishes an annual information paper setting out the fuel mix disclosure and the CO2 emissions for suppliers licensed in Ireland and operating in the single electricity market.  It includes an all-island fuel mix.<\/p> <p>Electricity suppliers publish their own fuel mix information, as well as the all-island information, on all bills no later than two months after the publication of this information paper.  This provides consumers with information on the recent environmental impact of electricity from the supplier compared with the all-island average.  A supplier's fuel mix information must be presented on bills in accordance with certain requirements.  Where fuel mix information is presented on the back of a consumer bill, reference must be made to it on the front of the bill.  CO2 information should be given in units of grams of CO2 per kW.  In addition to fuel mixed disclosure requirements, the CRU's decision paper on the regulation of green-sourced products in the electricity retail market governs the display of fuel mix information for suppliers who offer green-sourced products.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frankie Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Suppliers may use a guarantee of origin certificate, which is an instrument defined in the renewable energy directive that certifies that electricity is generated from renewable energy sources.

He will be aware the Cassells report was published in 2016.  For five years, it has been kicked to touch, but having sought advice at European level, we did get an assurance from the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science that we will finally come to crunch time - I believe the phrase he used was \"this is the year\" - and that there would be an update published this autumn on how we are proceeding with implementing the report.  My question and that of most of the sector is when we will see that update this autumn.  Will we clearly see, either as part of the budgetary process next week or in the very near future after that, a clear timetable to ensure we have a sustainable model for funding of higher education?<\/p> <p>Higher education has been underfunded, as I am sure the Minister of State is aware, but during the pandemic the situation became even more critical.  Higher education institutions and students responded very well in difficult circumstances, but the financial challenge facing those institutions grew even more.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the income from international students effectively collapsed and the opportunity to gain income from commercial activities also disappeared.  We also saw a significant increase in the number of higher education places in terms of the number of students coming through the CAO system, which was most welcome.  I think it is something we should be very proud of in this country that we have one of the highest participation rates in higher education in the world.  Even though all those additional places were made available, and students will talk about this, the additional staffing and resources behind it were not there to match it.<\/p> <p>Therefore, I am asking the following questions.  Will we see the publication of the report quite soon?  In the budget, or soon after, will we see a sustainable plan for the long-term funding of higher education?  The Minister has also promised we will have a national strategy on research, which will be crucial for this country's long-term development.  The current Government allocation for research and development is 0.94% of GDP, which is well below the EU average of 1.4%.  There is also a commitment to undertake a review of SUSI, which is particularly important to students.  Students are experiencing enormous financial difficulty at the moment.  This is feeding into the funding crisis in higher education.  I would appreciate an update soon on where we are with the SUSI review.<\/p> <p>During the course of the pandemic, we saw the operation of a number of very inclusive working groups for the higher education institutions and those in the sector to try to resolve the problems.  It has been a tradition in higher education that the approach would always be collaborative.  This makes sense.  I understand the group dealing with student accommodation is now being reconvened.  It is important that all of the players are involved.  However, in terms of this country's long-term development, everybody accepts our investment has to be in education, training and research.  We have been kicking this can down the road for far too long.  I am hoping the Minister of State will be able to provide us with some kind of update today on what is happening with the Cassells report and whether we will see a long-term strategy to ensure a sustainable higher education sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#E00500","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this important matter.<\/p> <p>The expert group report of 2016, entitled Investing in National Ambition: A Strategy for Funding Higher Education, confirmed that higher education makes a hugely positive contribution to the development of individuals, employers, society and the State.  The report concluded that the approach to funding at the time was unsustainable and that substantial increases in investment in higher education must be made to ensure the sector can remain viable and provide the capacity to meet the major increase in student demand projected up to 2030.<\/p> <p>In advance of and since the publication of the 2016 report, my Department has been working hard to deliver a significant programme of reinvestment in higher education.  It is important to acknowledge that, since 2015, a very significant programme of reinvestment in higher education has been implemented.  Over that period, current public expenditure allocated to the higher education sector has increased by in excess of half a billion euro or almost 40%.<\/p> <p>Funding and policy developments taken in recent budgets have taken significant steps to address the funding needs of the sector.  Most notably and in line with the recommendation of the Cassells report, a new stream of employer funding was introduced upon a review of the National Training Fund.

My Department has commenced its examination of the report's analysis, findings, conclusions and recommendations to develop proposals to bring to the Government to seek its support for a sustainable future funding model and transformed further education and training, FET, and higher education, HE, sector as contained in the statement of strategy.

Extra funding or support should go to the Rural Link service, which does absolutely tremendous work linking smaller communities and villages with larger towns.  I know from experience in Kildare, where Mr. Alan Kerry is chief executive, there is an excellent service but it could be so much more if it was funded for development.  In a household a second car may be required to go perhaps ten miles to a local railway station in order to commute to Dublin.  If there was extra funding, it might be possible to enable a minor bus link to join a larger commuting hub, which would be well worth doing.  We must also look again at rail fares, which must be affordable, accessible and flexible.  We must have a medium hop zone between Sallins and Portarlington, as commuters and students in particular may not be able to afford accommodation in Dublin at this point.<\/p> <p>It was very refreshing to hear dads on the radio yesterday speaking about international surrogacy.

It is really a red letter day to see a project going ahead to construction in the coming weeks.  It has been a long-running saga.  The first phase commenced in 2014 and the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, sanctioned the upgrade of the road into Moycullen.

There is still no fund for new communities - a fund of scale.  Small communities probably find it easier, which is ironic, because there is a lower population.  Very often a field might be donated to them or they can get money through the LEADER programme or whatever else whereas for large, growing communities where land is zoned and expensive, there is no fund to which they can apply for a few million euro, plus they must try to negotiate or work with the local authority on rates or the development contributions to get things going.  I have pleaded for something.  There has to be an opportunity there because we encourage people to support housing projects and to welcome new houses, which we need, and yet the infrastructure piece in terms of amenities and community centres is not always there.

It would also be timely because of the controversy we hear these days about soccer players not taking the vaccination.  I am thinking of Callum Robinson and the ongoing news story there.  Speaking as somebody who chose to be vaccinated, there is a delicate balance to be reached.  It is undeniable that we want people to take up the vaccine and it is more than legitimate for people in authority to propose this to people, such as soccer coaches and managers.  There is, however, also a need to respect human freedom.  Where we need to get in this area is to a culture of ethical and informed decision making by people.  A person might refuse a vaccine because he or she subscribes to some conspiracy theory.  Equally, he or she might refuse to take a vaccine because he or she has arrived at a personal decision about the ethics of the vaccine or issues of safety as he or she has made his or her judgment listening to whatever news is available to him or her, and that has to be respected.

It is further compounded by the fact that the northern distributor road, an absolutely key part of infrastructure in Limerick, is not even mentioned in regard to the NDP.  This road would complete the opening up of Moyross, and I would ask the question as to whether the Green Party really want to go back there again.  It would also ensure that we could have transiting buses crossing the city.  It is, therefore, crucial for public transport as well as road transport.

At present when you approach the Matthew roundabout, you see cars queueing outside the motorway turn off.  That is the extent of the chaos and traffic congestion right now.  Yet there appears to be no plan from this Government to address that matter, or to complete the Atlantic corridor.  I call for an urgent debate in regard to this issue.  The people of Limerick must not be left to be second class citizens again in regard to this plan.<\/p><p>I again raise the issue of Julian Assange.  He is facing his appeal trial at the end of the month.  We are very good in the Seanad at raising human rights issues.  It is something we should all be proud of, and we did it again last night in regard to Belarus.  I commend all the speakers in that regard.  Julian Assange's only crime was to outline what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan, to expose US war crimes.  If he is extradited he faces 175 years in jail.  <i>The Irish Times <\/i>gave us an editorial calling for this process to be stopped.  It is hardly a bastion of radical left wing thought.  Amnesty International has called for it, as has <i>The Washington Post.  <\/i>Why will no one on the Government benches simply say what all of us know to be true, that the extradition of Julian Assange should be stopped and the man should be released and recognised for the huge service he has done for humanity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#H00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Over the past eight weeks, I have had reason to meet a considerable number of apartment dwellers in the area of Dublin Central where I am based.  They live in apartment blocks which were built in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and over the past three to four years, they have had to come to terms with the horrendous reality that they are living in units that are effectively fire hazards, and units that are riddled with construction defects.  Despite the impressive exterior of many of these apartments, behind that there are instances of negligent design and contemptible behaviour with regard to construction standards.  There are cavity barriers that are not mechanically fixed, there is no fire stopping around many openings, there is soil in service pipes, insulation cladding has been found to contain combustible material, and the list goes on.  This is a nightmare that thousands of people living in apartments in this city and throughout the country have to deal with day in, day out.<\/p> <p>The consequences for many apartment owners and dwellers is that they face bills of up to &euro;50,000.  For some, that bill will be spread over a number of years.  I know of one apartment block where &euro;15,000 is demanded of each owner between now and the end of the year.  For some, that is simply impossible.  Failure to provide it will mean that they will not get insurance and, of course, will have to live with the risk that they are living in a unit that could go on fire at any time.  Yet, the people who fraudulently signed off on the self-certified fire safety certificates, the well known names around this city who built those apartment blocks, continue to design and get planning permission for further developments in this city and throughout the country, and there are no consequences for them for the havoc they have left behind them.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt a number of legislative changes are needed, and that the State needs to step in with regard to a fund.  There is, however, an immediate action that the Government can take next week, which I hope will be relayed back.

She is the Facebook whistleblower who revealed a number of things many of us have heard about Facebook and some of the other social media companies.  It is very clearly the case that Facebook has put company above country and, in many ways, above ethics.  I raised this issue previously.  It will come before these Houses in the context of the discussion on the online safety and media regulation Bill, the debate on the need for greater transparency, the need to ensure these social media companies are properly regulated and, when it comes to algorithmic decision-making, the need for us to have clear policies in place.  I want to make it clear that I expect the legislation that will be brought forward by the Government will be sufficiently strong and we will have an online safety commissioner with real teeth.  If we do not, I will have a problem supporting the legislation.  We need to address some of the underlying issues, which pose some of the greatest threats to society and to our democracy.<\/p> <p>It is also important we have a broader debate on the changes to the world of work, post pandemic.  I have also raised this issue previously, but in the context of the skills shortages we are now experiencing, while there are many excellent initiatives through Springboard and others, we are seeing such rapid changes that we need to look at how we upskill and reskill all our citizens to be able to avail of those.

In the past few days, 82 people were on trolleys despite the fact that a 60-bed modular unit was commissioned and built in the hospital within the past 18 months or so.  We are still in a situation where 82 people are on trolleys.  God only knows what it will be like in January.  I put that to the Minister and I did not get a satisfactory reply.  We need a debate in this House on how emergency departments throughout the country are being managed.  We also need a debate on the winter plan once it is published.

In County Clare, there is a need for wastewater facilities to be built in places such as Doolin, Carrigaholt, Cooraclare and Broadford, to name only four.  I will specifically talk about Doolin because it is operating at almost 100% capacity for approximately ten months of the year, but it could do so much more.  Many people in Doolin are prepared to invest in developing products, accommodation, tourism facilities and so on.  They cannot do it, however, because if they apply for planning permission they will not get it on the basis that the wastewater and sewerage system is at capacity.  Let us get the basics right and development will happen.  I would like a debate on the issue of wastewater and sewerage development in rural Ireland, especially in areas where investment can happen if the structure and infrastructure is in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#J00300","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>There has been a lot of conversation on the energy crisis this past week in the media and both Houses.

Senator Joe O'Reilly rightly stated that we have to avoid energy poverty and we must ensure that low-income households do not suffer on account of the transition to renewable energy sources.

They hope the employment wage subsidy scheme continue because at the moment it is masking major deficits in the national childcare scheme.  Ultimately, the Seanad should be ambitious.  I would love to see a motion tabled in this House on a national childcare scheme.  Childcare should be brought within the ambit of the Department of Education and all children from the age of two should have free early preschool childcare within a more streamlined and regulated environment, such as the Department of Education.  We should lead on it in the Seanad and campaign for it together because when we work together our voices are much stronger than individual ones.<\/p> <p>I also raise the issue of the assisted capacity legislation, which was enacted in 2015.

Anyone with diminished capacity is affected by this legislation not being implemented.  There are families looking to place parents in nursing homes and children with severe disabilities who cannot manage their financial affairs.  There is a major struggle going on within families throughout the country.

The policy lab came about after extensive engagement with more than 2,500 participants via a survey, followed by intensive policy kitchens to allow group discussions, feedback and the shaping of ideas from parents, childcare providers and early years professionals, which was particularly instructive.

In the second case a young man waited an hour lying on the ground in the rain for an ambulance and the fire brigade to arrive.

I have done the measurements and it would reduce the existing route by 100 m.  The answer I have received so far is another bone of contention.  The responses I have received have not been satisfactory.  I ask that common sense prevails.  It is administration gone mad.

Even in the letter the council sent out, a copy of which I have here, it states that if the funeral is on at the weekend, of course the offices are closed so one cannot make a payment.

She has been shouted at, followed and attacked twice in two years while living here.  She was attacked by a group of teenagers when she was getting off the Luas.  We cannot tolerate this kind of behaviour.  We are asking foreign nationals to come to this country and share their skills, labour and time with our economy, if nothing else.  Beyond that, they are our neighbours in humanity, if that is not putting the matter too tritely.  It is unacceptable that this kind of behaviour would continue and it is time we put a stop to it.  I do not know what the answer is but I ask that we have a debate on the issue and explore whether we need more resources, more legislative solutions or something else.  We cannot allow this awful, disgusting and intolerable situation to continue.  Something must be done to put a stop to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#L00500","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I wish to talk about an issue that affects my local area and other areas across the country, that is, the severe lack of carers in the country to be able to provide home care packages.  It is an issue I have been dealing with over recent months, particularly with one family.  I spoke to Sin&eacute;ad, the daughter of the lady for whom I have been working, and she gave me permission to mention the following story, which highlights the issue we have in providing carers.  Ann Hearty was 61 years of age when, unfortunately, she had a debilitating stroke.  She was to be discharged from the hospital, pending a home care package, on 20 September 2021.  However, 17 days later, here we are on 6 October, and she has not been discharged due to a lack of carers.<\/p> <p>The family were unable to apply for a housing adaptation grant because the sheer amount of money required was too much for what a housing adaptation grant could provide.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John McGahon:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They put a serious amount of their life savings into adapting their home so Anne could come home, yet she is sitting in a hospital bed in Dundalk.  She has been unable to come home for 17 days because, while 50% of the carers needed can be provided, the other 50% cannot.  How can we turn around with a straight face to a family and say we want their loved one to continue occupying a hospital bed and that she cannot be taken home because of a lack of home care packages and carers?<\/p><p>The reason I ask about this is simple.  I do not just want to have debate because we all have different stories and anecdotes about this; I want an answer.  First, I want to know why there is such a lack of carers.  Is this something that has emerged because of Covid?  Was it clouded in the mists of Covid such that it is only on emerging from Covid that we realise there is a situation?  Why do we have a lack of carers?  What does the Government want to do to resolve it?  In this day and age, it is just not acceptable to have discharge dates overdue for 17, 18, 19 or 20 days.  People want to be cared for in the home.  We need to have them looked after in the home and to get them home.  We can do that only with proper carers.  I would love to know why we do not have them at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#L00600","speaker":"1670","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues.  Senator McGahon asked the $64 million question.  I would love to know the answer.  An obvious answer is that caring is a bloody hard job.  Some of the conditions that the State has imposed on private care providers make it even harder for them to do their hard job.  They make it harder to recruit people to do the hard job.  One concerns the rate of pay, which is &euro;11 per hour, although I am aware the HSE pays a little more.  A carer might have to look after one person in Dundalk and another in Blackrock, County Louth, but the time taken to travel between both houses is not included in his or her working day.  This is ludicrous.  A genuine review of the national strategy on carers is certainly long overdue.  It should be prioritised by the Department of Health.  We met representatives of Family Carers Ireland and other such organisations in the past couple of weeks when they were on their pre-budget tour.  There are certainly several small things we could do as a State and Government to go a long way towards providing the support structures needed for family carers, and improving working conditions and, hopefully as a consequence, the recruitment prospects of the private companies that provide the care, which is so valuable in our communities, on behalf of the State.  I will write a letter to the Minister for Health and ask him about the status of the review of the carers strategy.<\/p> <p>Senator Ward raised an issue we touched upon last week.  I am referring to the video of the attack on the young Deliveroo rider, whom we all know is new to Ireland and who is probably working in the gig economy, being paid buttons and being mistreated.  Senator Seery Kearney has met the Deliveroo people.  I will not say that we need to accept that we will always have troublemakers in Ireland looking for trouble.  When I looked at the video, the thing that made me feel the most shame was the crowd of Irish people standing around cheering on the tramps attacking the young man.  What the Senator has described means we have a problem with the culture, including the changing culture, in this country.  That is not something that is going to go away on its own.<\/p> <p>I was dismayed to hear the assistant Garda Commissioner telling us on television on Monday that we do not have a problem, that we have vibrant cities and that everything is wonderful.  This morning, I was pleased to hear our Minister for Justice not contradict but perhaps disagree slightly with the assistant commissioner and say there will be a new active policing plan introduced, not just for Dublin but for all the other urban areas where there is a growing antisocial behaviour problem.  I am not sure whether that will address incidents such as the throwing of eggs at the Chinese woman getting off the Luas, as described earlier, and the name-calling or other forms of insidious racist behaviour that are a growing problem in this country.  Maybe we need a more universal or national debate on how we can address this.  I am not quite sure whether something like a citizens' assembly would highlight the matter but some forum needs to be found in which people can share, in full view of other Irish people, their experiences so people can realise just how important this issue is and how prevalent the problem is in society.  I thank the Senators for raising it.  I will revert to them on whether I can arrange a debate in the House.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne talked about the M20.  We referred yesterday to what she raised, namely, the need for a debate on public transport.  Several colleagues raised this yesterday.  I have asked the Minister for Transport to come to the House to talk about public transport, particularly in light of the NDP developments and announcement on Monday.  As soon as I have a date, I will revert to Senators.<\/p> <p>Senator Carrigy mentioned the need for the Mullingar&ndash;Longford part of the Dublin&ndash;Sligo route to be included in the project in question.  I hope to be able to give him a date for that as soon as I can.<\/p> <p>Only in Ireland would something as bizarre as what Senator Ahearn described happen.  Ireland is renowned for how empathetic its people are when somebody dies and for how communities, families and extended families come together to cherish memories and support families, so to be talking about money is just bizarre.  I am not sure whether I can ask the Minister to write a letter; I can certainly try but we can write the letter to Tipperary County Council.  I can certainly do that on the Senator's behalf.<\/p> <p>Senator Cummins raised an equally bizarre matter that would happen only in Ireland.  I am now in the Oireachtas for nearly 11 years.  We have had the debate on school transport.  I am referring to the bizarre way in which Bus &Eacute;ireann tries to solve a problem in a way that only an Irish person would try to solve it.  Every year, however, the same issues arise.  The only thing I can say to the Senator is that tenacity will inspire him to seek a resolution, but it seems bizarre that we have to do as we do every year to solve the same problems for different people.  I wish the Senator well and hope he gets for the family the resolution he is looking for.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to have Senator Joe O'Reilly harass me weekly on the gambling regulations Bill.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, where the legislation is on the list of priorities and revert to the Senator.<\/p> <p>On the CAMHS waiting list, I am aware of the matter.  I will ask the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, to schedule some time in the coming weeks to come to the Seanad to talk about her plans.  She is well aware of the waiting lists for CAMHS.  She is pursuing options to alleviate the pressure on the waiting lists beyond just recruiting more CAMHS personnel.  She has been looking at some of the wonderful organisations that are assisting people under 18, such as Jigsaw and Pieta House.  However, I will get her to come to the House to tell Senators about the work she is doing.<\/p> <p>Senator Boylan referred to the overworked workforce that is Dublin Fire Brigade.  It is particularly overworked at this time of the year.  It should not be overworked at any time of the year.  We definitely need recruitment.  One of the Senator's colleagues mentioned the matter last week or the week before.  I had reason to write to Dublin City Council a couple of weeks ago to ask it about its position on recruitment.  I am still waiting on a letter to come back to me.  I will certainly ask the Minister today on behalf of the House to revert to us on this.<\/p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney mentioned the launch over the weekend of the Fine Gael policy on the care of the child.  It represents a wonderful body of work.  I realise people might believe I am saying that because I am a member of Fine Gael but I genuinely welcome the approach taken by the policy lab in Fine Gael because it is a new initiative for us.  It is important that people feel policies are made from the ground up because, for far too long in this country, we have had policies that have been made from the top down.  It is afterwards that one reflects on some of the obvious steps that should or could have been taken through policy.  I welcome the body of work.<\/p> <p>It is time for us to have a national conversation.  Every year around budget time, we talk about needing more money for childcare.  Every year, budgets are announced and we just tinker around the edges.  We all know how important the years from zero to six, six to 12 and 12 to 18 are in children's lives.  We certainly have not got it right yet and, therefore, I welcome the policy.  However, I will ask about it.  The Labour Party launched a policy last weekend on its childcare initiatives but it is time for us all to have a proper debate about what we would like to see as a State and put our heads together to determine how we can resolve the problem.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh mentioned her support for the ECCE scheme, but again recognising that the providers who were in the building yesterday said it is not meet all the needs of our children or realising our ambitions for them.  More attention needs to be paid to the scheme and the support network.  The Senator suggested that childcare should be under the Department of Education.  When Deputy Richard Bruton was the Minister in that Department, an idea was circulated that childcare providers could use the school system before and after school on the grounds that we own the buildings and that they are empty before and after school, when children have gone home or have not yet arrived.  Actually, we do not own the buildings; the patrons own the buildings, which is a huge stumbling block.  It is not unique to one particular patron.  All the patrons own the buildings so it may be time to think about how we provide public services and pay for them to make sure we can get full value out of them.<\/p> <p>Senator Keogan called for a debate on energy prices.  The issue is topical.  I have requested that the Minister come to the House to talk about it.  In the budget this year, a top priority should be meeting the needs of the most vulnerable in light of us having introduced carbon taxes to curb and change people's behaviour.  The arrangement for the most vulnerable will not be enough this year owing to the increase in prices because of supply shortages.  The increases imposed by providers in the past couple of months, including Electric Ireland only this week, are not because of carbon taxes; there are other reasons.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to be mindful of that because some of things that have been suggested this morning, while they might not be widespread, will certainly be true for some families.  The Senator is right to raise the matter.<\/p><p>Senator Conway talked about University Hospital Limerick and the requirement for a debate on rural Ireland due to wastewater shortages.  I will try to arrange a debate as soon as I can.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne talked about Ms Frances Haugen.  On a number of occasions the Senator has raised the issue of social media, its pervasiveness and how activities have not been curbed.  What Ms Haugen has said sends chills up one's spine.  Sometimes whistleblowers are treated with contempt and told they must be making half of it up.  Even if Ms Haugen made up 10% of what she said yesterday then we should be incredibly afraid for the outcomes social media will have on adults, democracy and how we are duped but, genuinely, on how our children's lives are being shaped.  I am not surprised that the requirement for the child and adolescent mental health services, the resilience in our children, and the vulnerabilities that we all see, even in our own families, have multiplied in the last ten years.  It is also not really a surprise that this has occurred at the same time as an increased use of social media.  I have four children at home and their phones are never out of their hands.  I think that I am a strict parent but clearly I am not strict enough.  We need to have a serious debate and not just in the Seanad or the D&aacute;il but at a policy level so that regulations can swiftly be brought into place so that social media usage can be curbed and the algorithms benefit us as a people.<\/p><p>Senator Gavan talked about the Atlantic corridor and the N20 motorway.  I appreciate his bona fides on this matter.  I have asked the Minister for Transport to come in as soon as possible and I will probably attend the debate.  The project is very much needed.<\/p><p>I cannot answer the Senator's question on Julian Assange but only because I am not as knowledgeable as I should be and do not want to say something that would be ignorant.  It strikes me as odd that Mr. Assange, who is the gentleman who just highlighted major ills as he saw them, has suffered.  I will research the matter and get back to the Senator.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen asked for an ongoing debate on the progress of vaccinations.  Part of me thinks, holy God, is the pandemic not behind us yet but the Senator is right because booster jabs will be needed.  Although I never think of it this way there is a need for an ethical debate because, as the Senator mentioned, not everybody believes the conspiracy theories or that people have other reasons.  We should respect those reasons and not necessarily try to change people's minds.  I will ask the Minister for Health to schedule a visit here for a debate in the next couple of weeks.<\/p><p>Senator Kyne talked about the welcome news about the Moycullen bypass and the awarding of a &euro;30 million contract.  The project has been very important to him and his locality for the last number of years.<\/p><p>Senator O'Loughlin mentioned the \"Women of Honour\" group and the response by the Minister for Defence and his Department to their experiences that have been shared in the last number of weeks.  I would say that it is probably only the tip of the iceberg and it is not just in the Defence Forces that there is a repugnant culture, which we do not and would not like to admit exists.  Perhaps it is time to have a commission on these matters covering all male-dominated environments and I do not mean to be disrespectful when I make that suggestion.  For far too long vulnerable people, and in a lot of cases they have been women, never had an opportunity to speak out and express either their concerns or share their experiences.  It is time that we shine a light on all things that are repulsive in Irish society and the State because it is only when one does so that one can do something about it.<\/p><p>Today, outside Leinster House, we will shine at a light at 1 p.m. when we, the ladies of the Oireachtas, and gentlemen are very welcome to join us, will march for maternity services.  Albeit that the pandemic is nearly over and 92% of the adult population are, thankfully, vaccinated, the partners of the women who are going through the nine months maternity journey and giving birth and the care that is provided to both the baby and the mam afterwards, the partners are still being excluded.  We do not have uniformity across the 19 maternity hospitals.  We certainly do not have the same access that would have been provided pre-pandemic, which is all that we ask for.  We ask for one nominated partner for any lady who is having and experiencing the maternity journey, and giving birth to much wanted children, and in some cases losing much wanted children.  The one nominated partner should be given equal access to all visits, scans and pre-natal and post-natal appointments.  The entire maternity journey should be shared because it was shared at the beginning and should be shared all the way through the journey.  I invite Members to join us and march in solidarity with the women of Ireland who will be outside these premises at 1 p.m.  Some of whom will bring their babies who were born during the pandemic, and demand better maternity care in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#M00200","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank the Leader for informing the House of that important initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#N00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1633512600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Twelfth Report of Seanad Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight: Motion","time":1633512600,"counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#N00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Twelfth Report of the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight on new Standing Order 63A be adopted, laid before the House and printed. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#N00600","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1633512600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1633512600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 12.35 p.m. and resumed at 1 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021: Motion","time":1633512600,"counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#Q00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolves that Part 2 of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 (No. 24 of 2021) shall continue in operation for the period beginning on the 10th day of October, 2021, and ending on the 9th day of January, 2022. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#Q00200","speaker":"1643"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to the House.

The Act is due to expire on 9 October.  The sunset clause of Part 2 provides that each House of the Oireachtas may, on or before 9 October, pass a resolution to continue Part 2 in operation for a period not exceeding three months.<\/p> <p>For the purpose of giving the House some background on this, Part 2 of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 provides for the reopening of indoor hospitality under certain conditions.  The Act was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas last July and gave effect to the Government's decision taken then that provided for indoor hospitality premises to reopen to persons who are fully vaccinated and persons who are immune from Covid-19 on the basis that they have recovered from Covid-19, as well as certain children and staff.  The decision was made in line with the public health advice.  Ultimately, the Government's decision made it possible to get pubs, caf&eacute;s, restaurants and other licensed premises reopened for business in a safe and sustainable manner.  This Act and associated regulations were of vital importance in ensuring that hospitality businesses could reopen safely and begin to recover from a very difficult period of closure.  It occurred against the backdrop of the Delta variant.  In a lot of ways, this last period, coinciding with the introduction and subsequent dominance of the Delta variant, has been the most demanding on us as a people.  Our resilience has been tested by the variant's virulence.  This variant of concern has continued to circulate extensively, especially among people who either have not yet been vaccinated or are not yet fully protected by vaccination.<\/p> <p>From the outset, the Government has been guided by the public health advice provided by the National Public Health Emergency Team as to what restrictions might be necessary to manage or suppress the disease.  Along the way, extraordinary measures have been introduced to protect public health and the most vulnerable in our society.  These were difficult and challenging decisions in a crisis scenario, with an evolving understanding of the disease, its impact, how best to manage the situation, what vaccines might offer and what variants might do to undermine our plans.<\/p> <p>The decision to require proof of vaccination or recovery to access indoor hospitality arose in the context of advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, on 28 June last.  That advice was that indoor activities expected to reopen on 5 July \"which, by their nature are high risk activities involving significant levels of social mixing in indoor environments, should only be permitted for those who have been fully protected by vaccination or who have had Covid-19 infection in the previous nine months\".  NPHET advised that easing of these measures should proceed only when supported by a robust, non-reproducible and enforceable system of verification of vaccination or immunity status.  The Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 embodies this system of verification.<\/p> <p>This House has already recognised the intrinsic value of the measures in the Act in order, on the one hand, to get indoor hospitality businesses open and, on the other, to protect public health from a variant that continues to be dangerous, unpredictable and virulent.  The measures in the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 balance both these requirements and have enabled and permitted indoor hospitality premises to continue trading while maximising the opportunity to protect public health.<\/p> <p>This is about maintaining an equilibrium between the social, economic and public health interests of the State.  Ireland has endured a profound shock to its social and economic life as we have dealt with the impact of this disease at an individual, community and societal level.  It has had an impact on almost all aspects of our lives and, for many, their livelihoods.  It is in this context that the Government agreed Ireland's next plan in its response to Covid-19, entitled Reframing the Challenge: Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting.  This recognised that Covid-19 has had a global impact, sending shockwaves around the world, with its effects felt in every section of Irish society.  Reframing the Challenge declares that if it is not possible to eliminate Covid-19 completely, we need to move to manage Covid-19 in a more \"mainstream\" way rather than as an exceptional threat requiring society-defining interventions and actions which are increasingly burdensome and scarring on our economy, society, health and well-being.  We must manage the burden of Covid-19 on the basis that it will likely continue to be constantly present into the foreseeable future.<\/p> <p>This House will know that extraordinary measures have been introduced to protect public health and the most vulnerable in our society.  These were difficult and challenging decisions in a crisis scenario, with an evolving understanding of the disease, its impact and how best to manage it.  Our plan provides that the public health management of Covid-19 should transition, in broad terms, from a focus on regulation and population-wide restrictions to a focus on public health advice and personal judgment and personal protective behaviours, subject to certain criteria.<\/p> <p>Reframing the Challenge includes a series of planned measures, such as the transitioning of the public health response and interim arrangements pending transition.  The Government decided to remove further statutory restrictions in respect of events and activities from 22 October next based on criteria which include the achievement of at or close to 90% of people aged 16 or over being fully vaccinated.  In effect, the statutory regime in place to support the protection of public health is to be largely wound down in line with the agreed removal of restrictions.  For indoor hospitality, the Government's plan specifies, \"No further changes are proposed to the current arrangements in respect of the hospitality sector until the final transition point is reached\".<\/p> <p>I am mindful of the precariousness of this virus.  The Chief Medical Officer has advised that the future trajectory of the disease cannot be predicted with certainty.  As a result, a response to this disease that is agile and flexible, with an ability to pivot rapidly and respond to any emerging threat, needs to be ensured.  The Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 is a key part of that response should the potential for one arise in the future and, while unlikely, it cannot be fully ruled out because of the uncertainty of the future trajectory of the virus, given how novel it is.  I assure the House that existing regulations under the Act will be revoked with effect from 22 October, pending a Government decision, in line with the Government's plan for this phase of Covid-19.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 is being proposed for continuance for a period of three months, without any regulations being imposed providing for restrictions on the indoor hospitality sector.  The continuance in operation of the Act is solely to align with the public health advice that the possibility of the reintroduction of any given measure cannot be fully ruled out in order to enable us to respond to the disease and the challenges its transmission might pose for us.  We must continue to ensure our response is agile and flexible, with an ability to pivot rapidly and respond to any emerging threat that might arise.<\/p><p>It is in this context that this resolution to extend the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 is being presented to the House.  The continuance in operation of the Act maintains the potential and flexibility to respond to an emerging Covid threat that could jeopardise public health and safety were it to go unchecked.  The Government, while working to reframe the challenge and reopen society, must act cautiously and prudently to ensure the most vulnerable continue to be protected to the best of our ability, should the need arise, from this unpredictable and virulent disease.<\/p><p>In summary, the measures for indoor hospitality are due to expire on 22 October.  I cannot pre-empt a Government decision before that date.  The current trajectory is encouraging and, because of the policy measures taken previously, we are broadly aligned to the optimistic scenario of the four we were presented with, as was the policy intent.  I cannot predict what will happen between now and 22 October but progress to date is steady and stable and we are tracking the best scenario we were presented with.  If all were to go to plan, from 22 October all restrictions for indoor hospitality would be removed.  The current Act and timing would remove the ability for those to be in place earlier, I believe from 9 October, which is in the next few days.  There was broad agreement that we would extend at least to 22 October.  I seek the House's agreement that we extend the legislative framework for about 11 weeks, to 9 January.  The restrictions will not be in place but if things were to change rapidly, it means we could move rapidly in terms of putting the restrictions in place.  The restrictions are not broad, sweeping societal ones.  They apply specifically to indoor hospitality.  It is just those restrictions and speed could be of the essence.<\/p><p>The week before last Christmas, on a Friday evening, the UK Government sent out an international signal about the Alpha variant.  We met all through the weekend and on Monday and Tuesday made some serious decisions.  That is how quickly this can move and how quickly we need to be able to respond.  Some have suggested letting the legislation expire or extending the sunset clause to 22 October and then letting it expire and if we need more ability to respond, we can re-legislate.  While that is a reasonable position, there is no way we could have done that last December.  There is no way that could occur between a Friday and Monday, in terms of seeing something serious, making the decisions and going through a legislative process.  I hope it will never be used.  On the current trajectory, it would not be used, but as we know from last December, things can move with this disease very quickly.  The ask is to extend it for about 11 weeks past the end of October as a safety net that we hope we will not have to use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#Q00400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that clear presentation and summary at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#R00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive and fully thought-through position on what he is asking us to do.

The Minister is welcome to the House for the last hurrah of Covid measures, we hope.  It seems like only yesterday that the legislation to which this motion refers was rushed through the House, all Stages in one sitting, with pre-legislative scrutiny having been waived.  I opposed it then and oppose it now.  I watched the motion being debated in the Lower House yesterday and was struck by the clear and candid summary of events by Deputy Connolly.  We were told this legislation was essential to reopening.  It was put through on a Government majority and, four months on, we have no clear picture of how it is operating and no numbers on compliance officers hired, emergency cessation orders handed out or compliance notices served.  There has been no independent assessment of adherence to GDPR by businesses carrying out functions under the Act.  However, we are again trotted into this Chamber to rubber stamp the extension of this outrageous Act because the Government wants it just in case.<\/p> <p>On 5 October last year, there were 518 cases; this year, there were 1,124.  On 5 October last year, not a single person in the world had been vaccinated; now, 7.4 million vaccines have been received in this country, with the 90% of the adult population mark passed in September.  Aside from breakthrough cases which were expected in older persons and those with underlying conditions, the vaccines have largely succeeded in reducing the hospitalisation rate per thousand.  This is reflected in the planned date of 22 October for the roll-back of Covid measures.<\/p> <p>All of this begs the question of why we are here.  The Act provides for an extension of any period up to three months.  Why opt for the full three months?  Why not match the sunset clause of the Act to the Government's chosen end date for the use of domestic vaccine certificates?  Do we expect the Covid ghost of Christmas past to rear its ugly head again?  If so, what modelling is that based on?  Where was it published?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Is it NPHET's minimal change modelling from last summer which predicted 2,300 cases per day?  For those who can remember, that modelling was undertaken to provide scenarios to inform the Government's reopening of society.  Minimal change meant outdoor dining remained closed to all.  The Minister will remember the modelling as it was sent to him.  The most pessimistic scenario projected 681,900 cases by the end of September, while the most optimistic scenario projected 81,000 cases.  There were in fact 35,700 cases.  The most optimistic scenario projected 165 deaths between the end of June and September.  The actual figure for that period was just over 60.  The data were widely inaccurate.  This is NPHET's best case scenario versus the reality.  That was certainly not the one that got the headlines, \"Grim\" and \"Sobering\".  The Minister warned us that the biggest hurricane that had ever hit Ireland was coming.  It was not true.  It did not happen.  I do not for one second believe the Minister was being disingenuous; he was simply being cautious.  We cannot afford to be so cautious for caution comes at a price.  When caution is based on such inaccurate data or, as in the case of this Act, no data at all, it becomes an impossible pill to swallow.<\/p><p>Let us for once recognise the reality of the situation.  We need to send out the clear message to the public that the blunt instrument of lockdown will be put away for good and that the insidious practice of dividing society based on vaccination status will be likewise put to rest.  I oppose the use of domestic vaccine certificates and I oppose this motion before the House today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#R00500","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I seem to be meeting him a great deal today.  I welcome this legislation.  We have been successful in regard to Covid-19 precisely because we have been cautious, we have followed public health advice and, by and large, the public have bought into and supported politicians, the Department of Health, the Minister for Health and the Government in terms of the leadership that has been shown by abiding by restrictions and accepting the vaccines.<\/p> <p>It is a fact that Ireland is a world leader when it comes to Covid-19 vaccinations in that over 90% of our adult population are vaccinated.  We are the envy of many countries throughout the world that cannot get their vaccination rates over 50%.  Some countries would consider themselves to be successful on achieving a vaccination rate of over 70%.  We are in the situation where over 90% of our adult population are vaccinated.  This is proof that when the Irish people roll up their sleeves and get stuck in, Ireland is a world leader, as it has been in so many areas down through the years.  Ireland is now a world leader in terms of dealing with a pandemic and a world health emergency.  It has led the way in terms of the leadership shown by the previous Government and this Government, the former Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the current Minister, Deputy Donnelly, in dealing with the pandemic.  In fairness, throughout the country the public have been leaders as well in terms of how they have adapted to very difficult situations, including staying at home, working from home and through businesses closing their doors.  Some businesses will never reopen.  All of that was done because people wanted to save as many lives as possible.<\/p> <p>We must always reflect on the lives lost.  More than 5,000 people lost their lives to this disease and thousands more are sick as a result of it.  Many thousands more might have died but for the coming together of various components in our battle to save lives and to reduce the risk as much as possible.<\/p> <p>The Minister is aware of my concerns in regard to long Covid.  I do not think we have dealt with it in the way we should.  This is an evolving situation and a learning process in terms of the consequences of long Covid.  I know the Minister has put together a high level group to address the issue, but I think it probably needs more attention and more resources.  So many are suffering from long Covid.  It is one of the legacies of the pandemic.  We need to deploy the best possible medical resources and research to help those people to deal with long Covid and, it is hoped, if at all possible, to overcome it.<\/p> <p>The ask in terms of the Act is very reasonable.  I would have been happy to support a six-month extension.  If it is necessary to extend it beyond 9 January, the Minister should not hesitate in coming to the House this side of Christmas to do that.  It is important this legislative mechanism is in place in order that the Minister can act and move swiftly if necessary to do so.  That he was in a position prior to last Christmas to act and move swiftly in terms of the reintroduction of restrictions saved many lives.  It did not save all lives, but it did save many lives.  The Minister needs to have that flexibility.  He does not need to be looking over his shoulder in regard to the legislative framework and his powers to act when dealing with health in the public interest.  As I said, if prior to Christmas this Act needs to be extended further, the Minister should by all means do it.  We wish him well.<\/p> <p>We are seeing much brighter days and we are all looking forward to 22 October, depending on what comes between now and then, but it is looking good.  We can be reasonably positive and optimistic that, as we move towards Christmas, we will see a significant return to normality.  I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach will agree it is great to be back in Leinster House, to meet people again and to see the self-service and Members' restaurants open and people somewhat returning to normality.  That is reflected throughout the country.  Those who are vaccinated have the confidence to return to work for a couple of days per week and many more will be returning on 22 October, all going well.<\/p> <p>I hope the motion in respect of the legislation is agreed.  There is no argument as far as I am concerned as to why it should not be.  I wish the Minister well with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#S00200","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I echo the Senator's sentiments in regard to our being back together again.

Before I get to the substance of Sinn F&eacute;in's position on this Act, it is important to reflect on what we have achieved nationally in regard to Covid.  The current vaccination rate of approximately 87% - it may be slightly higher - is a huge achievement.  The political consensus on the importance of science on vaccines has been crucial to that.  At the Council of Europe last week I had an opportunity to chat to colleagues from countries that do not have that consensus.  For example, in Armenia only 10% of the people are vaccinated but not because there is a shortage of vaccines.  They have ambulances outside market squares inviting people to get vaccinated but there is a huge level of government distrust and, unfortunately, there is a far-right opposition in this country that is anti-vaccination and anti-science.  Thank God we do not have that in this country.  With the possible exception of the odd Tipperary Deputy we do not have that, thank God.  It is important to reflect on that and on the progress that has been made.  That is an important point.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> While we are on the issue of vaccines with the Minister, I also raise the issue of the lack of Government support to date to a call for a waiver on intellectual property, IP, rights for vaccines.  That is a significant disappointment to me.  I am sure the Minister will accept the logic that no one is safe until everyone is safe and that we need to assist the developing world in a way that we just have not done to date.  We need voices at European level.  This was brought up at the Council of Europe again last week and it was very disappointing to hear the Commissioner not back the idea of dropping intellectual property rights.  It is so depressing to see western governments aligning themselves with big pharma rather than with the world.  We need to give the world the right to produce its own vaccines.  I cannot for the life of me understand why this Government cannot make that simple and clear call.  I ask the Minister to reflect on that and perhaps respond to this point.<\/p><p>Moving on to the issue of this debate and the powers, the Minister is correct in what he said in that there is a consensus that we should extend legislation until 22 October.  Sinn F&eacute;in will certainly support that but we cannot support its extension beyond that date for the simple reason that the restrictions are being lifted, which we welcome and want to see happen.  This Government has shown on several occasions in the past that we can move legislation very quickly, if needs be.  It is important to recognise that we have to be very careful in regard to the extraordinary powers that were granted and to how they were granted and managed.  I reflect that when the need arose, we signed up to a &euro;64 billion bailout for banks overnight.  The idea that we could not come in here, if necessary, to reintroduce this legislation just does not fly.  Christmas this year is on a Saturday.  Even accepting the Minister&rsquo;s scenario, we could take the week coming up to Christmas and still come back and pass this legislation.  Our view is that that would be preferable in terms of respect for human rights than the tack the Minister is taking.  I stress that our party thinks that the approach has been broadly correct but on that one issue, we do not agree with the Government, so this is a respectful difference of opinion.<\/p><p>We need to reflect on the fact that even if these restrictions are dropped on 22 October, there will be partners who still cannot join their loved ones in maternity wards.  For the life of me, I cannot understand that.  They are marching in the rain as we are conducting this debate.  I ask that the Minister respond to that point and say what else he can do.  I have spoken to colleagues in Limerick on this issue and have  stood with them.  There seems to be a significant disconnect between what the Minister&rsquo;s Department is saying and what is actually being implemented.  Ultimately, I argue that the buck stops with the Minister on this issue.  We have all spoken about this and it has come up almost every week in the Seanad since we have come back and yet it persists.  I ask the Minister address this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#S00400","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir f&eacute;in.

It is the first time we have been in the Chamber with him, so it is good to see him here.  Thankfully, there appears to be a light at the end of what has been a very dark tunnel.  I commend the Minister on the work he has done in taking on that role as Minister during a very difficult period in the history of the State.  Not only did he have to deal with the pandemic but with all of the data issues as well.  At times during the pandemic, it seemed as if normal life, or at least a version of it, might never resume.  Thanks to the sacrifices and the sensible decisions made by the Irish people, we are back on track to seeing most of the remaining public health restrictions lifted on 22 October.  Thanks to the impressive rate of vaccine uptake and the buy-in by the Irish people to the remaining public health restrictions, we have avoided the worst case scenario as modelled by NPHET, both in terms of case numbers and deaths attributable to the virus throughout the summer months.  Additionally, we have had fewer deaths attributable to the virus throughout the summer that was modelled in NPHET's best case scenario.<\/p> <p>Despite this relative success, we need to progress with caution from this point.  Breakthrough cases persist in some people who have been fully vaccinated and the risk of infection remains high for those people in Ireland who remain unvaccinated.  While our case numbers are stable, they remain stubbornly high.  Our hospitals remain under pressure and we must ensure they have the capacity to deal with the seasonal surges in presentations this winter.  I have full confidence in the Irish people to look after one another as they have done so well over the past 19 months.  <\/p> <p>Different industries and sectors of society have all made sacrifices throughout the pandemic but, as I have said here many times, our hospitality, entertainment, cultural and creative sectors have, potentially, shouldered a greater burden than many others.  There is no doubt about it that 22 October is a beacon of hope for those employed in those sectors and those who take so much from them, socially and culturally.<\/p> <p>While the Government is confident at present that it will not require the emergency powers as set out in the Health (Amendment) Act 2021, it has decided to extend the legislation which underpins these powers as a precautionary measure.  I understand the rationale in doing so and the caution around it but I remain concerned that the continuation of this Act makes legal provisions for an Irish society in which people can be treated differently on account of their vaccination or health status.  While the Government may not utilise the powers as set out in the Act past 22 October, there will remain provision for it to do so as it sees fit until the legislation expires on 9 January 2022.  We must, therefore, have the conversation as to what will happen in the circumstances where the emergency powers are required.  I invite my colleagues in the Chamber, in the Government and in the Cabinet to speak to those considerations.<\/p> <p>If the Government chooses to invoke its powers as set out in this Act over the coming three months, it must ensure that expert public health modelling informs its decision-making while also actively consulting with experts in human rights and civil liberties.  Additionally, those sectors which will be affected by this legislation must be consulted and communicated with regard to Government decision-making in a clear and transparent way.<\/p> <p>While there is a specific endpoint to the legislation, it is vital that we ensure that it is adhered to.  However, with this in mind, what does the Government suggest might happen if the public health landscape deteriorated to such an extent that it required the emergency powers to be extended past the date currently provided for in the Act?  Expert groups on the protection of both data and civil liberties have expressed concern about the use of the Covid-19 tracker app as an e-wallet within which to store the digital Covid certificate.  These concerns were raised with the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Data Protection Commission in the first iteration of this Act.  These concerns, to my knowledge, have not been adequately addressed to date.<\/p> <p>Specifically, I would welcome assurances that the use of special data in this way, medical data in this case, is not demonstrative of an instance of scope-creep by the Government.  Further, I ask for assurances that the data protection impact assessment undertaken in designing this app and the EU digital Covid certificate, DCC, was thorough and considered the principles of necessity and proportionality, having adequately assessed risks and the safety and security measures necessary to mitigate it.<\/p> <p>While people are not required to upload their digital Covid certificate to the Covid tracker app, this is the format in which many people are storing their certificates.  We must ensure that the sensitive personal data that we are storing and processing to facilitate this is kept as safe and as secure as it can be.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister and commend the Irish people on the Trojan efforts made to keep people safe throughout this pandemic.  I hope with all of my heart that this sense of unity and togetherness is something that we continue to hold on to long after the darkest days of this pandemic are well behind us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#T00300","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Black for that contribution and I now call Senator Kyne to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#T00400","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome back to the House.  I will start, as I did this morning at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health, by acknowledging the success of the vaccination programme.  I commend the Minister, his team within the HSE and the Department of Health and, most important, the Irish people, as well as, in some instances, the mothers and fathers who persuaded younger persons in particular of the importance of taking up the vaccine to protect themselves and others.  The success of the vaccination programme has been acknowledged in worldwide league tables.<\/p> <p>I have always acknowledged that the issue all along was the supply of vaccines.  All present are aware of the current situation in New Zealand and Australia that has resulted from a mixture of hesitancy and the non-prioritisation or non-supply of vaccination.  We are lucky to have had the power of the European Union behind us in that regard.  Despite a slow start, it came through in terms of supply of the Covid vaccine, so well done to all involved in that.<\/p> <p>I welcome the decisions relating to mandatory hotel quarantine.  I do not think anybody, not even the Minister, was overly supportive of the initiative but it was a necessary measure at the time.  The Delta variant has now spread worldwide and it was very much evident in Ireland.  Most important, the success of the vaccination programme has negated the need for mandatory hotel quarantine.  It is a chapter of this saga that has ended and I welcome that.<\/p> <p>The legislation relates to the extension of emergency powers to January of next year.  These are powers that I am sure the Minister hopes will not be needed and does not expect to use.  However, it is important to have them in place in case they are required.  As they say, \"fail to prepare, prepare to fail\".  It is a precautionary measure as recommended by the team in NPHET, which has been proven to have given proper advice in all its various interventions in the past year.  Although the advice was not always politically welcome or welcomed by the public, it was necessary and has proven to be correct, so we have to respect it.  Out of an abundance of caution, we must ensure these measures are available and can be easily put in place if required.  As I stated, we all hope they will not be required.<\/p> <p>The flu vaccine is an issue related to that of vaccine uptake.  Ireland has a strong record in the context of the flu vaccine, particularly among older people.  One could argue that a lack of hand hygiene and cough etiquette, such as shaking hands and so on, was a vector for spreading infection pre Covid.  That is important.  I urged from the start that there be strong messaging on this issue.  People have been in close contact, whether at funerals or various other events.  I hope that does not stop, but the use of antibacterial and antimicrobial hand sanitisers and the like will be very important and should be continued.  I would like those products to continue to be available in shops, supermarkets, churches and at funerals or wherever there are large crowds gathering.  I encourage everyone to use them.  It is particularly important that they be available for those who wish to do so.  That should continue in an effort to combat the spread of infectious disease, particularly flu, which can be debilitating and life-threatening, particularly for older people.  I ask the Minister to ensure the Department continues to look at messaging on that issue and to roll out guidelines or messaging relating to the flu season that are similar to those rolled out in the past 18 months in the context of Covid.  That would have a very positive effect in the context of flu prevention.  Members are aware of the number of people who appeared in accident and emergency departments pre Covid, particularly in January, suffering from flu.  Prevention and messaging in the context of maintaining proper cough etiquette, hand hygiene and hand sanitisation are important aids in preventing the annual surge that takes place every January.  They are probably as useful as many of the more expensive measures needed to treat flu.  Prevention is more important.  <\/p> <p>I again acknowledge the work the Minister, his Department and the HSE have done.  I wish him well on this measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#U00100","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>To come into Cabinet and take on the gauntlet of the health ministry is a daunting challenge at any time, but it is particularly daunting to come into that role at the height of a pandemic.  It has been no joke.  I say &quot;Well done&quot; to the Minister.  We are where we are largely due to courageous decisions that have been made.<\/p><p>The roll-out and uptake of the vaccine have been fantastic.  I look forward to the next phase, encouraging the last section of the population to take it, and its possible extension to younger groups.  On a personal level, I believe in taking on the responsibility of vaccine justice.  My family has donated elsewhere the cost of vaccines as we have benefited from the wealth of this country and its being able to provide us with the vaccine.  I encourage others to do likewise and I ask the Minister to be active at governmental level in ensuring that is given consideration.  We are not safe until we are all safe.  That is important.<\/p><p>I welcome that the extension of the powers is a restricted extension.  It is good to have that caution in respect of the necessity for an extension of these restrictions and powers.  I trust and believe that the Government and the Minister will be responsible in their administration.  However - there is always a &quot;however&quot; - I refer to the issues being experienced by certain women, men and families.  I know the Minister has done everything he can in that regard, but I ask him to consider whether more can be done to hear their experiences.  We have met them in virtual meetings in recent weeks.  To hear their stories is horrific.  It is hard to believe that in 2021 women are going through pregnancy loss, and then the whole experience of birth, alone.  In the context of pregnancy loss, I refer to those moments where a woman is going in to a scan that may reveal bad news.  There is nothing like the moment when one is told there is no heartbeat.  It would be just horrific not to have a partner with one for anything like that. <\/p><p>I refer to couples who were due to go for IVF treatment in time-critical circumstances.  The availability of IVF treatment in Ireland is based on the age of the mother.  As a result of Covid, in some instances, women seeking IVF treatment have gone past the required age through no fault of their own without being able to access the treatment.  We need to look at that as a hangover from, and a consequence of, Covid.  It means that some couples will be denied their opportunity of parenthood through IVF as a consequence of Covid.  Something needs to be done.  We need flexibility such that the availability of treatment is based on ability to conceive or receive an embryo, rather than the age of the mother, because some women get pregnant at older ages.  We need to consider that.<\/p><p>The Minister cannot come to the House without me raising my next issue.  He knows the drum I am going to beat, which is that we need progress on the legislation relating to surrogacy and assisted human reproduction.  At present, international surrogacy is excluded.  There is a need for it to be included and for issues relating to dealing with children who are born here and Irish citizens and growing up to be dealt with retrospectively.  The lack of legislation has caused real delays and problems.  I know the Minister is meeting groups and there is action afoot, but I ask him to really put his influence behind this.  We are mammies.  We are the only mammies our children have ever known.  We have the right for them to have a lifelong legal relationship with us, rather than one that expires when they reach the age of 18.  It is horrific to think that in order for my child to inherit from me, I am reliant on a barrister giving a legal opinion that I was <i>in loco parentis<\/i>for all of her life.

He has had a busy morning.  I watched him attending the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health.  It is important we continue to pioneer reform.  I commend him on the appointment of the two new chairs of Sl&aacute;intecare.  His presentation this morning to the committee is one we should reflect upon as opposed to some of the populist commentary we have heard from some on other benches who do not care about the outcome other than what they can get in the newspapers and the headlines in the media.<\/p> <p>I wish to acknowledge the response of, first, the people and, second, Government, in terms of the roll-out of the vaccination programme.  We can reflect upon the rocky days at the beginning of the roll-out of the vaccination programme, when we were all inundated with reports that people had not received dates for appointments.  We were all getting flummoxed and worried.  Look where we are today.  We are No. 1 in the Bloomberg Covid resilience rankings, with 92% of people vaccinated.  Look at America, where 50% plus of the population is vaccinated.  Rational, sane people are refusing to get vaccinated for reasons of political ideology, putting themselves and their colleagues at risk.  That is why I am proud of our country, that we did the due diligence and listened to the science.  Yes, there are people who hold different views.  Senator Keogan gave a very spirited response to the debate today, much of which I did not agree, but that is okay; we can agree to disagree.  The job of Government and public health is to lead, and the people responded and we saved lives.<\/p> <p>The backdrop of our debate today, as Senator Conway rightly said, is the 5,000 people, citizens of our Republic, who have died: people we knew, grew up with, lived next to in our communities and estates, and in some cases they were part of our families.  They were people of all ages and genders, with immunity and none.  Our debate today takes place in the context of the deaths of those people.<\/p> <p>As I have said many times, none of us would be making decisions to vote to curb civil liberties under normal circumstances.  We are being asked to agree to a continuation of the legislation for three months.  The Government is asking for extraordinary powers, which they certainly are.  However, as the framework states, it is based on an evolving understanding and response to the virus.  I can tell Members of the House there are friends of mine in many parts of the world who are envious of us because we have a vaccination programme that has worked.<\/p> <p>I am a small bit concerned about two issues.  One concerns the booster shot requirement.  I appeal to the Minister, those in NPHET and in government to have an information campaign on why such booster shots are needed, if they are needed and who will get them.  It should be clear and concise, as was the case with the vaccination programme.  I heard the Minister's response in the context of the optimistic outcome, but I was struck by Professor Nolan's remarks yesterday when he said the situation is stable but it is a complex picture.  I am small bit worried in two respects.  First, on the issue of mask wearing, we say indoor retail and on public transport as two examples where it is to be continued.  I believe we need to have a further debate on mask wearing to make it mandatory in all indoor settings.  I was away two weekends ago and I travelled through Dublin Airport.  It was a wonderful experience.<\/p> <p>Second, I am still not impressed with our response to antigen testing.  The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Martin, made some remarks on the issue yesterday.  I do not know why we have not proceeded with antigen testing as quickly as we did with other testing.<\/p> <p>We have been listening to public health advice.  I share similar concerns around the extension of the powers as those raised in the remarks of Senator Gavan and others, while understanding the reasons we need to be where we are and where we are going to.  Finally, there will be no requirement for social distancing from 22 October.  We are going back to serving customers at the bar.  There are still issues with maternity hospitals that have not been addressed.  However, I commend the Minister on his work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#V00200","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House today.  I support the idea of giving the Minister the option of extending the restrictions if necessary when the time comes.  Certainly, we have all been through a very turbulent time.  On the Order of Business earlier today, I made the point that in Limerick, as part of mental health week, they are floating white roses on the River Shannon on Friday to mark the lives of the 289 people who died from Covid in Limerick city alone.  The fact is it is the job of the Minister and the Government to act in a responsible manner and to provide guidelines to help people along and to protect their lives and health.  Therefore, I fully support the extension of the powers.  When people go into a restaurant or any enclosed setting, they want to feel safe.  The fact the restrictions were brought in was very welcome at the time.  Certainly, they should be kept in place for as long as necessary.<\/p> <p>I know there is a protest outside Leinster House today in respect of maternity services.  I wish to raise that issue.  Access should be granted to partners of women using maternity services.  I know the Minister is committed to looking at the issue and dealing with it as it comes along.  I wish to put that on the record.<\/p> <p>I must say that I believe the Government has done a very good job in terms of vaccinations and protecting people as much as possible.

I start by saying \"Congratulations\".  The achievement of the Government and the Minister's Department in the roll-out of the vaccination programme has not just been exceptional but has been a watershed in terms of dealing with this virus.  The Minister deserves great credit for it.  We can rightly be proud of the work that was done by staff in the HSE, pharmacies and GP practices throughout country to ensure every citizen who wanted a vaccine could get one.  I very much welcome that.<\/p> <p>I know there are certain people who do not want the vaccine, and I agree with the right they have not to take it.  I do not agree with some of the emails I have received recently to say this is the beginning of a fracturing of Irish society.  While acknowledging that people have the right to choose not to take the vaccine, they also have the right to make that choice in circumstances where it gives rise to certain other consequences.  When we make choices, there are consequences one way or the other.  However, while part of the vaccination programme and part of this legislation does create, by some arguments, a divide, more importantly it facilitates those who wish to engage in particular activities to do so in a safe way.  My colleague, Senator Byrne, just mentioned how important it is for people who go into restaurants to feel safe.  That is exactly the purpose of this legislation, to allow businesses to re-establish themselves, get back to work, allow their employees to get back to work, and allow us as members of society to re-engage in the kind of activities we have all missed so much.<\/p> <p>The Minister will be aware of the enormous demonstration that is taking place on Molesworth Street outside today relating to maternity services, which has been mentioned by other colleagues.  I have been out there this afternoon listening to what are genuinely harrowing stories from not just women but their partners, who have been denied an opportunity to be together at wonderfully joyful moments and at tragic and sad moments when perhaps the news was not good in terms of a pregnancy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I understand that the Minister has listened to what they have to say and that he agrees with them - at least on one level - but the time has come for the foot to be put down in the Department and for very clear messages to be sent to our maternity hospitals that the guidelines are to be followed and that it is no longer acceptable to exclude partners from the maternity process, be it an early scan, birth or postnatal care.  The reality is that this is part and parcel of the care that is provided.<\/p><p>Covid has not yet left us.  I recognise that by bringing this motion, the Minister recognises that and sees a need for the continuation of certain powers that we passed into law through this House and the D&aacute;il.  At the same time, we know that with the vaccination programme and the progress we have made on this, there is a safe way to facilitate people who must go into maternity hospitals and for people to be present at the birth of their children, at scans or, God forbid, when bad news is delivered.  It is incumbent on the Department and by extension, the Minister to make it clear to maternity hospitals that this is the case.  There are discrepancies around the country in terms of how hospitals deal with this, which is neither fair nor reasonable.  The Minister has been here for the debate on this motion so he has not had an opportunity to go outside to talk to the people who are out there, but I can assure him there is a lot of deep feeling based on reality and reasonableness.  It is not something they are saying on the hoof.  These are people who have experienced the difficulty caused by those restrictions.<\/p><p>All of the restrictions create problems and I know the Minister and other Members acknowledge it.  Every restriction will create a different level of difficulty for different people but I also think we recognise that they are necessary.  I recognise the need for the continuation of the Covid passports or the digital certificate that allows people to enter restaurants but I also recognise that later this month, we will remove a lot of the restrictions about which we have been talking.  I wonder whether the date until which the Minister is seeking to continue the restrictions is the right one.  Could the Minister comment on whether an earlier date would be more appropriate?<\/p><p>I congratulate the Minister.  I ask him to recognise the difficulties that restrictions cause.  I ask him also to recognise that there is a fundamental inconsistency between the notion that we will lift those restrictions later this month and this proposal to continue the power of the Government to impose restrictions.  Perhaps we should examine the possibility of an earlier closure of the powers the Government was given by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#V00400","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I echo the comments regarding maternity services.

We all know that the healthcare system in Ireland, and I have been involved in healthcare systems abroad, is under constant attack and criticism.  We all know that when things go wrong in healthcare, it is the most serious situation we can have.  I know from my current role and my previous jobs that it can be very demoralising for those working in healthcare - in a department of health, the HSE or the NHS - to be criticised again and again.  If we were to look at the public narrative around the world - it is not unique to Ireland - we would be forgiven for thinking nothing good happens in healthcare systems.  I really welcome the comments from colleagues acknowledging our healthcare workers; not just front-line workers but also managers including directors of nursing, directors of medicine, managers of hospitals and civil servants.  My view, which I think is shared by everyone else, is that over the past year and a half, those working across the healthcare family have demonstrated the very best of our nation.  It has been really tough for them.  They have had a brutal year and a half.  Many of them are traumatised by it and it is great to hear an acknowledgement from the Oireachtas of what they have managed to do in the middle of the biggest health crisis in 100 years.<\/p> <p>Regarding the motion, they are extraordinary powers but they are being extended by just 11 weeks.  In answer to the question \"why 11 weeks?\", that was the public health advice.  That was the recommendation I got from the chief medical officer.  While we hope not to use these powers, we are mindful of what happened the week before Christmas when we found out about the Alpha variant and how quickly we had to move.  We simply cannot legislate and implement policy in that period of time.  We could not have done it last time.  The ask of the House is that it would agree to that.  I thank colleagues for their input, debate and support.<\/p> <p>Regarding global justice for vaccines, it is essential that we have a global and just solution to this.  I think the waiving of IP rights has merit.  The analysis I have seen, which looks solid, makes the point that waiving IP rights on its own will not answer the question.  These are highly sophisticated compounds that require highly sophisticated manufacturing, cold chain storage, containment and distribution and one must get it all in place.  I am very happy to be able to report that Ireland recently donated a large number of vaccines to Uganda.  We will be doing more and through the international mechanisms of COVAX, we will donate millions of vaccines.  We should be proud European citizens on this.  The EU stands out as the region that has exported out of its region way more vaccines than any other region in the world.  Some parts of the world that should know better have put restrictions on exports of vaccines and the raw materials for them.  I want Europe to continue to play a leading role and I want Ireland to be a leading voice in the EU on this.  It is essential.<\/p> <p>I know the next issue is not part of today's debate but as most colleagues and the Acting Chairperson have raised the question of maternity visits, I might have some leniency to discuss it.  Covid has resulted in awful restrictions across the healthcare system.  They have affected mums and their partners, nursing homes, hospital visits to people on bed wards and ICU.  I have spoken with seasoned experienced ICU nurses who over decades have seen many people get very sick and die in intensive care and they tell me that they have been traumatised by Covid - both the viciousness of the disease and how it kills people, and the isolation of those people when they are so sick and trying to communicate with their families on phones and iPads.  It is vicious.  It has been brutal for mums and partners, patients and people in nursing homes and it has been brutal in intensive care.  Covid caused a horrible situation for patients and our healthcare professionals supporting those patients.  That is true in maternity services and across healthcare.  I acknowledge the men and women who have come to Leinster House today to have their voices heard and I acknowledge their passion, frustration and anger.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->No woman in this country should be asked to deal with pregnancy loss alone.  The brutal reality is that women have been asked to do that because of Covid.  The question is what are we doing about it.  I have worked very closely with the HSE and Department of Health on this.  We established four criteria that had to be met.  As we pushed successfully back against Covid and the vaccine programme took hold, we moved from four to eight criteria.  We then moved from those eight criteria to much more comprehensive guidelines.<\/p><p>The HPSC guidelines were updated at the start of September.  The guidance facilitates access for support partners when women are attending for antenatal care, during the period of labour and childbirth and during postnatal care.  It includes, critically, antenatal appointments for 12-week scans and 20-week scans and unscheduled attendances.  It also includes a minimum of two hours access for partners per day where the woman is in a multi-bed room.  If she is in a single occupancy room, the HPSC guidelines say that there is no time restriction.  They are the guidelines, and more detail on the guidelines is available online on the HSE website.<\/p><p>There is a point on which we have to be very clear, namely that the safety concerns being raised by our clinicians are real and very present in maternity care today.  I would like to share with colleagues one piece of data that emphasises how important it is that we are careful around maternity care.  Pregnant women reflect 1% of the population.  Believe it or not, pregnant women represent 8% to 10% of those with Covid in ICU.  Let us think about the implications of that.  Our clinicians have acted to try to protect mums and babies.  We have to find a way to make access as full and complete as possible while protecting mums and babies. <\/p><p>I sought an update on this.  As of yesterday, the HSE has advised that hospitals are broadly compliant with the current guidelines.  We must always keep pushing on those guidelines to make them more and more open.  Seventeen of the 19 units are being reported to the Department as being fully compliant.  Two hospitals - St. Luke's in Kilkenny and Mullingar - are non-compliant.  St. Luke's is non-compliant for high-risk emergency presentations.  Mullingar is non-compliant for high-risk emergency presentations as well, but it is noted that following a clinical assessment on a case-by-case basis attendance is facilitated where it can be determined by the clinical team.<\/p><p>I wrote to the board and chief executive of the HSE yesterday and today to state that we must have full compliance and ongoing and very clear monitoring of that compliance, and where there is non-compliance we must understand exactly what the local reason for that is and do everything we can to support the maternity hospital or unit in addressing that issue.  However, I have gone further.  I believe that the women and men outside have experienced very real and traumatic experiences.<\/p><p>It is very easy for people to say that there are guidelines in place and compliance is being monitored.  That is not enough.  This morning I wrote to the chief executive of the HSE and board of the HSE to ask for a mechanism to be put in place immediately that would facilitate mums and partners who find themselves denied the access that is contained in the guidelines to contact the HSE to ask why access is being refused and to ask that it be followed up on.  I want reassurance that if there is non-compliance, it is for a legitimate local clinical reason.  If there is not a legitimate local clinical reason, we need to know about that so we can intervene.<\/p><p>I can assure the House and, more importantly, the men and women who have come to Leinster House today that we are taking this seriously and will always put safety of mums and babies first.  Obviously, in a global pandemic that is priority number one.  Once that is addressed to the satisfaction of the clinical experts, all other restrictions need to be removed.<\/p><p>A lot of the restrictions that are causing real frustration have nothing to do with Covid.  They have to do with historical underinvestment in women's healthcare and maternity care in this country.  A really good maternity strategy was introduced by the previous Government in 2016, the national maternity strategy.  It puts choice for women right at the centre.  If they want specialist obstetric care, they can choose that.  If they want midwifery-led care, they can choose that.  If they want a hybrid between the two, they can choose that.<\/p><p>This year, for the first time, that maternity strategy has been fully funded.  I have been in maternity units and have spoken to caregivers who have talked to me about the benefits and increased choice that is beginning to happen for women.  I cannot commit to next year yet because the budget has not been agreed and signed off on, but I am again looking for considerable funding to continue the roll-out of maternity care.  That is not enough because the facilities are not fit for purpose.<\/p><p>I do not believe it is a coincidence that some of the oldest hospitals are maternity hospitals.  I honestly believe that if men had babies, all of these hospitals would look like the Blackrock Clinic, the Hermitage or some very fancy place.  They do not.  The Rotunda is 250 years old.  Stand-alone maternity hospitals and maternity units need a level of investment they have never had, and that is something I, as Minister, am determined that we are going to see.  I am determined that we are going to build a state-of-the-art national maternity hospital that can provide the care and experience that mums deserve and that our clinicians deserve to work in.  Ultimately, that capital investment and increase in facilities is what will allow things like single-room occupancy and unrestricted visiting for partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#W00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for addressing the broader issues raised during the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#X00200","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"vote","time":1633512600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 25; N\u00edl, 5.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Robbie Gallagher and Se\u00e1n Kyne; N\u00edl, Senators Niall \u00d3 Donnghaile and Paul Gavan.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#X00250","aye":["1629","1633","1637","1638","1384","1639","1640","1641","1644","1646","1647","1648","1651","1652","1654","1658","1659","1665","1666","1667","1670","1689","1693","1683","1685"],"nay":["1632","1635","1660","1664","1688"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1633512600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 2.33 p.m. and resumed at 3.34 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Registration of Wills Bill 2021: Second Stage","time":1633512600,"counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#FF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>C&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.

She is somebody who I greatly admire.  She is full of common sense and very dynamic.  I know she will listen attentively to this debate.  While we might disagree, the Minister has a job to do, and I always respect that.  I, too, have a job to do and I gave a commitment to the former Senator, Mr. Terry Leyden, before he left this House that I would continue to raise this issue.  It is timely and I am glad it is today, although that was not of my choosing, as such.<\/p><p>We know from the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>and the Teagasc website that there will be a series of two webinars, one this evening, on the transfer of the family farm and on succession.  A similar event was run last year and it was the most attended event ever held by Teagasc.  It dealt with succession, the rural farm, the rural household and the family home, all very contentious issues when people have legitimate expectations to inherit them.  Usually that is encouraged, fostered and supported by a parent or guardian who suggests to little Johnny walking the hills in Cavan that one day he will inherit this 70-acre place.  Everyone is familiar with <i>The Field<\/i>, and with that legitimate expectation and excitement of inheritance, to carry on what one's father had.  Someone sowed and someone reaps.  Land is fundamentally important to our hearts and souls and to our belonging and tradition, which are very important things.  It is funny that the further one travels north or west, where the holdings are smaller, there is an even greater intention and desire to continue, to carry on, to inherit and to succeed.  That is where the will comes in.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister.  At the outset, I wish to acknowledge that this is not my Bill.  This is the Bill of many Members who put the work into it.  I gave a commitment to former Senator Terry Leyden when he left that I would endeavour to pursue this issue.  In the last two or three weeks I checked with the Seanad Office and it confirmed to me that the Bill had fallen.  The Bill went through all Stages in this House, but in the parliamentary cycle it did not go to the D&aacute;il.  Hence, it could be reintroduced.  I sought to reintroduce the Bill in the House last week.  I had the full support of every Member of the House and it was restored to the Order Paper.  I am aware that the same content of this Bill was reintroduced yesterday in the D&aacute;il, but it has a different date from this Bill.  The only difference is that this Bill is dated 2021.  However, that is the process and the way these things go.  I acknowledge the enormous amount of work done by the former Senator and former Minister of State, Mr. Terry Leyden, on this important issue.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for an opportunity to register one of the most important documents a person can make, a will.  Most countries have such a register in place.  Having this debate highlights again the importance of making a will and of storing it in a safe place to which the appropriate people will have access at some stage in the future.  Some legal firms go out of business and can no longer hold a will.  Indeed, I will share a story with Members.  I made a will over 20 years ago with a big Dublin firm.  I inquired some weeks ago where it was.  First, I learned that the company had split into two different groups.  When I then asked where my will was, neither company could tell me.  I put it to them that I spent &euro;75 some 20 years ago for a will and that they had a duty of care to me personally.  They said they would look into it.  I happen to have found a copy, but this shows the importance of lodging a will and retaining it in a safe place.  We do not know when we will be called or when our life will be ended or taken through health or whatever, so it is important to have that.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that there are issues that need to be teased out.  I am the first to say, and I am not pre-empting what the Minister will say, that this Bill contains anomalies and shortages.  However, I want to get it from this Stage to Committee Stage.  The then Minister in 2016, Deputy Varadkar, later the Taoiseach and now the T&aacute;naiste, said it was important to have this Bill.  He heard all the debate.  Many Senators then who are still Senators - I do not see them here but they may be tuned in somewhere else and might join us later - spoke in glowing terms about the Bill.  It passed every Stage in the House, and that is important.  Many current Senators spoke in support of it.  The then Minister with responsibility for social protection, Deputy Varadkar, spoke about its importance and the right to choice.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In fairness to him, he expressed some concern about aspects of the process.  He asked if was a voluntary register, how much did a registrar know and have access to and what aspects were there in respect of confidentiality or abuse of access to wills, for example.  He made some valid points but he suggested that pre-legislative scrutiny was the way to go in order to tease out this topic through committee.  More important, it would get it to the next stage.<\/p><p>I am seeking a register of wills stating when and where the will was made, where it is held, the reference number and where it is available subject to the standard and appropriate checks, which are really important.  We have a register for dog and television licences but we do not have a register for wills, which is extraordinary.  We have a land registry and a very successful and professional probate service.  We also have registration of births, deaths and marriages but we do not have a register for wills.<\/p><p>I note from previous debates on this matter that the Law Society of Ireland has expressed reservations and concerns, which I expect, as it represents the legal profession.  It has views and it should be consulted.  Again, either the Committee Stage process or pre-legislative scrutiny would be important in this regard, as that body would have opportunities to engage at that stage, which is important.<\/p><p>There have been times when people have felt they had to attend different solicitors in different towns to make different wills, which is extraordinary.  It happens nonetheless, and it is very problematic.  I have spoken with a number of solicitors in the past week and they told me they often receive emails from the incorporated Law Society asking if they have a certain will belonging to a certain person.  People go through an exhaustive process, usually starting in their town, whether it is in Galway, Cavan, Waterford or Wexford, but may not be able to find a will.<\/p><p>I heard a terrible story of two women.  One sister had minded her mother for 40 years and the other sister came home six weeks before the mother's death, admitting afterwards that she removed and destroyed the only will they had in the dining room.  That case went to litigation at great cost to both of the women.  The two sisters fell out and the courts forced the sale of the property.  The sister who spent 40 years with her mother, giving up everything in her life, was chucked out on the road.  How sad is that?  Had the will been safe and out of the family home - or at least if a copy was out of the family home - she would have had some protection.  The courts and the legal profession was sympathetic but there was simply no evidence of a will.  The estate was declared intestate, the courts forced the sale and the legal profession made much money.  Meanwhile, the two women now have virtually nothing.  That should not happen and if there had been a register of wills, they would have known what was going on.<\/p><p>A national register of wills could address such matters.  We all know what matters to people and disputes around estates can become very divisive, difficult and upsetting for all involved.  Many people became benefactors of homes, farms and businesses that were not willed to them.  Another solicitor told me thousands of wills were left in this city of Dublin in an old building not too far away from Leinster House.  The business was completely wound up and in the normal set of circumstances the incorporate Law Society should have been informed of those wills.  He told me the wills dated back from the early 1900s to the 1970s.  Probate was never taken out on these wills and many were never opened.  We only know they were filed alphabetically in a box and if a person said his or her name was \"Boyhan\" or \"Humphreys\", they would see if the file was there.  Those wills were destroyed.  It is a person's last will and testament but there are issues of concern around this.  Not all solicitors are complying with regulations in that when they cease to be in business or amalgamate with another firm, they may not transfer the wills to the people.  It is important because we know that if a will is found after probate takes place and assets have been distributed, the will is null and void.<\/p><p>People could find an only existing will five years afterwards but if the case has been in probate and the assets have been distributed, that is the end of it.  It is a case being sorry but it is not good enough.  The best way to achieve the key objectives of this Bill is to pass the legislation now.  I know the Minister has considered this already.  That is her style and I know how she operates.  I know she will have an idea she will like to share with us.  I respect that but I am conscious of the amendment that the Government has put down.  I am proposing the legislation but the first I learned of the amendment was when it was notified to me in a general email some time late yesterday afternoon.  I had no prior knowledge or discussion about it and nobody told me, as the person who moved the legislation, that this would be done.  That is the process and I deal with that process.<\/p><p>The amendment proposes a delay of nine months, which is, to be frank, too long.  We have been talking about this since 2005.  I know that because I looked at the relevant sections of the Official Report.  The T&aacute;naiste has spoken about this and urged that we go ahead.  I have the transcript of the speech where he suggested we go to Committee Stage.  All I am asking today is that we go to Committee Stage.  So what?  I am not saying we should have that next week or next month but let us agree today not to have to bear another reading but to agree to go to Committee Stage.  If it takes two or three months, that would be grand, but it cannot be nine months for another reading at this point.  After all, this was passed through the Houses and been voted on by many Members.  It is an important point.<\/p><p>I understand there is an idea of an online register.  One aspect of the T&aacute;naiste's contribution from back then that I like is that there may be a need to look at an online Irish wills register.  Covid-19 has taught us something about being online.  This is simply a register and it is not about the content and who made what.  This would be a central register pointing to where the wills are deposited.  He spoke about looking at the possibility of an online system.  A wills register is an essential part of legal services.  I am talking to the Minister, who wears several caps and is the Minister for Justice as well, but she is not here today in her capacity with the justice brief.  She has much influence and people listen to her.  They do not take \"No\" from her.  She can make this happen.  She represents a rural constituency.<\/p><p>I will tell her about two brothers in Bailieborough that I flagged with her when I spoke to her outside.  They were promised they would inherit the family farm but in the end there was a dispute, as has happened so many times.  It is so sad when we think of people who have fallen out over disputes involving land inheritance.  We are talking about their heritage, their belonging and where they came from.  They want to keep it but that may not happen if there is a dispute.  These brothers fell apart, with one developing mental health issues.  He is constantly struggling and feels betrayed and done out because, again, the will was destroyed.  Somebody consciously set out to go into the dresser in the kitchen, bring the will outside and burn it because it was advantageous to that party to do so.  How sad could that be and what legacy does that leave?<\/p><p>I do not need to share with the Minister or anybody in the House why so many suicides have happened and so many guns have been pulled on brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers over land disputes.  It is about inheritance.  We should remember the little boy who picked the stones from the fields or the fellow who settled the dry wall.  We should remember the fellow who drove the cattle across the road to a few conacres he rented because he did not have it himself.  He did not want his few acres overgrazed.  These were noble men working the land and were proud to do it.  They wanted to keep that land in their family name.  Would the Minister begrudge that to anybody?  I certainly would not.<\/p><p>A lawyer spoke to me today about a promissory estoppel.  Within contract law, promissory estoppel refers to the doctrine that a party may recover on the basis of a promise - an honour and commitment - when the party's reliance on that promise was reasonable and the party attempting to recover detrimentally relied on that promise.  The three main components needed for promissory estoppel are the promiser, the promisee and the promise that was not honoured.  The injustice happens when the promisee suffers loss when he or she relied on that promise but it was not kept.  In simple terms, it is legitimate expectation of inheritance and belonging that was, in a person's understanding, entitled to him or her or due to come his or her way.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is not to mention the free labour, the toll and the commitment and sacrifices that one member of a family might have made to stay with an elderly parent and to allow the other members of the family move on.  That comes at a price too.  As a rural representative, the Minister will appreciate that people make sacrifices, and not always by choice.  Often an elderly father, mother or guardian cannot be left alone.  Those who remain do not necessarily get paid.  They might get out-of-pocket expenses on good days and nothing on bad days, but they have the hope that on the passing of the parent or loved one if a will is safe and can be found and executed they will inherit what they have been told is theirs.  That is fair.  People have the right to leave property to other people, to exclude others from their wills and to make early provision for people.  That is important too.<\/p><p>I have made a reasonable case for this measure.  I know the Minister is fair and reasonable.  I paid particular emphasis to the importance of the family farm because that is the kernel of so many of the inquiries I have received.  I have only one ask, that is, that the Minister agree to allow this Bill to proceed to the next Stage.  I am not demanding that Committee Stage would take place this month or next month, but that she would give reasonable consideration to my request such that people listening in to this debate can have hope.  I know the Minister is committed, fair and reasonable.  This is a time for her to support and stand in solidarity with the people who need a decision today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#FF00300","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his impassioned speech on the legislation, which has been before the House previously and discussed at length.

There is no doubting the principle of what he is promoting and proposing.  What Senator Boyhan has proposed is in the best interests of the people of Ireland.  It is only right that we remember the work of the former Senator, Terry Leyden, in regard to this issue.  I appreciate Senator Boyhan mentioning him.  I recall Terry Leyden speaking very eloquently and passionately about the need for this legislation at a Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party meeting.  He had the full support of the party in bringing forward legislation to deal with it.  I was pleased to see Deputy Devlin seek leave to have it reintroduced in the D&aacute;il in order that it could be progressed further.<\/p> <p>On the Bill, Senator Boyhan covered it so well that I cannot expand in any way on the reasons we need to have legislation that deals with wills and ensures that following death, the last wishes of a person are respected such that we do not have situations where land, property and money, etc., unfortunately do not go where the deceased person wanted or, indeed, where solicitors and the State end up taking the bulk of it.  I have been through the probate process in regard to my father.  It is a difficult enough process when there is a will that is very clear in that it takes a significant amount of time.  I can only imagine how difficult the process is when there is no clear will.  We should send out from this House a clear message that everybody should make a will and ensure it is clear in terms of their wishes.  As stated, none of us know the day nor the hour in terms of where we will be.<\/p> <p>With regard to my party's support, we had a lengthy discussion on this legislation when it was put forward by Terry Leyden.  At that stage, it was allowed to progress.  Fianna F&aacute;il is not opposing this Bill but we support the nine-month timeframe set out in the Government amendment.<\/p> <p>It is fair to say that the concerns which were expressed in relation to the previous Bill still stand.  The Law Society of Ireland and the General Registry Office, GRO, have previously raised concerns with regard to weaknesses in the approach being proposed in this Bill.  I would hope that those weaknesses could be strengthened and that the Bill would come into law.   There is no doubt that detailed further engagement with the relevant authorities is needed, including with the Department of Justice, the Probate Office, the GRO and the Department of Social Protection.  The proposers of the Bill rightly claim that such a register will reduce the risk of the existence of a will remaining unknown or being found belatedly and will facilitate the discovery of a will after the death of a testator.  That is important.  The Bill will also enable a solicitor to register the name and address of the custodian of the will to reduce the risk of it remaining unknown or being found belatedly.  It also provides for the privacy of the registered particulars of the will prior to the testator's death.  All of these are important provisions. <\/p> <p>In terms of the concerns raised by the Law Society of Ireland and the GRO, in 2005, when a Bill was first proposed, the Law Society of Ireland opposed it on a number of grounds, primarily that the proposed registration is to be voluntary and would have limited effect, that registration does not guarantee that the registered will is the final will and that registration is not proof of validity.  We would need to a devise a system to ensure the will that is registered is the final will.  A responsible person might make a will at an early age.  As we age and go through different stages in our lives, to whom we wish to leave the benefits of our life's work will, possibly, change.  Ensuring that a will is the final will and testament is important.  <\/p> <p>There is also concern in regard to the appropriateness of establishing the proposed register by amendment of the Civil Registration Act 2004 because civil registration deals with registration of life events such as births, stillbirths, marriages, adoptions and deaths and not with matters relating to public or legal administration.  These systems are central to the determination of identity and legal underpinning of identity.  The registers currently maintained by the GRO have the presumption of accuracy based on independent evidence of the event.  The GRO has expressed concern that the establishment of such a register could undermine the reputation of that office.  We need to look at how we can address its concerns but, again, I think that is something we can do.  <\/p> <p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this noteworthy Bill.  I wish the proposers well and thank them for bringing it back before the House.  It is an important Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100600002#HH00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1633512600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;That&quot; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>- &quot;the Bill be read a second time this day 9 months to allow for comprehensive consideration of the implications of the Bill.&quot; <\/blockquote> <p>I note the comments of Senator Boyhan.  In fairness, this amendment is not about opposing the Bill.  Rather, it is about ensuring it is given full consideration, as is expected of us.  As Senator O'Loughlin said, it is important to acknowledge the work that has been done here previously by others.  I was not a Member of this House when Terry Leyden was a Member.  He had an excellent reputation as a Senator.  It is important for him that we follow through on the discussion on this Bill.  I acknowledge Senator Boyhan in bringing this Bill forward and the passion with which he delivered it.  There are an awful lot of people in this House who share his views on the complications that can arise in relation to wills.  I come from a farming family.
