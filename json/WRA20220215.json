The Government has committed to providing significant additional resources to general practice to help to meet those challenges.<\/p>  <p>  The 2019 Agreement with GPs will see investment in general practice increase by approximately 40%, or &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented.  We are on schedule in the delivery of those resources, with an increase of funding of &euro;143.6 million provided between 2019 and 2021, and an additional &euro;63 million provided in Budget 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The 2019 Agreement provides for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GPs, and new fees and subsidies for additional services. The Agreement also provides for increased support for GPs in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  Previously, changes were made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible GMS GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, while enhanced supports for rural GP practices were introduced, and since increased by the 2019 GP Agreement, to support rural GPs and make rural GMS panels more attractive. <\/p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has increased steadily in recent years from 120 in 2009 to 233 trainees enrolled in 2021. Further increases are expected following the transfer of responsibility for training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners.  <\/p>  <p>  The vital role played by general practice and GPs individually throughout the COVID crisis is acknowledged. General practice has continued to operate, providing both Covid and non-Covid care to their patients. In return, the Government has provided substantial additional payments of over &euro;300 million to general practice to enable GPs to provide: consultation services; assessments and referrals for Covid tests; Covid respiratory clinics; and Covid vaccinations.

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the data requested by the Deputy, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) collect, collate and publish waiting lists in respect of outpatient specialties and inpatient\/daycase procedures. The NTPF have advised my Department that waiting times can be examined in terms of the appointment or procedure that a patient is waiting for, however, it is not possible to identify the number of patients waiting by clinical diagnosis, for example how many patients with spina bifida are on the waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  While waiting list data is classified in this very specific way, it is possible to provide a broader update in terms of services for children with Spina Bifida.  Children's Health Ireland have advised my Department that Temple Street has doubled its capacity from 2 Multidisciplinary (MDT) clinics to 4 MDT outpatient clinics per month. This will improve access to specialists in the area of Neurodisability, Neurosurgery, Orthopaedics, Urology, Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, and Neuropsychology. The clinics also provide access to a Medical Social worker and a Clinical Nurse Specialist. CHI has advised the Department that this capacity increase is expected to provide each child with an annual review and will reduce the waiting time for follow up appointments.<\/p>  <p>  Children with Spina Bifida often require specialist orthopaedic procedures. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision, particularly for Children's Health Ireland. On the 7th February 2022, I met with senior officials of Children&rsquo;s Heath Ireland (CHI) and the HSE, as well as senior orthopaedic clinicians from Temple Street, Crumlin and Cappagh, to discuss increased orthopaedic activity at CHI and additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures, including children with Spina Bifida, by year end.<\/p>  <p>  In order to tackle waiting lists for orthopaedic paediatric surgery and support the needs of patients with Spina Bifida, an additional &euro;5 million has recently been committed to improve access, including through additional theatre and diagnostic capacity to be brought on stream this year. <\/p>  <p>  This funding will be used to build on the working on-going to improve access to orthopaedics. In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively.<\/p>  <p>  Children's Health Ireland have confirmed that they continue to examine new and innovative ways to improve access to orthopaedic services. &ldquo;Cappagh Kids&rdquo; at the National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional theatre capacity for non-complex, age appropriate, orthopaedic procedures, freeing up much needed space at central CHI sites for children with complex, multi-disciplinary needs. Additional orthopaedic outpatient sessions are also now held at Cappagh, providing additional capacity to see and assess children on the outpatient waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a new fast-track orthopaedic pathway has been developed as part of outpatient reduction plans. Paediatric Active Clinical Triage has already been introduced for the longest waiters (over 12 months) on the paediatric outpatient list.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p>  <p>  Today I brought to Government the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan which includes high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting.<\/p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come to ensure that our waiting lists are in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets.

Furthermore, due to a combination of screening and treatment improvements, the mortality rate for breast cancer in Ireland has steadily and significantly declined in Ireland over the period 1994-2018. This is also evident in the survival rates for breast cancer, which have increased from 69% in 1994-1999 to 88% for those diagnosed between 2014-2018. Indeed, of the 200,000 estimated cancer survivors in Ireland in 2019, almost a quarter of these were patients with a previous breast cancer diagnosis.<\/p><p>I am fully committed to supporting our population screening programmes which are a valuable part of our health service, enabling early treatment and care for many people, and improving the overall health of our population.

In this regard, it is important to be aware, that future decisions about changes to our national screening programmes, including reducing the age range in breast screening, will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC).  This independent expert group considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria. It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms.  It may be of interest to that the NSAC recently held its first 'Annual Call', importantly it gave members of the public and health professionals an opportunity to suggest new screening programmes or modifications to existing ones.  I am looking forward to receiving recommendations from the NSAC and will be guided by such to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s population-based screening programmes continues to evolve in line with new evidence and developments.<\/p><p>It is an important message, screening is for healthy people without symptoms.  If anyone becomes aware of symptoms, or if they have concerns or worries, they should contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. It is important that every woman is breast aware. This means knowing what is normal for them so that if any unusual change occurs, they will recognise it.

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.<\/p>  <p>  Clinical leadership is central to the delivery of the changes required by our healthcare system and reducing waiting lists. National Clinical Programmes (NCPs) are the vehicle through which multi-disciplinary clinical design leadership and innovation are enabled.

The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p>  <p>  The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting.

The scheme will include the full range of contraceptive options already available to GMS (medical) card holders, two GP visits per year, and any necessary fitting, removal and check-up appointments required for long-acting reversible contraception.<\/p><p>A significant portion of the overall investment has been allocated to the continued investment in significant service developments, such as ambulatory gynaecological services.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 provided &euro;3.31m to facilitate the establishment of the final six ambulatory gynaecology clinics, which will bring the total number of such clinics around the country to 20. This will complete the implementation of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care. I am advised that NWIHP has completed its engagement with the relevant hospitals in relation to these clinics and has indicated that these developments are on schedule. <\/p><p>Similarly, with an investment of &euro;0.58 million, further developments will be made in menopause care through the development of three new specialist menopause clinics based in Galway, Cork and Limerick respectively. This follows on from the establishment of the first such clinic in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street last year. The operationalisation of the new clinics will be dependent on resourcing the necessary staff, however, NWIHP has advised that the engagement with the relevant Hospital Groups in this regard is progressing as planned. <\/p><p>A further &euro;0.25 million has been allocated to Sexual Assault Treatment Units, which will enhance the services provided in this area over the course of 2022.<\/p><p>A portion of this funding, &euro;0.54 million, has been allocated to the establishment of a Obstetric Event Support Team within the National Women and Infants Health Programme, To date, Phase 1 has been rolled out in the Saolta, South\/Southwest and UL Hospital Groups, with Phase 2 due to commence in March 2022 covering the remaining Hospital Groups. <\/p><p>Along with continued investment in ongoing development, Budget 2022 commits &euro;0.7 million as a first-time investment in tackling period poverty. Following a call for expressions of interest, my Department is engaging with Local Authorities with regard to period poverty mitigation measures in their areas. Planning in partnership with HSE Social Inclusion and local community representatives has commenced with regard to initial roll-out to Travellers and Roma. Engagement with the voluntary sector will commence in the next few weeks.<\/p><p>The remainder of the fund will see us build on initiatives started in 2021, by further extending the complex endometriosis services (&euro;1.39 million) that I mentioned previously along with the commencement of a structured and resourced service in the Dublin and Cork regions for perinatal genetics services (&euro;1.34 million). I understand that NWIHP is engaging with the proposed service providers and this project remains on schedule. <\/p><p>Details on the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce are found at www.gov.ie\/en\/campaigns\/-womens-health\/.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500057#WRC05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Services","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500057#WRC05700"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[7908\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500057#WRC05800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the efforts to improve community health services in Fingal, County Dublin in line with growing population centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500057#WRC05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500057#WRC06000"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[7974\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500057#WRC06100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the work underway to increase the number of frontline nursing and midwifery staff in hospitals to help increase capacity and improve experiences for both staff and patients.","asker":"1566","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the health service has been committed to ensuring sufficient staffing levels to meet both COVID-related and long-term healthcare demand.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school, or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled, who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to request the National Immunisation Advisory Committee consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:<\/p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and<\/p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.<\/p>  <p>  If the NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500058#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500058#WRD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[7827\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500058#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will allocate additional resources to HSE for additional  out-of-hours general practitioner cover in rural areas.","asker":"1602","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>GPs contracted under the General Medical Services Scheme are required by their contract to make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with them, or a locum or deputy, for emergencies outside of normal practice hours.

This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified. HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic.

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients.<\/p><p>Children with a range of needs rely on the orthopaedic service of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, for example children with Spina Bifida, hip deformity, and other orthopaedic needs. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision.<\/p><p>Two months ago, I met with the Scoliosis Co-Design Group. This is a well-established and successful group which facilitates a multi-disciplinary approach to service improvement. The group includes members from advocacy groups, as well as orthopaedic consultants from Children's Health Ireland, and senior management from across the CHI sites.  Further to this meeting I requested that Children's Health Ireland (CHI) draw up a plan to improve waiting times for orthopaedic services, particularly for those children with conditions such as scoliosis and Spina Bifida where time is a crucial factor in ensuring that these children have a positive outcome from their surgeries. <\/p><p>Last week I convened a meeting with the clinical teams from Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital, along with senior management from these hospitals and the HSE. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the draft orthopaedic waiting list plan and to ensure that an appropriate plan with ambitious and attainable activity levels was being produced. The plan will be funded in the context of the wider waiting list action plan for 2022 and will include additional activity to reduce the spinal orthopaedic waiting list through the use of theatres at Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh. In the context of the waiting list action plan additional capacity will also be sought in the private sector to work towards reducing paediatric orthopaedic waiting times. <\/p><p>In terms of broader services for children with Spina Bifida, CHI have advised the Department of Health that CHI at Temple Street has doubled capacity from 2 Multidisciplinary (MDT) clinics to 4 MDT outpatient clinics per month. This will improve access to specialists in the area of Neurodisability, Neurosurgery, Orthopaedics, Urology, Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, and Neuropsychology. The clinics also provide access to a Medical Social worker and a Clinical Nurse Specialist. CHI has advised the Department that this capacity increase is expected to provide each child with an annual review and will reduce the waiting time for follow up appointments. <\/p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.<\/p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500058#WRD05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500059#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[7835\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500059#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made in addressing the backlog of audiology appointments in counties Cavan and Monaghan.","asker":"1451","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500059#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500059#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[7973\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500059#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the issues in accessing general practitioner care in Lucan, County Dublin; the actions that are being taken to improve access to general practitioner care nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, including the limited access to GP services in certain areas. We are working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.<\/p>  <p>  GPs are self-employed practitioners and therefore may establish practices at a place of their own choosing. There is no prescribed ratio of GPs to patients and the State does not regulate the number of GPs that can set up in a town or community. Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the selection process to find a replacement GP.<\/p>  <p>  Currently there are 14 GMS GP contracts listed in Lucan, none of which are vacant.  One contract holder is retiring imminently, and this list has been advertised by the Primary Care GP Unit.<\/p>  <p>  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years. The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with large increases made in recent years. Further increases are expected as responsibility for training has transferred from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible\/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.<\/p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. The wider reforms in the health service will also help to provide an atmosphere in which the practice of medicine in Ireland will remain attractive. The additional investment in general practice provides a sound basis for ensuring that GPs have access to a credible and rewarding career path in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500059#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500059#WRE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[7989\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500059#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of Covid-19 vaccines that have been administered in pharmacies in each county in tabular form;

The &ldquo;Elective Hospitals Oversight Group&rdquo;, under the joint governance of the Health Service Executive, Department of Health and Sl&aacute;intecare, has been guiding the development of the elective hospital proposals, following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code, setting out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning, and management of large public investment projects.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2021 the Government agreed, subject to the necessary approvals and requirements under the Public Spending Code being met, a new National Elective Ambulatory Care Strategy. This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. No other locations are under active consideration. It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement an elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as a wide catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas including Limerick and neighbouring mid-west counties.<\/p>  <p>  The elective care scope of service will be developed in two phases commencing with day cases, diagnostics, and outpatients and then by in-patient treatment. On this basis, the Elective Care Centres (ECCs) will be designed to provide sufficient capacity to facilitate future phases, including some elective in patient capacity, thereby providing a sustainable and strategic response to cater for the highly dynamic landscape of healthcare policy and practice. <\/p>  <p>  A Programme Preliminary Business Case and a Project Preliminary Business Case (PBC) for Cork have now been completed, while project PBCs for Galway and Dublin are at an advanced stage of development.  The Business Cases will be subject to technical review by the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, including through the recently introduced External Assurance Process. Pending favourable review(s) under the Spending Code, further memoranda for Government would then be brought forward to progress the programme for Cork, Galway and Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500059#WRE06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[7727\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has considered the appointment of a chief social care officer for social care services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":254,"content":"<p>Under the Public Service Management Act, the Secretary General of the Department of Health has the authority, responsibility and accountability for a range of functions, including the assignment of staff within an appropriate structure to facilitate an effective response to matters that pertain to the Department, while ensuring cost effective public services.<\/p>  <p>  As part of a review of its structure to meet its strategic priorities, the Department is considering arrangements for incorporating relevant expert advice for its policy work on a multi-disciplinary basis.

I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients.<\/p>  <p>  Children with a range of needs rely on the orthopaedic service of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, for example children with Spina Bifida, hip deformity, and other orthopaedic needs. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision.<\/p>  <p>  Two months ago, I met with the Scoliosis Co-Design Group. This is a well-established and successful group which facilitates a multi-disciplinary approach to service improvement. The group includes members from advocacy groups, as well as orthopaedic consultants from Children's Health Ireland, and senior management from across the CHI sites.  Further to this meeting I requested that Children's Health Ireland (CHI) draw up a plan to improve waiting times for orthopaedic services, particularly for those children with conditions such as scoliosis and Spina Bifida where time is a crucial factor in ensuring that these children have a positive outcome from their surgeries. <\/p>  <p>  Last week I convened a meeting with the clinical teams from Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital, along with senior management from these hospitals and the HSE. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the draft orthopaedic waiting list plan and to ensure that an appropriate plan with ambitious and attainable activity levels was being produced. The plan will be funded in the context of the wider waiting list action plan for 2022 and will include additional activity to reduce the spinal orthopaedic waiting list through the use of theatres at Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh. In the context of the waiting list action plan additional capacity will also be sought in the private sector to work towards reducing paediatric orthopaedic waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of broader services for children with Spina Bifida, CHI have advised the Department of Health that CHI at Temple Street has doubled capacity from 2 Multidisciplinary (MDT) clinics to 4 MDT outpatient clinics per month. This will improve access to specialists in the area of Neurodisability, Neurosurgery, Orthopaedics, Urology, Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, and Neuropsychology. The clinics also provide access to a Medical Social worker and a Clinical Nurse Specialist. CHI has advised the Department that this capacity increase is expected to provide each child with an annual review and will reduce the waiting time for follow up appointments.<\/p>  <p>  The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year.

I announced my commitment to establish dedicated specialist menopause clinics across Ireland on the 10th of September 2021. These clinics will form a core part of a new approach to menopause care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing menopause.<\/p>  <p>  The first specialist menopause clinic opened in the National Maternity Hospital in December 2021. Building on this development, Budget 2022 provided further commitment to a focussed approach in menopause care with funding for three further specialist menopause clinics, to bring the number of clinics nationally to four. Once in place, specialist menopause clinics will be provided in Dublin, Limerick, Galway and Cork working to complement the menopause support available to women in their community.<\/p>  <p>  Additional activity underway and planned in the area of menopause includes:<\/p>  <p>  \u200e<\/p>  <p>  - GP training is a key aspect of women receiving the best care through menopause. The Irish College of GPs are active members of the Women's Health Taskforce and continue to be engaged on how women's health can be better considered within the primary care setting. Relevant activity includes the collaboration between ICGP and the British Menopause Society to develop training in menopause management, which is currently in place; a ICGP Women&rsquo;s Health Webinar on menopause and endometriosis which was held in June 2021 and had 1567 attendees; and a GP Education course which was established in September 2021 in the area of Community Gynaecology Course which includes menopause as a topic. Funding has been provided through the Women's Health Fund to develop a 'quick reference guide' for GPs on the menopause, to support primary care provision in this area. <\/p>  <p>  Of particular relevance to the Deputy's query on a women&rsquo;s health structured care programme, I have outlined my support for a new ICGP post of Clinical Lead for Women&rsquo;s Health in General Practice, the first such post in Ireland. This is currently being progressed and once in place, the Clinical Lead will provide the essential leadership to drive forward an ambitious agenda to enable a comprehensive life-course approach to women&rsquo;s health in general practice. <\/p>  <p>  Further activity in the area of menopause includes:\u200e\u200e<\/p>  <p>  \u200e\u200e - A number of health topics relating to women's health, including menopause, have recently been updated and are now live on the HSE A-Z. This information is an important first step towards delivering enhanced information and education on menopause. A public information webinar on the menopause was held on November 29th 2021.<\/p>  <p>  - A civil service webinar on 'Menopause at work' was held on October 18th, and further HR training to better understand the challenges and solutions for supporting women in their menopause journey within the civil service was held on November 30th.  The Healthy Workplace Framework, published in December 2021, aims to support the growth of effective approaches to enhance health and wellbeing in the workplace. The Framework is underpinned by robust evidence and consultation. An Implementation Group is in the process of being established, which will hold responsibility for developing an action plan. It is envisaged that a representative from Women&rsquo;s Health will be included on the Implementation Group to help ensure the needs of women in the workplace are incorporated.<\/p>  <p>  At present, GPs provide consultations without charge to women who have a medical card or GP visit card. Approved prescribed drugs and medicines, including HRT, are available free to medical card holders, subject to the statutory prescription charge. In addition, under the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than &euro;100 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.<\/p>  <p>  Further research is required to understand the cost and benefit of such a development. This will be considered when planning for further menopause activity to take place in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of menopause in particular has also been emphasised through the nationwide &ldquo;Radical Listening&rdquo; exercise carried out by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This exercise enabled women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services. This was a large-scale consultation process intended to maximise the participation of women across all life stages from 18 years upwards, including minority and disadvantaged women.  278 women participated in open interviews and workshops, where menopause was a recurring theme. Through this process, the taboo around discussing menopause, and a lack of trusted information, were consistently raised as key issues for women experiencing menopause. I published a report on the findings of the &lsquo;Radical listening&rsquo; exercise on September 14th 2021 which can be found here:<\/p>  <p>www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/ebe3e-significant-milestone-as-minister-donnelly-publishes-a-report-of-womens-voices-on-womens-health-following-a-radical-listening-exercise-this-year\/  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Departments","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF04200"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[7952\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the extension of the emergency department and associated works at Mayo University Hospital; the steps that are being taken to accelerate the project timeline; if progress has been made on replacing the CT scanner at the hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabilities Assessments","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF04500"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[5446\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the backlog of assessment of needs for children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":297,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF04800"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[6483\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the mechanisms available and options being explored in relation to truth for families following the deaths of persons (details supplied) given the exclusion of a commission of inquiry.","asker":"1498","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>There has been a very clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic as the national and international understanding of the virus evolves, and where necessary to ensure that the public health-led approach evolves, as evidence and learning materialises.<\/p>  <p>  The independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort in nursing homes. This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified. HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic.

I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients.<\/p><p>Children with a range of needs rely on the orthopaedic service of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, for example children with Spina Bifida, hip deformity, and other orthopaedic needs. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision.<\/p><p>Two months ago, I met with the Scoliosis Co-Design Group. This is a well-established and successful group which facilitates a multi-disciplinary approach to service improvement. The group includes members from advocacy groups, as well as orthopaedic consultants from Children's Health Ireland, and senior management from across the CHI sites.  Further to this meeting I requested that Children's Health Ireland (CHI) draw up a plan to improve waiting times for orthopaedic services, particularly for those children with conditions such as scoliosis and Spina Bifida where time is a crucial factor in ensuring that these children have a positive outcome from their surgeries. <\/p><p>Last week I convened a meeting with the clinical teams from Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital, along with senior management from these hospitals and the HSE. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the draft orthopaedic waiting list plan and to ensure that an appropriate plan with ambitious and attainable activity levels was being produced. The plan will be funded in the context of the wider waiting list action plan for 2022 and will include additional activity to reduce the spinal orthopaedic waiting list through the use of theatres at Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh. In the context of the waiting list action plan additional capacity will also be sought in the private sector to work towards reducing paediatric orthopaedic waiting times. <\/p><p>In terms of broader services for children with Spina Bifida, CHI have advised the Department of Health that CHI at Temple Street has doubled capacity from 2 Multidisciplinary (MDT) clinics to 4 MDT outpatient clinics per month. This will improve access to specialists in the area of Neurodisability, Neurosurgery, Orthopaedics, Urology, Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, and Neuropsychology. The clinics also provide access to a Medical Social worker and a Clinical Nurse Specialist. CHI has advised the Department that this capacity increase is expected to provide each child with an annual review and will reduce the waiting time for follow up appointments. <\/p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.<\/p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual Waiting List plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":304,"content":"<p>Question No. 163 answered with Question No. 97.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF05500"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[1951\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if staff employed on the HSE MyOptions hotline have been trained to provide advice and information for expectant mothers on relevant social welfare entitlements and supports.","asker":"1612","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>As the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to a service area, I have referred this question to the HSE for direct response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500060#WRF05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500061#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[7833\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500061#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress of plans to address the recruitment challenge in the health service which has left a significant number of consultant and hospital posts vacant leading to poorer outcomes for patients, including in mental healthcare.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>As a result of the commitment to sufficiently staff the health service into the long-term, 2020 and 2021 have seen record numbers recruited into the workforce. 2020 saw the largest increase in the health sector workforce since the foundation of the HSE, with 2021 having the second largest. Since the beginning of January 2020, an additional 12,506 WTE have been added to the workforce, which is an increase of 10% above 2019 levels. 7,592 of these WTE have been additional to the Acute sector.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has provided funding for a further large-scale expansion of the health service workforce. A risk has been identified of a reduction of labour supply, given the large amount of recruitment that has already been achieved. To mitigate the risks associated with recruitment in 2022 and to achieve recruitment targets to the fullest extent possible, a number of steps are being taken by the HSE including expanding recruitment capacity, engaging third party agencies to carry out recruitment and expansion of international recruitment frameworks.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to consultant recruitment specifically, in 2021 the Health Service Executive undertook a full review of their processes for the recruitment of consultants to the health service.

From the outset of the pandemic, great focus has been placed by the cancer services on providing safe patient pathways and encouraging people to come forward. Urgent cancer services were maintained throughout the pandemic.<\/p><p>By the time Wave 2, and subsequent Covid Waves, occurred, the degree of resilience built up in cancer services, through staff commitment, revised treatment guidelines, social distancing and infection prevention and control measures, instilled confidence in people that they could access cancer diagnostics and treatment.  Accordingly, services were much less impacted. <\/p><p>As indicated, we are continuing to closely monitor trends in numbers coming forward to diagnostic services, and the level of attendances for appointments for treatment. Based on the most recent figures available: <\/p><p>- the total number of GP e-referrals to cancer Rapid Access Clinics for 2021 stands at 130% of the activity in 2019;  <\/p><p>- the total number of patients seen across all Rapid Access Clinics for 2021 stands at 102% of the activity in 2019; <\/p><p>- the number of patients receiving chemotherapy for January-November 2021 is at approximately 95% of 2019 activity;<\/p><p>- the number of patients receiving radiation oncology for January-November 2021 is at 85% of 2019 activity; and  <\/p><p>- the number undergoing surgical oncology for January-November 2021 is at 80%.  <\/p><p>In December 2021, the Royal College of Physicians Ireland (RCPI), in conjunction with organisations such as the National Cancer Registry Ireland (NCRI) and NCCP, published a report titled <i>'Cancer care in Ireland in 2020 &ndash; The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic'.<\/i>NCRI data included in the report indicates that, as expected, the number of cancer diagnoses in 2020 was lower than in 2019 due to Covid-19. While the full extent of the impact of Covid-19 on cancer patients will not be known until the NCRI 2020 data reaches maturity, the NCRI suggests that the reduction may be between 10% and 14% of the expected figure (which allows for increasing trends due to our increasing and ageing population). <\/p><p>The Government has provided significant extra funding for cancer services in Ireland. Funding of &euro;5m has been provided in 2022 to continue the work of supporting cancer services and increasing capacity in the context of Covid-19. This is in addition to the &euro;12m allocated in 2021. This funding is facilitating additional clinics and the extension of clinic times, as well as allowing for minor infrastructural works to be carried out and for locum and temporary staff to be recruited to support the delivery of services. <\/p><p>In addition, there has been significant investment over the last two years for implementation  of the National Cancer Strategy, with &euro;20m provided in 2021 and a further &euro;20m in 2022. This funding is being utilised to advance the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer and to provide continued support for patients living with and beyond cancer.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I would emphasise that it remains important to stress that anyone with concerns about cancer should visit their GP, who will arrange appropriate follow-up care.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school, or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled, who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to request the National Immunisation Advisory Committee consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:<\/p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and<\/p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.<\/p>  <p>  If the NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500061#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Strategies","counter":330,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500061#WRG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":331,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[7909\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500061#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the work of the Food Reformulation Task Force and the efforts to implement the Roadmap for Food Product Reformulation in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":332,"content":"<p>&ldquo;A Roadmap for Food Product Reformulation in Ireland&rdquo; was launched on 3rd December 2021 by Minister Donnelly and myself.

The health sector is expecting to face significant challenges this winter in providing emergency care while also dealing with Covid-19. Emergency department attendances are close to 2019 levels, exceeding them at some sites, while the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys have been increasing steadily since June 2021.<\/p><p>I met with senior HSE management on the 9th February to discuss the current challenges facing emergency departments. They outlined some very specific challenges in the system at the moment. Higher than normal levels of attendance in recent weeks, combined with around 600 Covid-19 inpatients and 600 delayed transfers of care, is putting intense pressure on hospital capacity. It is increasingly difficult to discharge some patients who need nursing home or stepdown care due to the number of Covid-19 outbreaks in nursing homes. There are also difficulties in discharging some patients home due to issues with providing home care. These issues are compounded by the level of staff absenteeism related to Covid-19. I have requested the HSE to take all appropriate action to mitigate these challenges, as far as possible. <\/p><p>We have put significant resources into preparing the system for winter. 1,146 acute hospital beds were funded under last year&rsquo;s Winter Plan and Budget 2021.

The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and\/or labour shortages in the State, required to develop and support enterprise for the benefit of our economy. However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.<\/p>  <p>  The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit and these lists are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review.<\/p>  <p>  Since March 2020, my Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment, and\u00a0Ireland was one of the few countries which has managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.\u00a0 From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department has issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.\u00a0 The impact of this has resulted in a significant backlog, which has increased from 1,000 in April 2021 to approximately c. 10,500 at the end of January 2022, which is now stabilising.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits following the latest Review of the Occupational Lists has increased the availability of employment permits for these roles.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack.\u00a0 As a result, employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other nonstandard methods.\u00a0 This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications, requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in the process and had a direct impact on wider processing times for other permit applications.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises the impact delays on the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and has developed a plan of action to reduce processing times built up over the pandemic. My Department has approved a trebling of staff in the employment permits section in order to deal with the increase in applications.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the plan to deal with this issue is implemented and begins to take effect, we expect to see improvements shortly, with the backlog considerably reduced by the end of Q1 and substantially reduced by the end of Q2 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, further systemic changes have also been introduced.\u00a0 My Department has worked with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice to streamline and extend the time period for General Employment Permits (GEP) issued to doctors.\u00a0 A new two-year multi-site GEP for Medical Doctors in Public hospitals and Public health facilities was introduced in respect of the January 2022 Doctors rotation.\u00a0 This will result in significant benefits for applicants, as well as major efficiencies for the Employment Permits Section, by eliminating the necessity to apply for additional employment permits when moving to a different Public hospital or Public health facility within this two year period.<\/p>  <p>  The Department provides regular updates on its website in relation to processing times and engages directly with key stakeholders including the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, AmCham, IBEC, representative groups and individual companies, as required.<\/p>  <p>  Applicants can keep track of Employment Permit applications current processing dates at enterprise.gov.ie\/en\/What-We-Do\/Workplace-and-Skills\/Employment-Permits\/Current-Application-Processing-Dates<\/p>  <p>  The Management Board of my Department is overseeing the implementation of the plan of action and its impact on waiting times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500062#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500062#WRH02900"},{"type":"question","counter":399,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[7912\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500062#WRH03000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the range of supports provided by his Department to social enterprises.","asker":"1466","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":400,"content":"<p>Policy responsibility for Social Enterprises lies with the Department of Rural and Community Development, which provides funding to Social Enterprises as defined by the National Social Enterprise Policy 2019 &ndash; 2022, with a view to complementing mainstream business supports.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices can assist in the establishment and\/or development of new and existing enterprises (limited company, individuals\/sole trader, cooperatives and partnerships), including those that are considered social enterprises, provided that such enterprises are capable of attaining commercial viability and subject to certain criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Local Enterprise Offices offer one to one Mentoring and Training services and a wide range of high-quality business and management development programmes.

A key target set out in the Climate Action Plan is to carry out a work programme to identify a route to deliver one to three terra-watt hours of zero emissions gas (including green hydrogen) by 2030. The plan includes a suite of actions relating to green hydrogen across the electricity, enterprise and transport chapters and includes:<\/p>  <p>  - testing the technical feasibility of safely injecting green hydrogen blends in the gas grid;<\/p>  <p>  - assessing the potential for system integration between the electricity and gas networks, which will include the production, storage and use of green hydrogen;<\/p>  <p>  - progressing research and pilot studies regarding the use of hydrogen in the transport sector. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is developing a number of initiatives on the role of green hydrogen in decarbonisation. The 2021 SEAI National Energy Research Development &amp;amp; Demonstration (RD&amp;D) Programme Call included a number of projects relating to green hydrogen, and the development of floating offshore wind foundations coupled with hydrogen storage. The SEAI is currently conducting the National Heat Study, which aims to examine options to decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors in Ireland to 2050, including options for green hydrogen. The outcomes of this study are due to be published shortly.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the Climate Action Plan will be updated on an annual basis to reflect ongoing developments and targets achieved. I expect a strategy focussing on the development of green hydrogen to be included in Climate Action Plan 2022. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500062#WRH05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":423,"content":"<p>Question No. 203 answered with Question No. 202.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Action Plan","counter":425,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500063#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[7594\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500063#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when the Climate Action Plan for 2022 will be published.","asker":"1466","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":427,"content":"<p>The climate ambition in the Programme for Government has been placed on a statutory footing through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, which was signed into law in July 2021.

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares.<\/p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision. All PSO providers are currently in receipt of emergency support funding to compensate for fare revenue loss arising as a result of the impact of Covid-19 on the sector, and the associated fall in passenger numbers (passenger numbers fell to below 10% of 2019 levels at the height of the restrictions in 2020 and 2021). Further, on 25\/06\/2020 Government approved the introduction of temporary financial supports for the licensed bus sector &ndash; commercial operators (in accordance with EU and national legislation).<\/p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). &euro;9m of the &euro;538m allocation has been provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector for the first three months of the year. While, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use public transport every day. A further &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares. This is in addition to the forthcoming introduction of the Young Adult Card (YAC), which will provide people aged between 19 and 23, with an average discount on fares of 50%.<\/p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.

My Department is engaging with relevant stakeholders to inform this work and it is envisaged that the strategy will be published for consultation early this year.<\/p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the roll-out of charge point  infrastructure.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes developing appropriate guidance for local authorities in line with the Programme for Government which will ensure we can continue to expand our national charging network through the supports for on street chargers. I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure.

The installation of high powered charging hubs will be the priority for the remainder of the program.<\/p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.  ESB are awaiting the delivery of new chargers which have twice the charging capacity and speed when compared to the existing technology.  This element of the programme will restart when the units are delivered and conclude in Q3.<\/p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete, 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.<\/p>  <p>  The project is due to be completed in 2023.  <\/p>  <p>  Further details on ESB charge points nationwide can be found at www.esb.ie\/ecars\/charge-point-map<\/p>  <p>  In light of the ESB eCars responsibility in the matter of the provision of charge points, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the ESB for direct response.

The EWSS is operated on a self-assessment basis with the onus on applicants to satisfy themselves that they fully meet the eligibility criteria for the scheme as set down in the legislation and to self-declare to Revenue that they correctly qualify. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for the EWSS, a business must have tax clearance and have suffered a minimum 30% reduction in turnover or business orders in the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021, for pay dates on or between 1 July 2021 and 30 April 2022, due to the impact of COVID-19. The &lsquo;reference period&rsquo; used to establish the minimum 30% reduction varies depending on when a business commenced trading. For example, where a business was established prior to 1 January 2019, the &lsquo;reference period&rsquo; is 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. There is no discretion in the legislation to apply a different qualifying criteria other than the 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders in the reference period. This remains the case where a business diversifies into other trades.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question registered for EWSS in August 2020 and received payments until it deregistered from the scheme in early August 2021. As the business started trading prior to 2019, it is required to compare its turnover or customer orders against 2019 (reference period) to determine if there is a minimum 30% decline in turnover or business orders, for pay dates falling between 1 July 2021 to 30 April 2022. According to the information provided by the business, it is not currently experiencing this level of decline and as such is not entitled to the EWSS. This does not impact on eligibility for certain other COVID-19 support schemes such as the Debt Warehouse Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue confirmed to me that it has already engaged directly with the business to explain the eligibility criteria required for the EWSS. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in response to the additional public health measures announced on 17 December, the Government further announced on 21 December 2021, that the EWSS would reopen for certain businesses who would otherwise not be eligible and that such businesses could continue to be supported until the expiry of the scheme on 30 April 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The new arrangements for EWSS provided employers who had previously availed of EWSS but who were no longer eligible, with the opportunity to re-qualify for the scheme where they met certain conditions. Broadly, to re-qualify the business must experience a 30% reduction in turnover, or customer orders during a particular reference period. For example, for businesses established on or before 30 April 2019, to re-qualify for EWSS, the business must have anticipated that their combined turnover for December 2021 and January 2022 would be down by at least 30% compared with their combined turnover for December 2019 and January 2020. The business must also have a valid tax clearance certificate.<\/p>  <p>  Employers that qualified for re-entry to the scheme received support on a prospective basis from 1 January 2022, and they can remain in the scheme until its expiry date (30 April 2022).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500066#WRO05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Agreements","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500066#WRO05400"},{"type":"question","counter":624,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[8349\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500066#WRO05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount that Ireland paid into the EU unrecycled plastic packaging levy in 2020 and 2021; and if the moneys came from the central budget and not from the packaging producers.","asker":"1468","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":625,"content":"<p>As part of the overall agreement on the Post-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and Next Generation EU (NGEU), EU leaders also made a number of changes to the current system of own resources, including the introduction of a plastic-based contribution based on non-recycled plastic packaging. <\/p>  <p>  The plastic-based contribution is calculated on the weight of non-recycled plastic packaging waste with a call rate of &euro;0.80 per kilogram.

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. Ireland applies excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to fuels used for motor or heating purposes. <\/p><p>MOT is comprised of a non-carbon and a carbon component; the carbon component is also referred to as carbon tax. The Deputy will be aware that the 2020 Programme for Government committed to increasing the amount that is charged per tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions from fuels to &euro;100 by 2030. I followed through on this commitment by introducing legislation in Finance Act 2020 to provide for a 10-year trajectory for carbon tax increases to reach &euro;100 per tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub>by 2030. This measure is a key pillar underpinning the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. <\/p><p>It is important to note that a significant portion of carbon tax revenue is allocated for expenditure on targeted welfare measures and energy efficiency measures, which not only support the most vulnerable households in society but also in the long term, provides support against fuel price impacts by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. <\/p><p>Of course, the Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices and for this reason we designed a package of measures to alleviate the impact of increased energy prices on households. <\/p><p>The package of measures includes:<\/p><p>- an increase in the energy credit to &euro;200 including VAT, estimated to impact just over 2 million households (to be paid in April)<\/p><p>- a lump sum payment of &euro;125 on the fuel allowance will be paid in early March to 390,000 recipients<\/p><p>- to reduce the burden on people returning to the workplace and people using public transport, there will be a temporary reduction in fares of 20% from the end of April to the end of the year. This will impact approximately 800,000 daily users<\/p><p>- the original Sl&aacute;intecare report proposed a reduction of the Drug Payment Scheme from &euro;144 to &euro;100. The government has decided to reduce this further to &euro;80. This will benefit just over 70,000 families<\/p><p>- the working family payment budget increase announced on Budget Day will be brought forward from 1 June to 1 April<\/p><p>- reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children<\/p><p>In designing a support package, the Government was conscious of the need to target the main underlying problem &ndash; higher energy prices &ndash; while operating within the fiscal framework set out in the Summer Economic Statement. The suite of measures was announced last week and strikes the appropriate balance. This package provides support to every household via the electricity credit but also provides specific supports for more vulnerable households through targeted welfare measures.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that tax registered businesses are eligible to apply for a refund on the tax paid for fuels used in the course of business.Additionally, the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS) allows qualifying road haulage and transport operators to claim a partial repayment of MOT on their transport fuels when the pump price of diesel goes above &euro;1.23 per litre. The DRS was amended in 2019 to increase the rate of rebate and it continues to be an important support to the road transport sector.<\/p><p>The Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion of introducing an adjustable qualifier to result in variable MOT rates dependant on market fluctuations would undermine the tax policy initiatives that I have implemented to support delivery of critical emissions reductions strategies, including the allocation of expenditure for the Just Transition.  It is also a broad based measure which would not provide targeted support to those households most vulnerable to fuel poverty. I am satisfied that the package of measures announced last week, in addition to the support measures announced in Budget 2022, is the most effective means of reducing the impact of inflationary trends on households.  <\/p><p>On a general point regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal, I am advised by Revenue that administering fluctuating tax rates would be extremely challenging and likely to result in considerable additional administrative burden for taxpayers and for Revenue.

manner in 2020, meaning the collection of any tax due was deferred until year end. This approach was adopted to ensure that payments reached recipients as quickly as possible, given the suddenness of the pandemic and in the expectation at the time that the emergency supports would be short-term in nature, which turned out not to be the case due to the continued prevalence of COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  From 2021, the mechanism to tax the PUP, in common with other Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments, including Jobseekers&rsquo; Benefit and Illness Benefit, is to reduce the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands, ensuring as far as possible, that the right amount of tax is collected at the right time thereby preventing arrears building up. Where employees return to work following PUP, they are placed on a Week 1 basis to minimise potential financial hardship and prevent any further underpayments arising in the year. <\/p>  <p>  Where tax liabilities (including PUP) still existed for 2020 after all additional tax credits such as health expenses were applied, the outstanding balance is automatically collected interest free over four years from 1 January 2022 by reducing the employee&rsquo;s tax credits. For employees that have an overpayment on record for 2021, the amount due is automatically offset to the underpayment for previous years. This is normal practice to ensure the taxpayer&rsquo;s overall tax position is rectified as soon as possible, allowing restoration of full tax credits.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that taxpayers engaging a tax agent do so at their own discretion and any commission paid is a matter between both parties. Revenue has also confirmed that it provides a comprehensive range of online services for taxpayers to self-manage their tax affairs.

However, proof of the vehicle&rsquo;s status in NI prior to 1 January 2021 will be required. <\/p><p>For example:<\/p><p>- A ferry ticket showing the date of arrival in NI, and which clearly identifies the specific vehicle<\/p><p>- A copy of an invoice from a transport company identifying the vehicle and delivery date<\/p><p>- Tax and insurance details indicating use in NI<\/p><p><b>or<\/b><\/p><p><b>- <\/b>A copy of the V5C showing the last registered keeper in NI and a date of registration to that keeper prior to 1 January 2021.<\/p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that where a second hand vehicle is imported from GB after 1 January 2021 and the Customs formalities were completed in Northern Ireland, the person wishing to register the vehicle in Ireland should first contact Revenue as there will be a VAT liability that needs to be discharged prior to registering the vehicle for VRT. This measure was introduced as a result of a UK decision to allow the VAT margin scheme to apply to imports of vehicles from GB to NI. A &lsquo;Supplementary Import Declaration &ndash; VAT on import&rsquo; must be made to Revenue in respect of the VAT margin scheme and qualifying vehicle being imported from NI. Revenue will request verification that the Customs formalities have been completed in NI. Once the VAT, which is charged at the standard rate, is either paid or accounted for (in the case of VAT registered businesses only), Revenue will provide the necessary documentation to the customer for presentation to the NCT centre. <\/p><p>There are two methods of calculating the VAT:<\/p><p>- For vehicles purchased directly from a NI dealer:  VAT is charged on the VAT inclusive value shown on the invoice issued by the NI dealer. No additional costs are added for cost of transport and Customs duties because these costs will already be included in the price charged by the NI dealer. <\/p><p>- For vehicles purchased from GB and imported to Ireland via NI by the same person:  VAT is charged on the Customs value of the vehicle i.e. the VAT inclusive value shown on the invoice issued by the dealer plus transport costs to the point of importation plus Customs duties paid.<\/p><p>This is a temporary arrangement until the situation regarding VAT at importation is regularised for vehicles imported from GB to NI.

Under the provisions of the EU - UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, if the imported vehicle is of UK origin, then a preferential tariff rate of 0% Customs duty applies. However, where the vehicle is not of UK origin, Customs duty at a rate of 10% of the value of the vehicle is applicable to the importation.  The value of the goods on which VAT is levied at the point of importation is the Customs value of the vehicle. The Customs value consists of the purchase price of the vehicle, plus transport and insurance costs, any handling charges and the Customs duty amount payable on the vehicle. Vehicles are liable to VAT at the standard rate. Finally, Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is payable on the open market selling price of the vehicle at registration, with the VRT calculation and collection being undertaken by the NCT centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500067#WRP03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":663,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500067#WRP03800"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[7580\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500067#WRP03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will examine the arrangements in relation to structural improvements and enhancements to rental properties in Budget 2023 such as through retrofitting to allow these costs to be offset and treated as expenses rather than via capital allowances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":665,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[7581\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500067#WRP04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will examine the current arrangements with regard to improvements to rental properties which are currently capitalised over eight years given inflation rates; if he will consider reducing the time period or introducing categories for items to reflect their average useful life to encourage landlords to improve properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":666,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 286 together.<\/p><p>The tax treatment of structural improvements and enhancements to rental properties is set out in sections 75, 97, 97A, 284 and 285A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA).  <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that guidance as to whether those costs incurred should be treated as expenses or capital allowances when computing taxable profits, is provided in the following Tax and Duty Manuals, available in the &ldquo;Tax Practitioners&rdquo; section of the Revenue website:<\/p><p>- Tax and Duty Manual Part 04-08-12 - Capital Allowances and Rented Residential Premises<\/p><p>- Tax and Duty Manual Part 09-02-03 &ndash; Plant in leased buildings &ndash; Treatment of leasing income and capital allowances<\/p><p>- Tax and Duty Manual Part 09-02-04 - Accelerated wear and tear - Allowances for energy efficient equipment<\/p><p>In general, expenditure on structural improvements and enhancements is considered as capital rather than revenue in nature, and the expenditure would only be allowable if it was integral to the business of letting the premises.  <\/p><p>If the expenditure on structural improvements qualifies for capital allowances, it would be claimed over eight years, rather than being allowed as a deduction from rental income in the year the expenditure was incurred.  <\/p><p>Accelerated capital allowances for expenditure on certain energy efficient equipment under section 285A TCA, which can be claimed in full in the year of the expenditure, are not available to be set against rental income, because such allowances are only available to taxpayers carrying on a trade.<\/p><p>If the expenditure was found to be capital in nature, but not deemed to qualify for capital allowances, it may qualify as &ldquo;enhancement expenditure&rdquo; for Capital Gains Tax purposes and may be deducted when calculating the chargeable gain arising on the disposal of the property, should all relevant conditions be met.  <\/p><p><b>Rental Income<\/b><\/p><p>Rental income is chargeable to tax under what is known as Case V of Schedule D.  Landlords are entitled to deduct certain expenses from the gross rental income received and are then taxed on the balance, which is the rental profit.  Generally, expenses which are capital in nature are not allowable as deductions unless they fall into the category of &ldquo;plant&rdquo; for the purposes of section 284 TCA 1997.  However, the expense must have been incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business of letting the property.  <\/p><p><b>Expenses<\/b><\/p><p>Section 97 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA) provides the principal rules for the computation of profits\/gains chargeable under Case V of Schedule D.  Allowable expenses include:<\/p><p>- rents paid for property such as ground rents<\/p><p>- insurance premiums against fire and public liability<\/p><p>- maintenance of the property such as cleaning, painting and decorating<\/p><p>- property fees before the property is first rented out, such as management, advertising, legal or accountancy fees<\/p><p>- the cost of any service or goods provided by the landlord that are not repaid by the tenant (such as electricity, central heating, telephone, service charges, water and refuse collection).<\/p><p>- certain mortgage protection policy premiums<\/p><p>- expenses in between renting out the property in certain circumstances<\/p><p>- capital allowances<\/p><p>- repairs, such as rot treatment, mending windows, doors or machines<\/p><p>- certain pre-letting expenses on vacant residential property<\/p><p>- the cost of registering with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).<\/p><p><b>Pre-letting expenditure<\/b><\/p><p>Section 97A TCA provides that expenses incurred on a vacant residential premises prior to it being first let after a period of non-occupancy are authorised as a deduction against rental income from that premises.  The section applies to expenditure on a premises which has been vacant for at least 12 months and must have been incurred in the 12 months before it is let as a residential premises.  The expenditure must be such as would be allowed against rental income if it had been incurred during the period of letting.  The deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises.  I extended this deduction for a further three years to 31 December 2024 in the Finance Act 2021.<\/p><p><b>Capital Allowances<\/b><\/p><p>Generally, expenditure on a property which is capital in nature is not deductible when computing taxable profits, other than where a landlord has incurred capital expenditure on the provision of &ldquo;machinery&rdquo; or &ldquo;plant&rdquo; as defined in section 284(1) TCA.  Such allowable expenditure is known as capital allowances, or &ldquo;wear and tear&rdquo; allowances.  There is no exhaustive list as to what can be considered &ldquo;plant&rdquo; and the decision as to what constitutes plant remains primarily one of fact.  Case law has also set out certain factors which may be considered when determining whether an expense is plant. <\/p><p>Capital allowances are provided for in section 284 TCA. The allowance is given for a chargeable period where at the end of the chargeable period the machinery or plant belongs to the person and is wholly and exclusively in use for trade purposes.  <\/p><p>The rate at which wear and tear allowances on machinery and plant are claimed has changed over time.  Prior to 2001, the allowances were claimed over seven years (15% of the actual cost per year for six years and 10% in the final year).  Finance Act 2001 changed the period to five years at 20% of the actual cost per year.  Finance Act 2003 changed the period to eight years, at 12.5 per cent of the actual cost per year.  <\/p><p>Capital allowances are available in respect of capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings (furniture, kitchen appliances, etc.) provided by a lessor for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation.  The allowances are available only where the expenditure is incurred wholly and exclusively in respect of a house used solely as a dwelling which is, or is to be, let as a furnished house on bona fide commercial terms in the open market.<\/p><p><b>Retrofitting and deductions<\/b><\/p><p>The Government last week approved the National Retrofitting Scheme, which is a package of supports to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes with lower energy bills.  The scheme will be administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Retrofitting a property would involve expenses that should be considered on a case by case basis as to whether they constitute plant for the purposes of claiming capital allowances.  What constitutes qualifying plant in one case may not be plant in another, as has been determined in case law.  Also, in the event that a grant is received by the person incurring the expenditure, no part of the cost to which the grant relates could be deducted either as an expense or a capital allowance when computing taxable rental profits, as the portion of the cost to which the grant relates would not have been incurred by the claimant.  <\/p><p><b>Accelerated wear and tear allowances for certain energy efficient equipment <\/b><\/p><p>Section 285A TCA provides for accelerated capital allowances for expenditure on certain energy-efficient equipment bought for the purposes of the trade.  An accelerated wear and tear allowance of 100% of the capital expenditure incurred can be claimed in the year in which the equipment is first provided and used. The incentive runs until 31 December 2023. It applies to certain classes of technology that are listed in the Table to Schedule 4A TCA, which include &ldquo;heating and electricity provision&rdquo;, &ldquo;process and heating, ventilation&rdquo; and &ldquo;building energy management systems&rdquo;.However, accelerated capital allowances are not available against rental income taxable under Case V; they can only be claimed by taxpayers carrying on a trade.<\/p><p>Regarding the specific questions raised by the Deputy, there are no particular plans in place to examine the measures along the lines mentioned by him in relation to the rental sector.  Also, consistent with my Departments Tax Expenditure Guidelines, to the extent that a system of direct grant expenditure might be in place to encourage retrofitting it would on the face of it reduce the case for any further incentive measures to be put in place through the tax system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500067#WRP04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":667,"content":"<p>Question No. 286 answered with Question No. 285.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":668,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500067#WRP04300"},{"type":"question","counter":669,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[7588\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500067#WRP04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of active employment wage subsidy scheme claims and the amount paid, by month in Dublin during 2020 and to date in 2022, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":670,"content":"<p>The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible.

This is a well established and broadly accepted principle. <\/p>  <p>  Section 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, sets out that tax under Schedule E shall be charged in respect of every public office or employment of profit.   In addition, Section 112 of the TCA 1997 brings into charge all salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits of any kind arising from an office or employment.  Therefore, the long-standing position is that all tips, gratuities and service charges arising from an office or employment are chargeable to income tax under Schedule E in accordance with Section 112.  <\/p>  <p>  Gratuities from customers for example, service charges in hotels or tips in restaurants, paid to the employer and subsequently paid out to an employee should be included in pay for the income tax week or month in which they are paid out. These tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system.  The employer is not required to provide a separate breakdown to Revenue detailing these amounts. <\/p>  <p>  However, in a situation where an employee receives tips directly from customers, the employer is not obliged to operate PAYE and in that case, the tips and gratuities are fully taxable and should be included by the employee in his or her income tax return.  It is important to point out that such tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system.  Where such income is declared by employees themselves, there is no requirement that it be itemised separately from other forms of income on the relevant tax returns. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, I am advised by Revenue that is not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy as regards the precise amount received by Exchequer in the form of tips, gratuities and service charges, from Revenue data. <\/p>  <p>  As referenced by the Deputy in his question, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is progressing legislation on tips and gratuities and this legislation will prohibit the practise of using tips or gratuities to top up wages.  It will also ensure that electronic tips and gratuities, which are much more common these days, have to be divided fairly and equitably among the staff. In addition, the legislation will provide transparency to customers so they will know what the policy is on tips and service charges, how they are managed and to whom they go.  <\/p>  <p>  For the reasons outlined in the opening paragraphs of my reply, I have no plans to amend the tax treatment of tips and gratuities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":691,"content":"<p>Question No. 294 answered with Question No. 293.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":692,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ01300"},{"type":"question","counter":693,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[7919\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason that a community run and operated community centre (details supplied) which has not had an insurance claim over 15 years has seen its premia rise by &euro;10 in the past year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":694,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products, which is ultimately a commercial matter for each provider. As the Deputy will appreciate, I am also unable to comment on individual cases.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Government recognises that the cost of insurance remains a significant issue for many groups, including community and voluntary organisations. The Government is therefore pursuing a broad range of measures through the Action Plan for Insurance Reform in order to improve both the affordability and availability of this key financial service, including for such groups.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key developments under the insurance reform agenda has been the creation of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, chaired by Minister of State Fleming. The Office aims to both improve costs and increase the availability of cover by encouraging greater competition in the Irish market. Since its establishment, the Office has held over 60 meetings with a wide range of stakeholders on issues surrounding competition. Officials are also working with IDA Ireland to leverage the ongoing reform work in order to attract potential new market entrants here, and are identifying targets to engage with. This will, in the first instance, seek out providers who offer insurance in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; in the Irish market.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Government is committed to ensuring that the benefit of the various reforms being implemented, notably the new Personal Injuries Guidelines, are passed onto customers. In this regard, Minister of State Fleming recently met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in November to discuss a variety of issues, including expanding insurers&rsquo; risk appetite in underserved areas, such as those raised by the Deputy. Furthermore, he has also met with insurance providers who are seeking to expand their cover here.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, this Government is committed to improving both the cost and availability of insurance in Ireland through continued implementation of the current reform agenda. With regard to community centres, upcoming priorities of particular note including making changes to the duty of care, and legislating with a view to increasing the number of claims settled by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. It is my intention to continue working with colleagues across Government to help to deliver these key actions and to ensure that the overall implementation of the Action Plan leads to a more competitive and sustainable insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":695,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ01600"},{"type":"question","counter":696,"qnumday":296,"qnumall":"[7983\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the new European Union VAT rules agreed in December 2021 at European Council level will impact on Ireland's existing derogations from European Union VAT rules.","asker":"1467","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":697,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

In most cases, a lender is legally required under section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to make sure that a mortgage applicant has mortgage protection insurance in place before granting a mortgage loan.  <\/p>  <p>  This is an important statutory provision which is designed to protect the borrower's dependants and their home should the borrower die before the mortgage has been repaid.  However, the Act also recognises that in certain cases such protection is not necessary or would be inappropriate and it provides for a number of limited exemptions to this statutory obligation such as where the borrower belongs to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to a life insurer, or would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally.<\/p>  <p>   In such circumstances, there is no statutory requirement on a mortgage lender to arrange for mortgage protection insurance and it is then a matter of the lender&rsquo;s own internal policy to decide on whether or not it wishes to ensure that such a policy is in place.  This will be a commercial decision as opposed to a statutory requirement for an individual mortgage lender, and it is not possible for me to instruct lenders on their individual lending policies.  <\/p>  <p>  However, if a person is not satisfied with the way a regulated mortgage provider has dealt with them in relation to an application for a mortgage, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, including the requirement for the regulated entity to act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of its customers, the consumer can also complain directly to the regulated entity and, if they are not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to any intervention by the State to provide insurance in these circumstances, I would be cautious about the introduction of a State-backed insurance scheme in this jurisdiction generally, for a number of reasons.  <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, any State insurance scheme would be required to comply with the same prudential rules under the Solvency II Directive as private companies, thereby meaning that the cost would still have to reflect the risk involved.  <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, there is no reason to believe that the State would be any better at managing risks than private firms, and therefore be in a position to provide insurance more affordably.  <\/p>  <p>  Thirdly, such an approach could actually decrease competition, with insurers potentially discontinuing certain lines if there is a view the State will insure these risks instead.  <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, any such proposals for State intervention, while well intended and which may appear as representing an easy solution, are likely to lead to unintended consequences. Accordingly, I am not convinced that a State-backed insurance scheme would be a solution to either the cost or availability of mortgage protection insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":701,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ02200"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[8123\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason that Ireland has not requested pre-financing from the Recovery and Resilience Fund.","asker":"1579","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":703,"content":"<p>Article 13 of the Recovery and Resilience Facility Regulation provided for pre-financing.

The Central Bank advises that there is no corresponding obligation under the Act on Credit Information Subjects (borrowers) to produce a credit report when applying for credit.  <\/p>  <p>  Borrowers may apply for their credit report any time, free of charge, online at www.centralcreditregister.ie. For data protection purposes, borrowers must include complete identification documents (passport, PPSN and address) and a completed application form.  <\/p>  <p>  Each application is scrutinised for compliance before being sent for completion.  Any decision by an individual to produce their credit report to a third party is solely a matter between the individual and that third party. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank advises that recent increases in activity by borrowers are likely to be as a consequence of increased awareness of the CCR and a possible knock-on effect of the cessation of the Irish Credit Bureau in late 2021. The processing of individual credit report applications is an operational CCR matter. However, the Central Bank advises that the time required to provide a credit report to a borrower is approximately three weeks and that efforts are underway to increase resources with a view to reducing this timeline.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":710,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ03100"},{"type":"question","counter":711,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[8330\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to making childcare costs tax deductible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":712,"content":"<p>The Government acknowledges the continuing high cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children.

During the preparation of this amendment as well as during the passage of the Finance Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas, my officials engaged with officials from both Revenue and the Department of Justice in relation to this provision in order to ensure that it was not contrary to Department of Justice policy and legislation in this general area.<\/p><p>I would note that this amendment affects only the disposal of a principal primary residence through a game or lottery and the winner of a such prize is not subject to CGT on their winnings.<\/p><p>The practice of raffles or lotteries being run by different organisations, mostly community-based (including sports clubs and local schools), to generate funds for their activities has been commonplace for many years.  Increasingly, the practice has extended to a situation where a real asset, such as a car or a house, is put forward as the prize for the winner rather than a cash sum. <\/p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Deputy&rsquo;s question requires consideration across a number of tax heads, as set out below.<\/p><p><b>Stamp Duty <\/b><\/p><p>From the description provided, it is not clear whether there will be a transfer of a house from the developer to the sports club and a subsequent transfer to the raffle winner, or a transfer directly from the developer to the raffle winner. However, I can advise that the transfer of a property (including a house) constitutes a conveyance on sale for the purposes of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999. Stamp duty is payable by the transferee, whether or not it was transferred by way of sale, gift or as a result of winning a raffle. Where a property is sold, or otherwise transferred, for less than market value, section 30 SDCA 1999 imposes a charge to stamp duty at the market value of the property.  <\/p><p>Stamp duty on transfers of residential property is chargeable at the rate of 1% where the market value does not exceed &euro;1 million. Where the market value exceeds &euro;1 million, stamp duty is chargeable at 1% on the first &euro;1 million and 2% on the balance in excess of &euro;1 million.  <\/p><p><b>Capital Acquisitions Tax<\/b><\/p><p>In the normal course of events, a charge to capital acquisitions tax (CAT) arises on the gifting of assets between individuals or groups of individuals. The beneficiary of the asset being transferred is liable for this charge. Notwithstanding this, section 76(2) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides that a gift or inheritance taken for public or charitable purposes is exempt from tax and is not taken into account in computing tax, to the extent that Revenue is satisfied that it has been, or will be, applied for purposes which in accordance with the laws of the State are public or charitable. <\/p><p>While the CATCA 2003 does not provide a definition of &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo;, section 3 (1) of the Charities Act 2009 provides that each of the following shall be a charitable purpose: <\/p><p>- the relief of poverty<\/p><p>- the advancement of education<\/p><p>- the advancement of religion<\/p><p>- other purposes beneficial to the community.<\/p><p>Donations to local sports clubs are generally considered to be beneficial to the community and consequently a donation of a dwelling house by a local sports club for the purposes of fund raising would generally be exempt from CAT.  <\/p><p>On the matter of the transfer of the dwelling house to a winner of a raffle, section 82 CATCA 2003 provides for an exemption from CAT for certain types of receipts. Among these is the receipt of winnings from betting (including pool betting) or any lottery, sweepstake or game with prizes. Such winnings are exempt from CAT provided those winnings are received bona fide, i.e. the winnings are received from betting or games the outcome or which is not certain or cannot be controlled by either the organiser or the winner. Accordingly, provided the raffle is run by the local sports club in a bona fide manner, the receipt of the dwelling house by the winner will be exempt from CAT. <\/p><p><b>Capital Gains Tax<\/b><\/p><p>It is not clear from the description provided as to whether the property transferred is an investment property; however, it is assumed, based on the transferor being described as a developer, that the property is stock in the developer&rsquo;s trade, and not an investment asset. On this basis, no capital gains tax (CGT) consequences arise on the transfer of the property by the developer.<\/p><p>Should the property be transferred by the sports club to the prize winner, any gain arising on the transfer will be exempt from CGT, as charitable and sporting organisations may be exempt from CGT in respect of chargeable gains which arise on the disposal of their assets, should the gain arising on the disposal be applied to charitable purposes or for the purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports, in accordance with section 609 and\/or section 610A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997. <\/p><p>Winnings from betting, lotteries, sweepstakes or games with prizes are exempt from CGT, as are rights to winnings from those sources (for example, the sale of a bet), by virtue of section 613(2) TCA 1997. As such, no CGT liability arises for the prize winner on wining the property. If the prize winner subsequently disposes of the property, the base cost of the asset is its market value at the date it is acquired, and CGT will be calculated on any rise in value since it was acquired.<\/p><p><b>Income Tax\/Corporation Tax<\/b><\/p><p>On the assumption that the property transferred by the developer is part of their stock in trade, the transfer will be reflected as a sale at cost in their accounts for the relevant accounting period; whether or not this cost may be deducted in arriving at taxable profits depends on whether the expense meets the requirement of having been incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the developer&rsquo;s trade. <\/p><p>Section 235 TCA 1997 provides an exemption from income tax or corporation tax, as appropriate, for bodies which are established and existing for the sole purpose of promoting:<\/p><p>- an athletic game or an athletic sport, or<\/p><p>- an amateur game or an amateur sport.<\/p><p>The exemption applies to that portion of the income of the &ldquo;approved body&rdquo; which has been or will be applied for the purpose of promoting an athletic or amateur game or sport. This means that if the proceeds of the raffle are applied for such purpose then the exemption should apply. However, each case would need to be considered based on its own facts.  <\/p><p><b>VAT<\/b><\/p><p>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of the EU VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply. Revenue&rsquo;s understanding of the transaction, from the details provided, is that a developer initially developed a property for sale which was then granted or given to a sports club as a prize for fundraising activities and where the developer did not receive consideration for the house.  In these circumstances and in accordance with VAT legislation the developer has diverted the property to a non-business use which is known as a 'self-supply'. As this is the first supply of the property by the developer, it is, therefore, a taxable supply and, in simple, terms, the value of the self-supply is the cost incurred by the developer in relation to the property. The net effect of the rule is that where a property is diverted to a non-business use there is a claw-back of the VAT that had been deducted on the acquisition or development of the property. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":720,"content":"<p>Question No. 304 answered with Question No. 303.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":721,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ04200"},{"type":"question","counter":722,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[8410\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500068#WRQ04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider abolishing the current disregard amount in place in respect of tax relief on college fees for PAYE parents who are not eligible for assistance through the SUSI grant scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1589","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":723,"content":"<p>Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for income tax relief in respect of qualifying tuition fees paid by an individual for a third level education course (including a postgraduate course), subject to the conditions set out in that section.

Engagement on the pilot scheme has been ongoing between my Department and the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Basic Income for the Arts scheme is not a social welfare payment, it is a grant payment and is a pilot scheme to research the impact of a basic income for the arts.     <\/p>  <p>  I believe that the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector post pandemic and it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500070#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry","counter":803,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500070#WRS00800"},{"type":"question","counter":804,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[8117\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500070#WRS00900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of persons currently employed in the film and television industry in the State.","asker":"1497","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":805,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[8155\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500070#WRS01000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of persons that are actively working in the film and television industry currently.","asker":"1498","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":806,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 and 333 together.<\/p><p>An Economic Analysis of the Audiovisual Sector in the Republic of Ireland by Olsberg SPI with Nordicity Report in 2017 showed that there were a total of 11,960 employed in the category of Film, TV and animation.<\/p><p>Screen Ireland is the national development agency for the Irish film, television and animation industry, investing in talent, creativity and enterprise with a mission to support and promote Irish film, television and animation through fostering Irish artistic vision and our diverse creative and production talent, growing audiences, and attracting film-makers and investment into the country.<\/p><p>Screen Ireland compiles statistics on the numbers of cast, crew, trainees and extras employed on Screen Ireland funded projects.

Production continued throughout 2021 despite the very great challenges of COVID-19.  Levels of employment across the industry have been particularly high. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has a range of measures to encourage activity in the audiovisual industry including the Section 481 tax relief and direct grant to projects from Screen Ireland and the Sound and Vision fund. <\/p>  <p>  The Government's Audiovisual Action Plan aims to provide the necessary environment for Ireland to become a global hub for the production of Film, TV drama and animation. The Plan recognises Section 481 as a vital part of the financial infrastructure of the audio-visual industry in Ireland and underlines the need to ensure that it remains fit for purpose and achieves its objectives.  My Department is in ongoing collaboration with the Department of Finance to ensure that the tax relief is kept up to date and in line with international incentives. <\/p>  <p>  Screen Ireland's mission is to support and promote Irish film, television and animation through fostering Irish artistic vision and our diverse creative and production talent, growing audiences, and attracting filmmakers and investment into the country.  The funding allocation for screen Ireland will increase in 2022 by &euro;6.65m compared to 2021. The total allocation for 2022 will be &euro;36.743 million - an increase of 22.1%. Screen Ireland&rsquo;s 3-year strategic Plan &lsquo;Building for a Creative Future 2024&rsquo; sets out how it plans to support this important sector including championing development that is national and sustainable, supporting Irish companies and an expanded workforce. Screen Ireland also wants to ensure large-scale mobile productions are enabled to complete their full project in Ireland, including valuable animation, post-production and Visual Effects (VFX) work. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) continues to develop and implement the broadcasting funding schemes that support an increase in the production and availability of diverse, innovative and culturally relevant Irish audio-visual content.  In 2020, &euro;15,769m was allocated by BAI to Sound and Vision projects.  In 2021, the equivalent figure was approximately &euro;16m. <\/p>  <p>  In December 2020, the trade union SIPTU and Screen Producers Ireland (SPI) announced a new Shooting Crew agreement.

The guidance is a useful reference for service providers, highlighting where they can be of greatest assistance to their clients.  It covers a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports. These include provisions around the use of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme, or the Rental Accommodation Scheme, where a victim has a joint interest in the family home, or ownership of alternative accommodation, but would otherwise qualify for social housing support.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, where a victim of domestic violence applies for social housing support in their own right while still a joint tenant, it is a matter for the relevant local authority to address the contractual issues arising in relation to the joint tenancy agreement. Accordingly, the household may transfer out of their existing tenancy and into a new tenancy agreement with the local authority or they may access an independent tenancy in the private rented sector utilising the various housing supports offered by the State.<\/p>  <p>  The guidance was introduced with the objective of supporting a partnership approach by statutory agencies in respect of the delivery of domestic violence services. This is particularly the case in relation to helping to prevent and reduce the occurrence of related homelessness and facilitating the provision of long-term accommodation for victims of domestic violence. This guidance continues to apply in providing direction to housing authorities in supporting the housing needs of victims of domestic violence.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above supports, a new protocol was established in 2020 when the Minister for Social Protection agreed to make rent supplement more accessible to victims of domestic violence.

I am also keen that local authorities and AHBs avoid competing with potential private purchasers for available properties.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the focus of support on the build programme and the need to avoid competition, I have asked local authorities to limit their acquisitions of privately owned properties, with approximately 200 acquisitions to be undertaken over this year under the Social Housing Investment Programme and the Capital Advance Leasing Facility funding programmes. In January 2022, my Department issued a Circular to local authorities on this matter, entitled Housing Circular 02\/2022 - Arrangements for Social Housing Acquisitions in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  It will be a matter for the local authorities themselves to decide their specific priority acquisitions, including in circumstances where a notice to quit has issued to sitting tenants. I have asked that they focus on the following priority areas: <\/p>  <p>  - One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;<\/p>  <p>  - Other properties that allow persons\/families to move from homelessness;<\/p>  <p>  - Specific housing required for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs.<\/p>  <p>  Any acquisition proposed must represent value for money per my Department&rsquo;s acquisitions guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  Limited acquisitions by AHBs through the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) will also continue where they are focussed on specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with disability.  However, the priority remains to focus to the greatest extent possible on increasing construction delivery under CAS.  Local authorities should therefore engage with AHBs operating in their areas with a view to increasing their focus on construction projects or acquisitions that utilise vacant properties.<\/p>  <p>  Social housing allocation policies are a matter for the local authorities. It is open to Dublin City Council to secure limited acquisitions, on a case by case basis, in line with their own Allocations Policy and the priority criteria set out in Housing Circular 02\/2022 Arrangements for Social Housing Acquisitions in 2022.  As Dublin City Council represents a significant proportion of the national housing need it would be expected that it will have a significant number of priority acquisitions approved in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding situations where landlords are selling a property rented to a person or a family in receipt of social housing supports, including the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and has issued the tenant with a valid notice to vacate, the local authority will offer advice and assistance. <\/p>  <p>  Providing early intervention to people at risk of homelessness is a priority for Government. Local authorities oversee a range of homeless prevention and tenancy sustainment measures.  Many of these services are operated in partnership between local authorities and NGO service delivery partners and are funded by my Department. The HAP Placefinder Service supports households experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, to identify and secure a HAP supported tenancy in the private rented market.  Under the Placefinder service, all local authorities are provided with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for eligible households.  My Department is funding three dedicated HAP Placefinder Officers to support eligible households in the Dublin City Council area. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also funds Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Protection Service.  This service provides advice and support to individuals, couples and families living in private rented accommodation experiencing tenancy problems. This service has been instrumental in preventing homelessness in the first instance and supporting people to remain in their homes.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, in circumstances in which it is not possible for the tenants to secure a different home and are in danger of entering homelessness it is open to a local authority to propose acquiring the property in order to prevent such an outcome.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific case to which you refer, I understand that Dublin City Council has advised my Department that an AHB is entering into negotiations with the landlord with the view to purchasing this property allowing the family to stay in their home.  The Council has also confirmed that they will consider recommending this acquisition to my Department, once it meets the criteria as set out by Housing Circular 02\/2022 Arrangements for Social Housing Acquisitions in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500071#WRT03375","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":892,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500071#WRT03400"},{"type":"question","counter":893,"qnumday":363,"qnumall":"[8013\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500071#WRT03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the total spending by his Department allocated to local authorities or any other body for retrofitting social housing stock since 2010 to date;  the total  funding to approved housing bodies for the same purpose, that is retrofitting or any scheme that increases energy efficiency and so on; and if the funding is allocated under just one scheme or funding stream.","asker":"1486","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":894,"qnumday":364,"qnumall":"[8014\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500071#WRT03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the State&rsquo;s social housing stock according to the BER rating allocated by each county and local authority area in tabular form.","asker":"1486","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":895,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 363 and 364 together.<\/p><p>My Department launched the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme in 2013 with the aim of funding retrofit of local authority owned homes requiring insulation and energy upgrade works.

If more than one party is interested in buying the property, the lender will provide information to the borrower around the options available to them and the borrower will make the decision on who purchases the property. <\/p>  <p>  A review of the MTR scheme took place in 2017 and explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme. Along with introducing a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the MTR scheme, the review concluded that the financial model of the scheme at the time may not have been capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme. The review, taking account of capacity within the AHB sector given that sector's role in delivering ambitious targets around new social housing supply, recommended that alternative funding options, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment, be explored in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale. An Expressions of Interest (EOI) Request was initiated by the Housing Agency in October 2017 inviting parties from the private sector to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model. The outcome from the EOI process is that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model was announced in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector. <\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of an MTR provider from the private sector has had a positive impact on the number of completed cases since its entry into the scheme and up to the end December 2021, has facilitated 672 families (40% of all MTR cases) to stay in their homes.

This is the highest volume of monthly applications ever received and is as a direct result of the pent-up demand for passports following the relaxation of necessary travel restrictions due to the Covid pandemic. The Passport Service estimates that up to 1.7 million passport applications will be received this year.<\/p><p>My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.<\/p><p>My Department is working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive that has been underway for several months. Since June of 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service. Additional staff are being assigned on a weekly basis with a goal of reaching staff numbers of 900 by the end of March. This represents a doubling of staff numbers over the course of 9 months.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the  turnaround times for passports and improve customer service:<\/p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications.<\/p><p>- The Passport Service is actively prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time.<\/p><p>- A new document management process is being put in place that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in 3 weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application. <\/p><p>In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service. Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system. Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.<\/p><p>Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA.

I have asked my officials to review the detail of the report.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position on these matters is &ndash; and will continue to be &ndash; based on international law including international human rights law, Israel&rsquo;s obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention as the occupying power in the occupied Palestinian territory, and on the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been consistently forthright in expressing concern regarding the unequal treatment of Palestinians and the application of different standards in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.

Compensation of the kind in question would usually result from a civil action for damages against the Department of Defence, but compensation received from any other source is not excluded.  <\/p>  <p>  The provisions do not apply to Disability Pension cases related solely to disablement due to disease attributable to or aggravated by overseas service with the United Nations. They apply only to wound pension cases involving wound or injury or where disease is secondary to wound or injury.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 1,011 Disability Pensions of all categories in payment, of which 275 in relation to injury\/wound pensions have had a reduction under S.13 (2) applied. <\/p>  <p>  There have been a number of key cases both at Supreme and High Court levels involving Section 13(2) and the procedures in place in relation to individual cases take account of these judgements. The Courts, in various judgements, have upheld the Minister&rsquo;s statutory right to take into consideration that part of the damages which can properly be regarded as general damages or that part which can properly be regarded as referable to loss of earnings, as he considers proper. <\/p>  <p>  The reduction of these Disability Pensions is not arbitrary; it is provided for under legislation and is done on foot of a bona fide decision by the Minister after careful consideration of the specific circumstances of the individual case. The person or his\/her solicitor is advised of the statutory provisions and of the potential implications for his\/her application. Representations are invited regarding, in particular, the person's circumstances, details of the compensation actually received, and whether there are any special or extenuating circumstances involved. <\/p>  <p>  On receipt of representations, each case is submitted to the Minister for decision, together with the relevant facts of the case, including details of the representations made and an actuarial assessment (in pension only cases) of the compensation received.

When received, this report will also be considered in the context of planning future provision.<\/p>  <p>   The Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools, which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, including pupils with Specific Learning Disability (SLD); of which Dyslexia is one such SLD, in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, s\/he will have access to an appropriate education. <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for the provision of special educational needs supports to schools. <\/p>  <p>  The Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which supports have been provided to support their child's education they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's present or future educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<\/p>  <p>  All Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to cater for children with special educational needs, including pupils with dyslexia.  Rather than having to make individual application to the NCSE for additional supports schools can now respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching. This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner. <\/p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers have been published on Gov.ie at www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/56c43-supporting-pupils-and-students-with-special-educational-needs-guidelines-for-schools\/ Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services.  <\/p>  <p>  Educational Psychologists from the Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) work with schools using a problem solving model to help schools identify need and interventions to support those needs. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system is in line with international best practice and allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological assessment and have equality of access to support prioritised on their individual needs. <\/p>  <p>  NEPS understands dyslexia in the context the severity and persistence of an individual&rsquo;s needs over time and their response to intervention.  This approach aligns with the new Special Educational model in schools which focuses on the identification of need and the matching of specific interventions to that need.  Specific interventions are therefore tailored, by the school, to the individual&rsquo;s observed needs by the school, rather than being generic to a specific difficulty or disability. <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with the Department's guidance. The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is available to schools under the assistive technology scheme for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and\/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia. In order to qualify for equipment under the scheme, a child must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the child to access the curriculum.

The NCSE operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support<\/p>  <p>  All Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to cater for children with special educational needs, including pupils with dyslexia.  In September 2017 the Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs in our schools. The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, in that Special Education Teacher allocation is now frontloaded into schools to support children with special educational needs.  Rather than having to make individual application to the NCSE for additional supports schools can now respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching. This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner. <\/p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers have been published on Gov.ie at www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/56c43-supporting-pupils-and-students-with-special-educational-needs-guidelines-for-schools\/ Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services.  <\/p>  <p>  Educational Psychologists from the Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) work with schools using a problem solving model to help schools identify need and interventions to support those needs.  Under the new model, NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system is in line with international best practice and allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological assessment and have equality of access to support prioritised on their individual needs. <\/p>  <p>  NEPS understands dyslexia in the context the severity and persistence of an individual&rsquo;s needs over time and their response to intervention. This approach aligns with the new Special Educational model in schools which focuses on the identification of need and the matching of specific interventions to that need. Specific interventions are therefore tailored, by the school, to the individual&rsquo;s observed needs by the school, rather than being generic to a specific difficulty or disability. <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with the Department's guidance. The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.<\/p>  <p>  The Department also provides for special schools and special class placements where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.  Special classes attached to mainstream primary schools also support the needs of pupils with dyslexia.  Such classes have a reduced pupil\/teacher ratio of 9:1 and an increased level of capitation grant.  The pupils who attend these classes have, following psychological assessment, been identified as having a specific learning disability.  The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to those schools; the enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  <\/p>  <p>  Funding is available to schools under the assistive technology scheme for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and\/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia. In order to qualify for equipment under the scheme, a child must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the child to access the curriculum.  It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs.  Equipment may only be provided where medical and\/or other professional reports outline that the degree of communicative disability is such that this equipment is essential to allow the pupil to access education and set out how the equipment will provide for this.  An assessment indicating that equipment would achieve improvement in performance is not sufficient since this could be true in the case of any child.<\/p>  <p>  In order for a grant for assistive technology to be made available for a pupil diagnosed with dyslexia, the pupil must have a degree of learning disability specific to basic skills in reading, writing or mathematics which places them at or below the 2nd percentile on suitable, standardised, norm-referenced tests.  <\/p>  <p>  Schools apply to the NCSE, through their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) for such support.  SENOs make recommendations to the Department where assistive technology is required, in accordance with the criteria set out in the Department's Circular 0010\/2013.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available at ncse.ie\/regional-services-contact-list<\/p>  <p>  Resources provided to schools also include additional training for teachers who support children with Dyslexia, through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  <\/p>  <p>  The Special Education Support Service (SESS) is part of the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service, along with the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for children who are deaf\/hard of hearing and for children who are blind\/visually impaired (VTSVHI). <\/p>  <p>  The Support Service provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for teachers and continuing professional development for teachers with additional training needs in the area of Dyslexia. The Support Service continues to update current Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses for teachers and design new CPD courses in response to the needs of teachers. <\/p>  <p>  The Department, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland, developed an information resource pack on dyslexia in CD-Rom, DVD and video format. This product was made<\/p>  <p>  available to all primary and post-primary schools. The DVD and video provides support for parents of pupils with dyslexia while the CD-Rom assists teachers who are teaching children with dyslexia in the mainstream classroom. <\/p>  <p>  Further resources provided for pupils with dyslexia include reasonable accommodations in State Examinations such as the provision of a reader, use of a tape recorder or scribe, or a spelling and grammar waiver; further details are available on the State Examinations Commission website at www.examinations.ie\/schools\/circulars\/reasonable-accommodations\/.  <\/p>  <p>  Within the Further Education and Training Sector, a broad range of supports are provided through the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) to support the participation of learners with a disability, including learners with dyslexia.  As well as general adult literacy support, specific supports provided for persons with dyslexia can include:<\/p>  <p>  - Access to tutors with specific expertise in the area of dyslexia<\/p>  <p>  - Additional 1:1 tutor support, where necessary <\/p>  <p>  - Adaptive technologies such as screen reading software<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a reader or interpreter service<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a reader or scribe or extra time during examinations  <\/p>  <p>  - Provision of preferred learning-style identification and 'learning to learn' programmes that have particular emphasis on memory and organisational skills.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition, learners participating in PLC programmes can apply to the HEA &ldquo;Fund for Students with Disabilities&rdquo;. It allocates funding to Further and Higher Education Colleges for the provision of services and supports to full-time students with disabilities. The Fund aims to ensure that students can participate fully in their academic programmes and are not disadvantaged by reason of a disability.  PLC providers have the opportunity to apply to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on an annual basis for funding to provide services to learners with disabilities. It was reported that this funding allowed for provision of one-to-one tutorial support for learners with dyslexia attending PLC programmes.<\/p>  <p>  The Department also provides funding to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland at national level which helps the organisation operate an information service for members and the public as well as assisting in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association. Funding is also provided to enable the Dyslexia Association to provide services and supports to people with dyslexia to access further education and training.   <\/p>  <p>  Dyslexia Association of Ireland activities in the Further Education and Training Sector include:<\/p>  <p>  - Development and delivery of expanded CPD training on assessing needs in the FET Sector<\/p>  <p>  - Piloting &lsquo;brief-assessment&rsquo; model for improved access to dyslexia identification services<\/p>  <p>  - Providing daily specialist literacy and numeracy tuition to learners on Career Paths courses<\/p>  <p>  - Facilitating learner progression to education and the workplace through specialist support and training <\/p>  <p>  - Providing a specialist information service on adult dyslexia, including helpline, drop in service and information seminars<\/p>  <p>  - Working with the FET Sector, employers and policy makers to drive policy and new initiatives for learners with dyslexia.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, resources available for adult literacy and numeracy providers include policy Guidelines for Specific Learning Difficulties &lsquo;Keys for Learning&rsquo; www.nala.ie<\/p>  <p>  The Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), provides financial support through the Fund for Students with a Disability (FSD) to higher education institutions to ensure that they are adequately resourced to cater for the needs of students with disabilities. This Fund provides grants towards the individual needs assessment, provision of services, purchase of equipment and provision of academic supports for students with disabilities.  The scheme applies to students who have serious sensory, physical and\/or communicative disabilities, including dyslexia.<\/p>  <p>  The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) offers places at reduced points to school leavers with disabilities. Admissions under the DARE scheme is regulated by the institutions themselves. Each higher institution determines its own admission policy in relation to DARE, the number of places they reserve for DARE and the allocation of those places. <\/p>  <p>  The Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which supports have been provided to support their child's education they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's present or future educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this information is of assistance to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500074#WRW04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":1065,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500074#WRW04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1066,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[7583\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500074#WRW04900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide an update on a school building project (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1067,"content":"<p>The permanent building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under my Department's Design and Build programme which uses a professional external Project Manager to progress the project through the relevant stages of architectural planning, tender and construction.<\/p><p>An application for Planning Permission was submitted to the relevant Local Authority in June 2021.<\/p><p>A Request for Further Information (RFI) was received on 28th July 2021 and my Department&rsquo;s Project Manager has been actively working through the items raised.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. <\/p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. <\/p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.<\/p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and\/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.<\/p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement. My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools. The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500076#WRY01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1149,"content":"<p>Question No. 449 answered with Question No. 448.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1150,"content":"<p>Question No. 450 answered with Question No. 448.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1151,"content":"<p>Question No. 451 answered with Question No. 448.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1153,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[8151\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500076#WRY02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the agreed review of the special needs assistant contract as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement will take place.","asker":"1498","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1154,"content":"<p>A review of the existing SNA contract is one of the commitments agreed under the Building Momentum National Agreement.

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.<\/p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. <\/p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.<\/p>  <p>  Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement.

Where the number of applications for travel on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of spare seats available Bus &Eacute;ireann allocates tickets for the spare seats using an agreed selection process.  <\/p>  <p>Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that, generally, pupils residing in the area referred to by the Deputy are not eligible for transport to the school referred to by the Deputy as they reside closer to other post primary schools. Bus &Eacute;ireann has also advised that there is currently no mainstream school transport services available from the area referred to by the Deputy to the school in Naas, County Kildare referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  In cases where the Department is satisfied that the nearest school is full, eligibility for school transport will be determined based on the distance the pupil resides from their next nearest school having regard to ethos and language.  If a family requires further information in regard to the closest school being full they should contact School Transport Section of my Department at school_transport@education.gov.ie <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500076#WRY05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Site Acquisitions","counter":1182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500076#WRY05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1183,"qnumday":464,"qnumall":"[8276\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500076#WRY05300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will receive a deputation (details supplied) regarding the acquisition of a site for a new school from a group; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1454","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1184,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department continue to liaise with officials in Cork City Council in relation to the identification and acquisition of suitable sites for the school in question.<\/p>  <p>  A potential suitable site has been identified in conjunction with the Local Authority and discussions are ongoing with the relevant stakeholders in relation to exploring all options available to my Department to obtain possession of this site. <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that the process is taking a considerable length of time but I can assure you that the acquisition of a suitable site for the school is very active on the programme of site acquisitions and every effort is being made to secure a suitable site for the school as expeditiously as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Work on securing a permanent site for this school continues to be a priority for my Department.

To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has recently announced additional expenditure measures to a total of &euro;505 million which will make a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.<\/p>  <p>  As part of these measures, I was delighted to announce an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 that will be paid to all households in receipt of the fuel allowance payment. It is expected that this additional lump sum will be paid in early March, at an estimated cost of &euro;49 million.<\/p>  <p>  Other significant measures announced by the Government include the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment which is a key measure being developed by the Government to help mitigate the effects of the recent rise in electricity prices.  The scheme, under the auspices of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and supervised by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, will be paid in addition to the gas and electricity element of the Household Benefits Package to qualifying households.  Approximately 2.1m households will benefit by &euro;200 each from the new scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The combined worth of the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment and the additional fuel lump sum payment is &euro;325 or the equivalent of over 9 weeks' additional Fuel Allowance at current rates.  I have also announced that the Working Family Payment Budget increase announced on Budget Day will be brought forward from the first of June to the first of April.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department also provides Exceptional Needs Payments which may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500077#WRZ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments","counter":1228,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500077#WRZ04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1229,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[7451\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500077#WRZ04500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of families who receive child benefit payments; and the number of children these are in respect of.","asker":"1460","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1230,"content":"<p>At the end of January 2022, 623,640 families were in receipt of Child Benefit in respect of  1,202,173 children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500077#WRZ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1232,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[7452\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500077#WRZ04800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full-year cost of making a one-off annual double payment of child benefit to all recipients in March 2022.","asker":"1460","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1233,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[7453\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500077#WRZ04900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full-year cost of making a one-off annual double payment of child benefit to all recipients in September 2022.","asker":"1460","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1234,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 483 and 484 together.<\/p><p>The estimated cost of paying a once-off double payment of child benefit in March or September 2022 is &euro;172 million. <\/p><p>This costing is based on the estimated average number of recipients in 2022 and is subject to change in light of emerging trends and subsequent revision of the estimated number of beneficiaries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500077#WRZ05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1236,"content":"<p>Question No. 484 answered with Question No. 483.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":1237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500078#WRAA00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1238,"qnumday":485,"qnumall":"[7469\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500078#WRAA00400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention been drawn to an anomaly with the living alone allowance that means some single persons are not entitled to this allowance and that this is discrimination based on their civil status given that  they are not in receipt of a social welfare allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1449","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1239,"content":"<p>Primary weekly social welfare payments are intended to enable recipients to meet their basic day-to-day income needs.

It is estimated that around 400,000 households will benefit from the Fuel Allowance payment in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices.  To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has announced additional expenditure of &euro;505 million to assist householders.  As part of these measures, I have announced an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 payable to fuel allowance recipients.  It is expected that this additional lump sum will be paid in early March at an estimated cost of &euro;49 million.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, 78,378 state pension (contributory) customers received Fuel Allowance and 56,640 state pension (non-contributory) customers received the payment.

Officials are continuing to process applications for the Fuel Allowance and therefore the data on the number who have qualified under the expanded criteria is not available.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, discretionary payments can be made to help people with the cost of heating their homes.

In particular, &euro;69 million for the new Core Funding stream (equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full year) is being made available from September.  Developments to the NCS will also come into effect this year including an extension of the universal subsidy to children of all ages up to 15 and a change to the practice of deducting time spent in ECCE or school from the number of hours of NCS subsidy for which families are eligible. <\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will support providers in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase and is contingent on an Employment Regulation Order being agreed by the Joint Labour Committee.  Core Funding amounts to an estimated increase of 16% in the total annual income to the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Initial information about the scheme was made available to providers as part of the Budget FAQ: gov.ie\/en\/publication\/b3e97-budget-2022-overview-and-faqs-for-early-learning-and-care-elc-and-school-age-childcare-sac-providers-and-parents\/. <\/p>  <p>  Further information was issued on 4th of February.

Developments to the NCS will also come into effect this year including an extension of the universal subsidy to children of all ages up to 15 and a change to the practice of deducting time spent in ECCE or school from the number of hours of NCS subsidy for which families are eligible. <\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will be allocated to services based on their capacity and the qualifications of those working in a service.  Core Funding will support providers in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase and is contingent on an Employment Regulation Order being agreed by the Joint Labour Committee.  Core Funding is estimated to amount to an increase of 16% in the total annual income to the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Communications about Core Funding have issued to ELC providers in recent weeks and further information will be made available in the coming weeks.  A Ready Reckoner to support services to determine the potential value of Core Funding will be available in early March.  <\/p>  <p>  In the interim period in advance of Core Funding, significant additional investment is being made in the sector through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which will remain available to the sector until April 2022, with a continued exemption to the turnover rule for employers in the sector. Following the cessation of EWSS, a once-off Transition Fund will operate from May to August 2022, to support providers in the period leading up to the new Core Funding stream, in return for a commitment not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. The sum paid to each service under the Transition Fund will depend on the service&rsquo;s capacity and location, and will reflect opening hours. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500080#WRCC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies","counter":1358,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500080#WRCC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1359,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[7889\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500080#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the role Tusla had in providing supports for children and their families that were accessing CAMHS in south Kerry; if these supports are still in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1360,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that statutory and operational responsibility for the delivery of child protection and welfare services is a matter for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

The Deputy may wish to ask the Minister for Justice for a more comprehensive response on how the State is meeting its commitments under the Convention.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is working collaboratively with Government Departments and other agencies to ensure the successful implementation of objectives of the Convention. Tusla has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013. <\/p>  <p>  My Department provided Tusla with an increase in core funding of DSGBV services in 2021 to &euro;28 million and an additional &euro;2 million of contingency funding to help services cope with the ongoing effects of Covid-19. This allows Tusla to fund 60 specialist services around the country, including 44 services providing support to victims of domestic violence, 21 of whom provide safe accommodation in refuges. I have allocated further resources to Tusla under Budget 2022 to maintain supports for DSGBV services and address the recommendations arising from Tusla&rsquo;s Accommodation Review of refuge provision. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that resources will continue to be used to meet obligations under the Istanbul Convention, including:<\/p>  <p>  - resourcing of the 24 hour national helplines for dv including 24\/7 access to translation services;<\/p>  <p>  - addressing disparities in geographical coverage of services;<\/p>  <p>  - delivering additional services to targeted groups at risk;<\/p>  <p>  - provision of therapeutic programmes and access to dedicated supports for all children in refuges;<\/p>  <p>  - establishing additional regional hubs for men experiencing domestic violence.<\/p>  <p>  On the provision of refuge spaces, the Istanbul Convention sets out signatory obligations but does not set out a single standard or recommended number of refuge spaces.

Investment under the NDP will consist of three pillars: Modernisation, New Capacity and First 5 Initiatives. This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:<\/p><p>(1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency. This investment will prioritise follow-up funding for buildings that were funded through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), with funding also available for previously non-funded infrastructure.<\/p><p>(2) New Capacity: Ireland is approaching the limits of capacity, with shortfalls for early learning and childcare places already evident in some areas and for some cohorts. The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.<\/p><p>In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.<\/p><p>(3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision. Each of these initiatives have capital requirements.<\/p><p>As outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, access to affordable early learning and childcare is inherently linked to creating an equitable society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. Early learning and childcare provision is therefore considered under the National Development Plan, along with housing, schools and health facilities as an integral part of national infrastructure.<\/p><p>First 5 commits to increasing investment in early learning and childcare by up to &euro;1 billion by 2028, and includes a range of actions to address availability and affordability, including the development of a new funding model.<\/p><p>On 7th December, Government approved the recommendations of an Expert Group on a new funding model for ELC and SAC contained in the report Partnership for the Public Good. The new funding model is intended, over time, to deliver transformational change including quality improvements to services, better pay and conditions for staff, tackling disadvantage, improved affordability for parents, better management of supply to meet demand, and support for provider sustainability.<\/p><p>The Expert Group report informed the transformative package of measures for the sector committed in Budget 2022. This will see Government investment in the sector reaching &euro;716 million next year, an increase of &euro;78 million from &euro;638 million in 2021.

No. 564 of 2020), which came into effect on 30 November 2020, set out a range of minimum standards to be observed in the provision of property services by licensees to their clients. Failure to comply with the standards set out in the Regulations amounts to improper conduct.<\/p><p>There is no particular provision in the Land and Conveyancing legislation, in the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, or in related regulations, that deals with the situation as described by the Deputy. <\/p><p>A &ldquo;Contract of Sale&rdquo; for those buying and selling a property specifies exactly what is being sold and the terms and conditions of a sale. A contract, once signed by both parties, binds the parties to the completion of the transaction. Disputes regarding contracts are a matter for the law and the courts.<\/p><p>It is important to note that in a private treaty sale the licensee is contracted by the vendor and has no contractual relationship with potential buyers or bidders. The licensee is selling the property for the vendor, is acting in the vendor&rsquo;s best interests, and takes instructions from the vendor. Ultimately, it is the vendor's decision on the price they wish to sell the property for and to whom.<\/p><p>The Deputy's question highlights similar issues to when &ldquo;Gazumping&rdquo; occurs, i.e. where there has been an oral pre-contract agreement between a buyer and a seller, including the payment of an initial &ldquo;booking deposit&rdquo;, for the sale of property at a particular price, and, subsequently, the seller<b><\/b>refuses to execute the contract due to seeking a higher price from the, or another, prospective buyer. The non-enforceable relationship between the original parties is preserved by use of the term &quot;subject to contract&quot;. <\/p><p>The problems associated with gazumping were examined in detail by the Law Reform Commission in its 1999 &quot;Report on Gazumping&quot; (LRC 59-1999). The Commission noted that delays arising between the conclusion of negotiations and completion of the formal contract were usually for the benefit of the intending purchaser, for example, to ensure the availability of funding for that property, or to ascertain if there were any legal difficulties in relation to the title. The Commission concluded that the only practicable reforms were to improve the information available to intending purchasers and to regulate the terms according to which booking deposits are paid and accepted. It did not recommend any specific legislative reforms to the legal framework within which gazumping occurs. <\/p><p>There are no plans at present to introduce or amend legislation in this area. However, as with other policy and legislative reforms, interested parties are welcome to make submissions on this matter.<\/p><p>The Property Services Regulatory Authority published a detailed &ldquo;Guide for Users of Property Services Providers in Ireland&quot; which explains the legal position in relation to gazumping and related matters such as payment of deposits and signing of contracts.

It allows those engaged in prostitution to provide information to Garda&iacute;; for instance if they were subjected to violence by clients, without fear of prosecution for selling sexual services. <\/p>  <p>  Section 27 of the 2017 Act provides for a review of Part 4 of the Act three years after its commencement.

However, I would like to state that my Department provides funding to a number of other organisations that support victims of crime more generally and who, as part of their work, may also play a role in helping domestic and sexual violence victims recover from the trauma that they have been subjected to.<\/p><p>This is, of course, separate to the primary funding that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, under the aegis of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, provide for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV) and of course Tusla are, at this time, the primary funders of organisations that deliver frontline services.<\/p><p>As the allocation of the 2022 budget of &euro;5.35m for combatting domestic sexual and gender based violence has not yet been finalised, I am not in a position to provide a breakdown of this time. <\/p><p>I can however provide the breakdown of the 2021 budget under our combatting domestic sexual and gender based violence budget heading:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Budget Heading<\/th>       <th>Amount<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Domestic Violence Perpetrator Programmes<\/td>       <td>&euro;955,839 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Grants to NGOs for educational, legal and research programmes<\/td>       <td>&euro;273,705 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Awareness Campaign's run by the Department to tackle Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,448,460 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>As noted above, funding is also provided by my Department to assist organisations that support victims of crime and some of these organisations have, as their primary remit, supporting victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence.

I hope that it will then complete its passage through the Oireachtas as soon as possible, hopefully later this year. <\/p>  <p>  I should point out that while this will not be an excessively long Bill, I am aware that the issues it addresses, such as privacy rights and data protection, are complex.  All uses of recording devices under the legislation are linked to Garda functions, namely the investigation, detection, prevention and prosecution of criminal offences, public order and public safety, and safeguarding the security of the State.<\/p>  <p>  While Garda&iacute; have extensive common law powers at their disposal when carrying out their functions, it is important to have in place a modern and robust statutory framework to set standards and procedures in relation to the use of recording devices and to provide appropriate oversight of the use of the powers, in particular where they could infringe on the privacy or data protection rights of citizens.   <\/p>  <p>  The digital recording technology for policing purposes continues to evolve at pace and it is vital that the law supports the Garda&iacute; to respond dynamically to this and be in a position to make the best use of emerging technology.  Nevertheless it is also my intention to build in a number of safeguards to the legislation in order to maintain public trust in policing and to make clear that any intrusions into a citizen's private life are only where necessary and proportionate and for justifiable policing purposes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500082#WREE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid","counter":1486,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500082#WREE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1487,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[7575\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500082#WREE03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider a review of the payment levels to solicitors and barristers for the provision of services under civil legal aid for domestic violence and family law matters; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1488,"content":"<p>The Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) is the statutory, independent body responsible for the provision of civil legal aid and advice to persons of modest means in the State, in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;) and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2021.

Instead, they can provide a full colour certified copy. A points-based scoring system for proofs of residence has also been introduced to assist applicants and ensure that submitted applications are complete. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has identified that approximately 20% of the 25,000 applications currently in the system are incomplete, with further action required by the applicant to progress the application.

This mix of accommodation enables the Service to provide a varied prison regime where progression through the system assists prisoners to prepare for release from custody on completion of a custodial sentence. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of single cell accommodation for all prisoners, while desirable, is not currently possible due to the existing capacity within the prison estate, and current levels of committals. The Deputy many be aware that there are approximately 3,300 usable cells in the estate with about 3,800 people in custody at any one time. <\/p>  <p>  It is also the case that the number of people in custody is subject to increasing and decreasing trends and prior to the onset of the pandemic there were over 4,200 prisoners in custody. <\/p>  <p>  Data from the last published cell occupancy census carried out by the Prison Service indicates that 56% of prisoners in custody are accommodated in single cell accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that some prisoners are accommodated in multi-occupancy cells for reasons other than capacity and some prisoners, at committal stage, indicate a preference to share a cell with another person who may be known to them.  <\/p>  <p>  All prisoners are assessed by prison management on committal with regard to their suitability for sharing a cell. <\/p>  <p>  The need to ensure the availability of modern prison facilities with adequate capacity will be central to the development of the new Irish Prison Service Capital Strategy 2023, against the background of the work underway as part of the Programme for Government to develop policies and proposals to review policy options for prison and penal reform, including the effective and appropriate use of non-custodial sanctions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500083#WRFF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Policies","counter":1548,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500083#WRFF03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1549,"qnumday":590,"qnumall":"[7804\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500083#WRFF04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will address a matter raised in correspondence (details supplied) regarding parental alienation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1550,"content":"<p>To better inform further discussion on parental alienation, my Department arranged for research to be carried out.

It is also my intention to commence a public consultation on the topic in the coming weeks. Both the research and consultation will, I expect, create a deeper understanding of the issue, and inform my Department&rsquo;s consideration of policy and law in this area. The best interests of the child will of course be paramount in any considerations.  <\/p>  <p>  I recognise that going through the breakdown of a relationship can be a difficult and traumatic time for children and parents and that reform of the current family justice system is needed to better support families through such times.  <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a faster and less adversarial resolution of disputes in specialised centres.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2020, Government approved the drafting of a Family Court Bill along the lines of the General Scheme, which has been published. This has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. Work is ongoing on the drafting of the Bill, with a view to its publication as soon as possible this year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of finalising a Family Justice Strategy, which will set out a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill. <\/p>  <p>  To develop the new strategy, a Family Justice Oversight Group was established by my Department. To assist its work, this Group has engaged in a phased consultation process where relevant stakeholders, the public, children and young people who engage with the family justice system gave their views on how a modernised family justice system should look. <\/p>  <p>  One of the areas being considered by the Group is additional training for those working within the family justice system that would benefit all those who engage with the system. It is intended that the Family Court Bill will provide that specialist knowledge and ongoing professional training in the area of family law would be required to be appointed as a Family Court judge.

The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, my Department made 11,512 citizenship decisions, the highest level achieved since 2015.  Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in the cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500084#WRGG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":1583,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500084#WRGG01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1584,"qnumday":602,"qnumall":"[8234\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500084#WRGG01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda cars and vans attached to Louth Garda division as of 1 February 2020 and 8 February 2022, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":1585,"qnumday":605,"qnumall":"[8238\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500084#WRGG02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda cars and vans attached to Carlow-Kilkenny Garda division as of 1 February 2020 and 8 February 2022, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1586,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 602 and 605 together.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 has allocated &euro;12m for investment in the Garda fleet, which will mean more high visibility policing in our towns and cities.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

A condition was that the person concerned was ordinarily resident outside the State. To re-acquire citizenship, they would have to apply for naturalisation.<\/p><p>With one exception, this remains the position in relation to all former Irish citizens who do not have a constitutional entitlement to Irish citizenship.

If born between 24 June 2004 and 1 January 2005 (the date of implementation of the relevant provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004), they continue to be dealt with for the purposes of re-acquisition after renunciation as if they are constitutionally entitled to citizenship. This exception is simply a reflection of the passage of time between the enactment of the constitutional amendment and the implementation of the primary legislation and the prospective approach taken in matters of this nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500085#WRHH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Organisations","counter":1625,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500085#WRHH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1626,"qnumday":616,"qnumall":"[8379\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500085#WRHH00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will clarify the position in respect of sports clubs offering houses as prizes in the course of their fundraising activities in the context of the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019","asker":"1489","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1627,"content":"<p>The Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019, which was commenced on 1 December 2020, modernises the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 to assist the better promotion of local gaming and lottery activity held primarily for charitable and philanthropic purposes.

I am informed that Operation Thor proactively targets organised crime gangs and repeat offenders through coordinated crime prevention and enforcement activity based on intelligence and the latest crime trends and patterns to protect communities.<\/p>  <p>  This annual focus from Operation Thor has proved highly successful in tackling property related crime since its inception in November 2015, with incidents of residential burglary significantly reduced nationally since its introduction. In 2015, there were in excess of 18,800 residential burglaries reported.

This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also allocated &euro;12m for investment in the Garda fleet, which means more high visibility policing in our towns and cities and on our roads.

In addition to focusing on the lifesaver offences of speeding, seatbelts, mobile phones and driving under the influence, there is a significant focus on crime prevention and crime detection. Roads Policing work closely with crime units to target known criminals and to disrupt their activities through strict enforcement of road traffic legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500085#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":1634,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500085#WRHH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1635,"qnumday":619,"qnumall":"[8441\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500085#WRHH01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if consideration will be given to reducing the fees for registration for the scheme for the regularisation for long-term undocumented migrants given that many of the applicants particularly those in direct provision have very limited means; the way that the scale of fees was arrived at; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1636,"content":"<p>The Regularisation of Long Term Undocumented Migrants Scheme opened for applications on 31 January 2022.

In line with the Mental Health Act 2001 (Approved Centre) Regulations 2006, each inpatient mental health service, as in general health services, must have a complaints procedure in place, such as the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;Your Service, Your Say&rsquo; service. I further note that 'Your Service, Your Say' is available to anyone accessing HSE mental health services, be that on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Following the investigation of the complaint by the HSE, an individual may request an internal review to be carried out by the HSE if they are not happy with the outcome. Furthermore, in cases where the complainant is not satisfied with the response to their complaint, they can request an external review from the Office of the Ombudsman, or in the case of child and adolescent services, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. This option is available to anyone who accesses our public health services, be it mental health services or otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act, published in July 2021, provides for every person accessing treatment in an inpatient mental health facility to be given information about their care and treatment, including an explicit requirement to provide information on the service&rsquo;s complaints procedure. Furthermore, the powers of the Inspector of Mental Health Services are being expanded to include 24-hour community residential facilities and community mental health services. As under the existing Act, the Inspector will continue to meet with any person accessing mental health services who has requested such a meeting.<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme also includes a statutory right to engage an advocate under numerous heads, including a definition of advocate under Section 2, information on advocacy to be provided to people in approved inpatient facilities under Section 16, 79 and 91, access to an advocate during a review board under Section 16B, during inquiries carried out by the Inspector under Section 55, or when making decisions about treatment under Sections 56 and 104. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of advocacy supports for people accessing mental health services offered by the public and voluntary sectors. The HSE currently provides some advocacy supports such as a Peer Advocacy Service in mental health. This service is concentrated on inpatient services and is delivered by an external agency on behalf of the HSE. In addition to adult advocacy services, HSE National Mental Health Services has a pilot scheme in place in two inpatient units to provide an advocacy service through an external provider for young people and their families using Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).<\/p>  <p>  The National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities (NAS) provides a free, confidential service to people with mental health difficulties, particularly people with complex needs. NAS is funded and supported by the Citizens Information Board, which has a mandate under the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the Comhairle Act 2000 to provide advocacy for persons with disabilities. Citizens Information Centres can be found nationwide and provide free, impartial advice and advocacy, or the Citizens Information Phone Service can be reached by phone.  <\/p>  <p>  Sage Advocacy also provides some advocacy support to people with mental health difficulties, particularly older people, in their role in supporting and enabling vulnerable adults and older people to make their voices heard in their healthcare decisions. The Irish Advocacy Network provides peer advocacy supports to people with mental health difficulties which can be accessed on a self-referral basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500085#WRHH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1653,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500085#WRHH03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1654,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[8318\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500085#WRHH03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) will be eligible for the &euro;1,000 payment allocated to frontline workers for their efforts during the pandemic.","asker":"1626","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1655,"content":"<p>Firstly I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all healthcare workers for their efforts during this most challenging period.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the efforts of the general public, volunteers and all workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on Wednesday 19 January, the Government announced a once-off public holiday will take place on Friday 18 March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also announced COVID-19 recognition payment for frontline public sector healthcare workers, to recognise their unique role during the pandemic.

We made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle.<\/p>  <p>  We have made a specific commitment to supporting \"the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, including the development of a Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, to tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland\". A number of initial priority areas for action were determined by the Taskforce, with the issue of endometriosis recognised and included as part of a priority workstream on improving gynaecological health for women and girls.<\/p>  <p>  The endometriosis workstream identified a number of potential actions in this area, including enhanced services and supports and increased information and awareness. There has been significant work underway to reflect these actions in implementation, including direct investment in services which I will mention in further detail shortly, and a public webinar on endometriosis which was held on November 24th 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Information provided by the HSE indicates that endometriosis is a difficult condition to diagnose and treat because of the variation of presentations, impacting the physical and mental wellbeing of patients at varying levels. Treatment may include pain medications, hormone treatment and surgical interventions. The time to diagnose endometriosis varies by patient due to its varying and ambiguous symptom presentation. The HSE's National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the treatment of endometriosis, I am advised that a GP referral to a gynaecologist is the standard pathway of care for the management of endometriosis in Ireland. This is similar to the pathway in place for the management of other gynaecological conditions.<\/p>  <p>  The  HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme  has developed a plan to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology, which includes patients with endometriosis. The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory, or see and treat, model, rather than the traditional outpatient referral model.  An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources.  It is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.<\/p>  <p>  As such, the Programme has developed an Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care which centres on the establishment of one-stop &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; ambulatory gynaecology clinics. An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources than the traditional outpatient model and it is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.<\/p>  <p>  Building on progress made in rolling out these ambulatory gynaecology clinics in 2020 and 2021, funding has been provided under Budget 2022 which will facilitate the establishment of additional ambulatory gynaecology clinics, thereby completing the implementation of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care. This will bring the total number of these clinics to 20 nationally.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, in April 2021, I announced the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital (TUH) to deliver a specialist endometriosis centre for the management and treatment of all forms of endometriosis, with particular focus on advanced and complex cases for which there is no ready access in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Further to the above, funding provided under Budget 2022 will enable the expansion of the endometriosis service at TUH as well as the establishment of a new service for more complex endometriosis cases at Cork University Maternity Hospital<\/p>  <p>  The issue of endometriosis has also been highlighted through the nationwide &ldquo;Radical Listening&rdquo; exercise carried out by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This exercise enabled women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services.

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p>  <p>  The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will bring to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The taskforce will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.<\/p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500085#WRHH04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1669,"content":"<p>Question No. 631 answered with Question No. 630.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1670,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500085#WRHH05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1671,"qnumday":632,"qnumall":"[7435\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500085#WRHH05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of hospital appointments which were cancelled, postponed and rescheduled in University Hospital Galway in each of the years 2019, 2020 and 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1672,"content":"<p>I fully acknowledge the distress and inconvenience for patients and their families when elective procedures are cancelled, particularly for clinically urgent procedures.

The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan. <\/p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual Waiting List plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.<\/p><p>The data requested by the Deputy concerning the number of persons waiting for a surgical procedure across each specialty is outlined in the attached document.

There are an estimated 6-8,000 known rare diseases affecting up to 6% of the total EU population, (at least 30 million Europeans), and perhaps up to 300,000 Irish people during their lives.<\/p>  <p>  It can be a challenge to provide highly specialised treatment or care for patients who have complex conditions. This is especially true when the prevalence of such conditions is low, as is the case for rare diseases. This challenge is due to both the scarcity of expertise and to the scattering of small patient populations across the EU, sometimes in isolated locations where expertise does not exist or cannot be accessed.<\/p>  <p>  European Reference Networks (ERNs) are virtual networks involving healthcare providers across Europe. They aim to facilitate discussion on complex and rare diseases that require highly specialised treatment and concentrated knowledge and resources. European Reference Networks (ERN) create a clear governance structure for knowledge sharing and care coordination across the EU to improve access to diagnosis and treatment, as well as the provision of high-quality healthcare for patients. They are networks of centres of expertise and healthcare providers that are organised across borders.<\/p>  <p>  On Friday 26th November 2021, Ireland received formal notification from the European Commission (DG-Sante) that the 15 applications (involving a number of Centres of Expertise led from five academic hospitals) submitted to join the European Reference Networks were approved.  <\/p>  <p>  This is a significant achievement for the Irish Health Service with international approval\/endorsement, to facilitate mobility of expertise, virtually or physically and develop and share information, knowledge and best practice and foster developments of the diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment of rare diseases.  Very importantly, this is also a very positive development for individuals and families affected with rare diseases for the enhanced cross border provision of highly specialised\/rare disease services. <\/p>  <p>  These 5 academic hubs will be pivotal to and drive innovation, training and clinical research for highly specialised care in collaboration with the established momentum of the ERN model which incorporates the most talented clinicians and investigators in the European Community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500089#WRMM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1857,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500089#WRMM01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1858,"qnumday":696,"qnumall":"[7657\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500089#WRMM01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a meeting was held with persons (details supplied) in 2003 that led to the decision to halt a review into missing samples from a family in Askeaton, County Limerick; and if pressure was brought by the persons to stop the review going ahead.","asker":"1612","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1859,"content":"<p>No meetings were held in 2003 between the then Minister for Health, An Taoiseach Miche&aacute;l Martin T.D., and Mr. de B&uacute;rca relating to a review into missing samples from the family concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500089#WRMM01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":1860,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500089#WRMM02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1861,"qnumday":697,"qnumall":"[7658\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500089#WRMM02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021; if he plans to propose an extension of its provisions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1862,"content":"<p>The Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 extended to 31 March 2022 the period of application of certain emergency provisions that have been key to the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person<\/p>  <p>  - Bed and board<\/p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living<\/p>  <p>  - Laundry service<\/p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. CCPC&rsquo;s mission is to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare. The CCPC has published consumer protection guidelines for contracts of care in long-term residential care services for older people. The guidelines set out the obligations and responsibilities that providers must adhere to under consumer protection law and are aimed at providing greater transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500089#WRMM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1878,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500089#WRMM03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1879,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[7738\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500089#WRMM03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an urgent CAMHS assessment can be immediately provided for a person (details supplied);

I also note growing awareness and interest in this topic, which derives in part from the current focus on genetic mutations in the SARS-Cov-2 virus, and genetic sequence-based surveillance which is informing public health measures globally. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that the Health Research Board, our lead agency with responsibility for supporting clinical, population health and health services research, is active in this agenda. Their new strategy for the years 2021-2025 contains an action to &ldquo;engage with the Department of Health, the HSE and others to explore opportunities and interfaces for current and future investments in genomic research and personalised medicine&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2021, the HRB convened stakeholders (including Science Foundation Ireland, researchers, clinicians, patient organisations, and the HSE) to discuss current opportunities and challenges for Ireland in genomics medicine, research and innovation. The HRB is coordinating an application from Ireland to join a Digital Europe funding programme call to support member states to develop the necessary data infrastructure (and skills and standards) to collect, store, manage, share and analyse genomic datasets within and across EU member states, in a secure, transparent and trusted manner. The consortium will secure European funding to allow authorised data users, such as clinicians and researchers, to advance our understanding of genomics for more precise and faster clinical decision-making, diagnostics, treatments and precision medicine, and for improved public health measures that will benefit citizens, healthcare systems and the overall economy.<\/p>  <p>  This is an important step to ensure that investment in Ireland in genomic medicine and research is appropriately governed, acceptable to citizens, and will enable global research efforts towards improving healthcare. <\/p>  <p>  The HRB will establish a national mirror group to follow these developments in the EU (including the One Million Genomes Project and the Beyond 1 Million Genomes project) and will strive to connect researchers (clinicians and funders) in areas that will benefit from being able to share and analyse genomics data, in particular rare diseases and cancer, where the HRB is also actively supporting research at national and EU-level. <\/p>  <p>  Genomics and personalised medicine will be important issues to consider in the context of the new National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation, led by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. I am committed to working with other Government departments and agencies to this important agenda to capitalise on our collective national investments and plans in genetics and genomics research, to sustain efforts in capacity-building, and to plan for adequate research infrastructure to support these developments. By working together towards a coherent framework and common principles, we can foster a vibrant portfolio of research in genetics and genomics, amenable to academic and industry partnerships, and which will support and drive advances in healthcare for our citizens. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500089#WRMM05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabilities Assessments","counter":1900,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500090#WRNN00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1901,"qnumday":710,"qnumall":"[7778\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500090#WRNN00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a child (details supplied) will have an assessment of need completed and the necessary services put in place.","asker":"1491","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1902,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500090#WRNN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1903,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500090#WRNN00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1904,"qnumday":711,"qnumall":"[7779\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500090#WRNN00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons from CHO8 who used the Cross Border Directive in order to avail of health services in Northern Ireland in each of the years 2017 to 2021.","asker":"1498","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1905,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500090#WRNN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1906,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500090#WRNN00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1907,"qnumday":712,"qnumall":"[7780\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500090#WRNN00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current healthcare services provided in the Louth Hospital;

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.<\/p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.<\/p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.<\/p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of January 2022 there were 4,901 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,437 in January 2019.<\/p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will bring to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.<\/p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.<\/p><p>The data requested by the Deputy concerning cataract surgeries carried out under the NTPF, is outlined in the attached document.

It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, it may be of interest to that the NSAC recently held its first 'Annual Call' for submissions from the public on new screening programmes, or proposed changes to existing programmes.

It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements that will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. The Department recently commenced a targeted stakeholder consultation on these draft minimum requirements. A public consultation will take place in 2022. In addition, HIQA lately ran a public scoping consultation to inform the development of their National Standards for Home Support Services.

In 2021, funding was secured for the Health Service Executive to: (i) progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; (ii) pilot a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and (iii) establish a National Office for Home Support Services.<\/p>  <p>  Recruitment of 128 interRAI Care Needs Facilitator posts has been approved. This will progress the national roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care for older persons services. A comprehensive and robust operational model for the roll-out of interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The testing of the reformed model of service delivery for home-support commenced in November 2021 in the first of the four pilot sites: East Westmeath in Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) 8. The three other sites &ndash; Tuam, Athenry and Loughrea in CHO 2; Bandon, Kinsale and Carrigaline in CHO 4; and Ballyfermot and Palmerstown in CHO 7 &ndash; came into operation in January 2022. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluations will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel, the Department is developing the evidence base to determine the optimal approach to a funding model for the scheme. As part of this work, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) is undertaking research on behalf of the Department on the potential demand for and cost of home-support. The first report from this research, published in March 2021, focused on the potential demand for such a scheme in a number of policy scenarios. The findings contained in the report indicate that there will be a significant increase in the demand for home-support in the coming years and that, relative to a baseline of the provision of 24.7 million hours in 2019, between 3.5 and 8 million additional hours will be required across a range of policy scenarios modelled. Building on this work, the ESRI is currently undertaking research on the potential cost of introducing such a scheme across a range of funding scenarios. This report is scheduled for publication in Q1 2022. This work will complement the research already undertaken, including by the Health Research Board, in relation to the provision of home-support in other countries. The Department will seek Government approval in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a funding model for the new home-support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the statutory scheme, the Minister for Mental Health and Older People, Mary Butler TD, has committed to establishing a cross-departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group to examine strategic workforce challenges in front-line carer roles in home-support and nursing homes. The work of this Group, the first meeting of which is expected to take place the week commencing 28th February,\u00a0will centre on engagement with relevant stakeholders in the sector and will involve a structured programme of ongoing consultative engagements with key sectoral stakeholders to further explore and define the issues, listen to stakeholder views, and identify approaches to respond to strategic workforce challenges. Potential areas to be considered by the Group include recruitment, retention, training, and the career development of front-line carers in home-support and nursing homes into the future.\u00a0 Provision of travel expenses to staff may also form part of these considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500096#WRVV03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":2214,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500096#WRVV03600"},{"type":"question","counter":2215,"qnumday":813,"qnumall":"[8097\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500096#WRVV03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expand the home care sector.","asker":"1572","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2216,"content":"<p>The HSE has operational responsibility for planning, managing and delivering home support services at national, regional and local levels. Services are delivered either directly by HSE-employed staff, or on its behalf by a combination of private and Section 39 organisations (i.e. voluntary\/not-for-profit) providers who operate under service agreements with the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 the HSE began streamlining services by bringing together the funding for home help and standard home care packages, which now operate as a single home support service. This approach provided significant benefits, including: making the services easier to understand; streamlining the application and decision-making processes; and, facilitating service users in moving to changed levels of service as their assessed needs changed, without the need for an additional application process.  Overall, the 2018 HSE National Service Plan (NSP) provided for 17.4 million home support hours to be delivered to 50,500 people at any time.  This includes home support hours provided through intensive home care packages.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to increasing home care hours.  During the lifetime of this Government I have secured additional funding of &euro;150 million for home support, to progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services, and to provide for up to 5 million additional hours of home support last year. Last year&rsquo;s target was to deliver 24.26 million home support hours, which included hours to be delivered through Intensive Home Care Packages and I'm pleased to say that the funding to provide these additional hours has been maintained into 2022.  Since 2018 the overall target for home support has increased from 17.4 million hours to 24.26 million hours.  This represents an increase of approximately 40%.  <\/p>  <p>  Preliminary data show that about 2.9 million more home support hours were delivered by the end of December 2021, compared to the same period in 2020.  I am aware that delays can arise between funding approval and the delivery of home support hours. Certain regions are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability. I am committed to establishing a cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group to examine strategic workforce challenges in front-line carer roles in home support and nursing homes.   Invitations to join the Group, along with its draft Terms of Reference issued to all relevant Government Departments and agencies on 11th February.

It commenced in November 2021 in east Westmeath, which is the first of the four pilot sites. The three other sites became operational in January 2022.   Recruitment of 128 InterRAI Care Needs Facilitator posts to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care needs, has been approved.  In addition, a National Home Support Office is in the process of being established. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500096#WRVV03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2217,"content":"<p>Question No. 814 answered with Question No. 788.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":2219,"qnumday":815,"qnumall":"[8099\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500096#WRVV04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps he is taking to harvest data around the provision of home care and the need for such care in Ireland.","asker":"1572","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2220,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500096#WRVV04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2221,"content":"<p>Question No. 816 answered with Question No. 812.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2222,"content":"<p>Question No. 817 answered with Question No. 812.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2223,"content":"<p>Question No. 818 answered with Question No. 812.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2225,"content":"<p>Question No. 819 answered with Question No. 788.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care of the Elderly","counter":2226,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500097#WRWW00300"},{"type":"question","counter":2227,"qnumday":820,"qnumall":"[8104\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500097#WRWW00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps being taken to address what the World Health Organization Global Report on Ageism states is evidence of ageism in the provision of long-term care of older persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2228,"content":"<p>Ireland's National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS, 2013) is grounded in, and consistent with, the international developments in relation to ageing.\u00a0 The World Health Organisations 'Active Ageing &ndash; A Policy Framework (2002)' was the theoretical underpinning for this strategy.\u00a0 As a result, Ireland's strategy aligns in many areas with the World Health Organisations 'Global Report on Ageism' and the framework for action.<\/p>  <p>  In 2022, the Department of Health will be establishing a Commission on Care.\u00a0 The work of the Commission on Care will include an assessment of NPAS to ensure it is addressing the diverse needs of todays older citizen.\u00a0 Ageism is one of the key pillars of NPAS and will be examined under the Commission on Care to ensure enough is being done to prevent and counter ageism in all care settings.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500097#WRWW00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":2229,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500097#WRWW00600"},{"type":"question","counter":2230,"qnumday":821,"qnumall":"[8106\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500097#WRWW00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if nurses, such as those who work in a registered charity (details supplied) which has a service level agreement with the HSE, will be included in the proposed health care bonus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1517","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2231,"content":"<p>Firstly I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all healthcare workers for their efforts during this most challenging period.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the efforts of the general public, volunteers and all workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on Wednesday 19 January, the Government announced a once-off public holiday will take place on Friday 18 March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also announced COVID-19 recognition payment for frontline public sector healthcare workers, to\u00a0recognise their unique role\u00a0during the pandemic.

Further developments will focus on the areas of memory assessment and support services, memory technology resource rooms, the implementation of a dementia registry and the national intellectual disability memory service.<\/p>  <p>  In addition the proportion of new home support hours that will be ring-fenced for people with dementia will more than double from 5% in 2021 to 11% in 2022. Taken together, this will represent &euro;15 million of increased investment dedicated to dementia in 2022 to supplement the &euro;12.9 million of additional funding in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Funding in 2021 allowed for substantial advancements in the areas of:<\/p>  <p>  -  Enhanced Memory Technology Resource Rooms in 9 sites across the country<\/p>  <p>  -  Dementia diagnostic services through a specialist regional memory clinic in Cork and four new memory assessment and support services in Mayo, Wexford, Waterford and Sligo<\/p>  <p>  -  Enhancement of acute care pathways for people with dementia\u00a0through the recruitment of more clinical nurse specialists<\/p>  <p>  -  The implementation of a National Clinical Guideline on the appropriate prescribing of psychotropic medication for non-cognitive symptoms in people with dementia<\/p>  <p>  -  Increased access to in-home day care and support and<\/p>  <p>  -  Dementia: Understand Together initiatives<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in November 2021 I officially launched an expansion of the National Dementia Advisor Service.

In addition, a Brain Health project manager post will commence in 2022 to support the delivery of actions from this group and support national campaigns and programmes to incorporate dementia risk reduction.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that up to 40% of dementia prevalence worldwide is preventable. The national risk reduction working group published a document titled &ldquo;key messages on dementia risk reduction&rdquo; in 2019. Identified risk factors for dementia include smoking, obesity, diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, depression, social isolation, alcohol etc. National campaigns (such as Quit smoking; askaboutalcohol; mental health campaigns; healthy eating and active living) all help to address the risk factors that are associated with dementia.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, key messaging on brain health and risk reduction have been incorporated as part of dementia awareness training, within the Dementia Understand Together in Communities programme. The Memory Assessment and Support Services funded in 2021 and 2022 as part of the National Service Plan will have a dedicated Advanced Nurse Practitioner (ANP) for brain health.

The model of care for infertility was developed by my officials in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme in order to ensure that infertility issues are addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.<\/p>  <p>  This model of care comprises three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs), extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments), with patients being referred onwards through structured pathways.<\/p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs within maternity networks, in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues at this level of intervention. The completion of Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Hospital Groups across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system, but will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated and the AHR legislation commenced.<\/p>  <p>  Publication of the Bill to regulate the area of AHR is a priority for the Government and officials in my Department and the Office of the Attorney General are continuing to engage intensively in order to finalise this legislation, which encompasses the regulation for the first time of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction. I expect to be in a position to bring a Memorandum to Government seeking approval to publish the Bill in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  While advanced AHR treatment, such as IVF, is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant\/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I understand that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF, or other advanced AHR treatment, privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the model of care for infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500097#WRWW03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2263,"content":"<p>Question No. 835 answered with Question No. 749.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":2264,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500097#WRWW04000"},{"type":"question","counter":2265,"qnumday":836,"qnumall":"[8173\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500097#WRWW04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost of having fully staffed mental health teams in each CHO across the country;

I secured an additional &euro;7.3million in budget 2022 for dementia services with a focus on memory assessment and support services, memory technology resource rooms and the implementation of a dementia registry. In addition the number of additional home support hours that will be ring fenced for people living with dementia will more than double from 5% in 2021 to 11% in 2022.

This included the enhancement of memory assessment and support services, enhanced memory technology resource rooms, increased access to in-home day care services and the continuation of the dementia understand together initiatives. These enhanced services and supports will work to enable people with dementia to live well in their communities for as long as possible.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in November 2021 I officially launched an expansion of the National Dementia Advisor Service. The Dementia Adviser Service provides a key focal point to help people navigate the health and social care system, ensuring they receive the right support at the right time.

Funding of approximately &euro;9m has been allocated in Budget 2022 to enable commencement of the scheme, which is still scheduled for August 2022.<\/p><p>In terms of stakeholder consultations, it should be noted that the recommendations of the JOC8 took into consideration the deliberations of the Citizen&rsquo;s Assembly on the matter.

Clear stakeholder feedback with regard to access to contraception is duly taken into consideration in the development and progression of this scheme<\/p><p>The scheme will provide for:<\/p><p>1.

The Waiting List Task Force will ensure that the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan and subsequent multi-annual plans will be aligned with these other interdependent initiatives, which include: new electives-only hospitals; reform of eligibility policy; Enhanced Community Care; implementation of the Regional Health Areas (RHAs); the Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract; implementation of the capacity review; strategic workforce planning; eHealth initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500101#WRAAA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":2459,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500101#WRAAA04500"},{"type":"question","counter":2460,"qnumday":906,"qnumall":"[8417\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500101#WRAAA04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which provision can be made or is being made to address the deficiencies in the orthodontic services throughout the country; the number of persons on waiting lists at present; when they will have access to the necessary treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2461,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500101#WRAAA04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2463,"qnumday":907,"qnumall":"[8418\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500101#WRAAA04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which an adequate dental service is available through the schools and thereafter by way of every means possible in order to ensure the highest possible standards of service to the public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2464,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500101#WRAAA05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":2466,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500102#WRBBB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2467,"qnumday":908,"qnumall":"[8419\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500102#WRBBB00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to further increase the number of hospital consultants throughout the country with a view to ensuring an adequate spread of skills throughout the regions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2468,"content":"<p>Given its statutory functions in relation to medical training and approval of consultant posts I have asked the HSE to reply to the Deputy concerning these issues.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that there are particular challenges in filling posts in certain specialties, including psychiatry and paediatrics, and in certain locations.

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients.<\/p>  <p>  Children with a range of needs rely on the orthopaedic service of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, for example children with Spina Bifida, hip deformity, and other orthopaedic needs. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision.<\/p>  <p>  Two months ago, I met with the Scoliosis Co-Design Group. This is a well-established and successful group which facilitates a multidisciplinary approach to service improvement. The group includes members from advocacy groups, as well as orthopaedic consultants from Children's Health Ireland, and senior management from across the CHI sites.\u00a0 Further to this meeting I requested that Children's Health Ireland (CHI) draw up a plan to improve waiting times for orthopaedic services, particularly for those children with conditions such as scoliosis and Spina Bifida where time is a crucial factor in ensuring that these children have a positive outcome from their surgeries.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Last week I convened a meeting with the clinical teams from Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital, along with senior management from these hospitals and the HSE. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the draft orthopaedic waiting list plan and to ensure that an appropriate plan with ambitious and attainable activity levels was being produced. The plan will be funded in the context of the wider waiting list action plan for 2022 and will include additional activity to reduce the spinal orthopaedic waiting list through the use of theatres at Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh. In the context of the waiting list action plan additional capacity will also be sought in the private sector to work towards reducing paediatric orthopaedic waiting times.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In terms of broader services for children with Spina Bifida, CHI have advised the Department of Health that CHI at Temple Street has doubled capacity from 2 Multidisciplinary (MDT) clinics to 4 MDT outpatient clinics per month. This will improve access to specialists in the area of Neurodisability, Neurosurgery, Orthopaedics, Urology, Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, and Neuropsychology. The clinics also provide access to a Medical Social worker and a Clinical Nurse Specialist. CHI has advised the Department that this capacity increase is expected to provide each child with an annual review and will reduce the waiting time for follow up appointments.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.\u00a0This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force.\u00a0It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan\u00a0which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The Task Force\u00a0will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.<\/p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual Waiting List plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500102#WRBBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2473,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500102#WRBBB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2474,"qnumday":911,"qnumall":"[8422\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500102#WRBBB00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which adequate provision can be made in the short term to deal with various aspects of women&rsquo;s health with a view to ensuring minimum waiting times, early diagnosis and a rapid response; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2475,"content":"<p>Improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes is a key priority for me and this Government.

Already, we are seeing new drug &amp;amp; alcohol needs emerge, whether in the night-time economy, among young people, in disadvantaged communities or polydrug use. <\/p><p>The development of population-based resource allocation will ensure funding is allocated on an equitable and rational basis in accordance with health and social needs. It also supports the emphasis on enhanced community care in the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme, that shifts care into the community and closer to people&rsquo;s homes. By integrating drug and alcohol services as part of primary care, the diverse health needs of people who use drugs can be met and the stigma of drug and alcohol use can be reduced.

The significant increase in both feed (concentrates) and fertiliser prices is directly linked to energy prices. <\/p>  <p>  There are also other factors impacting costs for our farmers, including increased transport costs,  increased global demand particularly from the big grain-producing countries and EU-imposed tariffs and duties on certain Third Country imports. <\/p>  <p>  I have been following the rising fertiliser price issue closely for the past number of months. In October 2021, I tasked Teagasc with laying out a credible roadmap to assist farmers in the short-term, as well as offering a long-term solution in the move to reduce dependency on chemical fertiliser. I launched the Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign at Teagasc Ballyhaise on the 26th January.  This roadmap can be good for the environment and good for the farmer's pocket. <\/p>  <p>  Teagasc has put together a comprehensive information pack for farmers and their advisers - through a compendium of 20 factsheets - to optimise the use of plant nutrients and to help farmers address the challenge of maintaining their farm outputs in the face of rising fertiliser costs and reduced availability.  This is a strategy that can ease the price pressure on farmers. It is a strategy that will be good for the environment and good for the pocket.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised this issue a number of times at European level too. At the November Agriculture and Fisheries Council, I raised the increasing challenge faced by farmers due to the rising costs of inputs.

On foot of this I understand that the sawmills had a good year in 2021.  As regards the coming year, Coillte had their contract event on 17th November, with sawmills receiving 50% of their supply of Coillte generated logs for 2022.

On foot of this I\u00a0understand that the sawmills had a good year in 2021.\u00a0 As regards the coming year, Coillte had their contract event on 17th November, with sawmills receiving 50% of their supply of Coillte generated logs for 2022.\u00a0 In addition to this, sawmills are taking in a steady supply of logs from private felling sites.\u00a0 Critically, the volume of felling licences issued has stabilised the market in this regard.\u00a0 Our plans to maintain the number of felling licences issued to Coillte and to increase the number of private felling licences in 2022 will, I believe, meet the needs of the sector and will  exceed the projections of the COFORD All Ireland Roundwood Production Forecast.<\/p>  <p>  As regards afforestation\u00a0I would like to assure the Deputy that achieving the targets set out in the Climate Action Plan of 8,000 hectares is a priority for me and my Department. I am more than aware of the need to engage farmers and landowners with\u00a0 forestry to achieve this.<\/p>  <p>  Improving licencing\u00a0output has a role to play in building confidence amongst farmer and landowners, and in increasing the demand for licences for afforestation and that is why we have a target of 1,040 afforestation licences for 2022. We are\u00a0fully committed to increasing the efficiency of the licensing system and work underway under Project Woodland in terms of the review of the regulatory framework and\u00a0of our business processes is aimed at helping us to achieve better and more responsive delivery.<\/p>  <p>  We do, however, need to address the broader issue of\u00a0increasing the level of interest in planting. In 2021, for example,\u00a0there were 502 afforestation licences issued. Those licences would have facilitated\u00a0planting of over 4,200 ha but only\u00a02000\u00a0hectares were planted\u00a0in 2021. This low conversion rate to planting is\u00a0of concern and needs to change.\u00a0We are this week writing to applicants with unused licences to remind them that their licence is still valid and to encourage them to consider using them before their approval lapses.\u00a0 It is important that positive messages around planting are communicated and this is the responsibility of all in the sector, especially those\u00a0in direct contact with farmers and landowners.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of an amendment to the Forestry Act 2014 to facilitate small scale tree planting without the need for a licence may appeal to certain landowners and will widen the options available for planting.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above,\u00a0through Project Woodland,\u00a0the\u00a0Department is currently preparing for comprehensive engagement and public consultation that will take place over the next\u00a0three months on a shared national vision for the role of trees and forests and on the development of a new forest strategy. Significant progress has already been made. A national public attitudes survey on afforestation has been undertaken. Irish Rural Link have been engaging with communities across Ireland. Bilateral engagements are ongoing with key stakeholders. In the coming months there will also be an online public consultation facility available where stakeholders and the public can provide detailed written submissions regarding the new Vision and Forest Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The new Forest Strategy will set out a clear plan of action that will align with our climate action commitments. The next Forestry Programme for the period 2023-2027 is currently being prepared and this will be the main implementation vehicle for the strategy. The role of trees and forests will play a vital role in meeting our climate action commitments and the Forestry Programme will provide funding to encourage an increased uptake of a wide range of afforestation measures to meet this.<\/p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, we are committed to delivering a forestry sector that will benefit farmers, the environment and the economy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500104#WRDDD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2589,"content":"<p>Question No. 950 answered with Question No. 949.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2590,"content":"<p>Question No. 951 answered with Question No. 949.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greyhound Industry","counter":2591,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500104#WRDDD02700"},{"type":"question","counter":2592,"qnumday":952,"qnumall":"[7892\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500104#WRDDD02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the &euro;500,000 debt at a racetrack (details supplied) was cleared by Greyhound Racing Ireland; and the terms and conditions for clearing this debt.","asker":"1468","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2593,"content":"<p>R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann (RC&Eacute;)\u00a0is a commercial state body, established under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 chiefly to control greyhound racing and to improve and develop the greyhound industry.

That is why I am attaching importance to improving output on these licences in 2022. We Intend to issue 1,040 afforestation licences which is double our output in 2021. We are\u00a0fully committed to increasing the efficiency of the licensing system and work underway under Project Woodland in terms of the review of the regulatory framework and\u00a0of our business processes is aimed at helping us to achieve better and more responsive delivery.<\/p>  <p>  We do however need to address the broader issue of\u00a0increasing the level of interest in planting.

This low conversion rate to planting is\u00a0of concern and needs to change.\u00a0We are this week writing to applicants with unused licences to remind them that their licence is still valid and to encourage them to consider using them before their approval lapses.\u00a0 It is important that positive messages around planting are communicated and this is the responsibility of all in the sector, especially those\u00a0in direct contact with farmers and landowners.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of an amendment to the Forestry Act 2014 to facilitate small scale tree planting without the need for a licence may appeal to certain landowners and will widen the options available for planting.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above,\u00a0through Project Woodland my Department is currently preparing for comprehensive engagement and public consultation that will take place over the next 3 months on a shared national vision for the role of trees and forests and on the development of a new forest strategy. Significant progress has already been made. A national public attitudes survey on afforestation has been undertaken. Irish Rural Link have been engaging with communities across Ireland. Bilateral engagements are ongoing with key stakeholders. In the coming months there will also be an online public consultation facility available where stakeholders and the public can provide detailed written submissions regarding the new Vision and Forest Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  The new Forest Strategy will set out a clear plan of action that will align with our climate action commitments. The next Forestry Programme for the period 2023-2027 is currently being prepared and this will be the main implementation vehicle for the strategy. The role of trees and forests will play a vital role in meeting our climate action commitments and the Forestry Programme will provide funding to encourage an increased uptake of a wide range of afforestation measures to meet this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500104#WRDDD04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":2609,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500104#WRDDD04500"},{"type":"question","counter":2610,"qnumday":958,"qnumall":"[8025\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021500104#WRDDD04600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he is taking to ensure a more equitable distribution of the mackerel quota regarding the inshore fishing fleet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2611,"content":"<p>An\u00a0allocation of 400 tonnes for a fishery for smaller vessels (under 15 metre vessels)\u00a0fishing for Mackerel by means of hooks and line, which is prosecuted by the inshore fleet, was set down in Policy in 2010.\u00a0 The then Minister amended the Mackerel policy in July 2017 after intensive review and public consultation, however this particular amendment did not involve the hook and line fishery.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In order to amend Mackerel Policy, I must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.\u00a0 If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect of policy, it will require due process, involving an assessment of all issues arising, including a full public consultation.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There has been, for the past 20 years or so, intensive competition within the industry for a higher share of the mackerel quota.

The plan sets out an indicative 22% to 30% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, based on 2018 levels. To achieve sectoral targets and stabilise dairy emissions, a key priority for the Irish dairy sector, agreed under the auspices of the stakeholder-led Food Vision 2030 strategy,\u00a0 is &ldquo;to produce a detailed plan by Q2 2022 to manage the sustainable environmental footprint of the dairy sector&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  To achieve this action, I have established the Food Vision Dairy Group.

This will provide the basis for a future competitive advantage for the sector on a global scale.<\/p>  <p>  The continued development of market opportunities at home and abroad is also a key goal under the Food Vision 2030 strategy.

Unfortunately data is not available at project level at the granular geographical level requested by the Deputy.<\/p><p>This funding includes the\u00a0Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), the Community Services Programme, the Town &amp;amp; Village Renewal Scheme, the Community Enhancement Programme, supports for social enterprises, and funding for public libraries across the country. \u00a0<\/p><p>That said, the Department&rsquo;s Community Services Programme (CSP), which is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department, currently supports over 420 community organisations nationwide to provide local services through a social enterprise model.\u00a0 CSP funding provides a co-funding contribution of &euro;19,033 towards the cost of each agreed full-time equivalent (FTE) positions and &euro;32,000 towards the cost of each manager position, where warranted.\u00a0 The CSP contribution does not meet the full salary cost of the supported positions, organisations are required to provide additional funds from their own resources such as traded income, to meet the full cost of employment.\u00a0 During 2021, the CSP supported\u00a021 organisations in south western areas of Dublin with a contribution towards the cost of supporting 17 Managers and 112 full time equivalent positions, with all contracts extended to year end, with a total allocation of almost &euro;2.7m for 2022.\u00a0 Full details of CSP supported organisations are available on Pobal&rsquo;s website. <\/p><p>My Department provides a cohesive framework of supports for the community and voluntary sector.\u00a0This includes supports for 29 Volunteer Centres and a number of national organisations such as Volunteer Ireland and Young Social Innovators. A minimum of &euro;121,000 per annum is provided, by my Department, to strengthen and foster volunteerism in Ireland to each Volunteer Centre. This funding helps to build a support structure to develop volunteering locally thus enabling Volunteer Centres, including South County Dublin, to play a central role in facilitating and supporting the development of volunteering in their areas. <\/p><p>My Department also has overall responsibility for the funding, governance oversight and development of the national Public Participation Network (PPN) network. A PPN is a structure that brings together volunteer-led groups in each Local Authority area to represent the community sector in local policymaking. PPNs have been established in all local authority areas, including South County Dublin. My Department provides funding of up to &euro;55,700 per annum to each PPN, supplemented by local authority funding. This funding is to be used for the cost of the employment of Resource and Support Worker, and ongoing operational costs such as office accommodation and training.<\/p><p>South Dublin County Council received &euro;780,000 in funding under the Outdoor Recreation and Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS). The projects were approved under ORIS 2017 and the funds were subsequently drawn down in 2019. South Dublin County Council have been allocated &euro;148,500 under ORIS 2020 and have been awarded a further &euro;382,000 under ORIS 2021.
