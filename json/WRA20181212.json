The objective is to have a single aviation regulator responsible for economic, safety and security regulation and a standalone air navigation service provider.  This is in line with emerging best international practice.  It provides a sounder governance and organisational basis for enhancing regulatory functions into the future, which is needed to match the ever growing regulatory demands &ndash; particularly in aviation safety and security - emanating from the EU and ICAO.  <\/p>  <p>  As regards the current status, I can advise the Deputy that a high level project management board has been established, comprising senior officials from my Department, the Chief Executive Officer of the IAA and the Aviation Commissioner.  Project governance and implementation structures have also been established, including numerous working groups, which have been charged with carrying our due diligence on matters such as finance, international\/ EU regulations and law, and HR matters.   This work &ndash; which is detailed and in some areas highly technical in nature &ndash; is on-going.  Once the due diligence is complete, I expect the high level project management board to consider the outcome of that process, examine options arising and make recommendations to me.   <\/p>  <p>  The overall approach to the reform is wholly in accordance with established practice for structural reform processes within the Irish public sector.  There will be appropriate staff consultation throughout the process.  There has already been engagement with the main staff representative body &ndash; FORSA &ndash; and in all eventualities the commitment is that staff will transfer to the new structures on no less favourable terms and conditions, unless otherwise negotiated.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising that such reform has a number of complex components, I am mindful of the need to manage the transition to the proposed new arrangements for aviation regulation in a careful and methodical manner. That includes in relation to the eventual enactment of supporting legislation.  While good progress is being made, there are still a number of stages to navigate on the way to the production of a draft Bill that can be put forward to the House for consideration. <\/p>  <p>  This is an important project for the future of aviation regulation in Ireland. While the changes involved may be complex they also provide a new opportunity for enhancing existing provisions. Throughout the change process, senior management in both organisations will ensure that business as usual continues for all external stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200072#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":8,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 7 to 12, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200073#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[51959\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200073#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on whether a greater emphasis should be placed on disqualified drivers surrendering their licences and the enforcement of same by the Road Safety Authority; the reason there are so many driver vehicle databases; the differences between each; his views on which database is the most comprehensive for the road safety needs associated with such a database; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>The requirement for a disqualified driver to surrender his or her licence is set out in the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 2006 (S.I.

As Deputy Broughan is aware, enforcement of the law is a matter for An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.  <\/p>  <p>  Drivers who are disqualified are required to return their licences to the Road Safety Authority, however, very few do.  This is completely unacceptable, but it is not correct to give it the importance sometimes attached to it.  The real problem is not disqualified drivers failing to return their licences, it is disqualified drivers who continue to drive.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not believe that the non-return of licences, unacceptable and illegal though it is, is the central issue.  The number of disqualified drivers not returning their licences is not a proxy for the number of people who drive while disqualified.  As I've said some people will return their licences and still drive, others will not return their licences but not drive.  What we need is strong enforcement of the law against people driving while disqualified.  In this context, the crucial legislative step was taken in the Road Traffic Act 2014, which empowered An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to arrest a person where they have reason to believe that the person is driving while disqualified.  <\/p>  <p>  The penalty for driving while disqualified is fine up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 and or a prison term of up to 6 months.  The penalty for non-return of a driving licence is the general penalty under the Road Traffic Acts, namely a fine of up to &euro;1,000 for a first offence, up to &euro;2,000 for a second offence, and up to &euro;2,000 and\/or up to 3 months in prison for a third or subsequent offence in a 12 month period. <\/p>  <p>  The Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division (DVCSD) of my Department manages the computer records of all vehicles and drivers in the State, referred to collectively as the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF).

It also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of Local Link services funded under the Rural Transport Programme.   <\/p>  <p>Public transport in rural areas of the country is primarily provided by bus and coach services, as well as rail and small public service vehicles (SPSV) services, which include Taxi, Hackney and Local Area Hackney services. <\/p>  <p>  The bus and coach services include Public Service Obligation (PSO) services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann and other operators, Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway services, licensed services provided by commercial operators and Local Link services.    <\/p>  <p>These services comprise conventional fixed services with regular routes, stopping places and timetables and Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) services which respond to local demands and which constitute the vast majority of Local Link services.   <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to the further development of bus services in rural areas and that is why funding has been increased over the past number of years, for both PSO and Local Link services in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  The increased funding has enabled the introduction of 66 new commuter services into the Local Link network, operating five, six or seven days per week, as well as demand-responsive services. Key features of these new services include greater integration with existing public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, following my engagement with key stakeholders last year, I tasked the NTA to examine how to extend existing Local Link services to provide additional services in the evenings. Subsequently, the NTA approved funding for 65 new pilot evening and late night Local Link services to operate on a 6 months trial basis to the end of this year. The results of the trial are currently being assessed by the NTA and the continuation of these services will be considered in the light of those results and the availability of funding in 2019.  I wish to again acknowledge the Deputy's commitment to the development of these services.    <\/p>  <p>  The NTA is continually working with Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide improvements on its contracted services across both its urban and non-urban networks. Changes already implemented this year or planned for 2019 include improvements in the regional cities of Cork, Galway and Limerick and town services in Sligo, Navan, Athlone and Drogheda, as well as to Bus &Eacute;ireann networks in rural areas including to corridors in Mayo, Galway, Clare, West Cork, Kerry, Wicklow and Westmeath.  <\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Programme for a Partnership Government undertakes to examine how best to improve integration of services in the rural bus network within regions.

However, I am pleased to say that the National Transport Authority is continuing to support the enablement of Leap Card on regional Bus &Eacute;ireann services nationwide. <\/p><p>This year a considerable number of newly purchased Leap compatible ticketing machines were introduced across PSO bus services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the NTA. In that regard the emphasis will be on providing Leap Card on PSO services that until earlier this year have not been able to accept Leap Cards due to a shortage of suitable ticketing equipment. <\/p><p>I am now informed that all Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO services will be able to accept Leap Cards within weeks, with some occasional exceptions where services are operated by contractor vehicles.  <\/p><p>This will be of benefit to people all across the country and will no doubt be welcomed by the Deputy, as I welcome it myself. <\/p><p>As well as these PSO services, the NTA also works with commercial bus operators to make Leap compatible ticketing equipment available to those operators who wish to accept it. A total of 14 commercial bus operators now accept Leap and that means that passengers on commercial services in places such as Galway, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, and Wexford are all able to make their journey using Leap.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, Expressway is a commercial bus service rather than a PSO service and it is a matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann, in its capacity as the commercial operator of Expressway services, to engage with the NTA if it wishes to allow Expressway passengers use their Leap Card and what ticket price might apply.<\/p><p>I very much welcome the extension of Leap enabled services across all of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s PSO services and as already mentioned would encourage all public transport users to make the switch to Leap where possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200073#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Vehicles","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200073#WRB01800"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[52199\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200073#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the ongoing review of small public service vehicles; and if he will consider changing regulations in order to permit executive hire vehicles to use bus and taxi lanes.","asker":"1250","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, under the <i>Taxi Regulation Act 2013<\/i>, the NTA is the independent regulator of the taxi, hackney and limousine sector.

This will achieve the twin goals of reducing congestion and reducing pollution.<\/p><p>In addition to buses, bus lanes may also be used by cyclists who, as vulnerable road users, are safer in bus lanes than in general traffic. The lanes may also, of course, be used by the emergency services. Finally, after the lanes were originally introduced it was decided to allow only one category of SPSV - namely taxis - to use them. This was a concession based on the fact that taxis are a form of public transport available for on-street hire.<\/p><p>Since bus lanes were first introduced, there have been many requests to allow other classes of traffic to use the lanes. These have included requests on behalf of motorcyclists, multi-occupancy vehicles, electric vehicles, hired limousines, hackneys, and animal ambulances, among others.

The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.<\/p><p>The BusConnects programme for Dublin will see the transformation of Dublin's bus system, so that journeys by bus will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable.  Part of this programme is to simplify the fares structure, to encourage interchange between services and modes of travel and to reduce boarding times.  A revised fare structure is required for transport in the city which will easily allow seamless movement between different transport services without financial penalty.  <\/p><p>The NTA points out in its recently published Fares Determination document that its fares determination adjusts fares both upwards and downwards, ensuring that the travelling public pays a fare relative to the distance they travel, such that the operators are in a position to provide a safe and reliable service.  <\/p><p>The National Planning Framework commits to provide public transport infrastructure and services to meet the needs of smaller urban centres and rural areas.  It also commits to provide a quality nationwide community-based public transport system in rural Ireland which responds to local needs under the Rural Transport Network and similar initiatives.  <\/p><p>The National Development Plan (NDP) 2018-2027 was published alongside the National Planning Framework.  While the NDP is a capital investment plan, it recognises the importance of investment in public transport services outside of the cities and commits to continued investment in such services over the lifetime of the NDP.  Subject to the availability of operational funding support, it is intended to introduce new town bus services in certain large towns to enable their development growth and provide a public transport option for residents and visitors.<\/p><p>Modal shift from the private car to sustainable means of transport remains central to the transport sector&rsquo;s response to climate change.  Investment in public transport led to an increase of almost 31 million journeys on subsidised public transport and commercial bus service since 2013, with an increase<b><\/b>of 16 million passengers in 2017 (a 7% rise on 2016 figures) with a further increase of 6.2% to 4 November 2018, across all public transport services.<\/p><p>As Deputies are aware, in order to reduce the prevalence of the private car and encourage a shift to more sustainable forms of transport, a number of key policy measures to increase public transport capacity will be progressed over the next decade.  The National Development Plan has earmarked &euro;8.6 billion for investment in public and sustainable transport to 2027.<\/p><p>I have referred the Deputies questions to the NTA for reply in relation to those aspects where it has statutory responsibility.

In transport, natural gas can offer a cleaner alternative to oil and biogas can offer a lower carbon emitting alternative. <\/p>  <p>  Compressed natural gas (CNG) is an established source of transport fuel predominantly suited to larger vehicles, such as trucks and buses, travelling short to medium distances. Liquified natural gas is more efficient on longer road journeys with minimal start-stops such as transcontinental freight movement and in the shipping sector. <\/p>  <p>As outlined in the National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport, which my Department published in May 2017, natural gas, particularly CNG, is envisaged as a key alternative fuel in the heavy duty sector in Ireland. CNG is reported to emit few emissions, particularly NOx, SOx and particulate matter.  Importantly, it is a pathway fuel to renewable biomethane which can dramatically reduce CO2   emissions in transport. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, a Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Taskforce was established to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the take-up of low-carbon technologies in the road transport sector. The Taskforce is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment. It includes representatives from across the public sector and consults widely with industry, stakeholders and representative groups. Phase 1 of the Taskforce focused specifically on electric vehicles, while Phase 2, which began its work in September, is examining the role of other alternative fuel technologies including natural gas in both its compressed and liquefied states. Working Group 4 of the Taskforce is considering the range of incentives and infrastructure requirements to encourage the take-up of such low emitting fuels. I envisage that Phase 2 of the LEV Taskforce will report to Government next summer.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that a number of valuable measures are already in place to encourage uptake of gas vehicles in Ireland.  In Budget 2015 the excise rate for natural gas and biogas as a propellant was set at the current EU minimum rate (&euro;2.60 per GJ) and a guarantee given that this rate would be held for a period of eight years. This rate puts CNG in a competitive price position with diesel. Budget 2019 saw the introduction of an accelerated capital allowance scheme for gas-propelled vehicles and related equipment. This will enable businesses to write down the cost of such vehicles or equipment up-front in the year of purchase rather than spread over 8 years.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Gas Networks Ireland has received funding from the European Commission, under the CEF Transport Fund, to install 14 public CNG refuelling stations (including a station at Dublin Port which is due to open shortly) and a large scale renewable gas injection point under the &ldquo;Causeway Project&rdquo;. The provision of refuelling infrastructure will support greater uptake of gas vehicles while the installation of a biogas injection facility is essential to enable indigenous renewable gas to become part of Ireland&rsquo;s future transport fuel mix.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200073#WRB05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme Applications","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200073#WRB05200"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[52202\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200073#WRB05300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of applications received from County Kildare for the sports capital programme; when he expects allocations to be announced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>The 2018 round of the Sports Capital Programme opened for applications on Friday 7 September and the application period closed on Friday 19th October.

I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.   The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most. It is estimated that almost 400,000 people have died, and 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition. While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan. On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place in November.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peacebuilding. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November.<\/p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding has been provided so far this year, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $187 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which has provided more than &euro;90 million so far this year.<\/p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200075#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200075#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[51794\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200075#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on recent comments by the Advocate General to the European Court of Justice on Article 50; and his views on whether the UK could revoke its withdrawal without approval by member states.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>On 10 December, the European Court of Justice gave its judgement that the UK can revoke its Article 50 notification, unilaterally, at any point up to its withdrawal from the Union.

The Irish banks have made significant progress in this regard since the height of the crisis with NPLs at the banks in which the State has a shareholding reducing by 70% from &euro;54bn to &euro;16bn at end-June 2018. A major contributor to this has been the almost 136,000 mortgage restructures that have been put in place.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Despite this progress, the NPL ratios at the Irish banks remain at an elevated level and are well above the European average of around 4%. PTSB is a particular outlier and had a ratio of 16% even after the bank&rsquo;s loan sale &ndash; Project Glas &ndash; which was announced in July. Project Glenbeigh &ndash;\u00a0PTSB&rsquo;s second NPL transaction of 2018 announced on 29th   November, will achieve a further significant reduction in the bank&rsquo;s NPL ratio to below 10%. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the protections in place for all borrowers before a sale, either by way of securitisation or otherwise, remain unchanged. Start Mortgages, who purchased the Glas portfolio in July, and Pepper, who now hold legal title to the Glenbeigh mortgages and who will act as servicer and administrator of the mortgages, are both regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. When dealing with borrowers, these firms are required to comply with the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears. Furthermore, it has been confirmed in the case of this latest transaction that the terms of an agreed restructure will continue to be honoured.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, earlier this year I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible. The result of this review was published in October and it is encouraging to note that the key findings included confirmation that for borrowers who engaged with the process, the CCMA is working effectively as it is intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to highlight that I cannot stop loan sales, even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks, which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200075#WRD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Licence Applications","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200075#WRD03500"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[52348\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200075#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of licence applications before the Central Bank by category; the number of approvals provided in 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018, by category; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":179,"content":"<p>It was not possible for the Central Bank of Ireland to provide the information sought in the time available and, therefore, I will make arrangements to provide the Deputy with the information in line with Standing Orders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200075#WRD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200075#WRD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[52387\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200075#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the State has secondary security over moneys loaned by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to a company (details supplied) while the minority lender has a stronger fixed and floating charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>The role of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the SBCI, is to provide effective financial supports to Irish SMEs and encourage competition and innovation in the SME finance market while also ensuring the efficient and effective use of available EU resources.

The purpose of the changes was to ensure that investors paid the appropriate tax on gains arising from the disposal of loans that were secured over Irish land: namely Irish mortgages. This was achieved by treating mortgages as a separate business in respect of the PPN.<\/p><p>Prior to the 2016 changes these profits were being removed from the Irish tax net through the use of the aforementioned PPN. The 2016 amendments restricted the ability of a qualifying company to take a tax deduction for interest on a PPN where it arose from gains on Irish mortgages.<\/p><p>When the 2016 amendments were introduced, an exception was included for securitisations carried out in line with the Capital Requirement Regulation of 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (CRR). CRR requires an originator to retain an economic interest of at least 5% in assets which it subsequently sells by way of a securitisation. There are two key differences between securitisations carried out in line with CRR and the transactions which gave rise to the amendments made as part of the 2016 Finance Act.\u00a0 <\/p><p>- Securitisations are not outright sales of loans.\u00a0 <\/p><p>- Securitisations must have tranched debt. <\/p><p>This exception to the general 2016 amendment is only available:<\/p><p>- where the securitisation is being undertaken by the original lender, or<\/p><p>- where the securitisation is not by the original lender, it is by a financial institution or credit institution, regulated in the EU or EEA.<\/p><p>In relation to the taxation of the vehicle named, as I have already stated I am not in a position to comment on individual taxpayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200075#WRD06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[52474\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200075#WRD06400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the recent Central Bank loan-to-income and loan-to-value mortgage rules review by the Governor of the bank;

that sought to achieve a similar objective.\u00a0\u00a0 I understand that the &lsquo;Single Malt&rsquo; structure involves an Irish incorporated company relying on the fact it is tax resident in Malta, a country with which Ireland has a Double Taxation Convention, to prevent it from also being tax resident in Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0 Tax was ultimately avoided in certain circumstances where payments from an Irish group company to the &lsquo;Single Malt&rsquo;

NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.

The NCSE continues to establish additional special class and special school placements to support children with Special Educational Needs including Autism as required.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  From time to time, the Council identifies local areas where additional provision is required.\u00a0 In those circumstances, SENOs work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that the establishment of special provision in some schools and communities can be challenging.<\/p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Act, which commenced Monday 3rd December 2018, will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities. To this end the Department and the NCSE have convened a working group to put in place a new working protocol to ensure that there is effective pro-active planning and timely delivery of specialist educational places for students in special classes and special schools.<\/p>  <p>  The focus of the working group is to guide the development of necessary placements in schools in the short, medium and longer terms to meet the anticipated needs of pupils and to ensure that any necessary school building or refurbishment and school transport considerations are resolved as early as possible so that placement options can be accessed where and when they are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200077#WRF02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200077#WRF02800"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[52415\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200077#WRF02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to introduce a reduction in the paperwork requirement for special schools particularly the personal pupil plans when requesting one extra SNA in addition to a reasonable timeframe for a response from the NCSE in view of the fact that staff continue to deal with violent behaviour in the interim; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>The Board of Management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all\u00a0pupils and employees in their school.<\/p>  <p>  Students who\u00a0have a challenging behavioural needs should, in the first instance, be supported by teachers, other staff members and by whole school polices on the management of behaviour in schools.

Up to 6 face-to-face counselling sessions are available to provide supportive and solution-focused care based on an individual&rsquo;s clinical needs. The telephone service also provides specialist information, support and advice in relation to family, financial, legal, work-related and consumer information services as well as providing management support<\/p>  <p>  The School Authority, as employer, has a duty under Section 8 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to &ldquo;ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of his or her employees&rdquo;. The Occupational Health Service (OHS) is in place to assist the employer in carrying out this duty. The employer must therefore refer the teacher\/SNA to the OHS, for the purpose of an independent assessment, where reasonable concerns exist as to the capacity of the teacher\/SNA to undertake his\/her duties in a manner that is safe for both the teacher\/SNA and students. The OHS Provider, as contracted by the Department, is the sole recognised provider of independent medical advice for teachers\/SNAs and employers. It is a requirement of the Sick Leave Scheme that all participants and beneficiaries of that Scheme abide by the medical assessment of the OHS.  <\/p>  <p>  NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service has brought under its control the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the  National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for children who are deaf\/hard of hearing and for children who are blind\/visually impaired (VTSVHI). The Support Service provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special      educational needs, providing in-school support for teachers, continuing professional development for teachers and support to schools on the management of challenging behaviour.

The grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and travel expenses associated with researching the direction of their action plan. For example, this might involve investigating the feasibility of diversifying into new markets and market segments; investment in innovation; improvement in operational competitiveness; and\/or enhancement of strategic financial capability.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of effectiveness of the supports, a recent survey of 2,400 Enterprise Ireland clients found that 85% of them are taking Brexit-related actions.

The individual measures that are currently funded were selected for inclusion as they were deemed most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners, at least relative cost, and would thereby optimise the use of Exchequer funds while at the same time maximising the opportunities for homeowner participation.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that an increase in the use of stoves for home heating can be a cause of increased air pollution, particularly where such stoves replace cleaner, less air polluting fuels such as gas. Any increase in air pollution is a concern given its public health impacts.<\/p>  <p>  That is why installation of wood burning stoves can only be funded as part of a deeper energy efficiency upgrade &ndash; achieving an A3 Building Energy Rating - via the Deep Retrofit Programme or the Better Energy Communities scheme. Stoves installed must meet certain requirements; the specification is available on SEAI&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Energy Efficiency Obligation requires all energy suppliers above a certain threshold to work with their customers to deliver energy savings. The replacement of an open fire with a solid fuel, biomass or gas fired room heater can save homeowners money and is an eligible measure under this scheme. Some suppliers offer their customers rebates for replacing open fires in their homes. \u00a0If a customer would like to pursue this option they will need to contact their energy supplier directly or they can obtain more information from the SEAI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200080#WRJ06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":567,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200080#WRJ06900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parliamentary Questions Data","counter":566,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200080#WRJ06800"},{"type":"question","counter":567,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[52249\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200080#WRJ06900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of parliamentary questions his Department has processed in the past three years to date; the number of questions answered directly; the number of questions referred to bodies or agencies under the aegis of his Department for direct reply; the number of staff who are assigned to his parliamentary questions section; and if non-departmental staff, advisers and-or public affairs and relations companies have composed parliamentary question replies or had an act or hand in forming parliamentary question replies in the timeframe specified.","asker":"1226","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":568,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is voluminous in nature and will take time to collate.

Sport Ireland and the IABA are\u00a0continuing\u00a0to\u00a0work collaboratively in preparing our Irish boxers for\u00a0Tokyo 2020\u00a0and\u00a0I will continue to monitor this situation\u00a0closely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200081#WRK02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1318"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Anti-Social Behaviour","counter":600,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200081#WRK02900"},{"type":"question","counter":601,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[52391\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200081#WRK03000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of anti-social behaviour incidents that have been reported on Luas lines to date in 2018.","asker":"1311","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":602,"content":"<p>The safety and security of passengers and staff including arrangements to deal with anti-social behaviour on the Luas is a matter for the transport operator (Transdev) in conjunction with, as appropriate, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  I have forwarded the Deputy's question to Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), who have contracted Transdev to operate Luas, for direct reply.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200081#WRK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":603,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200081#WRK03200"},{"type":"question","counter":604,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[52453\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200081#WRK03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which his Department is making provision for the eventuality of Brexit with particular reference to its implications for air and sea travel in view of the necessity to ensure easy travel access to continental Europe for Irish persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":605,"content":"<p>Brexit and\u00a0its potential implications for Ireland are being managed on a whole-of-government basis.

The main driver in this significant increase is the growth\u00a0in overseas tourism revenue from &euro;3.6bn in 2014 to over &euro;4.9bn in 2017. All of our main overseas markets\u00a0experienced\u00a0growth over the period with North America and Mainland Europe performing particularly well.\u00a0There seems little doubt at this stage that 2018 will see further growth in revenue from overseas visitors and tourism overall.<\/p>  <p>  All parts of Ireland have seen the benefits of this growth in tourism and it is one of our largest indigenous industries and a vital employer in the regions.\u00a0 It is deeply rooted in the fabric of Irish society, with F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimating that tourism now supports approximately 260,000\u00a0jobs across the economy, compared to 205,000 in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  While the industry\u00a0has gone from strength to strength in recent years, there is always scope for development and expansion on a sustainable basis.\u00a0In terms of our tourism offering,\u00a0\u00a0the main areas with very strong potential for future development and expansion are Attractions, Activities, Festivals and Business Tourism. \u00a0F&aacute;ilte Ireland is focussing its efforts on two key areas - &lsquo;Experience Development&rsquo; and the promotion of its brands of scale and singularity &ndash; Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East, Dublin, its newest brand Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands and Meet in Ireland &ndash; the business tourism brand. These brands are designed to differentiate Ireland in a very competitive international marketplace.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland undertakes marketing campaigns in more than 20 overseas markets with priority markets being Mainland Europe, North America, Britain and fast-growing Emerging Markets such as China.\u00a0It has recently carried out strategic\u00a0market reviews in conjunction with island of Ireland industry partners and sister agencies, for the Emerging Markets, USA and Germany. I have allocated increased funding to the agency in 2019 to commence implementation of these market strategies. This will help us to continue to grow overseas tourism in a targeted manner\u00a0over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, therefore, the tourism sector is well placed for further development. I will shortly publish a Tourism Action Plan for the period 2019-2021 which will set out a \u00a0number of actions to enable the sector to grow in a sustainable manner, with a particular emphasis on regional performance and seasonality, which will result in further job creation in all parts of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200081#WRK05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":622,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200081#WRK05100"},{"type":"question","counter":623,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[52459\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121200081#WRK05200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which bus and rail services are fully utilised and are in fact tailored to meet the requirements of the travelling or commuting public with particular reference to the need to ensure that the services are convenient to passenger requirements thereby enhancing viability and efficiency;
