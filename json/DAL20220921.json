This issue is not unique to anyone's constituency, but I hope to hear from the Minister of State what I can tell my constituents when they ring my office.  I will provide an example and call the woman involved \"Mary\". That is not her real name, but I am sure she does not want her name used.  Mary has multiple sclerosis and lives in Swords.  Last June, she needed to attend a dentist.  She is a medical card holder and she tried every dentist in her local area, but none of them was taking on new patients and some of them that she had previously attended had since pulled out of the scheme.  The story will be similar up and down the State.  She rang the HSE and, happy days, it gave her the number of a dentist a small bit outside her area.  Remember, this is a woman with a significant and ongoing condition, but she said it was great anyway and she would ring the dentist.  My constituency is the largest in Dublin in terms of population as well as geography, but according to the HSE, there is only one dentist in the whole of north County Dublin taking patients with medical cards.  Surprise surprise, but he was full and was not taking on any more patients.<\/p>  <p>  From time to time, I advise my constituents to try to attend the Dental Hospital, but that is not really an option.  In the interim, routine care is being missed out on.  It is not unique to my area, but we have ended up in a situation where our level of extractions is among the highest in Europe.  That is because people cannot access dentists before the point where they are up all night with a toothache.  I am someone who hates the dentist.  Even though I know I should not, I wait until I am up all night with a toothache before going to one.  For people who are trying to be proactive about their dental health, there is nothing available.<\/p>  <p>  I want to hear from the Minister of State what I can tell my constituents.  I understand that negotiations are ongoing with the Irish Dental Association, but what should someone who needs to see a dentist do in the meantime?  I will not go through everything, given that the Minister of State will have heard it all in her own area.  What can we tell people who need to access dental treatment but who do not have the necessary means?  In some of the newer - I will not say \"swankier\" - dental practices that are chains, the first thing that people see when they walk in are large signs telling them that there are payment plans.  We are in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis and people cannot afford to get their teeth done.  They certainly cannot afford to be getting themselves into debt, but they are now at the stage where they have no choice.  Getting a loan to have their teeth done and another loan to get them done again is not a feasible option for people on fixed incomes.  They have been granted the medical card for a reason, that being, they need it.<\/p>  <p>  I am at my wits' end.  When people come to see me, I tell them that I will raise the issue, and I have done so.  I have asked a number of parliamentary questions, which the Minister of State will know, as has my colleague, Deputy Cullinane.  We have brought the issue to the Government's attention.  What should I say to my constituents when they tell me that they are in pain and cannot afford to see a dentist or wait to attend the Dental Hospital?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100003#A00500","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1663747920,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of access to dental treatment for medical card holders.  She is right, and there is nothing she has said with which I could disagree.  It is the same in every constituency office and the situation is difficult the length and breadth of the country, more so in some areas than others.  Swords in north County Dublin has a large population.<\/p><p>I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  Dental treatment for medical card holders aged 16 years and over is provided under the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS.  Services available annually have included an examination, two fillings and emergency extractions.  Deputy O'Reilly is right, in that some of us - it might be because of our age - find it difficult to face going to a dentist and we leave it too long whereas others are proactive and go every six months for scaling and polishing, at which point problems they might have show up.  More complex care and a broader range of treatments for patients with special needs and high-risk patients is also provided, some of which requires prior approval.<\/p><p>The Government has been concerned for some time that medical card patients in some parts of the country have been experiencing problems in accessing dental services.To help address the issue, the Minister secured an additional &euro;10 million in budget 2022 to provide for expanded dental health care for medical card holders, including the reintroduction of scale and polish.  To address the concerns of contractors about the scheme, by whom I mean the dentists who deliver it, the Minister is using an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year's Estimate allocation to award fee increases across a number of items, including fillings.  The combination of these two measures represents an estimated total additional investment of &euro;26 million in the scheme over and above its &euro;40 million spend in 2021.  Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, these new measures came into effect on 1 May.  The Minister hopes that this significant additional investment in the scheme will attract more dentists to treat medical card patients.<\/p><p>One of the questions that has to be addressed is that of why so many dentists do not want to participate in the scheme and are leaving it.  I believe that 42% of people have a medical card or doctor-only card.  That is two in every five people who may need to access a dentist using a medical card.  This can cause difficulties if you are in pain and cannot access a dentist.  The number of patients being seen and the numbers of treatments being provided under the DTSS have started to increase in recent months.  Patients are also accessing the reintroduced preventative scale and polish, which is a positive development.<\/p> <p>Reintroduction of the scale and polish is in line with the preventative ethos of the national oral health policy, Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte.  I have been assured by the HSE that the local services on the ground will assist any persons who are still experiencing problems in accessing a service.  I take on board the experience of Deputy O'Reilly's constituent who we called \"Mary\".  It can be quite difficult for some people who do not have transport.<\/p> <p> The Minister is aware that contractors are looking for more substantive reform of the dental treatment services scheme in the longer term.  This concern is recognised.   It is the Minister's intention that this is addressed in the context of the implementation of the national oral health policy, Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, which sets out a body of substantial reforms of dental services.  Work is under way within the Department of Health to design a Government framework to oversee and facilitate root and branch reform.<\/p> <p> To answer the Deputy's question, an extra &euro;26 million has been provided this year on top of the original budget spend.  Slowly but surely, we are seeing increases in the number of people being treated.  However, I accept that it is slow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100003#A00600","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663748520,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I will highlight one of the sentences in her reply:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI have been assured by the HSE that the local services on the ground will assist any persons who are still experiencing problems in accessing a service. <\/blockquote>  <p>I refer the Minister of State back to the direct experience of the woman to whom I spoke.  She said she contacted the HSE about the dentist and the medical card issue and was told there was only one dentist in Balbriggan.  That was the extent of the service.  The Minister of State said the HSE assured her that &quot;local services on the ground will assist&quot;, but they directed this woman to a dentist only for her to find, notwithstanding the difficulties in getting there, and she was going to go, that the dentist is not taking on any new patients.  That was the extent of the help.  Is it possible that in each of our local areas we might have a telephone number or nominated person?  I do not want someone's name; I am just talking about a telephone number.  We do not want to be torturing someone; I get that.  That could be co-ordinated.  If the Minister of State is correct when she says that more dentists are going to come on stream - I have no reason to dispute it - that information needs to be in the HSE.  There needs to be a person whom people like Mary can contact directly.  The HSE assured the Minister of State that local people are helping.  I mean no disrespect to the people in the HSE who are working hard when I say they are not helping.  It is no help to Mary be told to go to a dentist in Balbriggan, which will be tough for her to get to - that is grand; she will do that - when that dentist is not taking on any patients.  The difficulty is when a person makes all the telephone calls.  I spoke to someone who rang 29 dentists in one day and was told &quot;No&quot; every single time.  This person was waiting and thinking that the dentist she previously attended was going to reopen.  She rang continuously and then eventually snapped, as one would do.  She made all of those telephone calls in one day and got a &quot;No&quot; every single time.  Where can I direct people in my constituency to get the help that the HSE assured the Minister of State they will be given?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100004#B00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1663748520,"counter":13,"content":"<p>As I mentioned, additional funding has been provided to resolve the current problems with accessing the dental treatment services scheme.  The preventive scale and polish, which has been reintroduced, is being accessed by patients.  However, the Minister and the Government recognise that the current model of provision of oral healthcare is in need of fundamental reform.  I think we all agree on that.  The Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte oral health policy provides the guiding principles aligned with Sl&aacute;intecare.  It will support the provision of all levels of care and has two goals, which are to provide the supports to enable each individual to achieve his or her personal best oral health and to reduce oral health inequalities across the population.  That is what we are really talking about today by enabling vulnerable groups to access oral healthcare and improve their oral health.<\/p>  <p>  I have taken on board everything the Deputy said.  I had a case where I was contacted by somebody in a direct provision centre in Carrick-on-Suir, which is not in my constituency but is only a few miles down the road.  Again, I was able to go through the HSE and refer her on.  It did take a few days, however, and the person was in a lot of pain.  I accept and acknowledge that.<\/p>  <p>  I am hopeful about the extra funding of &euro;26 million that has been provided this year on top of the funding that was already there.  We are seeing slowly but surely that some people are coming back.  I am also hearing on the ground that if a person goes to a dentist privately, the waiting lists have gotten longer than they were previously.  I do not know whether that is a challenge with regard to the number of dentists we have in the country.  I know from personal experience that a member of my own family had to wait four weeks for a routine check-up, which was not the case previously.  It is certainly something that is very much on the Minister's agenda.  It is on all of our agendas because we are coping with it every day of the week.  I thank the Deputy very much for her question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100004#B00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","time":1663748520,"counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100004#B00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1663748520,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I am very grateful to the Minister of State for coming in to take this really important debate early this morning.  This is an issue that Deputy Cathal Crowe, who is in the Chamber, has raised a number of times under Questions on Promised Legislation, as have Deputies from all sides of the House.  As the Minister of State can appreciate, it is something that is particularly close to home for me because I have kids in this age bracket but also because my wife works as a Montessori teacher.  I do not know if that is a declaration of interest or whatever but it frames the context of my contribution.<\/p>  <p>  The concern I have is that this new funding scheme was rightfully announced last week with a bit of fanfare from the Minister.  I really welcome it.  This is the key opportunity for the Government to introduce a scheme that will bring down the cost of childcare for parents and increase the level of availability for parents and guardians, but also ensure that providers can earn a good living and pay their staff a good wage.  I welcome the decision by the Workplace Relations Commission the other day.  The scheme will ensure providers can run a viable business that serves a vital cohort in the community, not just the young children themselves and their parents, guardians and grandparents, but also employers who are desperate to ensure that parents can return to work when they can and when they are ready.<\/p>  <p>  However, the sad fact of the matter is that 90% of providers have taken this up but there is an absolute geographic split.  In my constituency where I am from in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area of Dublin, it is only an 81% take-up.  It is in the 80% bracket across the Dublin city and county region.  It is the same when one goes to Cork city and county.  There is an imbalance where we have some counties in which pretty much all the providers have bought into it but in others, providers have just said they simply cannot afford to go into this scheme based on the core funding model the Department currently has at hand.  I am extremely worried that the core funding model is based on an interest rate calculation that is quite simply outdated at this stage.  It also does not bear in mind the very significant additional costs that providers, particularly those based in Dublin, will have that are at a different rate from those encountered by people across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue is that when we look at the rising inflation generally in society, we must also look at the rising fixed costs that all these schools have.  They need light and heat.  They cannot afford to turn off the heat when they have three-year-olds and four-year-olds in a classroom for three or four hours per day.  They cannot afford to dim the lights when they are trying to ensure that kids at the most vulnerable age are catered to.  Therefore, we have a situation where 500 providers have sent their concerns to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and they have not received the level of engagement they are rightfully entitled to expect.  At this stage, I would really appreciate if the Minister of State could bring this matter back to the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and all her wider colleagues.  I know she has a particular interest in this.  We have to see the key areas the Government needs to address to bring these providers onside.  We need to get these providers inside the tent in order to provide the service to parents, children and the wider society.  These providers want to sign up to a scheme but they need to sign up to a scheme that is fair.  We already have hundreds of providers who have signed up simply because they feel they have no choice, even though they know they might be in a situation where they will lose money in providing this important service that is, of course, also a business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100004#B00500","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1663748520,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Richmond for raising this really important issue and offering the opportunity to respond.  The biggest issue anybody with young children will deal with is trying to make sure they are well cared for and looked after before and after school.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 September, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth launched Together for Better, which is the new funding model for early learning and childcare.  Together for Better is underpinned by an expert group report entitled Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare.  This new funding model will support delivery of early learning and care, and school-age childcare, for the public good and in the interests of quality and affordability for children, parents and families.<\/p>  <p>  Together for Better brings together three major elements of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme including the access and inclusion model, the national childcare scheme and core funding in line with the employment regulation orders that are coming into effect.  The Minister is very pleased that so far, 90% of early learning and childcare providers, or almost 5,000 services, have become partner services under core funding, committing to working in partnership with the State for the public good and to freeze one-parent fees at September 2021 rates.<\/p> <p>Core funding is the new funding stream worth &euro;221 million in full-year costs to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers.  Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole, which everyone welcomes, and to improve affordability for parents while ensuring a stable income for providers.  Core funding allows for an estimated 19% increase in the total cost base for the sector.  The vast majority of services will see substantial increases in funding.  No service will see a decrease in funding.  Together for Better, the new funding model being implemented, aims to transform the sector with a higher degree of public investment and public management.  This transformation starts with core funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers.  Core funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding, including financial transparency and fee management.<br\/><br\/>Some providers take the view that the autonomy of their business is of greater value to them than committing to offering services under the conditions and investment levels on offer through core funding, the early childhood care and education programme and the national childcare scheme.  To address the nub of the Deputy's point, participation in core funding is, of course, optional.  The 90% participation rate countrywide currently ranges from 82% uptake in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown to 100% uptake in County Leitrim.  A total of 947 providers across Dublin as a whole have signed up to core funding, representing 85% of eligible services.  The remaining 165 services may choose to sign up at a later point.<br\/><br\/>One of the questions asked by the Deputy was whether small services would lose out.  Core funding is based on operating hours, the number of places offered by services and the age group of children for whom the places are offered, given the staffing requirements determined by the regulatory ratios for different care categories.  Service opening hours offering more places will receive a higher value of core funding than other services.  This is because their costs of operation are higher.  The ECCE preschool scheme is 15 hours per week over 38 weeks of the year.  This amounts to 570 hours per year and is equivalent to 23% of the annual hours of a full-day service operating from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. for 50 weeks of the year.<br\/><br\/>I will, however, take on board the issues the Deputy outlined.  I will take them back to the Minister, especially those relating to engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100004#B00600","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663749120,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister of State's reply but a couple of things stand out.  Some 165 services in Dublin have not signed up to this scheme.  Last year, a survey conducted by the Federation of Early Childhood Providers showed that 260 providers that have signed up to this scheme did not know whether they would be able to open their doors this autumn.  A number of services that are not included, and to which there is no reference, have signed up to this scheme somewhat under duress.  They have no other choice.  They know what the wider societal benefits are.  However, they believe their concerns are simply not being listened to.<\/p>  <p>  I heard a previous response from the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, indicating that he would encourage providers to contact their local county childcare scheme.  That is a slap in the face.  We need real engagement.  We need the Minister to sit down with the providers that have not signed up to this scheme, or that have signed up but are extremely worried they will not be able to keep the lights on.  Some 165 service providers have not signed up for this year.  What happens if the 260 providers that believe they are at risk go bust next year?  What happens if more providers realise this scheme will not work for them, particularly in Dublin?  The Minister said that 100% of providers had signed up in Leitrim.  That is great in Leitrim but just 81% have signed up in my constituency.  This is at a time when people are dying to get children into these places in order that they can access the workplace and we can fill critical jobs, bearing in mind we have a labour shortage in the wider society and people want to give their children the best choice.  People do not want to be saddled with the second mortgage that is childcare costs and then find themselves having to drive 25 to 30 minutes out of their way in the morning, and drive another hour back to the workplace, paying all the additional extras that come with breakfast clubs and after-school care.<\/p>  <p>  I plead with the Minister of State to bring it back to the Minister that there has to be a level of genuine engagement.  There should no longer be warm words.  Until the Minister can provide a system that will ensure these services are not under financial threat, we will not be able to provide proper facility for all in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100005#C00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1663749120,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I listened intently to what the Deputy said.  The one thing we have to consider is that this is a voluntary scheme.  Some 90% of providers overall have signed up to it but, as the Deputy said, it varies from 81% in some areas to 100% in others.  There are positives here in that there is a total annual budget of &euro;221 million to support the childcare sector.  This includes &euro;138 million to support staffing costs and improve pay and conditions; &euro;25 million to support administration, incorporating the old programme support payment budget of &euro;19.4 million; &euro;20 million to reflect increases in non-staff overheads; and &euro;38 million to support the employment of graduates.  These are the key determinants of delivery costs.  Capacity does not change from week to week, which provides income certainty for the providers.<\/p>  <p>  What also has to be looked at in respect of the inflationary impacts is that the total funding package for core funding, an allocation of &euro;20 million, is included to contribute to non-staff overhead costs.  An additional &euro;25 million is also available for administrative costs, which was not there previously.  Some of the providers have welcomed this.  I have spoken to many providers in my area.  Some were apprehensive about signing up but I am very hopeful that more providers will join once the scheme is up and running.

It is the only report of its type I am aware of in Ireland at present.  It was commissioned by Clare Public Participation Network, PPN.  I acknowledge the presence of Ms Sarah Clancy from Clare PPN, who is in the Public Gallery.  A significant effort went into this report.

In Clare at present, there are approximately 2,800 people on our housing list.

Some are sleeping on couches and some are living in housing assistance payment accommodation but all desire a home for their families.  I am sure many Deputies have looked at a website,<i>insideairbnb.com<\/i>, over the years.  It drills down into the information on rooms and houses available on Airbnb every day of the year.  As of today, there are 1,483 accommodation units available in County Clare on Airbnb.  We have 1,300 people without homes in County Clare today.  There is something systematically wrong when we have an adequate housing stock to put roofs over their heads, but we have some barrier preventing that from happening.

The report points out key failures at national and local level in measuring poverty and, as the saying goes, what you cannot measure, you cannot address.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key findings in the report is around housing, where the researcher drew upon data from the 2022 census.  It states there are 58,148 dwellings of which 47,867 are occupied.<\/p> <p>Some 4,912 are unoccupied holiday homes, and a further 5369 are vacant dwellings.  Therefore, there are 10,281 unoccupied dwellings in County Clare, giving a vacancy rate of 17.68%.  Another key finding relates to health.  There is a glaring shortage of both dentists and GPs, the provision of which is well below the national average.  In the case of dentists, County Clare has less than 50% of the national average.  In respect of GPs, a figure of 33% below the national average was recorded.  The report is clear on the lack of available data at the level of the State, local government and other relevant agencies to measure child or fuel poverty in County Clare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100005#C00500","speaker":"1517","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663749720,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Teachta&iacute; Crowe agus Carey.  On behalf of the Government, I welcome the report to which the Deputies have referred, Towards an Anti-Poverty Strategy for Clare, which was published by the Clare PPN.  Indeed, I welcome the representatives of the network who are here today.  We know that the voice of lived experience is essential for good policy and good decision-making.  Democracy is made stronger by allowing diverse views and interests to be considered as part of the decision-making process of local government.  It is important that we hear from those groups who are socially excluded and whose voices may not be heard in our society.  Therefore, this work of the Clare PPN is extremely important.<\/p><p>Addressing poverty continues to be a key priority for the Government.  The Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 was published in January 2020.  The primary ambition of the roadmap is to &quot;reduce consistent poverty to 2% or less and to make Ireland one of the most socially inclusive countries in the EU.&quot;  The roadmap translates this ambition into seven goals underpinned by 66 unique commitments that will help to deliver these goals.  It is a whole-of-government strategy with a five-year timeframe and includes a mid-term review in 2022 to facilitate an evaluation of the impact of roadmap commitments.  The social inclusion roadmap steering group, which monitors the implementation of the roadmap, has met seven times to date.<\/p><p>The most recent poverty data are from the 2021 survey on income and living conditions, which was published by the Central Statistics Office on 6 May 2022.  There were welcome reductions in all three national rates for the key poverty indicators.  Consistent poverty decreased from 4.7% to 4%, the at-risk-of-poverty rate decreased from 13.2% to 11.6% and the deprivation rate decreased from 14.3% to 13.8%.  Notably, the statistics reflected the positive impact of Covid supports.  Without the pandemic income supports, the at-risk-of-poverty rate would have been 19.9%.<\/p><p>While I am pleased to see these improvements across the key poverty indicators, I am keenly aware of the higher levels of poverty for certain groups, such as people with disabilities and lone parents.  The continued implementation of commitments outlined in the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 will contribute to a reduction in poverty.  One of the issues that is apparent from the work undertaken by Clare PPN is the challenge presented by not having official statistics available at a local area level.  In this regard, mechanisms such as the PPNs provide opportunities to listen to key issues at a local level.  I am aware that the Department of Social Protection each year hosts a social inclusion forum, where representative groups and individuals from around the country highlight the key poverty-related issues from their own perspectives.  In preparing for this forum, the Department contracts the European Anti-Poverty Network and Community Work Ireland to run regional workshops to ensure the lived experience of people from different backgrounds across the country is fed into the consideration and discussion at the social inclusion forum.  These engagements and important contributions from the PPNs help to inform the Government's approach to tackling poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100006#D00200","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1663749720,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Insightful as this report is, it becomes futile unless there is a strategy to respond to poverty in County Clare.  That is the very thing Clare PPN and our partners are looking for.  We have a Clare county development plan that contains headings on housing, retail and wind energy, but there is no heading dealing with poverty.  Currently, that plan is under review.  We need a heading and a strategy on poverty.  The representatives of Clare PPN cannot speak from the Public Gallery today, but if they could they would shout out that there is no data set, particularly where childhood poverty is concerned.  It is true that we collect data in the census, but census figures sometimes take five or six years to trickle down.  A child who is measured as being in a home of a certain income level may have left childhood by the time they are accounted and factored for within Government strategy.  It is particularly concerning that we are 33% down on GP service requirements and 50% down on dental service requirements in County Clare.  That is how far we need to go to catch up with the national average, which itself is not good.  It is something that I believe the Government and the HSE need to deal with.  There is a whole lot more to be done to deal with the marginalisation of Travellers, mental health and pathways to education and jobs.  We need a strategy.  I think the Clare county development plan is the vehicle for that.

It is clear that the rural practice allowance that is there is just not adequate.  These issues need to be teased out and resources and policy changes need to be introduced.  I am proposing that the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, who attended the launch of the report yesterday, arranges to engage directly Clare PPN, and that a cross-departmental working group is established, led by the Department of Social Protection,  which includes officials from other Departments such as the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage; the Department of Children.

It is the case in Ireland that social protection budgets over the past number of years have prioritised the introduction of measures that have had and will continue to have a direct and positive impact on poverty in the entire country, and including those who are living in County Clare.  I know the Deputies have supported this.  We have increased the weekly child-related payments, including the introduction of a higher rate of payment for older children in 2019.  There have been increases in the working family payment thresholds and improvements in the means-testing of payments for lone parents.  We have increased the living alone allowance rate, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and the weekly rates of payment for all schemes in social welfare.  We have expanded the hot school meals programme to include an additional 310 schools, which will cover around 60,000 children.  This is very much to be welcomed.  We have extended the national childcare scheme universal subsidy to all children up to the age of 15.  The parent benefit has also been extended.  Other recent cost-of-living measures include a fuel allowance payment of &euro;125 paid in March 2022, with an additional payment of &euro;100 in May 2022; and an increase of &euro;100 in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  Further measures will be introduced next week in the budget.  We are acutely conscious that people are struggling at the moment as a result of the cost-of-living crisis.  The Government is keenly aware of this and is working very hard to make sure we can get best possible response to people in dealing with the issues that have been raised by the Clare PPN.  The Deputies should be under no doubt that the contents of the report and the contributions of the Deputies today inform the work of the Department and the Government, particularly in the run-up to the budget next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100006#D00500","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services","time":1663749720,"counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100006#D00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1663749720,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as an &aacute;bhar seo a phiocadh.

I know that I do not need to translate the Irish for the Minister of State.  He has heard it.  However, I need to emphasise what has happened here.<\/p> <p>The Inis O&iacute;rr notice was lifted just yesterday.  It is very difficult to understand what happened regarding Inisbofin.  <\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to clarify the sequence of events and dates.  When did Uisce &Eacute;ireann become aware that there was problem?  What was the nature of that problem and why could the system not deal with it?  Are the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the HSE involved?  This is an island that, like all of us, is utterly dependent on water, the most basic ingredient for life.  The islanders were told on 25 August by Irish Water to boil their water.  A boil water notice was issued to the 156 customers but no explanation was given as to why or what was wrong but a map was included.  On 2 September, they were told that the boil water notice remains in place as there was a deterioration in the quality of the water because the raw water in the adjacent lakes had deteriorated due to low levels and so on.  In the interests of brevity, I will not go into all of the details but the main point is that residents were again told to boil their water at that stage.  Fast forward to 3 September and residents are told that the boil water notice is now a \"Do not consume\" notice, with no explanation given.  I have no idea whether the doctors and nurses were told.  I do not know how anyone was told except through Radio na Gaeltachta and the local news.  That situation continues on Inishbofin today.  When did it start?  The date I have is 25 August but I understand it started earlier than that.  <\/p> <p> Similarly, Ceantar Cois Fharraige is without water.  More than 5,000 people are effected and no explanation has been given.  What has emerged is that the level of manganese is too high and the figure that has been quoted is 250 mg as opposed to 120 mg.  How did this happen?  What is wrong with the system?  When will it be put right?  I want the maximum volume of information to be given out so that we can have trust in the system.  As an elected representative, I have no trust in the system.  My trust was seriously challenged by the cryptosporidium issue in Galway and now we are back with the same lack of trust.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100006#D00800","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663750320,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Teachta Connolly as an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id na D&aacute;la.

This is a serious issue and I share her concern for the communities of An Spid&eacute;al, Inishbofin and Inis O&iacute;rr that have been affected by the recent &quot;Do not consume&quot; notices.  The Deputy has set out a lot of the facts.  Unfortunately  I do not have the full information she is seeking today but I will go back to the Department and Irish Water and ask that it be provided to her as a matter of urgency.  <\/p><p>Irish Water has had statutory responsibility since 1 January 2014 for all aspects of water services at national, regional and local level and the EPA is responsible for quality standards.  The Department has made inquiries of Irish Water and the information that I have is that a &quot;Do not consume&quot; notice for Inishbofin public water supply was issued on 10 September due to elevated levels of manganese.  Shortly afterwards on 16 September 2022, &quot;Do not consume&quot; notices for An Spid&eacute;al public water supply and Inis O&iacute;rr public water supply were issued, also due to elevated levels of manganese.These notices were issued following consultation between Irish Water; Galway County Council, which operates these water treatment plants for Irish Water, and the HSE.  These notices are necessary to protect approximately 5,676 customers - I do not like that word and prefer either citizens, residents, or drinkers of water - supplied by An Spid&eacute;al public water supply, 156 people supplied by Inishbofin public water supply and 257 people supplied by Inis O&iacute;rr public water supply.<\/p><p>I am pleased to report, as the Deputy Connolly said, that the &quot;Do not consume&quot; notice was lifted for Inis O&iacute;rr yesterday.  Irish Water and the local authority and HSE water liaison group will continue to meet to review the ongoing process control, monitoring and testing of the drinking water supply.  Irish Water drinking water compliance and operational experts are working with Galway County Council to resolve the situations in An Spid&eacute;al and Inishbofin as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Alternative water supplies in the form of bulk tankers have been arranged.  Nobody likes bulk tankers but in the context of what is going on, they are needed.  They have been arranged for the people in the affected areas and are in place at a number of locations around An Spid&eacute;al and Inishbofin.  These alternative water supplies are being replenished on a daily basis.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's priority is to ensure that people's health is protected and that adequate water is available for all consumers.  We all want to see this notice lifted without undue delay, but only when the HSE and EPA are satisfied.<\/p><p>The Government is making substantial investments in our water system to bring the services and systems up to the quality and resilience standards required.  I am glad that this issue was spotted through the testing and quality control work that is ongoing because it is obviously a very serious problem.  In budget 2022 the Minister secured funding of more than &euro;1.57 billion to support water services.  This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in public water and wastewater services right across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100007#E00200","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1663750320,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and certainly agree with him regarding the word \"customer\".<\/p>  <p>  This situation puts into acute focus the result of the Government's decision to put water under Uisce &Eacute;ireann.

That part is now missing.  In addition, what is missing is any oversight by a Department that has allowed this answer to be issued.  I understand the difficulties of the Minister of State in reading this out.  <\/p>  <p>  Since August, there has been a problem on Inishbofin.  Islanders were told they could consume water once they boiled it but then they were told not to boil it, that the water was not fit for consumption.  The Minister of State made reference to 10 September but that date is wrong in terms of when they were told on Inishbofin.  They were told way back in August and then they were told again at the beginning of September.  Then the notice changed and they are still in difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of all three areas what I would like to know, and what should be contained in the Minister of State's response, is how the problem arose.

What is the connection?  What has Uisce &Eacute;ireann done?  What is the involvement of the EPA?  What is wrong that they do not see the need to tell, at the very least, the GPs and the nurses in the area and to distribute newsletters to houses?

as a direct consequence of haywire Government-induced energy policies, Ireland is the worst-prepared country in Europe for an energy crisis, and the possibility of rolling blackouts this winter would not only be catastrophic but is a very real prospect;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the lack of a coherent Government energy policy to provide energy self-sufficiency means the real threat of a cold, dark winter is now becoming a reality, resulting in a full-blown political and economic crisis;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government's energy policy position also means Ireland is one of the most energy import-dependent countries in Europe, with zero storage capabilities and almost complete reliance on one United Kingdom (UK) pipeline for our gas;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the European Union (EU) concluded that Ireland having gas interconnection with Scotland did not provide the level of energy security required; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government's energy policy position puts Ireland in an extremely vulnerable and utterly unsustainable position, undermining our national and energy security;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Brexit adds to the uncertainty and risk as the UK is no longer legally bound by any measure, including the solidarity principle in the 2020 agreement regulation, to provide us with supplies, thus significantly increasing Ireland's gas supply vulnerabilities;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; despite this perilous position, the Government's lack of any strategic plan means that the cost of energy here is much higher than it should be, with no guarantee that the lights will stay on this winter or in subsequent winters;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government's lack of action means Ireland is drifting towards a permanent and extremely severe energy crisis and insecurity, which could have catastrophic economic outcomes for the country;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the failure to have published the promised energy security review contained in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future in June 2020 highlights a complete lack of urgency by the Government to the ongoing and evolving energy crisis;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Ireland simply cannot become a green economy overnight, when 87 per cent of our total energy supply still comes from fossil fuels and oil and gas will be required for decades to come;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Ireland currently imports 100 per cent of our oil needs and over 70 per cent of our gas needs (interconnectors from Scotland to Ireland), with gas imports rising steadily in line with production declines at the Corrib gas field;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Ireland's dependence on gas imports has risen sharply from 33 per cent in 2017 to 72 per cent in 2021;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the lack of energy security is resulting in the cost of Ireland's annual net fuel imports (oil and gas) surging towards &euro;10 billion (it was just over &euro;3 billion a year ago), which represents a significant reduction in our national welfare, which can only be eliminated if prices fall or the Government changes policy and allows for domestic energy production, which includes fossil fuel sources;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; importing the necessary oil and gas will not only create a much larger carbon footprint but it will also be costlier and leave us extremely vulnerable to supply and price shocks, while the monetary cost of importing oil represents a net loss to the Irish economy and the Exchequer; <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <blockquote> \tfurther notes that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; Ireland has no gas storage capacity, as a consequence of Government policy;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Southwest Kinsale gas field is now depleted, with the Government not pursuing the option to utilise it as a strategic gas store facility;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; while the German, Austrian and other EU governments are busily filling their gas storage capacity Ireland, at the very end of the gas grid, is hamstrung by a Government with no plan; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; Germany is now re-opening coal-burning power stations to provide a practical buffer to the energy crisis;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Ireland is the only country in Europe with a coastline that does not have a liquid natural gas import facility, meaning no alternative to the pipelines through the UK, as the Government chose not to have liquefied natural gas (LNG);<br \/><br \/>&mdash; this unprecedented energy crisis is compounded by the Government's policy position on energy, which is imprisoned by the single-lane and oftentimes narrow ideological position of the Green Party;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government's narrow ideological energy policy means closing our own national resource supply of oil and gas, meaning we must import from anywhere that will supply us, at whatever price is dictated by exporters;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government failed to apply for a European Commission funding initiative to source temporary floating LNG terminals as part of an effort to diversify fuel supplies amid the ongoing energy crisis, while nineteen other EU governments, including Germany and the Netherlands, availed of this funding source;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government's abject failure to apply for this key European Commission REPowerEU funding programme, before the April deadline (phase one), aimed at ensuring continuity of energy supply and providing states with an insurance policy in case of supply disruptions from the UK, borders on reckless and dysfunctional;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; countries that have already applied for the European Commission's REPowerEU funding programme will be better positioned than Ireland to produce energy at lower prices, resulting in cheaper energy for manufacturing industries, small businesses, farmers and households;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; there is no justifiable case for not developing our available oil and gas resources, and there is certainly no justifiable reason for this Government to stand over a current policy that adds to our carbon footprint, by importing gas from places like Qatar, which creates fourteen times the carbon footprint of using and developing the Corrib and Barryroe oil and gas resources; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the hypocrisy-laden Government energy policy, which turns a blind eye to importing from polluting dictators, is affecting the nation's energy security and leaving Irish consumers to pay more than anyone else; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the purely politically-induced ban on Irish oil and gas represents a false narrative, as it generates a greater carbon footprint and ensures all Irish people pay more for electricity, gas, home heating oil, petrol and diesel and is seriously adding to our cost-of-living burden while being devoid of any scientific or economic rationale; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the only practical solution is to re-open access to new supplies off our coast; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the current policy being pursued by this Government is leaving Ireland open to any and all international events of the future, which are well outside of our control, and exposes not only households but our entire economy to price hikes that are completely outside of this country's control; and <\/blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> \t&mdash; immediately prioritise safeguarding our economy and society from the unfolding catastrophic energy crisis rather than blindly adhering to climate change goals that were set in a very different political and economic era;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; suspend the unachievable fixed carbon budgeting legislation to prevent Ireland from entering a looming economic catastrophe; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; be honest, coherent and take urgent action that is based on the realities we face, which means everything must be on the table, including more gas infrastructure, such as storage terminals and exploration of domestic oil and gas;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; end the constant pathetic lecturing of the public to end turf-cutting, putting lettuce in window boxes, car sharing or shortening our morning showers and do something tangible to provide energy security for Ireland;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure Ireland is equipped with the policy options of developing, as transition energy supplies, its oil and gas sources in the Celtic Sea at Barryroe, where the accepted industry reserve projections indicate 365 million barrels of equivalent oil and gas resources; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; fully acknowledge that the Lease Undertaking is urgently required to allow plans to drill an appraisal well at Barryroe to move forward; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; sanction the natural follow-on from the Barryroe SEL 1\/11 exploration licence, by providing Ministerial consent for the Lease Undertaking, since the Barryroe technical strategy is ready to be implemented within a short timeframe;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; mandate the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Eamon Ryan TD, who has twice refused to engage with either Providence Resources or the Irish Offshore Operators' Association, to meet with both organisations immediately;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; urgently put in place, without undue delay, LNG storage infrastructure to ensure energy security for the State;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; implement windfall tax levies on all energy production operations in Ireland and use the proceeds to offer households relief from crippling energy bills;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; take immediate action so that the price of electricity is decoupled from gas to ease the burden on households and businesses; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; urgently re-open to full capacity all peat-fired power stations, including the Lough Ree power plant in Lanesboro and the West Offaly Power Station in Shannonbridge which were senselessly shut down, as Ireland requires this power back-up over the next four to five years;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; implement a policy platform aimed at reducing energy bills and corporate profits, and establish a new retrofitting funding programme across the entire country, together with funding schemes for community, family, farm and small businesses to develop their own renewable energy sources;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; develop a strategic domestic energy production model, by learning from what has been achieved in, for example, Nova Scotia's tidal energy along the Atlantic, offshore wind as done in Scotland or Costa Rica's publicly-owned energy system providing almost 100 per cent renewable, low-cost energy to 99.9 per cent of its population; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; be honest and accept that continuing on the current energy path means the cost-of-living crisis in Ireland will only worsen and that when energy supplies are low admit that we are at the end of the pipeline and will likely be reduced to a trickle; and <br \/><br \/>&mdash; fully accept that the only logical route available is to detangle the current Government's mistaken energy policies and ensure the development of Barryroe oil and gas which, after all, is environmentally superior to what is being imported today and would harness the required energy security, while reducing costs for all Irish consumers.   <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>Energy is vital and integral to our democracy and way of life in Ireland.  We have taken it for granted for many years but without sustainable and competitively priced energy, we face grave danger as a society.  This Government asks us to put on the green jersey yet again and tells us to turn off the heating in the west or east wings of the estate that its Members seem to think we all live on.  It is not put on the jersey anymore; this time it is put on the green fleece and long johns.  I have been warning about the potential for this energy crisis for years.  I worried about our security of supply for gas but nothing was done apart from the Government kicking the can down the road in the hope none of its bad policies would catch up with its members before they leave office.  However, they have.<\/p><p>Why is the Government only focusing on the period to March 2023 for mitigation measures?  Will Government members think beyond their noses and advise what they plan to do beyond March?  Will we continue to wing it as we have done for a number of years?  A few years ago, I brought a proposal from an Irish-owned and controlled company, which pointed out the exact failures in our energy system that have led to this crisis.  The company still wants to help bring a world-class liquified natural gas, LNG, storage solution to Ireland in a cost-efficient manager under Irish control.  Needless to say, it has been ignored at the expense of party policies and we are now paying a high price for this.  Gas Networks Ireland may well need expertise and assistance, along with implementation of LNG infrastructure, but we have people in our country who can do this and are willing to pull on the green jersey and help out in the interests of keeping Ireland a safe and prosperous place to live.  I acknowledge the current crisis is affecting all of Europe; however, we have had plenty of time to act.  Lack of action has put us in this mess.  Let us put it right now, but in the best interests of the country.<\/p><p>The Greens offer simple solutions to complex issues and there is no basis to other solutions.  On 10 July, wind generated 1.5% of our total electricity, while gas generated 80%.  When the wind does not blow, renewables do not work.  The Greens and the Ministers constantly talk about blue hydrogen as a solution.  The Irish Academy of Engineering and other world-leading experts say it might be commercially viable in 25 years.  The programme for Government has a target of 850,000 electric cars by 2030; today, we have 50,000.  No one across the transport and energy sectors believes this to be remotely possible.<\/p><p>No one in government discusses that it would require an additional 10% electricity generation capacity to fuel these cars.  Gas provides 52% of our annual electricity and 70% of this gas is imported through two pipelines, which start from the same interconnector in Moffat, Scotland.  If anything happens to that interconnector, our country stops.  A cyberattack, terrorist attack, explosion or major technical problem would shut the country down immediately.  This vulnerability has been known within the industry for more than a decade but nothing has been done about it.  While Britain was a member of the EU, there was an EU energy security protocol whereby Britain had to treat Ireland equally in the event of a gas shortage.  That protocol no longer exists and our only fallback is the word of the British Government of the day.  In the next three to four years, the Corrib gas field will be exhausted and Ireland will be 100% dependent on Britain for gas, which originates from Norway.  This means we are handing over our energy sovereignty to Britain.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in, whose Members are not present for the debate, is against exploration for our own fossil fuels.  How can it reconcile this position when we will be handing our energy sovereignty to Britain?  We all want the transition to a zero-carbon world to happen as soon as possible.  However, it will take time and will not happen overnight.  This transition needs a long-term plan.  We must recognise that we cannot build a long-term plan unless we have a short- and medium-term plan.  The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, issued a report recently on what is required to keep increases in global temperatures to less than 1.5<sup>0<\/sup>C by 2050.  Among its findings was that in 2050 global consumption of gas will still be at 55% of today's consumption and, in the case of oil, 40%. <\/p><p>In an interview in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>on 5 September 2022, the Minister acknowledged that we need co-ordinated energy systems based on our aim to have zero carbon within 30 years, a far more realistic possibility.  Not only is our dependency on imported fossil fuels a huge and reckless national risk, it is also the largest transfer of our national wealth on a daily basis.  In 2019, the cost to the State was &euro;4 billion; this year it will be &euro;12 billion.  The annual cost per citizen is &euro;2,300.  On 7 October 2002, in the<i>Irish Examiner,<\/i>the Minister, who was then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tProfitable oil and gas fields could reap huge sums for the Exchequer.  Profitable fields will pay up to 40% in taxation to the Exchequer.  That's a top rate increase of 15% for the oil and gas companies involved.  Ireland's oil and gas is a resource of the people.  I want to ensure that our waters are fully explored and also that we get a proper return to the State. <\/blockquote>  <p>What happened there?  The Minister forgot all about this, did he not?  He warned at the time that Ireland's dependence on imported oil and gas had grown to more than 85%, stating: &quot;This reliance on imported fuels from areas of the world that are geopolitically volatile, contributes to price instability and vulnerability in Ireland.&quot;<\/p><p><i>The Irish Times <\/i>on 9 October, 2007 reported:<\/p> <blockquote> \t<font color=\"#191919\">Minister for Energy Eamon Ryan, in setting out terms for a new oil and gas exploration licensing round in the Porcupine Basin, drew attention to<\/font>that instability factor <font color=\"#191919\">and he [you] pointed to Ireland's vulnerability as an energy importer.  Ireland now imports some 85 per cent of its gas supplies and natural gas is currently used to generate almost half of the country's electricity needs<\/font>.  <\/blockquote>  <p>All of us rural Deputies have met with businesspeople from all walks of life in recent weeks.  They all tell the same stories.  Loans to help with costs of energy will not help.  How will having an energy loan help any business?  These businesses have survived Covid, are now on their knees again and are being offered loans by the Government.  Kicking the can down the road is the problem here.  Some of these businesses have received grants and will not qualify for further grants.  The devil is always in the detail.  These businesses do not have the funds to invest in solar energy.  Many tell me they will not apply for the grants because they are too complicated.<\/p><p>I met with hoteliers recently.  They told me unless drastic measures are put in place, their doors will close for the final time.  It is not just the loss of a hotel in an area but the loss of jobs, a loss to the tourist economy and a loss to Ireland. <\/p><p>Let us get to the person who is trying to heat their home and turn on the lights on a dark winter night.  We are told to put appliances on at night but apparently that is the most dangerous time to put them on.  We are told to turn off lights.  If you are 80 years of age living in Ireland on your own, you are told to turn off your lights and become even more lonely and depressed, or maybe fall over and end up in hospital, costing the State even more.  How is the regular person supposed to pay these massive energy costs?<\/p><p>The Government needs to step up and cap energy costs.  It needs to consider the LNG storage proposal.  It is a serious proposal that was given to the Minister and which he is leaving unheeded.  He needs to give the licence for Barryroe.  He talks about helping the people of Ireland but he and his Government have done nothing but torture the people of this country.  They have destroyed the island of Ireland.  This will go down in history as the worst Government that ever sat in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  That is some legacy to leave behind just so the Minister's colleagues can stay in power - pardon the pun.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100008#F00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1663750920,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the opportunity to contribute on this important topic.<\/p> <p>I have never seen so many people so angry in recent times about what is happening to them and what is being allowed to happen to them by this Government.  Electricity charges have trebled in the past 12 months.  They have gone up every day since the Lanesboro and Shannonbridge plants were closed and the Government provided no alternative at that time.  It was only when they were stuck last year, before the war, that they started buying coal from Russia and got Moneypoint up and running again.  Indeed, electricity has gone way up three times or more since the start of the year.  Many people, domestic, commercial and retail, cannot afford to pay the bills they are getting now.  This includes small shops.  I am aware of one small shop run by a man and his wife.  Their electricity bill for the two months is up to &euro;7,000 now, when it was less then &euro;2,000.  How can those people keep going?  This is what is happening.  We then hear the Taoiseach saying that he can get the money back from the electricity companies.  He can of course because he allowed this to happen all year.  The Government is a shareholder in these companies and it is getting dividends from them.  He is saying now that he will get the dividends and give them back.  It will be too late because he will not give it back directly to the people who paid it.  He will not give it back at all to more people.  You do not have to be Einstein to know that if electricity companies put up their charges by 300% they are going to have 300% profit, and that consumers will have to pay 300% more.  The Government has let this happen all through the year and has stood idly by.  Shame on the Government for allowing this to happen and to be promising that it will do something in the budget and maybe give back a couple of hundred euro here and there.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Ryan, is the man who wanted one car to service 30 people in a small village.  The Minister is not with it at all.  The Minister is not in the real world if he thinks that one car would do 30 people in rural Ireland.  The Minister wants no turf cutting.  The Minister wants no gas burners or oil fires.  At the same time the Minister has no alternative provided.  I am glad that more turf is being cut this year than for many years and at least the people who have turf secured will be warm for the winter.  I believe the Government is suggesting that the people who cut their own turf should make a contribution.  I say to the Minister that they will not make any more contribution.  They have their contributions made.  As far as they are concerned they are self-sufficient now.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Government did not give them any help to save or turn in the turf and they are not entitled to claim any dividends from the cutting or the saving of the turf.<\/p> <p> When challenged about people being cold for the winter all the Government could say to them was to open their oven doors while they are cooking and that this would warm the house.  God Almighty.  Why is the Minister insulting so many people like this by advising people to grow vegetables in boxes in south-facing windowsills?  Now the Minister and McConalogue are saying that people cannot plough or till the land.  People have been tilling the land.  It is widely recognised that even with horses and small tractors by tilling the land one will make it more fertile and need to spread less fertiliser.  The Government does not want to give people any other option only wind turbines.  Wind turbines do not blow all of the year.  There are several other types of fuel.  There is biofuel to help with road diesel and with tractor diesel.  It is the same with petrol engines.  We could use the same engines but the Government does not want to hear that.  The Government will not entertain these companies.  At the same time, a group of people from Ballymakeera were on to me in the past week.  The Firebird company workers there are worried that their factory is going to be closed.  It employs 160 people.  They said that they can add biofuel and work their boilers to take HVO fuel, which includes biofuel, and that there would be no emissions from that.  The Minister, however, does not want to listen to things like that.  The Government has the daylights frightened out of people.  Petrol cars could be converted to LPG gas but the Government does not want to hear about that.  This was done back in the day in the 1970s.  My late father had a car converted to gas.<\/p> <p> Today we are demanding no more increases in standing charges.  The Government can put legislation in place to ensure this.  We call on the Government to give back every cent of the extra money that the Government has robbed from the people and put a cap on the ESB rate to that which applied this time last year.  We call on the Government to open up Shannonbridge and Lanesboro immediately and to allow micro-energy companies to develop solar and water turbines.  Many people are already producing extra electricity and they cannot get credit for it.  Much more could be generated.  We call on the Government to bring down the extra duty and taxes on road diesel and tractor diesel.  The Government gave them back nothing.  Home heating oil and petrol must be capped at the price being charged back in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100008#F00400","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663751520,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100009#G00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1663751520,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I am asking the Minister, Deputy Ryan, again here today to open up Shannon LNG.

The Rural Independent Group has been very consistent and we have also put forward a number of solutions to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and to the Government.  We do not see any Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael Deputies flanking the Minister this morning.  They were there, however, to endorse the reckless policies and they signed off on the policies.  That must be remembered by the people.  The truth needs to be heard here and it needs to be known.<\/p>  <p>  I begin by saying that in recent reports in the last week we see that ESB profits reached &euro;390 million in the first six months of this year.  I put it to the Minister that people are struggling.  I do not think the Minister realises it or gets it.  People are really on their knees.  I have met businesspeople and farmers.  I have one such bill here with me that shows an increase from &euro;400 every two months, to &euro;1,590.78.  That is some increase for a farmer in west Offaly.  I ask the Minister to take an urgent intervention.  We know the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is not too fond of agriculture and that he would like to see the farmers driven off the land but we in the Rural Independent Group will not allow the Minister to do that.  We will not allow the Minister or his reckless Government to do such a thing and particularly when there are food security issues also.  Food security is part of the problem that the Minister's policies have created.<\/p>  <p>  Today we are speaking on energy.  As I have said, people are really struggling.  They are dreading the thoughts of the bill coming through the letter box or the inbox.  The Minister must take urgent action.  I called on the Minister personally, before the summer recess, to intervene with the ESB.  Instead of pursuing the ongoing and sustained attack on rural communities, urban communities and agriculture I asked the Minister to do his job and intervene with the ESB.  This was before those profits were known.  I asked the Minister to do that.  Has the Minister taken any action?  I would like to hear about this in the Minister's speech.  We do not want tokenistic measures such as &euro;200 thrown at people.

That will not wash.  We need urgent and meaningful actions from the Minister's Government.  The Minister's Government has been reckless. Yes, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael let the Minister, Deputy Ryan, off the rails and let him wreak havoc with his policies.<\/p>  <p>  This morning I also wish to allude to the carbon tax.  The Rural Independent Group was the only group that was strongly opposed to the carbon tax.  Again, we call for this to be scrapped immediately.  People are trying to decide whether to spend money on food or on fuel.  This is the harsh reality that the Minister needs to understand.  The Minister needs to know the facts.  It is not right.  Our hauliers are struggling to keep things going and to keep businesses going, which keeps the economy going and to which they contribute hugely.<\/p>  <p>  The issues we are dealing with are not just timely, they are of the utmost urgency.  I say this again.  The sense I am getting, which is a sense that is becoming increasingly ominous by the day, is that the country is moving at speed towards the precipice.  We are heading into the storm at a time when safe harbour rarely appeared so distant.  Perhaps it would not be so bad if we had trust and confidence in the captains of the ship of the State to steer us through this crisis and to get us safely out the other side.  This includes Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and not just the Green Party.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are part of this mess and this disaster.  The reality is that it is precisely those people who have set us upon this course of fragile energy security who are the same people tasked with steering us a safe passage.  Obviously, they have been reckless in the past, so nobody has confidence.  Despite all their rhetoric, the people at the wheel appear blind to the dangers we are facing.  They seem incapable of recognising that a sane response in the face of such a crisis would be to apply the brakes or even reverse course, especially when it is now increasingly obvious what role the Government's current green energy policy has played in bringing us to this point of danger.<\/p> <p>They would not propose, for example, in the middle of a generational crisis in home energy, the silly and nonsensical policy idea of banning oil and gas heaters.  They would not tell families, especially those with children, to limit their energy use between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., just when many kids are home from school and many parents are only in the door from work.  Is the Minister proposing that mothers and fathers get up at 5 a.m. to cook the dinner?  It would be an absolute joke if it were not so serious.<\/p> <p> The pressure that families are under, just as they emerge on the other side of a mental health crisis created by the pandemic, is simply fierce.  I note that the Minister has finally received the report he commissioned from the UK-based analyst, CEPA, and its review of Ireland's energy security.  From replies to parliamentary questions I have submitted on this matter, we know the report has cost at least &euro;170,000.  The consultants need to have no worry about paying their bills if that is the case.  We told the Minister there would be an energy security crisis.<\/p> <p> I was one of the few Deputies who opposed the closure of the power plants at Shannonbridge and Lanesborough, along with my Rural Independent Group colleagues.  I call on the Minister and the Government to get real, wake up and smell the coffee and open up those power plants immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100009#G00600","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663752120,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100010#H00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1663752120,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;

Our Government commits to react comprehensively to the challenge to rapidly reduce and then reverse our impact on the climate.  The fossil fuel-based economic model is detrimental to human progress and we must make the necessary structural changes to break that link and dependency on fossil fuels, which is the cause of our problem.  The solution is heading in the direction of relying on our own natural resources and our own skills in energy management to make sure we use that energy wisely.  The measures proposed by the Deputies would represent a significant shift in policy away from that course and would have significant negative effect on key national objectives to protect the environment and people at this moment of energy crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The Government opposes the motion and proposes a countermotion that notes a number of different points.  First, it notes recent energy policy developments at EU level and states that the national energy security framework, NESF, which we published in April, sets out a single overarching response to address Ireland's energy security needs in the context of the war in Ukraine.  The framework includes a number of measures that will reduce our demand for fossil fuel and replace fossil fuels with renewables, which is our best course to protect people.<\/p>  <p>  It also notes that the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is carrying out a review of the energy security of Ireland's gas and electricity systems.  The report was published early this week, which the Deputy is right will now go to a public consultation.<\/p>  <p>  The third point relates to petroleum exploration.  The countermotion notes that the Government's policy on oil and gas exploration is clearly articulated in the programme for Government and underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2021.  The policy and legislative framework is set out in the policy statement on petroleum exploration and production in Ireland, which was published on 12 August 2022.  While existing licence holders may seek to progress through the various stages in the petroleum exploration process, no new applications for oil or gas are going to be considered.  Regarding the specific application for a lease undertaking made by Providence Resources in respect of the Barryroe field, the countermotion sets out the current position, which is that the application is under consideration by the Department and that it, like all other such applications, is assessed against a number of criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100010#H00800","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1663752120,"counter":52,"content":"<p>How long is it going to take?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100010#H00900","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1663752120,"counter":53,"content":"<p>These are environmental, technical and financial.

To answer Deputy McGrath's question, I expect it shortly, within the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The countermotion notes that the Department does not publish information on individual applications while they are under consideration.  It would be inappropriate for me or the Department, from both a legal and regulatory perspective, and would offend due process, to comment on the specific detail regarding any individual licences or applications pending a formal decision being made.<\/p>  <p>  The EU's Council of Energy Ministers met on 9 September and addressed the extraordinary situation of energy prices in the Union and emergency measures to mitigate current high prices and support demand reduction for electricity to strengthen the EU's winter preparedness.  The Commission has proposed a number of short-term exceptional emergency measures, which are under urgent negotiation by member states, including proposals to reduce electricity demand across the EU, capping the revenues of inframarginal electricity producers and the introduction of a solidarity contribution from fossil fuel companies to be used to mitigate the impact of high energy prices on consumers.  We support the threefold approach being taken in the regulation to: remove excess rents being earned by non-gas electricity production; reduce electricity demand; and to apply a solidarity payment from the producers of oil and gas.<\/p>  <p>  Nationally, the NESF, which was approved in April last, sets out Ireland's response to our energy security needs in the context of the invasion on our national circumstances.  In regard to the security of oil supply, the short- to medium-term oil supply outlook has stabilised somewhat, with a slow reduction in the international price of oil.  The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, currently holds approximately 85 days of oil stocks, the overwhelming majority of which is in the form of physical product, with 85% being stored on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the gas security of supply, we all know that gas supplies from Russia to Europe have been severely reduced over the past year and continue to be the main cause of our energy problems.  This has resulted in natural gas prices that are approximately ten times those seen just two years ago.  The continued supply of natural gas to Ireland has not, to date, been reduced or interrupted as a result of the war.  The UK, from where 75% of our gas comes, is at a strategic advantage compared to other European countries with a diverse source of gas supplies.  The European Council recently agreed a regulation on reducing gas demand by 15% this winter.  This regulation requires all member states to put in place a demand reduction plan.  As Ireland is not directly interconnected to another member state, it is not required to meet the mandatory reduction target in this regulation.  Preparations are however under way to put the voluntary demand reduction plan in place.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the secure supply of electricity, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, is managing a programme of work to address challenges to the security of electricity supplies in Ireland, with the support of EirGrid and my Department.  Specifically, for this winter a range of measures has been undertaken.  A large amount of maintenance work has taken place over the summer to ensure our generation fleet is adequately prepared for the winter ahead.  We are working with large-scale energy users, which have significant quantities of backup generation, to access them at times of system stress.  There has been work on the optimisation of grid batteries, the number of which is growing, to provide greater service during times of stress.  There have also been enhanced demand-side responses through a number of measures at domestic and industrial scale.  Furthermore, I welcome that the CRU is reviewing the capacity remuneration mechanism to make sure it is fit for purpose.  In carrying out this review, it is vital that we support the projects that have been awarded contracts under the existing mechanism and that planned capacity auctions continue to deliver.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to our medium- to long-term energy security, the Department's current review of security of energy supply sets out the forecast to the period to 2030.  In the context of a sustainable transition to net-zero emissions by 2050, we must consider potential risks to both our natural gas and electricity supplies and examine a range of measures to mitigate these risks, including the need for additional capacity to import energy, reduce energy use, provide energy storage and encourage fuel diversification and renewable gases such as biomethane and hydrogen.<\/p> <p>A set of recommendations will be brought to the Government for consideration once the review is completed.<\/p> <p> The price vulnerability that households and businesses face at the moment is at the core of the concerns we all share.  Members will be acutely aware of the unprecedented increases in prices we are seeing.  Recent estimates from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, indicate that 29.4% of households are now spending more than 10% of their income on their home energy needs.  The Government is keenly aware of the pressure on households facing these bills and has already implemented a &euro;2.4 billion package of measures to support energy customers, which includes electricity cost credits, a reduction in VAT and an increase in the fuel allowance.  We have greatly enhanced the home retrofit supports available to households, with the number of free energy upgrades for households at risk of energy poverty delivered each month more than double what was seen last year.  A new 80% grant support for cavity wall and attic insulation was introduced as a response to the exceptionally high energy prices.  These supports are the key response and will help to protect householders in the short and long term.<\/p> <p> However, we recognise that more needs to be done as prices continue to increase.  Additional measures to support households and businesses are being examined in the context of the upcoming budget.  I very much welcome the recent announcement by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, as set out by its representatives at the Oireachtas committee yesterday, of a range of additional consumer protections under the national energy security framework.  This is the way we are working to help to protect our people.  We are providing assistance and making sure nobody, particularly those at risk of energy, is left without power.  We are working to make sure we get through this wartime situation while defending our people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100010#H01000","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663752720,"counter":55,"content":"<p>What is energy security?  The basic aim of energy security for any country is to reduce the dependency on imported energy sources for economic growth.  Can the Minister tell me why this is not happening?  Ireland is the most energy import dependent country in Europe.  We have no storage capacity for our gas and there are no plans to reopen or upgrade existing facilities such as that in Kinsale.  For the past ten years, Foynes in County Limerick has been struggling to get planning for gas storage facilities.  Nothing is sanctioned there.  We are completely reliant on the UK pipeline for our gas, which, since Brexit, is not as secure as we would like to think.  Only recently, the Government failed to apply for the European Commission funding initiative to source temporary floating liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals.  It must be noted that 19 other European countries applied for and took that grant aid but our Government did not.  We are a country that is trying to bring down its carbon emissions but we have allowed the cost of importing fuels to surge to &euro;10 billion this year.  Yes, that figure is &euro;10 billion.  We are currently taking in 130,000 barrels of oil from a place called Qatar and, as yet, we have no storage for gas in Ireland.  There are easy wins to be had here, by the Government leading by example and showing us alternatives.  This is low-hanging fruit.<\/p>  <p>  Last night, there was a debate in this House on retrofitting and the collapse of the methodology used to roll it out.  Many Deputies had the same stories as I have.  The Minister talked about it again this morning.  The average time to get a house retrofitted in Ireland is 28 months.  I am sure he can work out what that is in years.  A total of 30 tonnes of bark mulch came in from Australia to Foynes to be burned in peat burners in Ferbane.  Coal is being brought from Russia to Moneypoint and turf is being brought from Poland.  We are doing things in a way that is creating carbon emissions across the world, under the same sky that the Minister and I are standing under today.  Does it not make sense to produce our own natural materials in this country instead of dragging them halfway around the world?  The Minister talks about emissions.  He was asked last year to look into euro 6 engines for the truck industry.  For a couple of million euro, we could have fitted every truck in Ireland with a euro 6 engine.  That would have dropped emissions at the turn of a key.  It is common sense.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Taoiseach said to me that the Government is not a business.  In fact, the Government is a business and it should be run like a business.  It is collecting tax, PRSI and PAYE for the whole country and it makes the decisions for the businesses that are creating employment.  The Government has a lack of business ethics and that is why it is destroying businesses in Ireland.  The VAT intake alone, even though the rate was reduced to 9%, is up 30% on last year, which has a knock-on effect on the businesses that are giving the Government the tax, PRSI and PAYE.  The income tax that comes into the country from every business that is here amounts to 12% of their profits.  Yes, the Government is a business but the problem is it does not understand business and that is why it is putting all the pressures on businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the Government spoke yesterday about pensions and said they want people to work until they are 70 but, if not, the young people of today will have to pay for it in extra PRSI contributions.  Again, it goes back to the businesses that are paying our salaries in this House and keeping this country running.  All the money is being wasted because the Government does not know about business and how it runs.  Business supports people, people support the Government and the Government is supposed to support the people but its lack of understanding is evident.

I was invited into the home of a lady called Nora, who is nearer 90 years of age than 80.  When I went into her house, she had a very small bit of a fire going, with maybe five or six lumps of coal in the back of the fireplace.  She had a red blanket over her knees, there was a very small bit of heat and she was very near the fire.  This woman is living on her own and has no relatives.  She talked to me about the price of a bag of coal.  I would look nice trying to tell that woman about the Minister's retrofitting grants.  She is barely living hand to mouth.  All I can tell the Minister is that he and his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael should be made to go to that house and made to listen to what that woman said.  She asked me what has happened to the people who are in power.  She said she remembered when there were people in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael who would stand up for the likes of her.  She said the Green Party would never have had any interest in her anyway.  That woman really drove it home to me about what the Minister and his colleagues are doing.  During Leaders' Questions today, I will be talking about Firebird Heating Solutions, Kingspan and Grant Engineering, which are the people who produce the boilers the Minister has said he looks forward to banning in the future.  I will go into more detail about that on Leaders' Questions.<\/p>  <p>  I remind Fianna F&aacute;il of what it did in north Kerry before the last election.  The current Taoiseach went around places like Tarbert, Ballybunion, Ballylongford, Lisselton and down into Listowel.<\/p> <p>He told the people when he was canvassing that if he was elected and formed a Government, delivering an LNG facility would be one of the policies he would pursue.  He said he would deliver it.  What the Taoiseach did, in respect of what I had ensured was in the programme for Government in 2016, namely, that we would have an LNG facility, was that he capitulated to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and said it was against Government policy to have such a facility.  He did a complete U-turn.<\/p> <p> The people in those places will be looking forward with great anticipation to the next election.  People will be shown up for the mistruths they told during canvassing.  It will be highlighted to the people what was in the programme for Government in 2016 and what the Taoiseach subsequently did in 2020 just for the sake of power at all costs to the detriment of people.  This has ensured that Ireland has no gas storage capacity as a consequence of Government policy.  The south-west Kinsale gas field is now depleted and the Government has not pursued the option to use it as a strategic gas storage facility.  While the German, Austrian and other EU governments are busily filling their gas storage capacity, Ireland, at the very end of the gas grid, is hamstrung by a Government with no plan.  Germany is now reopening the coal-burning power stations to provide a practical buffer to the energy crisis.  Ireland is the only country in Europe with a coastline that does not have an LNG import facility.  This means there is no alternative to the pipelines running through the UK, as the Government has chosen to not add LNG as an option, as I have already outlined.<\/p> <p> This unprecedented energy crisis is compounded by the Government's policy position on energy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100011#J01000","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663753320,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100012#K00200","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1663753320,"counter":66,"content":"<p>The Minister is a failure.

Principally, therefore, the responsibility lies with the Fine Gael party, it having been a continuing feature of Governments in that period.  There has been gross mismanagement.  This is a matter of energy supply and demand.  Those Governments rolled out the red carpet for data centres, which have huge energy demand.  At the same time, they Governments failed time and again to deliver on supply.  Data centres have a role, but we must be able to power them.<\/p>  <p>  There have been so many failures at different times, including policy failures and failures of action.  This has led us to a situation where we have had more amber alerts in this calendar year than we have had in most of the previous decade.  This has been a failure of successive Governments to plan, prepare, execute and deliver.  It has also been a failure of agencies.  The CRU has failed to deliver at several auctions.  It is almost a case of trial and error with CRU.  It tries to secure energy power plants and it fails.  It tries again and fails again.  Earlier this year, before the D&aacute;il rose for the summer recess, the Government had to rewrite the rulebook in the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022 because the CRU and other State agencies had failed to procure the necessary energy power plants to get us through last winter, this winter and the winters of 2023, 2024 and 2025.  <\/p>  <p>  This has implications for the price of energy.  It puts an extra &euro;40 on people's bills each year.  The other thing the Government did in that legislation was to take so-called ring-fenced carbon tax revenues, intended to be used to retrofit poor people's homes, to spend them on buying diesel generators.  It could not deliver gas generators, so now it is going to deliver diesel generators.  This is the same CRU whose representatives told the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action yesterday that there was nothing the agency could do regarding standing charges and it would not even suggest that families be put on the lowest tariff.  It is a case of kid gloves from the Minister, the Government and the agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Another responsible agency is EirGrid.  Its representatives presented at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action we had called to address this crisis and stated that a 9% increase in energy demand over the past five years was not excessive.  Those were the words used.  When we asked the CRU how a 9% increase in energy demand here compared with other countries, such as the EU 27, Switzerland and Norway, it indicated that the demand increase experienced in those countries in the past five years was 0%.  Yet, it also stated that a 9% increase was not excessive, as we face into a winter of amber alerts, possible red alerts and a real increase in the risk of blackouts.  This is no joke for families as they head into the winter.<\/p>  <p>  The State has also failed to deliver alternatives, whether it be gas storage as a back-up or renewables.  Regarding planning delays, wind energy groups have said there is supposed to be an 18-week turnaround time for decisions on planning applications but it is more like 60 weeks for planning appeals for strategic infrastructure developments.  Just today, it was reported that we do not have a single port in the Twenty-six Counties that will be fit to facilitate the building of offshore wind facilities, yet we are supposed to be delivering 7 GW of offshore wind energy generation by 2030.  It is not going to happen under this Government, and this is of deep concern.<\/p>  <p>  It is the same with the energy security review, which has been long-awaited and was published earlier this week.  It is a waste of money because it was very clear to anybody observing this area for any length of time that we needed to address the energy security crisis we have and that we needed gas storage.  The Government needs to get on with this work, rather than dithering.  The energy security review is a perfect example of that dithering.  It has moved into a public consultation.  The Government should get on with the work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100012#K01300","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1663753320,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this motion and I welcome the opportunity to speak on it, especially coming as it does on the back of Sinn F&eacute;in's motion on retrofitting last night.

Despite the commitment in the programme for Government more than two years ago, we are still waiting for the promised energy security review to be published.  \"Fail to plan, plan to fail\" is an adage that comes to mind in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The home retrofitting programme announced in February will take at least eight years to deliver its promise to retrofit 500,000 homes.  I say \"at least\" eight years but if the shaky start does not improve soon, it will go beyond ten years.  This is not acceptable.  Our older people, in particular, need to be prioritised.  We need a new energy poverty strategy and more funding to be ring-fenced for energy upgrades.  The Government thinks that if it keeps raising carbon taxes, behaviours will change.  Our older people are on fixed incomes, as the Government well knows.  They cannot afford to change their heating systems.  Of our total energy supply, 87% still comes from fossil fuels.  We need climate action but there must be a just transition.  Of those over 60 years old, 45% live in properties with a building energy rating, BER, of E, F or G.  This rises to 57% for people aged 75 or older.  Based on this, practically all homes with BER ratings of E, F and G are likely to be occupied by people aged 60 or older, meaning older people are especially at risk from energy price hikes.<\/p>  <p>  The Government must act immediately to implement windfall tax levies on all energy producers.  It must also ensure that the price of electricity is decoupled from gas to ease the burden on households and businesses.<\/p> <p>There must be a ban on disconnections during the fuel allowance season.  Two years ago, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a Bill to ban disconnections during the fuel allowance period every year.  We recognised that households who are struggling financially need support during this time, not the threat of having their light or heat cut off over the winter.  Disconnections are a real issue for many people.  For example, in 2019, there were more than 5,000 domestic electricity disconnections and almost 2,500 domestic gas disconnections.  A ban on disconnections will give households breathing space to arrange a payment plan with their supplier.  A few minutes ago, the Minister mentioned the war in Ukraine.  We did not have a war in Ukraine in 2019.<\/p> <p> It is clear from the actions of the Government that it is still indifferent to the plight of the working poor, struggling small businesses and our older people.  We need an election so that a Sinn F&eacute;in-led Government can implement much more caring policies and act to relieve the huge pressure our people are under.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100012#K01400","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663753920,"counter":79,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will be aware that there is enormous concern about how families, particularly elderly people and the vulnerable, will heat their homes this winter.  That is not scaremongering but the truth, as the Minister of State knows.  It is also the case in many other countries throughout the world.  There are undoubtedly international factors at work but there are also factors within our control.<\/p>  <p> We have left ourselves incredibly vulnerable - more vulnerable than most of our neighbours - in terms of our energy security.  We are extremely reliant on fossil fuels and the international markets.  We have made several mistakes regarding our grid and energy generation capacity in recent years, particularly during the term of the previous Fine Gael Government but also during this Government's term.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult to fathom the position the Government took for months in opposing the decoupling of electricity and gas.  It is now trying to hide behind the EU but the Government's position was one of opposition to decoupling.  That is difficult to fathom.<\/p>  <p>  I will make two points on energy security.  Anyone involved in energy, particularly the renewable side, will say they are tearing their hair out because of EirGrid and the CRU, and, beyond that, because of the processes that mean everything is sequential.  Only when an applicant has been granted planning permission for a project can it go to the ESB to try to advance it.  That is absolute lunacy.  I have come across cases - I will not go into much detail - where planning for wind farms is on the verge of elapsing and the project has not been able to proceed through the ESB and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There area also wait times caused by delays in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as Deputy O'Rourke pointed out.  This is seriously slowing down the ability of those who want to generate renewable energy to be able to bring it onto the grid.<\/p>  <p>  My second point is on solar power.  It is difficult to understand the bureaucracy and delays that are preventing businesses, individuals, schools and community organisations from being able to install solar panels and sell the power back to the grid.  There are 4,000 schools in the State.  Every one of them should have solar panels.  There is supposed to be legislation coming through.  The issue was supposed to be sorted out in the spring but has gone to consultation.  While there is nothing wrong with consultation, the delay is difficult to understand.  This issue was supposed to have been resolved months ago and the legislation was supposed to be in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100013#L00200","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1663753920,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Independent Group for the opportunity to speak on this important matter.<\/p>  <p>  As the previous speaker said, one of the areas the Government has refused so far to consider is the decoupling of gas from electricity prices.  Currently, the price of gas dictates the price of all electricity.  This is pushing bills through the roof, even for renewable electricity.  While we can produce electricity from wind and solar at relatively low prices, the current system means that this energy is sold at the same rate as gas-generated electricity.<\/p>  <p>  Shamefully, last October the Government strongly opposed a proposal at EU level to decouple electricity from gas prices.  Other countries took action to address this issue but as recently as June of this year, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, reiterated his total opposition to decoupling gas and electricity prices.  However, the Minister seems to have done a complete U-turn on the issue now in saying he supports decoupling.  Why did the Minister oppose this option until now?  Did the Government prioritise the considerable profits of energy companies ahead of the interests of citizens and their ability to afford to keep their home warm during this winter?<\/p>  <p>  Keeping the lights on is a Sinn F&eacute;in priority in the months ahead.  Some workers and families will be faced by stark choices this winter.  It could be quite simply a choice between eating and heating.  This is the reality unless measures are introduced now that will help our people get through this cost-of-living crisis.  Targeted financial measures aimed at those workers and families who are impacted most are needed, not universal measures where the wealthiest get the same financial assistance as everyone else.  Deputies should not get energy credits.  Nobody in this House should get them.<\/p>  <p>  We need to make sure there are supports in place for small and medium-sized businesses this winter.  The Government needs to ensure they are supported.  For example, my local butcher is a small business that employs local and provides a valuable local service.  This business has been in operation for 14 years.  It has faced considerable increases in the cost of electricity.  Three months ago, the monthly electricity bill was &euro;1,400.  The latest monthly bill was &euro;3,200, and increase of 128% increase in three months.  This is not sustainable.  My butcher informed me that he could be only two bills away from closing his business, which has worked well for 14 years and survived all the restrictions it faced during Covid.  The Government's abject failure to address the energy and cost-of-living crises could put this business under.  I am calling for measures to be introduced that would keep small businesses afloat this winter and into next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100013#L00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1663753920,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I also thank the Rural Independent Group for the opportunity to speak.<\/p>  <p>  The various motions that have been put before the D&aacute;il since we returned suggest the Government cannot lead when it comes to the current energy crisis.  It shows no foresight and has no comprehension of how to do right for the people.<\/p>  <p>  I followed the debate in my office before coming to the Chamber.  Looking at the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, across from me now only confirms my belief that they do not have any interest in solving this problem.<\/p>  <p>  In its amendment to the motion, the Government refers to recently ordered reviews, including a public consultation on the review of Ireland's energy security which was launched last week, on the same day the ESB posted half-yearly profits of &euro;390 million.  The Government consistently reacts when it is nearly too late.<\/p>  <p>  On decoupling gas from electricity prices, as I have told the House in October last, the Government strongly opposed proposals at EU level to decouple electricity prices from the gas market which would have helped bring down costs.  Its subsequent U-turn is welcome but hardly inspires confidence.<\/p>  <p>  We have a Government playing catch-up at a time when families and businesses across this country are at their wits' end.  Offshore wind energy has been left in the doldrums by the Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in recently launched the Green Hydrogen Strategy Bill.  Green hydrogen has the potential to act as a store for surplus renewable energy, an alternative source of heat for homes and businesses and a fuel in the transport sector, including for long-haul and heavy goods vehicles.  With its abundance of renewables, particularly offshore wind, Ireland is uniquely positioned to harness the potential of green hydrogen.  The European Commission published its strategy in July 2022 and our neighbours in Scotland published their first strategy in 2015.  The Government, while finally making some positive soundings, is lagging behind.<\/p>  <p> The Government's retrofit strategy prioritises those with means over those in need, while the warmer homes scheme for the most vulnerable households has a major backlog and waiting time of over two years.  Yesterday, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a retrofit system that would provide tiered grants that would see the most financial assistance provided to those on the lowest incomes who need help the most.<\/p>  <p>  At the ploughing championship yesterday, a Sinn F&eacute;in event with various farming organisations was told how our farmers can get credits for the sustainability measures they take on their farms.  The problem is we have a Government that is not making use of the resources we have the potential to provide.  Anaerobic digestion on our farms is not being given sufficient attention, while recent funding available in the EU under the RePowerEU programme was not even applied for.  I would like to know why.<\/p>  <p>  Successive Governments have failed to competently balance electricity supply and demand and, as a result, the prospect of blackouts this winter remains a real possibility.  Data centres can continue to set up shop regardless of the pressure they put on the grid.  The ESB can post scandalous profits and the Government still tries to sweep a decade of energy policy failures by successive Governments under the carpet.<\/p>  <p>  The Government cannot wash its hands of all responsibility.  It must move on from mere commitments and giving household advice to families who already know what needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100013#L00400","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1663754520,"counter":82,"content":"<p>It is a line I have used before.  Sometimes when everyone else has spoken, you are just repeating what they have said, only not quite as eloquently.  It has all been said.  We have seen an abject failure to ensure we have sufficient capacity to generate the electricity we will require.  A huge number of people became scared over the summer when they heard of amber alerts and that we had not done the due diligence in respect of the gas generators in particular.  Deputy O'Rourke and others spoke about the fact that we had to change the legislation so we could attempt to rectify some of that, but it is a shambles.  The problem with this is that it is happening at the same time as we have an energy crisis in respect of supply and cost.  Yes, very much of that relates to Vladimir Putin at this point in time, but until the western world and the European Union get their act together sufficiently quickly, and until the Irish Government plays its part, this is the biggest weapon Vladimir Putin has outside of the threats he has made to escalate the situation, and that really needs to be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  It is fair to say the Government is very late to the game regarding decoupling electricity prices from gas prices, which are through the roof at this time.

Undoubtedly, the cost-of-living and energy crises have been exacerbated by Russia's brutal war on Ukraine, and we see just this week even more evidence of the brutality and horror of Russia's aggression against Ukraine.  There is also no doubt, however, but that the Government has been failing to build up the necessary infrastructure to ensure the supports to get us through a cost-of-living and energy crisis as we face into a bleak winter.  There is also no doubt but that the Government has been insufficiently cognisant of the existential climate emergency we also face as we seek to deal with and to address the hardship so many families and households face through rising costs, spiralling food and energy prices and unaffordable rents and mortgages.  I hear every day in my constituency from families and individuals who are struggling to make ends meet and whose incomes, until even six to eight months or a year ago, were enough to meet the costs they were facing but are no longer enough to meet those spiralling costs.  In Ireland we have a surplus budget figure of &euro;6.3 billion for the eight months of this year and nearly full employment, a paradox of plenty because we see the social contract broken.  We see delivery riders unable to afford to eat and having to rely on charitable institutions to get hot meals.  That is really unacceptable in Ireland in 2022.  The hardship is intolerable.<\/p>  <p>  It is in that context we debate this motion on energy security.  It is true that the Government is failing citizens who are looking for certainty and who want to know what their bills will be like in one month, two months and three months as we face into the winter.  That is what is currently lacking.  The situation is at breaking point for so many households, who are now told that their energy bills may reach an average of up to &euro;6,000 next year, a threefold increase on heating and electricity, unsustainable for so many.  With this terrible cost-of-living crisis, households and communities undoubtedly need urgent measures in next week's budget to give immediate relief.  I think some of that is acknowledged in the motion.<\/p>  <p>  However, my common ground with the drafters of the motion ends there, unfortunately, because the motion as proposed by the Rural Independent Group fails to engage sufficiently with the climate emergency.  It fails to acknowledge the existential crisis we face.  We should not approach any measure seeking to tackle cost-of-living and energy crises without having serious regard to how best we can meet our vital climate emissions reduction targets.  It can be a win-win.  We can seek to reduce emissions through clever and radical government policy while giving relief to hard-pressed households, but that is absent from the original motion.  The global climate and biodiversity crises are existential, so the notion of abandoning carbon budgets is ludicrous.  To quote Extinction Rebellion, we must tell the truth about climate and climate change.  We are seeing its impacts everywhere - in Pakistan with floods and in Europe with droughts.  We have delayed for far too long, and the really bleak prospect of blackouts and freezing homes in Ireland this winter should refocus our minds and strengthen our commitment to insulate communities from the worst effects of climate change.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the technologies and solutions we need exist.  From agriculture to transport, we know it can be done.  Yesterday, I was delighted to visit the ploughing championships in County Laois and to meet there with members of the farming and food production communities, who tell me they want support to give effect to ambitious climate targets.  They want to see farming and food production in Ireland rendered sustainable not only for them and their children but for all our communities as we face into a climate emergency.  It was wonderful to see the engagement with our Labour Party stall at the ploughing championships and to hear from so many people involved in agritech about exciting new initiatives and entrepreneurship.  From my constituency, in Ranelagh, Concept Dairy has developed a new app for dairy farmers.  There are really ambitious and exciting innovations there, supported by Enterprise Ireland and others.  It was very exciting to see this sort of work being done.<\/p>  <p>  We know we can do this.  We can meet our climate targets and make Ireland the renewable superpower we can be, but for that we need a new economic model which generates wealth and prosperity for all but which also supports emissions reductions and breaks the hold of the fossil fuel oligarchs and magnates, and indeed the polluting dictators mentioned in the motion.  There is a better way possible than that envisaged in the motion, and we need to be clear about that.  We in the Labour Party do not believe, for example, that Ireland needs floating LNG terminals.  We are open to the development of storage facilities, of course, but only on condition that such facilities can be repurposed for renewables - in other words, they can be future-proofed.  To be fair, the Government acknowledges that too, but as a cost control measure and a way of addressing the energy and security crisis, the Labour Party has also called on the Government to take temporary ownership of the Corrib gas field, our indigenous gas supply, which could be provided to the market at cost plus a reasonable margin for the production facility rather than the Government and indeed households having to pay exorbitant costs for gas that is produced here, the price of which should not be set by international conditions.  I have called for that already in this House, and I would be glad if the Minister of State would take that call back to his colleagues in the Government.<\/p>  <p>  What Ireland really needs for energy security in the longer term, and medium term, is rapid deployment of offshore wind.  That should have been also a short-term approach.  Floating LNG is not a sound long-term strategy for Ireland because we all know the future is renewable energy.  If as much political energy were to go into resolving why offshore wind development has been so delayed as goes into when we need LNG terminals, we would be in a much more secure position.<\/p>  <p>  As a starting point, we need to ensure that emergency measures are introduced to alleviate pressure on households while we develop urgently our infrastructure for deriving more energy through renewable sources, in particular, offshore wind.  We have called for the immediate introduction of a windfall tax on excessive profits for energy companies, an immediate price cap on energy bills and the extension of eligibility for the fuel allowance to ensure that more low- and middle-income households can be brought into the allowance to alleviate hardship in the short term this coming winter.  These represent significant measures to get our communities through this winter.<\/p>  <p>We also need to see vastly enhanced environmental initiatives to incentivise a rapid nationwide switch to renewables to help to meet our climate targets and greatly reduce household bills.<\/p> <p> We have called for a climate ticket, unlimited public transport journeys anywhere in Ireland, for &euro;9 a month.  Even introducing this on a trial basis would have the added value of helping out hard-pressed households but also helping us all to begin making a real impact on vital climate targets.  The Government countermotion is unambitious because it does not seek to do anything as radical as a climate ticket.  It does not seek, for example, to double the grant which we should be giving households to invest in solar capacity.  That would be a win-win for all.  The Government should be incentivising households hugely through much more ambitious measures to ensure they switch to renewables and to solar.  Many households are already seeking to do this but are hampered, as we know from recent reports, by the excessive red tape and bureaucracy, the low levels of grants available, and indeed the long delays.  There are significant delays on the warmer home scheme with delays in getting repayment of grant aid that is available.<\/p> <p> Therefore, the Labour Party believes we need to see an Ireland that works for everyone and an Ireland that works for all, brought about through ambitious and more radical measures from the Government in next week's budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100014#M01000","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663755120,"counter":93,"content":"<p>First, I want to say that this debate is getting incredibly personal and it is the wrong approach for us to take.  I am aware the Minister has left the Chamber, but the personalised nature of the debate in respect of energy and climate is not the appropriate response.  However, I recognise that people are angry and scared, and they are unsure of how they will get through the coming winter.  I am not just talking about householders but about small businesses and community groups.  The energy costs that are hitting people now will have and are already having a significant impact on how they live their lives because of the kinds of sacrifices they are making now.  There is an onus on the Government to protect those businesses and individuals, particularly those who are most vulnerable to these incredible hikes in energy prices.  It is clear there are many people in our communities who will be very vulnerable to this and that is where the Government's focus must be.<\/p>  <p>  In dealing with this issue, I believe two approaches are needed.  First, we need to deal with it in the immediate.  A crisis intervention is required and the Government must make sure the resources that the State provides in the budget will be focused on those who are most at risk.  The Social Democrats are calling for a cash transfer to individuals that reflects their income levels so that those who are at risk of poverty are the ones who will be most protected.  I have said this previously and I will say it again: as a Deputy I do not need an energy credit.  I did not need it in the last budget.  I do not think any of us in this Chamber need it.  That is a misspend of Government money, particularly when we do not know when this crisis will end.  From talking to people in the industry, they have said that the crisis may potentially be with us for two or three years.  When making decisions on how finances will be spent in the budget, the Government needs to be prudent and make sure it focuses on targeted measures.<\/p>  <p>  Members spoke about protecting those who are most vulnerable.  The Minister of State mentioned that there are protections for people from being disconnected.  All individuals are protected for three months, but that is obviously not sufficient.  Longer protections are available for people who are designated as vulnerable, but those designations relate to medically vulnerable people.  It is clear that many people will be financially vulnerable this winter.  I ask the Government to look into expanding and extending the disconnection measure for longer than three months because we are in a crisis situation.  No one in this country should have their energy switched off this winter because they could not afford to pay for it with the crisis we are facing.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to talk about the urgency that the Government applies to this crisis.  I am aware that the national energy security framework, which was published by the Government in April, was a direct response to what was happening in Ukraine and the high prices we were seeing.  I recently received a response from the CRU to a parliamentary question I raised in respect of the list of actions it will take as part of the framework.  What I cannot understand is how it has taken six or seven months to deal with many of these issues.  One of the measures that will be put in place, as required under the framework, is to ensure that all customers with a financial hardship meter would be placed on the cheapest tariff.  That will not happen until 1 December.  How could it possibly take that long to put such a measure in place?  We are in a crisis situation.  The Government needs to act urgently.  The CRU also needs to act urgently in regard to this.  The reduced debt burden on pay-as-you-go top-ups was due to be implemented on 1 October.  These are measures that should have been in place quickly.  The work was done, the security plan was in place and the CRU should have introduced those measures immediately.<\/p>  <p>  In reference to the motion, we need to have an immediate and a crisis-led focus at the moment.  However, we cannot lock ourselves into a fossil fuel future in the medium and longer term.  That is really important because the reason we are where we are at present is because previous Governments did not move quickly enough to ensure our homes, businesses, schools, and community groups were protected, energy robust and energy resilient.  That must mean moving away from fossil fuels.  I agree with certain aspects of this motion but there are many aspects with which I do not agree.  If we continue down that road, we are just going to be more vulnerable in the future because the climate crisis is not going away.  In fact, it is getting increasingly worse and it will continue to do so if we do not take measures.<\/p>  <p>  There is a problem with the Government's messaging on the windfall tax and how the Government talks to people on this issue.  There is a level of patronising commentary from the Government, telling people that they need to use less energy in order to deal with this cost-of-living crisis.  Everyone to whom I have spoken knows that if they want to reduce their energy costs, they should use less energy.  You do not have to be a rocket scientist to get that.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard the energy cap being spoken about a lot, but I have not heard whether the Government has done an analysis on exactly how much it would cost the State, because that would be an open-ended cheque for energy companies.  I have spoken to people and they do not understand what happens if an energy cap is placed on bills.  It is not that the energy companies cannot charge more for energy; it is that the Government will pay energy companies.  That message is not getting out there.  I spoke to a number of people over the weekend who were quite surprised by this.  They thought it was a simple thing to do - to stop energy companies from charging us more.  Unfortunately, that is not a simple thing to do.  It is not possible because of the international energy markets we are in.  If a cap is brought in, the State, in the form of the taxpayer, will pick up that bill.  It will also mean that people like me and the Minister of State can continue to use as much energy as we want and the State will pay.  It is a non-targeted response to this crisis.  We will end up subsidising not only energy companies but large energy users, and that is not the way to go.  Has the Government done an analysis, or will it do such an analysis, so that this message can be made clear to people because the Government's response at this stage of the crisis is not a viable one? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100015#N00200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1663755120,"counter":94,"content":"<p>There is no doubt we are facing a real crisis.

There is no doubt it is a historic crisis.  The Deputies are right to table a motion but their solutions are unreal.<\/p> <p> The main demand of the motion will do nothing for ordinary people suffering in the crisis.  The motion hints at solutions of a windfall tax and mentions a national retrofit programme and decoupling gas.  It also quite rightly points to the examples of other states which have successful renewable energy strategies.  I have the feeling these demands are an afterthought to the real business being pushed, which is the interests of fuel companies, specifically Providence Resources and that jewel in its crown of Barryroe.  There is a saying that one should never waste a good crisis.  That saying is well used in the House but this is a classic example of it.  There are many reasons for the current crisis but it is not a crisis of energy supply.  It is a crisis of energy pricing.<\/p> <p> The one thing that has absolutely nothing to do with this crisis is the inability or delay in Providence Resources or any other oil company extracting oil or gas anywhere from the waters of the State.  We could tear up the climate emergency measures that we voted for and tell Providence, Shell, BP and anybody else to go dig their wells and sink wells all over this island and it would do nothing to deal with the energy crisis we have and the prices that people are facing.  There are two reasons I say this.  The first is the State's licensing terms for the exploration of oil and gas.  Depending on when licences were issued the companies will most likely pay no tax on their finds and no royalties to the State.  The State has had a policy of giving away the State's natural resources and reducing any potential tax take from oil and gas.  Corrib, like others, is able to claim the full cost of setting up its field and pays no tax on its production.  The licensing terms have been labelled the most generous of any state in the world.  That was under the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael philosophy and it remains so with regard to renewable energy, which is mainly in the hands of private companies.<\/p> <p> The terms of these licences also mean that any company that finds oil or gas is under no obligation to sell it back to this State.  It can sell it to where it sees fit.  An oil or gas find in Ireland does not mean an oil or gas sale to the Irish State.  It means Providence or anybody else that finds oil or gas may sell it to the State but the State will be charged at international market rates.  In short, finding oil and gas anywhere will do nothing to address the crisis we face.  I want to find out from the Deputies what they think about the fact that Shannon LNG paid more than &euro;4 million to Kerry County Council.  If the LNG fails will that money be returned to Shannon LNG?<\/p> <p> In the motion the Deputies make reference to domestic oil and gas and how it would have a lower carbon footprint than importing foreign oil and gas.  Many of them have articulated this over the years but they have a clear scepticism on the facts of climate change, seeing it mostly as a giant conspiracy and often speaking about an international campaign to cast doubt on climate change and rubbish any measures it attempts to address.  The House will forgive me if I doubt that the carbon footprint of oil and gas is not a real concern here.  The floods in Pakistan are receding and as the lives of 30 million people are devastated, sceptics on climate get bolder in their claims and denials.  The truth is they could live to see historic droughts and storms but they could also deny the evidence in front of them.<\/p> <p> The hysteria regarding energy security is similar to that of using a good crisis in the case of the war in Ukraine.  To listen to the hysterical talk that the Brits might cut us off and about our reliance on one pipe we would think we got gas from a small pipeline that could fail any second-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100015#N00300","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663755720,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Wake up, woman, wake up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100016#O00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1663755720,"counter":97,"content":"<p>-----if Liz Truss decided to turn it off.

They are way over the top in their usage of energy.  Meaningful action would mean moving away from the market and the deregulation and liberalisation of energy .

It follows the Regional Group's motion last week which was unopposed by the Government.  It set out a template for how to deal with the energy crisis and the energy price crisis that we have.  There is much rhetoric and talk about these issues.  We have to speak about real action.  Last week I said to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that we produced a document and set of proposals that could be a template for doing something practical and logical.  I am sure the Minister of State hears in his office, as does every Minister, about the number of small businesses in the country that are on the edge and paying through the roof for their energy.  There are small shops in small towns and villages.  Small publicans are fighting against the tide in any event following Covid.  The price of electricity for them to run their coolers and make sure everything is right for the food they sell has increased threefold.  It is not alarming but scary.<\/p>  <p>  Last Saturday morning a man spoke to me on the street in Tuam.  He said that if there is not something in the budget for business people, he will close.  He is young with a fairly sizeable business.  He owns his own property.  He does not have a mortgage on it and he is not renting it.  He has been there for the past 20 years.  He says he will close the doors unless he sees something happening.  This is what we are looking at.  This is with regard to the cost of energy.  We also have energy security.<\/p>  <p>  I will repeat what we said last week, which is that there is one simple solution.  People can say it is not simple because of legal matters.  The Derrybrien wind farm in my constituency could serve 40,000 houses with green energy.<\/p> <p>We should bring something in here to the D&aacute;il that we could all agree upon to get that opened as a matter of urgency.  It would be a statement of intent to get more energy, and more green energy.  There is no controversy about that.  It is an immediate step that can be taken to help people living in fear of not having energy next winter or having blackouts.  Industry cannot afford to have blackouts or downtime in its energy supply, never mind the fact that it is paying so much more for it.<\/p> <p> We should be looking at how we can generate more green energy as simply as possible.  If one looks at all the farm buildings around this country, it is a matter of getting supports to them to use the microgeneration that is there.  The microgeneration scheme that has been in place has sold a pup to many homeowners because they were supposed to get a payback from the grid when they were pumping energy into it.  This should have been happening since July of last year but they still have not got that sorted out which is an indictment of the way the policies are being enacted.  We need better and stronger plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100016#O01200","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663756320,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Independent Group for submitting this motion.  It allows us the opportunity once again to debate our energy crisis and security.  Many of the comments I made last week on my group's motion are also relevant to this motion, but I will try to avoid too much repetition of what I said then.  It is on the record and I hope it will be taken on board by those making the decisions.<\/p>  <p>  There are striking parallels between our approach to the housing crisis and the approach to the energy crisis.  They are fundamentally caused by the same issue - a lack of supply.  Supply is the issue.  Basic economics show that if the demand remains the same and supply has been restricted, it will result in prices going up.  We have caused that in the housing market by excess regulation and poor planning policy.  We are doing that with the energy market as well.  <\/p>  <p>  The current problems facing us in energy supply have been caused mainly by a combination of factors which have colluded to make the issue even worse.  Obviously, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions placed on Russian energy as a result have restricted supply.  The other major contributory factor to this is the fact that we have consistently and continually restricted our own supply of electricity, even though politicians have been aware of the potential for crisis for the past 14 years.  Government policy and decisions have made us more reliant on European and UK imports and, therefore, we are more exposed than we should be to events beyond our control.  The Government has closed our own peat-powered plants.  We have given the Government a proposal on the reopening of those facilities but it has, in the programme for Government, banned the exploration of gas off our coasts and we have no gas storage.  We are the only country in Europe with no gas storage.<\/p>  <p>  I would love to see the entire energy supply run on renewable and reliable energy but we have bitten off our noses to spite our face in trying to do it.  The cart has been well and truly put before the horse.  We have tried to curtail our reliable sources of electricity in favour of unreliable sources which are currently unable to provide for our needs or are unavailable.  This needs to change, as a matter of urgency, to meet the demands of the current crisis.  We need to ensure we build our renewable energy capability while still ensuring our energy security.  That means not moving away from the old reliables until such a time as the new sources are readily able to provide enough reliable energy.<\/p>  <p>  We need to secure alternatives which do not rely on the behaviour of foreign governments or volatile political situations abroad.  The Government and previous governments have allowed ideology to prevail ahead of pragmatism when it comes to energy.  The problem, in a nutshell, was illustrated by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, last week in the debate on the Regional Group's motion when he steadfastly refused to consider opening Derrybrien to provide additional power, for fear of upsetting the EU.  I would be more worried about upsetting the business owners up and down the country who are and will be hit with colossal energy bills.  It will drive businesses to close and people out of work and householders will be hit from all angles.  The worst case will be job losses.<\/p>  <p>  What is our priority?  We are a sovereign nation or, at least, we should be.  We should be free to manage our own affairs in times of crisis which means doing what is best for the Irish people in the national interest.  Furthermore, not one port in this country is ready to construct offshore wind farms.  Rosslare has been deemed the most suitable port, but not one penny has gone from this Government's coffers to justify and join the dots.  The Irish taxpayer has not committed one penny to Rosslare Europort for the advancement of electricity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100017#P00200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1663756320,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I very much welcome this motion from the Rural Independent Group.  I will support the motion if I am not called upon to pair with a committee Chair who has to be elsewhere.  It is a very important motion in that it recognises, as most people recognise, that we would like to move to renewables.  We also have to realistic about the fact that we will not achieve that in a couple of days, weeks or even months.  We will have to be realistic.  We will have to figure out a strategy for powering this State while we make that move.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened to what the Government has to say about this matter and in particular to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is the Minister in the Department tasked with this.  There is great hope for the offshore wind energy sector and he has considerable ambitions in that regard.  I would never fault anybody for having hope or ambition but they have to be tempered a little bit by reality.  Notwithstanding all the talk that we will be net exporters of wind energy, we have to bear in mind that in 2020, when this Government came to power, 35% of the energy generated in the State was generated by wind.  Last year, that fell to 29%.  The reality belies the words that are being floated about.<\/p>  <p>  We are told that offshore wind is this great panacea, but I would like to refer to Equinor, the Norwegian state company formally known as Statoil, is almost the biggest player and is certainly at the cutting edge of floating turbines.  They are the only ones I am aware of who have developed floating turbines.  To harness the wind energy off the Atlantic, the turbines will have to be floating, because offshore turbines need to be either anchored or floating.  They will be anchored in the Irish Sea but will have to be floating in the Atlantic.  However, Equinor has pulled out.  There had been a huge announcement, and I was delighted with what was going to happen at Moneypoint, but the company pulled out a couple of months later.  The company did not cite anything, but industry sources said it was because the company was baffled by the lack of planning and regulatory reform and the lack of any real capability or possibility of developing this sector in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We are being told, \"live, horse, and you will get grass\" - the grass we are going to get is this offshore wind energy - but we do not even have the ports.  A national ports study by Wind Energy Ireland which was released today found that we have no ports in the Republic of Ireland.  I am aware that the CEO of Foynes Port is very ambitious in this regard, but his ambition has to be backed by Government ambition and it has to be funded.  Again, the moves are not in that direction.  It is great that we have an ambitious CEO in Foynes Port with the foresight to see what needs to be done, but it is not so good if this ambition is not matched by the Government.  The ambition needs to be matched throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  If offshore wind is to be the great panacea which the Government says it will be, we will need to have suitable ports to load these substantial developments.  These floating turbines will be absolutely mammoth in scale.  They have be done locally.  If the big companies could load up the ships in Aberdeen or Stranraer they would do so, but they cannot.  The turbines have to be done locally, but we do not have the ports to do this.  Not alone do we not have the ports, but there is no sign of us having the ports to do it.  At the same time, we are being told we will have lots of wind energy which will solve all of our problems.<\/p>  <p>  I support the Government's ambition and hope, but I speak to small businesses throughout this State that are being hammered.  I will give an example.  <\/p> <p>The Shannon Swimming and Leisure Centre is State-funded.  The centre's energy bills doubled from August 2020 to August 2021 and doubled again to August 2022.  They are more than &euro;7,000 per month.  The centre is funded through the Clare County Council.  How is it going to keep its doors open?  How is it going to provide a facility to schoolchildren and people in Shannon who want to swim and stay fit?  How is that going to happen?  That is just one example.  Then there are the supermarkets.  When I was a child there was only one fridge in many shops and now there are walls of fridges and whatever.  They are not going to be able to keep the lights on because we are utterly reliant on imported energy and nothing the Government is doing is changing that fact.<\/p> <p> We have no control over the cost of imported energy.  We have to pay whatever the rate is and we are not developing.  We are talking about wind energy but we are not really developing it.  We are not even talking about nuclear energy but we are happy to import it and pay whatever the going rate is.  Of course, the going rate is linked to the price of gas, which suits the Germans.  It is \"All hail the Germans\" in the Government at the moment, especially Ursula von der Leyen.  Has the Taoiseach told the Minister of State what job he is getting?  Our strategy on gas, the Ukraine war and everything is based on whatever the European Commission wants, so somebody is clearly auditioning for a role.  Maybe it is the Minister of State himself; I do not know.  However, I am not content to see this State being sold down the swanny on the basis of the Germans' mistake of putting all their eggs in one basket.  The Minister of State can heave and sigh and fall over if he wants to, but the reality is Germany is utterly dependent on gas because it decommissioned its nuclear plants.  France is in a much better place because it did not decommission its plants, given it costs an awful lot less to produce nuclear energy at the moment than it does to generate electricity through gas.  The Germans made a mistake and the French did not.  As Germans made a mistake, we are all paying for it because the price we pay for imported energy, be it generated by nuclear or any other method, is linked to the price of gas and that is at the behest of the Germans, and we, for whatever reason, are in thrall to Ursula von der Leyen.  She is of course a former Minister of Defence in Germany.  They wanted to get rid of her and managed to shunt her off all right but that is a different matter.<\/p> <p> I come back to energy.  I am asking that this Government get real about how we are going to keep the lights on in the State and how we are going to achieve some degree of self-sufficiency.  I commend the Rural Independent Group on bringing forward a motion in that regard.  I am very disappointed by the countermotion put forward by the Government, which is basically whistling past the graveyard.  Live horse and you will get grass.  It will all be fine on the day.  It will not, unless strategy changes.  I see no sign of the Government's lofty words being matched with actions on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100017#P00300","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663756920,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Bogaimid go dt&iacute; an Aire St&aacute;it.

We have work to do on that and we have been doing a huge amount of work.<\/p>  <p>  On the crisis, Deputy Whitmore asked for clear messaging on the issue of what the Government is doing versus the caps Sinn F&eacute;in proposes.  Its proposed cap essentially mean that while prices will be capped, though at what level I am not sure because the party has not said, it would mean we would have to write a cheque from the public to the energy companies to make up whatever the difference between the price they would be allowed charge and the profit Sinn F&eacute;in would allow them to make.  The Government proposal, working with European governments, is to work on demand reduction measures, work to take the excess profits off the renewable generators and give them back to the Irish people because those revenues have been earned in a non-natural way and to take a windfall tax off those fossil fuel producers as well, namely the gas and oil companies, as the Rural Independent Group is advocating for.  They are in the proposal at the moment so instead of what Sinn F&eacute;in proposes, which is to give money from the people to the energy companies, we are saying the opposite should happen, namely, we should take the money from the energy companies at source and give it back to the people to help them with their bills and help us with our energy security.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of other measures under consideration, including the decoupling of the gas price from the electricity price, which is something we would all like to see if it could work.  However, it is certainly not easy.  It is something that has worked effectively for a number of decades at this point to ensure security of supply at a reasonable price, though clearly there is a big problem with it at the moment and we are working with our colleagues on that as well.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is a cap on the price of gas such that we would only pay a certain amount.  We would tell Russia, Norway, Britain or whichever country that this is all we are going to pay.  Ireland wants to see that.  We would like all the other member states to agree to that as well and it is something I hope can happen.  Again, it is not just as easy as saying the price of gas will be capped because there will be a reaction from the selling countries to that and, therefore, all these factors must be considered.  I ask people to at least appreciate that this is complex and in the face of climate change-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100018#Q01700","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1663756920,"counter":127,"content":"<p>It was made complex.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100018#Q01800","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1663756920,"counter":128,"content":"<p>-----and in the face of, effectively, a mad tyrant in Russia causing a war, there should be unity around the place.  We should take good ideas from the Opposition, which we are doing, and Opposition Deputies should also give some acknowledgment of the work under way, which is extraordinary work by all governments in the face of this crisis, and work with us to get the best results for the people, which is what this Government is determined to do.<\/p>  <p>  Nothing can be ruled out.  We do not like the Sinn F&eacute;in price cap.  I do not like it at all.  However, I am long enough around here to know that not nothing can ever be ruled out in a crisis.  The way gas and electricity prices are linked has been going on for a long time and worked very well for many years.  Maybe a few years ago it would have been unthinkable to intervene in the market that way, put a cap on the price of gas and take revenues off companies that were developing renewable energy because that would disincentivise them.  We have all got to think the unthinkable but we must do it in a reasonable way and acknowledge what governments have been doing.  To directly and immediately relieve the pressure on households facing exceptional energy bills, the Government has provided &euro;2.4 billion in a package of policies and measures to help energy customers, particularly through the summer months.  We were fortunate this summer and even into September with the mild weather and that has given everyone a break, but the Government has given people a break too.  We have had an electricity cost credit that has applied to more than 2.1 million domestic electricity accounts, a reduction in VAT on electricity and gas bills and increases to the fuel allowance for the most vulnerable to ensure our measures, while universal and broad-based, are also targeted at the most vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  The NESF, which was approved by Government and published in April, sets out our response to our energy security needs in the context of the invasion of Ukraine and our specific national circumstances.<\/p> <p>The storage review was published yesterday as well.  Some Members felt it had not been published but it was.  The CRU is managing a programme of work to address challenges to the security of electricity supplies in Ireland with the support of EirGrid and a number of consumer protections have been announced.  Specifically on the moratorium relating to disconnection, I ask people, please, not to get stressed out about this.  There is a moratorium on disconnections for all domestic customers.  Originally it was from mid-December to mid-January and the moratorium for vulnerable customers was originally from 1 November to 31 March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100018#Q01900","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663757520,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Every customer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100019#R00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1663757520,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Under new measures the moratorium has been extended from 1 December until 28 February and, for vulnerable customers, from 1 October to the end of March.  There was a Sinn F&eacute;in representative on television the other night saying there was no moratorium in place.  The moratorium is in place for the toughest times of the year.  There are lots of measures in place to help customers.  I have been asking the energy companies to do more and they are doing things to help customers.  We strongly encourage customers to engage with the energy companies if they are in difficulties and indeed with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's priority is to reduce the cost that customers have to pay to ensure we have the most secure electricity and energy supply possible.  The way we are going to do that at this moment, at least, is by direct measures in the budget.  The reason we are able to provide direct measures in the budget is that the Irish people and the Government have collectively run the economy in a very good way in the past few years that has enabled us to have a cash surplus built up.  We will use that cash surplus taxes have generated to give to the people to help with their bills, as we have done this year.  We are hoping to tell the energy companies that they are earning too much money and we have to take that back retrospectively and not just into the future, back in time to earlier this year, to give that money to the Irish and European people to help them with the bills they unjustifiably pay at the moment.  I hope that will be agreed next Friday in Brussels.  We will continue working towards a gas price cap.  We will continue working to see if decoupling can occur.<\/p>  <p>  The idea that these words and phrases can be just thrown around as if they are simple solutions is not correct.  The public knows this is a complex situation.  Only three weeks ago Members of the Opposition were criticising the Government for offering energy-efficiency advice.

Why is it that he has fled like snow off a ditch when questions were being asked, especially by the rural groups, the Regional Group, ourselves and Deputy McNamara who had to return to the health committee?  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan has to answer.  He made one statement - and we will check the record - that a final decision will issue on Barryroe and the application in the coming weeks.

He does not want to unhitch it now but it must be unhitched and the blame for the hames that was made must be put back where it should be - on him.

He is talking about the profits and the struggles that we have now on the back of Covid without mentioning the hardship and penury the Government put people through and the fear it put people through and that fear is killing people.  We are not climate change deniers in here, not one of us.  We understand nature and we are very proud supporters of the flora and fauna along with our farming and rural communities.  Indeed we understand that we must change and we will change - no better people to change when we are ready.  We should not loosen up the tacking on the horse before we go to the creamery with the milk.  If we do, we will have milk spilt on the ground.

I salute the ESB outdoor staff and indoor staff whom I deal with during outages.  They are very effective and very good.  The pure gouging they are taking out of people now and they are making &euro;590 million profit in the first six months of this year in the teeth of this awful, horrendous upward spiral of prices is just sickening.  For the CRU to come out yesterday, another quango with a brass plate on the wall, and say they could not do anything about it is why the people are so sick and so tired of a weary, cobbled together, mish-mash, liquorice allsorts of a Government.  However, the sweets are turning sour and there will not be any liquorice in them by the time this is finished.  When the Government Deputies meet the people, t&aacute; siad ag fanacht oraibh, they are waiting for them in the long grass.  They might not have the light to see them or enough batteries to see them coming in.  The Deputies might have head torches on from some kind of solar power, if they go near them at all.

How are they going to pay the bills?  The Government knows they are not.  They could not possibly pay them.  The Minister of State said a few minutes ago he does not want anyone to panic or worry and we will all be okay.  Live, horse, and you will get grass.  I say mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh siad and to look after our people but the Government abandoned that a long time ago.  We have also the leisure centres, as I said, and every facet of business - industry, hauliers.  I was in a SuperValu shop recently and their bill April 12 months ago was &euro;6,080.  Their bill in April 2022 was &euro;18,000, even before these mad increases we are talking about now.  How is that sustainable?  They employ 36 people.  Their competitors down the road, some of our German friends - I will not name the supermarkets; they are supported by people too - have ten staff and treble the income.  They can manage.<\/p>  <p>  We have served our global masters.  The Minister of State has served them too, as Minster of State with responsibility for European affairs.  The Taoiseach has served our global masters.  No matter what happens to the people, he is planning a big job when he is run out of politics here, in some part of Europe or beyond.  The sooner the better.  Get him away from us here because no one ever treated anyone or betrayed our people like he did.  When I think of de Valera, Lemass, Charlie Haughey and Bertie Ahern whom the Deputies are afraid to talk about now - they do not know what they are doing, a distraction - when I think of Albert Reynolds, the enthusiasm and the way he supported business and our small farmers and small people, the current Government is just serving the global masters of Europe.  That is all you want to do.<\/p>  <p>  As far as I am concerned the reality is that there are three main causes for the energy crisis.  Uimhir a haon is a complete under-investment in oil and gas.  There is no alternative capacity whatsoever and no backup plan.  They say the man who has no cash has no hope.  The Government has plenty of cash but it has no vision, no plan, and it is an abject failure.  That is why one of its backbenchers will not come in to the Chamber for this debate, the Regional Group's debate last week or many other debates we bring forward.  It is such a dereliction of democracy.  I welcome the Minister back to the Chamber.  At least the Government did cobble up a countermotion unlike the nonsensical situation last week and 40 times previous of not opposing the motions but only to acquiesce to them and put them in the bin.<\/p> <p>Such a cynical ploy by a Government is disgraceful.  The Government cobbled together a half-baked response to this.  <br\/><br\/>When the Minister was present earlier, he said that Ballyroe would get a decision in the next few weeks.  I am holding him to that.  We will raise it here because he has prevaricated, ignored the applicants and will not meet them.  <br\/><br\/>Deputy Smith and others think that &ldquo;companies&rdquo; is a dirty word.

As I said, it just not feasible or anything else.  The Minister shamed the oil companies and oil investors and dismantled all of them, yet he has no diversification plans.  There are many people out there crying.  Businesses, households and everybody else are trying to diversify and put in solar panels and many generators, turbines and everything else.  Many have, and the Government refused to pay these people supplying electricity back to the grid.

There are many people who have the vision and passion that the Minister has.  <\/p>  <p>  What changed him since 2007 when he made statements that we had to bring all our oil reserves and have gas reserves and be self-sufficient in this country?  What caused the dramatic change?  Was it the nod from the global masses in Europe?  I know Green Party policies are there.  I served with the Minister in the House between 2007 and 2011 when he was banished from the country.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, should know what happened to that Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  However, he does not care, as I said.

We know there is a meeting on 21st and we will have representatives at another global economic forum again instead of representing the people his country who duly elected him to this Parliament and all of us for the time being.  They are hurting across every facet of society from the womb to the tomb.  We know the attack that the Government went on against the womb before and the unborn.  However, he is attacking and hurting everyone now and he does not care.  He has no bit of humility, no bit of respect and no bit of appreciation of the problem.  It is time for the Minister to get out, go to the country and towns and feel the temperature.  He should continue to go out to the park and send the Taoiseach to the park and dissolve this ramshackle, humble, Humpty Dumpty Government before he destroys our people completely and our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100020#S00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663758120,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1663758120,"counter":141,"content":"<p>A division has been demanded.

I have no doubt that thousands more will take to the streets in the capital city of Dublin this Saturday for the very same reason.  Many of those who marched in Cork on Saturday had never protested before but they felt that they had no other choice.  They told their stories of cutting back on essentials, of going without or of barely just getting by.  I want to share some of the stories that they told the media over the past number of days. <\/p><p>Francis said<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe people are being robbed.  I'm frightened.  I have to do without certain things to pay my electricity bill.  I'm dreading the coming winter. <\/blockquote>  <p>Margaret said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt's going back to the 1950s.  In the 50s, when you got up in the morning, there was only the fire to keep the whole house warm, freezing cold floors and cold running water.  It's going back to that time. <\/blockquote>  <p>Donna asked:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDo we should just buy a load of candles instead of turning on the lights.  It is at that point for me, not turning on the immersion and washing in cold water in the middle of winter. <\/blockquote>  <p>Sheila said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe cost of electricity, fuel, food is frightening.  If you run a car, I really feel for anyone on a State pension, they're afraid.  People are living hand to mouth.  You can't budget when you don't know what is coming down the road.  <\/blockquote>  <p>&ldquo;When you don't know what is coming down the road&rdquo; - that one sentence sums up all of the fears and worries that households are feeling across the State as they try to cope.  It is easy to see why people are afraid.  It is so simple; just look at what they are facing.  Rents, and food and energy prices are going up.  The fear is especially real when it comes to the extortionate electricity bills that households face.  People are absolutely outraged when they see the scandalous hikes in standing charges by big profiteering energy companies that they are inflicting on households.  These hikes are ensuring that people are fleeced even if they do all that they can to cut back on their energy use.  The Government needs to act decisively.  It needs to cut electricity prices back to pre-crisis level and cap them at that level to help get families through this winter.  <\/p><p>This is a simple and straightforward plan to help more than 2 million households reduce their electricity bills at a time it is most needed.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s plan would give certainty to households this winter.  The Minister knows that this is possible.  When I raised it with him last week on the floor of the D&aacute;il, I told him it was happening in many other European countries.  In the past 48 hours, the Dutch and the Danes have announced price certainty for their citizens.  Cutting and capping electricity prices makes sense.  <\/p><p>What households need now is clarity.  What households are begging for is certainty - certainty that they will be able to make it through the winter.  That is what a cap will do - reduce electricity prices to pre-crisis levels and fix them at that right throughout the winter.  It is the right choice.  It is the choice that a growing number of countries across Europe are making.  I ask the Minister again if he will act to cut electricity bills back to the summer of 2021 levels and cap them at that level through the winter until the end of February.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100020#S00900","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1663758120,"counter":146,"content":"<p>We absolutely acknowledge that these price rises are hitting and hurting our people and businesses across the country and we have to do everything to protect them.  We also have to at every time remind our people that the reason for that is the war in Ukraine and the Russian Government&rsquo;s use of energy of a weapon of war, which is a direct attack on our people.  We will continue, as we have done over the past year, to look at the best way to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe the Sinn F&eacute;in plan is the right one.  I want to set out why.  It is very similar to what the Tory party is looking to do.  In fact, Jacob Rees-Mogg this morning, I believe, set out pretty much the same policy for Northern Ireland.  Sinn F&eacute;in is following a Tory Government approach.  I do not agree with it.  The first problem in principle is that it would actually benefit the better off, who tend to use more energy, have bigger houses and bigger bills.  They would benefit most from the approach the Deputy is suggesting.  <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, as in the Tory party approach, it would benefit the energy industries.<\/p> <p>That is something that we do not need to do at this time.  What we need to do is to apply windfall charges and give that money back to people rather than providing a cap where they get a free pass in any amount after that.<br\/><br\/>Third, I recommend the Deputy read the article written by Martin Wolf and published in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>today and originally in the <i>Financial Times <\/i>earlier in the week.  The economics of this are deeply uncertain in terms of the potential cost and length and the effect on the public purse.  We have to be careful with that because we need it to provide for social protection, such as the investment in social welfare increases through this difficult time.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy's plan is simple but it is not the right one.  This is not easy.  Every country has slightly different circumstances.  We have to adopt and look at what the right approach is.  I believe our approach is the right one - first and foremost with the likes of the investment in the fuel allowance and other social welfare provisions because we have to protect those on lowest income first and most.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy is against giving people an energy credit.  I argue that it is actually the right approach because the price increases are such that they affect everyone.  One could address that with a cap but that would really benefit the better-off.  It is better to do the credit, mixed with social welfare contributions.<br\/><br\/>The third element we need because businesses are going to be hard hit this winter in particular is to look at business supports, which is what we are doing as part of the preparations for the budget package.  Again, in doing that it is best to target.  There is a particular problem for many small and medium businesses that happen to have high energy use, be that a refrigeration system, a heating system or other power usage.  That is down to the local shop, caf&eacute; or hairdresser.  There is a variety of businesses that are particularly badly affected so we should target and address that.<br\/><br\/>That targeted approach in social welfare and how businesses are supported is better than the Tory giveaway that the Deputy is advocating.  There has been a lot of debate on this issue in the House in recent days.  We need to recognise that the fundamental way to get us out of this is to have ambition in the development of our own renewable power such that we are not held to ransom.  We also need to focus on being good on reducing energy use and being energy efficient and flexible.<br\/><br\/>Lastly, what we are doing is working in a European Union approach because the real story here is that Vladimir Putin is looking to divide Europe.  That is one of the key things he is looking to achieve in the coming six to 12 months.  We are working on that at the European energy council and the Heads of Government are working at the European Council to provide a united Europe response.  That is why we will use European methods towards windfall taxation.  It is why we will work with Europe on how we reform the market rather than going with the Tory party in a way that does not serve our needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100020#S01000","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663758720,"counter":148,"content":"<p>The Minister is actually the Minister who opposed the reforms at European level last October.

In fact, he previously told people to be clever with their energy use.  He said that people should use their smarts to cut down on energy use and save money.  People have been doing that.  All over the country, people are desperately trying to dramatically reduce the energy they use.  They are doing so because they can no longer afford to pay soaring bills.  Increasingly, people to whom I speak are telling me they are afraid to turn on the gas or electric.  They are afraid of the size of the bill they will receive and how high those bills will go through the winter.<\/p><p>People are being clever and conscientious but can the Minister explain how people can use their smarts to reduce the punitive standing charges that are now being imposed by energy companies?  These standing charges bear no relation to the amount of energy a consumer uses.  One could live in darkness for the next 12 months and it would make no difference to the charge one would pay.  Those charges are rocketing.  An article published in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>this week outlined the extent of the increases in standing charges.  Some suppliers are now charging up to &euro;700 on gas and electricity combined.  Customers with pre-pay meters, who are usually the most vulnerable, are paying up to &euro;900 a year.  That is gouging.  There is no other word for it.<\/p><p>As the Minister is aware, the standing charge was introduced as a means of reflecting the fixed cost associated with providing households with gas and electricity.  It has nothing to do with the unit cost of energy.  There is no reason it should be increasing at a rate that is similar to the increase in energy costs.  I heard the Minister speaking about this issue on the &quot;News at One&quot; radio programme earlier in the week.He blamed the war in Ukraine and he blamed Putin.  All present know Russia is responsible for the global energy crisis but some companies are using it as a pretext to jack up their prices.  Representatives of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, appeared before the climate committee yesterday and stated they were powerless to impose limits on the level of standing charges.  They said it was a matter for this House to legislate.  The Consumer Association of Ireland has also called on the Government to act.  It wants the Government to empower the regulator to have a role in setting equitable standing charges that actually reflect the fixed infrastructural cost they are supposed to reflect.  If the Minister really wants to see people rewarded for cutting their energy use, will he do something about the exorbitant standing charges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100021#T02000","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1663758720,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Time is up, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100021#T02100","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1663758720,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I do not want to hear him devote his response to the geopolitical problem.

No one should be getting any message that involves restricting that comfort and basic health.  The CRU appeared before the Oireachtas committee yesterday to addressing questions in respect of this and other issues.  It is important, however, to give confidence to people, particularly the most vulnerable, that they will not be left in a situation where they do not have those basic comforts.  There will be a moratorium on disconnection for vulnerable customers.  It has been extended from 1 October to 31 March.<\/p> <p>That moratorium is for all domestic customers.  It now extends to the end of February.  There will be an extended debt repayment period.  From 1 November, debt repayments plans will be extended to give households a minimum of 24 months to repay debt.  There will be reduced debt burden pay-as-you-go top-ups.  New measures mean that debt repayment levels will be reduced to 10% from 25% on pay-as-you-go customers' top-up payments.  For example, on a &euro;20 top-up, only &euro;2 will go towards the debt repayment instead of &euro;5.<\/p> <p> I will make two final points.  There will be better value for those on financial hardship meters.  All customers with a financial hardship meter will be put on the cheapest tariff from their supplier from 1 December 2022.  Electricity suppliers must actively promote the vulnerable customer register.  I could go on.  There are other measures.  This month, we will deliver a scheme that we introduced and that is taking time to deliver.  It means that for those at highest risk who may depend on medical equipment, we will take specific measures in the houses identified.  All of that is an important signal to give to customers not to turn off the heat or lights.  We will all manage carefully but we do not want to see anyone going cold, lonely or at a loss.<\/p> <p> On standing charges, as the CRU stated yesterday, this is not an issue over which it has regulatory control.  We have to do a review.  Earlier in the debate, we heard about what is being done in the European Union.

This is a huge mistake and I strongly urge the Government to review the facts and listen to the experts in this sector to solve the climate issue in the domestic heating sector.  This is a knee-jerk reaction by the Minister that is damaging rural Ireland already.  Firebird Heating Solutions, which is next door to me at home in Ballyvourney, Kingspan and Grant Engineering are members of OFTEC, the Oil Firing Technical Association.  They are the experts and I ask the Minister to listen to them.<\/p>  <p>  For 50 years, Ireland has been the envy of the world in the area of central heating.  The industry employs tens of thousands of people throughout the country.  This is something we should admire and be proud of.  The Minister, with ill-informed decisions and ill-informed advisers, will replace Irish jobs and companies with non-Irish imports.  This is a tragedy, especially when there is no need to do so.  We all know the climate problem at hand.  Currently, there are almost 700,000 liquid fuel boilers in operation in Ireland keeping homes and families warm in the winter.  In general, these boilers are in rural homes which are generally poorly insulated.  The home upgrade cost is large, even with the recently announced SEAI grants.  In general, those living in these homes are the least well-off in our society and cannot afford the larger retrofit programme, even with the grants involved.  The Government wants to retrofit 400,000 homes with heat pumps.  This is not a valid option for the majority of the 700,000 homeowners who use liquid fuel.  Ireland currently does not have the workforce to retrofit 400,000 homes.  When did the Minister last look for a plumber to work in his house?  He would have had a tough job to get plumbers to do 400,000 jobs for him.<\/p>  <p>  This move to retrofit 400,000 homes is really a move to electricity.  We are currently facing - if the Minister has not realised it - an electricity shortage this winter.  Factories are planning production shutdowns due to electricity shortages.  Older people are very nervous.  How do we expect to fit on the electric grid 400,000 homes that are currently being run off-grid?  Boilers run on 90 W motors for a short time during the day.  Their use of electricity is minimal.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is also planning to put thousands of rural jobs in jeopardy again.  The Government needs to look at all options.  There is no silver bullet.  Electricity is not the only show in town and I would like the Minister to realise that.  For the past ten years, Firebird Heating Solutions, Kingspan, Grant Engineering and OFTEC have been doing engineering studies on the use of HVO, hydrotreated vegetable oil, in our boilers.  They have successfully completed all trials and are ready to go.  HVO is fossil fuel free.  It delivers a 90% reduction in CO2 levels, potentially saving 32 million tonnes of CO2.  Will the Minister wake up to issues such as this, if that is possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100022#U01200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1663759320,"counter":182,"content":"<p>The example of what we did on central heating is a very good one.

There was an incredible change over two and a half or three decades.  We are going to have a similar change in the next two and a half or three decades.  We have to do it.  We know we have to switch from the use of fossil fuels to stop the planet from burning.  Another advantage of this is that we will switch to our own natural resources and local fuel.  We will still be using central heating systems.  In many cases, we will still use the same radiators.  It will depend on the particular house.  However, the switch in this case will be to heat pumps because there is a huge efficiency gain.  Underlying this change is that it makes energy sense through the gain it provides in consistent, controlled, high-quality, lower cost heating.  This is where we are going because it makes economic sense, it makes for better, healthier and warmer homes and we will be using our own power supply rather than power imported from Russia, Qatar or anywhere else on distant shores.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Healy-Rae on the quality of Firebird Heating Solutions, Grant and Kingspan Engineering.  We could add Munster Joinery, which is down the road from Ballyvourney, and Glen Dimplex.<\/p> <p>Those first three companies also distribute, sell and make heat pumps.

The signal of this war is to switch away from fossil fuels and we can and will do that in a way that helps and protects our people.  <\/p> <p>  HVO will have a critical role, as the Deputy said.  It is low carbon and involves taking a waste product and turning it into something that can replace oil.  The clear policy and approach set out is to use those HVO fuels in the transport system.  It will take that sector longer and be more difficult for it because the haulage industry and power plant vehicles with which the Deputy will be familiar need oil.  HVO is more expensive and where we do not have an easy electrical alternative, it makes more sense to use it in the transport solutions we need, but not in domestic heating where we have a better alternative.<\/p> <p> That is what the Government policy sets out.  The Climate Action Plan 2021 last autumn sets out how we do this, including through a phased step away from fossil fuel towards the electric alternative.

There are four points.  HVO is fossil fuel free heating because it is made from a waste.  It should have a zero rate of carbon tax, zero duty and a VAT rate of 5% applied to it, if the Government is serious about climate issues in rural Ireland.  It is not a fossil fuel, so why are we taxing it as such for heating?  That is a good point.  The Government should implement that.  The Government can also show how serious it is about the climate issue by extending the biofuel obligations scheme to include HVO.  That is sensible and it should do that.  The Government should work with Irish companies such as Firebird Heating Solutions, Kingspan and Grant to agree a joint plan to make Ireland the world leader in this fossil fuel-free liquid heating and create even more jobs for rural communities.

Finally, after a very long time, it looks like we will get this policy before Christmas.  As part of the consultation process for developing that report, the representatives of all of the islands asked for a number of things.  Very specifically, they asked that the funding model under the LEADER programme be changed and that the islands, altogether, ar fud na t&iacute;re, be recognised as one region and that the funding would go to them as one sub-region.  Despite my best efforts and the best efforts of my colleague in Galway, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and other Deputies, there is little hope of a change so far judging from the answers we have got.  In a week in which we are talking about sustainable goals, t&aacute; deis aige anois beart a dh&eacute;anamh de r&eacute;ir a bhriathair and to do something practical to ensure that there is sustainable living on the islands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100023#V00700","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1663759920,"counter":192,"content":"<p>T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm mar n&iacute;l ach beag&aacute;n Gaeilge agam agus n&iacute; raibh m&eacute; &aacute;balta gach focal a thuiscint ach but if I understand the Deputy's question correctly, it addresses the issue of the future of our islands and how we, as a Government and people, can ensure they thrive.  I will give a number of reflections on that issue.  I had the pleasure of meeting Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann in the past year.  I am very familiar with many of the islands as I spend a great deal of time on a variety of them, which I find to be a very rewarding experience.  It is completely appropriate for the islands to get special attention and treatment because there are tremendous benefits in that in so many different ways.  They are often a microcosm of wider Irish society and a place where we can test and see how we progress.  My great hero is Richard Douthwaite, the great green economist, who used Inishbofin as an example.  He said one can measure what is coming in and coming out and measure progress.  The sad truth about our islands is that there has been a story of decline in population during many decades in the history of the State.  I am glad to say that there are signs that this may be about to turn.  We should look to encourage, accelerate and facilitate that.<\/p>  <p>  Coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, I note that on a number of islands where people are now able to work remotely they are starting to see that the islands are brilliant places to raise a family, live and work, often in different locations at the same time.<\/p>  <p>  I support the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal with regard to the LEADER programme that the islands be treated as a distinct region because they have characteristics that make them different to the rest of the country.<\/p>  <p>  There are also very good and interesting examples in education, which is critical.  On Inis O&iacute;rr, for example, I understand the secondary school has provided a great example that we could use on other islands.  In many ways, if we were to work collectively together, we could have schools sharing resources and shared distance learning.  That is critical in getting young people raised and educated.<\/p>  <p>  One of the benefits of the islands is that they tend to have people who are very skilled in a variety of different ways.  Island people have to be adaptable and able to turn their hand to different tasks.  We could do with teaching the rest of the country some of what we call the island skills.<\/p> <p>We could actually go to the islands and bring back those skills to the rest of the country in a way that would be very beneficial.<\/p> <p> On energy, we have to treat islands differently because, with fossil fuels, it is very dangerous and expensive to bring such fuels out to an island and back.  I was proud in my last term as Minister to double the grants that are specifically for retrofitting insulation of buildings.  We have seen in places like Inis M&oacute;r in the Aran Islands a real success story, although it needs to go further, in terms of how community energy projects can work to improve housing, such as the example I mentioned earlier whereby we switch away.<\/p> <p> My answer to the question is \"Yes\".  These are &aacute;iteanna speisialta and we have to treat them in a different way.  We have to work collectively within the islands to make sure we get the best schools, energy systems, transport systems and jobs.  The Deputy suggested the LEADER scheme could be a path towards that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100023#V00800","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663760520,"counter":194,"content":"<p>On another day, I would enjoy reflecting on the islands but, at this point, we are on the policy and the policy has to reflect what the people want.  I do not have the time to go into that.  The urgency is to get the policy published and then get it based on legislation.  Specifically, I welcome what the Minister is saying in regard to LEADER.  If I hear him correctly, he is saying he agrees that the funding for LEADER should be changed to facilitate the demand, or if not the demand then the request of the islanders that the islands be recognised as a specific region or subregion rather than aligned with each county throughout the country.  That is specifically set out in the representations to us.  I clearly hear the Minister say he supports that, which I welcome.  I am asking him now to do something about that.  If he does not take action, the powers that be are going to proceed with the existing scheme, which does not recognise all of the islands as a subregion or a region of their own.<\/p>  <p>  We are past talking about what the islands can teach us.  We know that.  They are a microcosm of how to do things right.  They have shown resilience.  What we need now is to do something for them in terms of policy, legislation and funding.

This high visibility is continuing.  I am advised that earlier this year, Garda management implemented and has continued a high-profile policing presence plan to reassure the community and to secure confidence in the policing in the area.  This plan includes additional high-visibility pedal cycle patrols in the environs of the local shopping area, additional mobile presence in the community, support of the regional divisional roads policing unit and increased armed presence through patrolling by the regional support unit and armed support unit.

There are changes to the rules so people are now entitled to three months notice rather than the previous 28 days, even in short lets, to avoid someone being evicted through that short-term method.

The climate action plan has a transport section and there is some really good stuff in it in terms of getting more people onto public transport and more people walking and cycling.  However, we could do all of that and still not get the transport emissions reductions we need.  Unless there is both the carrot and the stick, we probably will not hit the 50% target to which we must get.  We need to talk about a national modal shift target and demand management, by which I mean congestion charging, road space reallocation, parking levies and all the things that were talked about in the past.

Regarding how we will deliver these outcomes, the Government's approach of providing for active travel in the budget and aiming to switch towards a 2:1 ratio of investment in support of public transport is the correct way to go.

This situation also puts the onus on the older person to ensure that all aspects of the employee's entitlements are adhered to, such as PAYE, leave and work permits, where applicable.  This aspect must be included on their home insurance.  It is also a requirement for the carer employed to have received training in moving and handling skills.

In a sense, we as a country, coming from the neutral position, as I stated earlier, have a particular role and responsibility to stand up for those international institutions.  It is through those mechanisms in Geneva, which have the first call that we should add our voices to the international court mechanisms to condemn and to convict where the evidence can be developed.

It will empower the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to assess, investigate, authorise, condition or prohibit third-country investments based on a range of security or public order criteria.  As well as equipping the State with the means to protect itself against threats arising from third-country investments, the implementation of a screening mechanism will also provide reassurance to key trading partners that Ireland is a responsible global player, cognisant of the threat posed by the strategic and potentially hostile state-backed investment strategies.  International evidence suggests that the existence of a screening mechanism does not act as a deterrent to inward investment.  The absence of such a mechanism, however, would do untold harm to Ireland's reputation among key investors.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill was developed on foot of the adoption of the EU foreign direct investment, FDI, screening regulation.  That regulation, which came into effect in October 2020, was, in turn, a response to the growing concerns among member states about the potential threat posed by unconstrained third-country investment, that is, investment from outside the EU and the European Economic Area, EEA.  Notwithstanding the overwhelmingly positive impacts of foreign investment, there is growing appreciation globally that in some instances foreign investment can be used as a tool by hostile actors to achieve a range of goals inimical to the interests of the state.  Such goals might include, for example, acquiring access to or control over strategic and sensitive assets or technologies that facilitate disruption to core activities of the state or that permit espionage.  Likewise, investment that results in the export of critical, cutting-edge technologies back to the home of the investor may represent a very real threat to our security and public order.<\/p>  <p>  The role played by third-country state-owned firms is of particular importance in this regard.  To date, there has been no formal investment screening mechanism for foreign investment in Ireland.  While Ireland is not alone in the EU in this regard, the absence of such a screening mechanism leaves Ireland ill-equipped to respond to threats to our security or public order arising from third-country investments.  This screening Bill is designed to address this issue.  Establishing a formal investment screening mechanism represents an opportunity to design and to tailor a system appropriate to Ireland's needs, and the approach set out in this Bill balances Ireland's long-standing foreign direct investment strategy while also acknowledging the challenge posed by potentially hostile investments.  Risks may arise as a result of a wide variety of factors, for instance, based on the source of the investment or the characteristics of the party being acquired across a host of existing and emerging sectors or through a range of deal types, regardless of value.<\/p> <p>Our mechanism, therefore, must be flexible enough to respond to such threats while simultaneously providing as much certainty as possible to the enterprise.<\/p> <p> In response, the Bill defines the nature, scale, and type of investments that will be required to undergo investment screening and sets out the factors to be considered when applying screening to transactions.  It is important to note that the screening mechanism will consider investments through a security and public order lens.  This is not about competitive or public interest tests.  Other tools are available to the State to address such concerns.  It is vital to maintain this exclusive security focus to maximise the effectiveness of the screening mechanism.<\/p> <p> Having provided the background and purpose of the Bill, I will now outline some of its main provisions.  The Bill contains four Parts.  Part 1 primarily deals with matters common to legislation, namely, commencement, interpretation, reporting obligations, and services of documents.  However, also contained within Part 1 are provisions on connected persons, the applicable offences and penalties, as well as provisions on any incurred expenses.<\/p> <p> Part 2 relates to the notification process and the manner in which applicable transactions are reviewed.  The Bill consists of a mandatory element and a discretionary element.  A mandatory notification will apply to investments from third countries relating to particular sectors and technologies.  These are based on Article 4 of the EU regulation.  A range of other criteria relating to ownership and deal-size thresholds also apply and these are expanded upon in the Bill.  In addition, the Minister of the day will be able to initiate screening of other investments which do not require a mandatory notification but which the Minister deems, on reasonable grounds, to pose a risk to security or public order.  This ensures that the screening system is flexible enough to adapt to changing economic and technological developments and allows the Minister to respond to deliberate attempts to circumvent the screening mechanism.<\/p> <p> Section 9 outlines the type of transactions that must be notified to the Minister, while section 10 sets out the notification process itself.  Section 12 sets out the requirement for the Minister to review both notified and non-notifiable transactions where he or she believes such a transaction may impact security or public order.  Section 12(1)(b) provides the Minister with a safety net to review transactions that did not require a mandatory notification but may still pose a threat to security or public order, as previously mentioned.  The applicable time periods during which the Minister can invoke such a provision are set out in the subsection.<\/p> <p> Section 13 outlines the factors the Minister shall consider when reviewing the threat to security or public order posed by a particular transaction.  In conducting such a review, the Minister must consider whether an investor is controlled by a third-country government; the extent to which parties to the transaction are involved in activities related to security or public order; any evidence of criminality among the parties; the likelihood of the transaction resulting in actions that are disruptive or destructive to people, assets, or undertakings in the State; the views of the European Commission and other EU member states; and the views of the investment screening advisory panel.  Under this section, the Minister is also empowered to consult with other Ministers or relevant parties to inform the review process.  The Minister also has the option to enter discussions with the parties to the transaction to mitigate any concerns relating to security or public order.<\/p> <p> Sections 14 to 17, inclusive, relate to the issuing of a screening notice to parties, the process around the notification of the screening decision, and the limitation on transactions under review.  Effectively, a transaction cannot be progressed once screening has commenced and until such point as the review has been completed.  In general, the Minister has 90 days to complete the screening process as per section 16.<\/p> <p> Section 18 outlines the decisions available to the Minister in respect of the outcome of a screening review.  Under section 18(1), once it has been determined that a transaction impacts upon security or public order, the parties to the transaction are required to comply with the Ministers direction.  Section 18(2) provides that where such a determination has been made the transaction cannot be completed other than in accordance with the Minister's direction.  However, under section 18(3), where it is deemed that a transaction poses a threat to security or public order, the Minister may allow the transaction to proceed subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.  Examples of such mitigation measures are set out in section 18(4).  Where those mitigation measures are not sufficient, the Minister may prohibit the transaction.  Under section 18(5), failure to comply with a ministerial screening decision is an offence.<\/p> <p> Section 19 permits the Minister to request additional information from the parties involved in a transaction to assist with the screening review process.  The section outlines the process the Minister is required to adhere to along with the prescribed timelines associated with such a request.  Section 19(5) deals with the provision of false information or failure to comply with an information request, while section 19(6) addresses the issue of legal privilege.<\/p> <p> Section 20 sets out how the timeline for the screening process can be paused upon a request for additional information from the Minister.<\/p> <p> Section 21 enables the parties to a transaction to provide written submissions to the Minister.<\/p> <p> Part 3 consists of four chapters and sets out the appeals mechanism open to the parties concerned.  Significant thought has also gone into the development of these appeals procedures, balancing the need to ensure fair process with the security requirements of the State while also complying with recent case law.<\/p> <p> Chapter 1 details the appointment and conduct of independent adjudicators.  Section 22 outlines the process for the appointment of an independent adjudicator to hear an appeal against the Minister's decision.  The subsequent subsections set out the establishment of an adjudication panel, the necessary qualification criteria, the prevention of conflict of interest, as well as the terms and conditions for appointed adjudicators.  Sections 23 to 25, inclusive, provide for the revocation of appointment as adjudicators, the liability of adjudicators and rules concerning the conduct of appeals before adjudicators.<\/p> <p> Chapter 2 sets out the procedure for appealing a screening decision.  Section 26 provides the avenue for parties to a transaction to appeal a decision of the Ministry.<\/p> <p> Section 27 sets out the procedure for initiating an appeal of a screening decision.  Under this section, appellants must notify the Minister of his or her intention to submit an appeal against a screening decision within 30 days of being informed of such a decision.  Pursuant to section 27(3), the Minister will appoint an adjudicator to hear the appeal once he or she has been made aware the appeal has been filed.  The Minister must notify the appellant and provide the details of the designated adjudicator and set out the means by which the appellant may make his or her appeal.  Thereafter, the appellant has 14 days to file an appeal.  In line with section 27(4), the appellant must state the grounds under which the appeal is being submitted and must provide all documents and evidence upon which the appeal relies.  Section 27(5) states that the Minister is the respondent to the appeal and most state the grounds upon which he or she intends to respond to the appeal, as well as the evidence upon which he or she will rely.  A party to an appeal may not make written submissions to adjudicator other than submissions relating to the grounds stated for the appeal or related to evidence provided under previous sections.  Section 27(9) confirms that an appeal to the adjudicator does not suspend the screening decision that is being appealed.<\/p> <p> Section 28 provides that an appeal may be heard without an oral hearing unless such a hearing is deemed necessary by the adjudicator.<\/p> <p> Section 29 sets out the powers of the adjudicator in the initial screening decision made by the Minister.  The adjudicator may allow the appeal and remit it to the Minister for reconsideration, or the adjudicator may affirm the Minister's decision.  This decision must be notified to the parties concerned as soon as is practicable.<\/p> <p> Chapter 3 contains provisions on how sensitive material and evidence is handled.  Section 30 deals with the ability of the Minister to provide sensitive evidence to the adjudicator in a manner that protects national security.<\/p> <p>Section 31 provides that the Minister may determine that an appeal to the adjudicator can be held in public if it does not create a risk to the security or public order of the State.  Section 32 addresses the need to maintain confidentiality around certain types of information obtained by a party via the appeals process.  Section 33 outlines the grounds for the Minister to approve or designate certain legal representatives in sensitive cases.<\/p> <p> Chapter 4 of Part 3 deals with appeals against the decision of an adjudicator.  Section 34 provides parties to a transaction with the right of appeal to the courts against the finding of an adjudicator.  Subsection (1) states that such an appeal be made by leave of the High Court on a point of law within 30 days of the adjudicator's finding.  It should be noted that under subsection (5), the decision of the High Court is final.<\/p> <p> Section 35 permits the appellant to ask the High Court to suspend a screening decision until such time as the appeal is determined.  Otherwise the lodging of such an appeal does not suspend the initial effect of the screening decision.  Section 36 deals with the issues of sensitive material in an appeal to the High Court.  Subsection (1) provides limitations on the sharing of evidence where a risk to security or public order exists.  Section 37 outlines who may attend an appeal to the High Court.  Attendance is limited to persons deemed necessary given the potential sensitivity of the hearing.<\/p> <p> The final part of the Bill, Part 4, provides for the establishment of an advisory panel to assist the Minister in the decision-making process.  Section 39 looks at the establishment of a screening advisory panel and sets out the process for appointing members to the panel.  It also contains provisions on the rules regarding the number of members of the panel as well as the functions applicable to the panel.  Subsection (4) permits the panel to request assistance from experts as and when required, while subsection (5) allows the Minister to dissolve the panel at any time.<\/p> <p> Section 40 outlines the level of officer to be appointed to the panel as well as the Departments to be represented on it.  Section 41 sets out the various rules relating to the frequency of meetings, the associated quorums and the meeting procedures.  Section 42 permits the panel to engage such consultants or advisers as necessary in the performance of its functions.<\/p> <p> It is essential that we enact the Bill to provide the State with the powers necessary to deter or mitigate the impact from hostile actors acquiring ownership of, or influence over, businesses and assets in order to cause harm to the State.  The mechanism that has been developed is tailored to suit Ireland's needs, ensuring that we remain an attractive location for foreign direct investment while being a safe and responsible location in which to do business.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to engaging with Deputies on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100028#FF00200","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663763820,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I welcome the newly appointed Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  I wish him all the very best in his role and I very much look forward to working constructively with him over the remaining period of government, although we all may wish different things for the duration of it.  I wish him the very best.<\/p>  <p>  I am grateful to have an opportunity to say a few words on this important Bill.  It is extremely technical but it is also political in its nature in the context of geopolitics and ensuring the security and safety of the State and its citizens.  Unlike many other EU member states, Ireland does not have a regime for screening foreign direct investment in key infrastructure.  The Screening of Third Country Transactions Bill 2022 seeks to change this and give significant powers to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Bill, which aims to provide the Government with powers to protect security or public order from hostile actors using ownership of, or influence over, businesses and assets to harm the State, introduces a foreign direct investment screening process.  This will allow the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to assess, investigate, authorise, condition or prohibit third-country investments in key Irish industries and sectors.<\/p>  <p>  On this point I want to establish from the Minister of State, if I could, that the definition of \"third countries\" captures investment in Ireland from Britain and the US.  We have 893 IDA Ireland-backed US foreign direct investment companies in the State and 161 from Britain.  For reference, there are only 267 from the rest of the world outside the EU.  If it does include the US and Britain, and I believe all investments in strategic assets and sectors should be screened, the legislation will place a significant burden on the State compared with our European neighbours.  If this is the case, I ask that ample resources be set aside to make sure the screening time is as quick as it possibly can be.  I am sure that businesses would very much appreciate this certainty.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill as it is drafted creates a mandatory notification obligation for parties to third-country transaction acquisitions, agreements or other activities with a value of &euro;2 million or more in designated sectors or involving sensitive or strategic activities that result in a change of control of an asset or undertaking in the State.  This is the point to which I will return later with regard to the current control of strategic assets and undertakings in the State.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, the Bill forms part of a broader effort by the European Union to encourage co-operation and information exchanges between member states and the European Commission on foreign direct investment from third countries.  Given the work of IDA Ireland in attracting foreign direct investment to the State, the legislation creates a change but one that can be of benefit.  Nevertheless, it will place additional burdens on the State, the Department and businesses.  For instance, when requested by other EU member states and-or the Commission, Ireland is obliged under the EU foreign direct investment screening regulation to provide information on any relevant transaction involving foreign direct investment, including details of the target's ownership structure, products, services and business operations.  It is also obliged to declare to other EU member states where the target conducts relevant business operations.<\/p>  <p>  At the core of the legislation, from a purely technical perspective, is the protection of security and public order from hostile actors who would seek to use ownership of, or influence over, businesses and assets to harm the State.  It will empower the Minister to respond to threats to Ireland's security or public order posed by particular types of foreign investment and to prevent or mitigate such threats.  While I understand the need for this, I ask for further clarification on the powers of the Minister to assess, investigate, authorise, condition or prohibit third-country investments based on a range of security and public order criteria.  This is so that when the legislation is passed there is certainty on the part of investors and the State and we do not leave ourselves open to accusations of bias or of being used as a pawn in geopolitics.  I say this because we should not forget where the EU regulation came from.  It came about following a European Parliament resolution and a joint letter sent by three member states, namely, Italy, Germany and France, asking the Commission to adopt a new regulation on the screening of foreign direct investment.<\/p>  <p>  The EU regulation comes in the middle of the crisis of the globalisation dogma being threatened by the commercial wars happening between the global powers.  Anyone who reads over the speeches regarding this EU regulation in the European Parliament will see that the extreme neoliberal approach of the EU policies pursued, which make the EU the most open economy in the world, was rarely questioned and the real target of this EU legislation is most likely China.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the timeframes for screening decisions, the legislation states that a decision must be made by the Minister within 90 days from the date of notification and that this may be extended by a period of up to 135 days at the discretion of the Minister.  Is the 90-day limit for extreme cases or is it the Minister of State's expectation that all cases will take 90 days?  With regard to the allowance for Ministers to use discretion in this instance, but also to use national security as a reason not to give information for why an investment was rejected, I hope these powers are wielded with careful consideration.  Security is absolutely important but so too are openness, transparency and trust.<\/p>  <p>  To return to a broader political point on investment screening and who controls assets and infrastructure in the State, the housing crisis, the energy crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic have helped to highlight the need for certain assets and infrastructure in the State to be appropriately controlled.  I do not think there is any doubt in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Investment and control of assets and infrastructure are not just a problem with hostile third-country actors.  There is investment from within Europe and private entities that is problematic but is rarely spoken about.  The EU forced liberalisation or sell-off agenda of strategic assets has seen energy, transport and telecommunications pass into the hands of private business.<\/p> <p>What good has the privatisation of public transport done?  We saw the difficulties this caused during Covid because of the sell-off of Aer Lingus, while every week I get emails from constituents with regard to the same bus routes operated by Go-Ahead, the 33A, 33B and 102.  As we deal with the energy crisis, can anyone tell us what good the sell-off and privatisation of energy has done for Ireland or anywhere else in the EU?<br\/><br\/>Businesses and people are seeing their energy bills double and treble as energy companies pay out dividends to stakeholders.  What has the response across Europe been?  Many countries have suspended the liberalisation of energy.  France has spent more than &euro;9 billion and concluded a public takeover bid to completely nationalise Electricit&eacute; de France and Germany is nearing the full nationalisation of gas giant, Uniper.  <br\/><br\/>The State has had to step back in on the telecommunications front to roll out a national broadband programme because the private market simply will not do it.  Where is the oversight of domestic, EU and third-party capital used to invest in both new and second-hand properties in the Irish housing market and which is having a significant impact on the housing sector?  Only this weekend, in the<i>Business Post<\/i>, there was a story about British weapons dealer, BAE Systems, which made &euro;2.4 million in profit by divesting itself of 43 second-hand Irish homes that it had only bought one year previously.  Where was the screening of the sell-off of these strategic assets?<br\/><br\/>Will the legislation cover companies that have invested in assets and undertakings in the State and have egregious records on workers' rights and dubious records on the protection of human rights?  I doubt it, especially when we have Ministers who go on trade missions to states that have no respect for human rights - never mind workers' rights - and are engaged in wars, either directly or by proxy, that are causing untold misery.<br\/><br\/>This Bill is a significant piece of work and it is necessary.  We do not want to see our strategic assets fall into the hands of hostile actors and we must do all we can to protect against that.  It is important that the State defends strategic sectors, sensitive technologies and infrastructure.  Given the geopolitical character of the EU legislation underpinning this Bill, I hope it is not used as an instrument to pressure Ireland or any other small states on which FDI we can and cannot accept from our larger European neighbours.  While I have my political differences with the Minister of State, I trust his judgment on what is best for this State over a minister from a state that does not have Ireland's interests at heart.<br\/><br\/>While we support this investment screening Bill, it must be said there is another way to protect critical assets and infrastructure, namely, through public control over critical sectors.  As I said before, in what I hope will be some food for thought for the new Minister of State to take back to his Government colleagues, we do not want to see our strategic assets fall into the hands of hostile third countries but nor do we want them to fall into the hands of private interests who have no care for this State or the people in it.  Strategic assets should be kept in the hands of the Irish State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100030#HH00200","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663764420,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to his new post and wish him all the very best for the time ahead.  This legislation is clearly necessary.  We have had considerable direct investment into Ireland, the vast majority of which has been very successful.  IDA Ireland has done an excellent job.  International corporations have employed many people in many regions of the country and have not just generated income for people but also new skills that would not otherwise have been created.  We have to recognise and understand.  However, this legislation looks beyond that to the dangers that exist and we have to acknowledge that as well.<\/p>  <p>  We recognise that our own homegrown criminal fraternity has spread its tentacles across the globe.  Many of the criminal organisations that engage in drug and human trafficking and make substantial amounts of money use that money to invest in what would normally be considered to be legitimate enough business enterprises.  They can do that in other countries and expand in their home regions where they may have started off and where, unfortunately, much of the misery they created can be seen.  We understand that.  It is important, therefore, that we have a mechanism in place to screen against that particular type of activity and against the rogue regimes in some parts of the world that engage in similar types of activities.<\/p>  <p>  As my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, pointed out, Ireland and most other European countries have free and open market economies and we invite investment in.  We talk about Europe and the free movement of trade and people but the free movement of capital, more than anything else, is what has made Europe what it is.  The free movement of capital is associated with great danger because it operates in an uncontrolled manner.  In essence, the legislation seeks to do something about that and to understand that we must be very careful about where these investments come from, what end role they may have and how they can, at times, have a very negative effect on a country.  One of the big issues, certainly for those of us on the left of politics, that causes us deep concern are the dangers associated with the privatisation of so many of the vital services provided to our people, for example, in health and transport.<\/p>  <p>  The way in which the Russian invasion of Ukraine has unfolded has brought home to many of us not just the problems that arise from the point of view of international politics but also from the point of view of the bread-and-butter issues that ordinary people have to deal with.  We see the price of everything going through the roof as a result.  Much of that is because we do not have our own capital in place to provide services and energy here in Ireland or, at least, close to Ireland and over which we have control.  They are controlled in these global spheres which are very dangerous.  We have to understand that.<\/p>  <p>  Criminal fraternities may also be involved in much of this type of activity.  Ireland is unique because we developed the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  We were one of the first countries to develop such a body.  The CAB has been copied in many countries around the world and is seen as an example of how to find and dispose of criminal assets.  I have some concerns in this regard as I believe the capacity of the Criminal Assets Bureau is being withdrawn or closed down somewhat but I will raise that with the Minister for Justice when I get the chance.<\/p>  <p>  We need to recognise that the problems we have around the globe exist mainly because globalisation has occurred.  While globalisation has some positives, it has many negatives.  There are many negatives from the point of view of the countries which produce much of the wealth.  We are all very glad to get cheap commodities in the western world but we have to recognise that they come at a cost to unfortunate people in other parts of the world who are often exploited.  Deputy O'Reilly spoke of trade missions to countries with poor records on human rights, but also on workers' rights, including the hours people work and the salaries they receive for the very hard work they put in.  An ethics model is needed in all of this.  It should not just be about the danger posed to Ireland but the danger that arises when these types of corporations exert their influence everywhere.

I look forward to working with him for the betterment of the people we are here to serve.<\/p>  <p>  As has been stated, the Screening of Third Country Transactions Bill 2022 seeks to provide Ireland with screening of foreign direct investment in key infrastructure in strategic sectors.  People might be shocked to learn that such a formal screening process is not already in place.  We have seen substantial privatisation of infrastructure over the past 20 years.  It is alarming that it has taken so long to bring forward legislation on screening FDI in the public interest.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill has been produced in response to an EU regulation that aims to establish the EU-wide framework for screening FDI.  The regulation aims to facilitate information sharing and co-operation between member states and non-EU foreign direct investment.<\/p> <p>While the EU has competency for FDI in a number of areas, this is predominantly a national competency as it relates to national security and public order.  The importance of this legislation cannot be overstated.  It is long overdue and it is vital we work together to ensure robust protections are in place.<\/p> <p> One aspect of the EU regulation relates to information on the ownership structure of companies.  Beneficial owners should never be allowed to hide behind complex legal structures.  We have far too little transparency when it comes to corporate ownership and finance in general.  This has huge implications far beyond the scope of this Bill relating to our ability to govern and tax the private sector nationally and internationally.  In this Bill it has a direct implication for our ability to effectively screen FDI in strategically important sectors.  We need to be more ambitious in this legislation and go beyond the overly narrow definition of national security and public order envisaged by the EU.<\/p> <p> The driving force behind this move at EU level was the investment in infrastructure by Chinese state companies in Europe.  The former President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, stated: \"If a foreign, state-owned, company wants to purchase a European harbour, part of our energy infrastructure or a defence technology firm, this should only happen in transparency, with scrutiny and debate.\"  That is a completely sensible proposal on the face of it.  The then Commission President's statement related to the Port of Piraeus in Greece and a Portuguese electric company that were bought by Chinese state-affiliated companies.  However, the irony was not lost on the Greeks and Portuguese as both countries were forced to privatise these important national assets by the troika under austerity.<\/p> <p> Like its origins in the EU, the legislation before us has a very narrow focus on state actors.  While this should no doubt form part of it, we need to also look at the potential risks related to private interests taking control of important national infrastructure or key sectors more broadly.  We are currently suffering the consequences of the privatised electricity market.  Our domestic gas asset, the Corrib field, which the Minister of State and I are very familiar with from our constituency, is completely in private ownership.  In recent years, we have allowed a genomics company to collect DNA from 400,000 citizens without proper public debate or scrutiny.  International property companies have also caused serious disruption to housing provision in this State.<\/p> <p> In principle, Sinn F&eacute;in supports screening FDI to defend strategic sectors, sensitive technologies and infrastructures.  However, this will always have a limited impact unless we look at a different approach to public control and governance over these sectors.  Austerity policy and privatisation were a big driver in causing these problems across the EU and that needs to be recognised.  This legislation is a step in the right direction but there is scope to strengthen the Bill to protect our citizens and our assets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100031#JJ00300","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663765020,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I join others in congratulating the Minister of State on his recent appointment.  We look forward to working closely with him in the coming period.<\/p><p>This Bill is about protection of the security or public order of the State.  In a globalised world with complex technologies and equally complex supply chains it is clear that our day-to-day lives are acutely vulnerable to the malign actions of state or non-state actors which could seek to disrupt our lives for their own political, economic or simply criminal purposes.  The true scale of our vulnerability was brought home by the hack of the HSE's data systems, which was an act of malice conducted by a group with evidence of informal links to Russian security services.<\/p><p>The current energy crisis exposes the vulnerability of the EU for its overreliance on entities that believe their strategic interests are fundamentally different from ours.  Unfortunately, the world is still haunted by the spectre of totalitarianism.  The hostility to the EU from authoritarian regimes and their supporters both inside and outside the EU poses a significant long-term threat to our economic well-being.  It is in this strategic context that it is clear we need to pay more attention to who owns or controls key components of our societal infrastructure.  We must acknowledge we are an open trading country where FDI is and has been the cornerstone of our industrial policy and we are uniquely dependent on external companies for our economic well-being.  There is no doubt that any mechanism to scrutinise external transactions has the potential to place a comparatively larger burden on our economy than on others in Europe.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to put in place a legal mechanism to enable a Minister to review business deals and transactions to ensure they do not put the security or public order of the State at risk.  It is being brought about as a direct result of the need for Ireland to implement Regulation (EU) 2019\/452.  In commentary on the Bill the T&aacute;naiste has stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThis new law is to give us the power to intervene if a non-EU actor is seeking to make an investment which would threaten our security or public order.  I think it's an important safeguard, which I hope we never have to use. <\/blockquote>  <p>I agree with him that this is an important safeguard.  However, I am a little concerned that there may be some reluctance apparent on the Minister's part to use this legislation.  I would be concerned if we ended up with a mechanism essentially rendered toothless by the political reluctance of Ministers to face down vested private interests.  We should have no doubt that for every transaction sent for examination, there will undoubtedly be vested interests of business lobbying strongly for even the worst transaction to go through smoothly on the basis of their own economic interest.  Therefore, it is just not good enough for a Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to have the power; he or she must be prepared to use it, even in the face of political pressure from many sources for a deal to go through.<\/p><p>Ultimately though, this legislation alone will not be sufficient.  It is increasingly clear to me and the Labour Party that one of the outcomes of the current energy crisis and the pandemic has been to restore the economic role of the democratic state as an actor in our economy, and this has vindicated many economists.  The growth in public spending in Ireland is likely to result in a permanently higher level of public spending.  We need a more prominent role for the State in the economy and this goes beyond just implementation of a single EU regulation.  We need that more prominent role to protect ourselves from externally created security risks but we also need it in other areas.  The cost and availability of housing, for example, are a chronic danger to our competitiveness but also fundamentally to almost all aspects of the functioning of our economic model.  To address that high cost the existing developer-driven housing model needs to be radically disrupted.<\/p><p>The Labour Party supports the aims of this Bill.  However, the challenge for everyone is to balance on one hand the risks of having essentially inactive or useless legislation and, on the other, the potential damage to FDI if the process becomes a disincentive or a drag on ordinary transactions.  Ultimately, we need a complete review of our industrial strategy.  To build a more robust domestic economy we must overcome the challenge of growing an internationally-traded sector comprised of medium and large Irish companies as well as a strong State sector to protect our strategic assets, while all the time standing up to the external threats, private and public.  We look forward to working with the Minister of State on the progress of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100032#KK00200","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1663765020,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Deputies Cathal Crowe and Patricia Ryan are not with us.

I join others in congratulating the Minister of State on his new position.<\/p>  <p>  This is an important piece of work the Minister of State has brought before the House.  If it was not as immediately and transparently important prior to Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, the need for this legislation is now clear and obvious to everybody.  I very much agree with some of the points made by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on the primacy of the state in terms of acting in the best interests of the citizen.  There was much in the speeches made by Deputies O'Reilly and Martin Kenny that I take issue with but the common factor is the idea that we need state actors - our State - to be involved in the protection of the strategic infrastructure that benefits our citizenry.<\/p>  <p>  Much of this Bill is about the regulation of dark money.  It is often said that sunlight is the best disinfectant.<\/p> <p>Really what we are doing here is trying to make sure sunlight is cast on how money is spent within our economy.  National borders have become ever more permeable.  In capitalism, capital has always flowed but now increasingly, ever more regularly, information also flows.  With information flows influence.  We see this not just in terms of physical, strategic assets and the buying up of strategic infrastructure but also in the trading of information.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to the hacking of the IT systems in the HSE and the massive impact that had.  It is vitally important for the protection of the interests of everybody in the State that we know where money is being spent and for what reason it is being spent.<br\/><br\/>The Higher Education Authority Bill 2022 was a significant piece of work that has passed through the Houses.  I spoke to amendments on Committee Stage of that Bill about having transparency as to who is spending money within our third level education system.  The State has a very large interest in that, a very clear and obvious interest in terms of the provision of education, but it also has a significant monetary stake.  There are other people investing within our third level system and I am not sure we have the clarity or transparency about who is investing and exactly why.<br\/><br\/>The 2019 regulation was prescient in some ways but we have seen now a resource war within Europe, a war that is being fought with resources.  We are seeing it playing out not just in our politics here in this House, where we saw it very clearly during Leaders' Questions today, but across Europe where the energy crisis and the weaponisation of energy are being used as weapons of war by a malign state actor.  Increasingly as the climate crisis intensifies and deepens we are going to see resource wars waged across the western world, be that in terms of energy or water.  We will see information wars waged as well.  I think we would all welcome clarity about where the spend is going, particularly in respect of social media companies and the regulation of media.  There is a need for clarity about how that level of information or disinformation, or the control of the flows of information, is having an impact on our democracies across the western world.<br\/><br\/>I refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>from October 2021 about research work that was done as part of the Pandora papers.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>established that an empty office in a service building on Fitzwilliam Street Lower in Dublin 2 was the registered address of more than 800 limited partnerships, a type of legal structure designed to allow investors to invest in businesses while limiting their exposure.  That is all fine and well, as it is an entirely legal structure.  In this case, we saw that the bulk of the limited partnerships registered at this address involved partners based in offshore jurisdictions, set up for clients from Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet countries.  The net effect is that the people using the partnerships control an entity that is based in an EU member state while their identity remains completely obscure.  That was 800 companies out of one brass-plate office, funded from who knows where and for who knows what reason.<br\/><br\/>This Bill is a move in the right direction in terms of trying to provide for transparency, to make sure we know what that money is being spent on.  I refer back to Article 4 of the EU regulation of 2019.  Deputy O'Reilly's view on it was quite jaundiced and probably quite Eurosceptic.  However, in some cases a little bit of scepticism about motivation is entirely warranted.  I am interested to note that some of the critical infrastructure referred to in that regulation was around electoral infrastructure.  We have certainly seen moneys spent in western economies by malign actors to push towards one outcome or another.  We should in no way imagine ourselves to be immune from that kind of influence here in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I also see critical inputs around energy and raw materials.  That has become incredibly obvious to us over the last number of months.  To take a forward-facing view, an area we may not pay quite enough attention to is domains around things like artificial intelligence, robotics, cybersecurity, aerospace, and moves towards quantum and nuclear technologies.  All of these are very much going to shape our lives in the coming years and in a fairly short timeframe.  Who would have thought that mobile phone technology would so completely revolutionise our lives in such a short space of time?  We need to be taking actions now to protect ourselves from things like investment in artificial intelligence.  There are certainly moves in that direction.  I want to make sure that money spent on that type of technology within Ireland is done for the benefit of Irish citizens and the State.  The Bill is a useful step in the right direction towards ensuring that transparency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100032#KK00400","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663765620,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State.  Unlike many EU member states, Ireland does not currently have a regime for screening FDI in key infrastructure.  The Bill aims to address this by providing the Government with powers to protect security or public order from hostile actors using ownership of or influence over businesses and assets to harm the State.  It is quite a technical Bill but very relevant to the current global situation.  It introduces a screening process which allows the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to regulate FDI from countries outside the EU and the EEA in key Irish industries and sectors.  It creates a mandatory notification obligation for parties, third country transactions and other activities with a value of &euro;2 million or more in designated sectors which result in a change of control of an asset or undertaking in Ireland.  The Bill will provide the Government with the powers to protect security or public order from hostile actors using ownership of or influence over businesses and assets to harm the State.  It will empower Ministers to respond to threats to Ireland's security or public order posed by particular types of foreign investment and to prevent or mitigate such threats.<\/p>  <p>  One area that needs urgent attention is the lack of oversight of EU and foreign capital that is being used to invest in the Irish housing market.  Unfortunately, the Government rolls out the red carpet for institutional investors to distort our housing market.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will prioritise ordinary workers, their families and our older people.  We will take the red carpet from institutional investors and roll it out for the working poor and those who have to emigrate if they want to secure an affordable, rentable home under this Government, let alone the chance to own their own home.  We cannot have a Government that cares more for tax-avoiding real estate investment trusts, REITs, than it does for the people who contact me daily, who languish at the bottom of housing lists with little hope of securing one of the two properties within the housing assistance payment, HAP, limits currently available in Kildare.  There is a lack of oversight for investment from companies and countries that have extremely poor workers' rights or human rights records.

I also wish to compliment the Minister of State's staff.  The format of his opening statement is excellent.  It is the first time I have seen formatting like that.  Whoever is involved, I hope we see more of it and that their lead will be followed across other Government Departments.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue and I look forward to supporting its passage through the Oireachtas.  The Minister of State was 100% correct in referencing how important FDI is to this country.  We have all lived through the 1980s and remember the mass unemployment, mass emigration and mass depression.  The multinational sector was one of the factors - just one of them - that dragged us out of that dark period in Irish history.  All we have to do is look at the corporation tax receipts.  We have &euro;6 billion of a surplus for the first time in 15 years.  That is going to have a massive impact on the budget next Tuesday.  However, it is not all just about corporation tax and the tax haul.  Significant skills are passed on by the FDI sector as well.  A lot of Irish people who work for those companies eventually go on to establish their own SMEs and contribute to the indigenous Irish economy.  It is right that we should maintain an accommodating and supportive environment for multinationals in Ireland, within reason.<\/p> <p>We should be able to provide a screening system so that the companies that are here or companies even considering coming here are aware that at least we have some basic screening tools to protect them from cyber, industrial and commercial espionage.<\/p> <p> Second, I think most people in the country are very happy with how Ireland conducts its business internationally.  We are an honest broker.  We engage in good faith with other countries.  To be fair, the vast majority of countries reciprocate and engage in good faith with us.  However, it would be very na&iuml;ve to think that every country does and will.  The Irish public, over the past 12 months, got a sample of what other malign actors are out there geopolitically when they saw some of the behaviour and conduct of a very small number of embassies here in Dublin.  It is very important that we are aware there is a threat and risk and that we have the appropriate structures and mechanisms in place.<\/p> <p> Ireland is a great place to live; I would not want to live anywhere else.  We do a lot of things very well and we do a lot of things very poorly.  Of all the things we do very poorly, security is what we do most poorly of all.  Whether it is energy, cyber or national security, we just do not seem to do security at all.  This legislation will certainly help in that regard.  At least it is a half step in the right direction.<\/p> <p> Turning to the technical aspects of the Bill, it strikes the appropriate balance, and \"balance\" is the key word.  It provides us with the opportunity at least to screen, to deter, to mitigate and to prohibit, if necessary, but it also allows for an accommodative posture as well.<\/p> <p> I like a number of things in the Bill.  I particularly like the appeals mechanism.  I like that companies have recourse in the courts if necessary.  What I like most about the Bill is the multidisciplinary aspect of the advisory panel.  We talk about diversity a lot in boardrooms and organisations and that is generally interpreted as gender balance or age balance between the young and the old, which are import things for sure, but we rarely recognise the importance for skills diversity.  To have input from defence, justice, foreign affairs, finance, transport and communications is a very good panel if it is implemented properly.<\/p> <p> In summary, I am happy this Bill is before the House and I am happy to support it.  I have one lasting thought.  Most of the law that comes from the EU is good.  Not all of it, but most of it is good.  This is an example of good law that we need to transpose now into domestic law.  The point I would like to leave the Minister of State with is that if it was not for the EU nudging and prodding us along this direction, I very much doubt we would be having this conversation today and that this Bill would be before the House.  I am grateful in this instance that we are in the European Union.

He has served in that Department before, so he will hit the ground running.  I wish him every success.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill.  However, I would like to add some context.  The record of foreign direct investment, FDI, in Ireland has been exemplary.  That is something we should also stress in bringing in this sort of regulation.  The professionalism of the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, is second to none.  The quality of investment it has brought in is outstandingly high.  I fear that some people in this House understate the contribution that FDI has made to the success of our economy and never miss the opportunity to attack our FDI sector, blaming it for an electricity shortage because of its investment in data centres or laying blame on it for alleged unfair work practices in other countries that are not directly linked to FDI in many cases.  We need to value what has been achieved by the FDI sector.<\/p>  <p>  Even since 2011, when I had the privilege to be appointed Minister, which was just ten years ago, there has been an 88% increase in employment in IDA companies.  That is 130,000 extra people employed in those companies and an undisputed multiplier of more than one for one.  This means there are 130,000 other jobs in the economy as a result of that.  Their wage levels are &euro;57,000 - exceptionally high - on average, which is much higher than the average wages in other sectors.  They have also been very instrumental in modernising the approaches in our economy, in lifting the levels of training, management experience and start-ups and have created an environment that has been absolutely invaluable to the success of the Irish economic model.  We should not lose sight of that.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, it is necessary that we recognise that in a world where data is becoming the new source of wealth and the control of data is often hard to track, we need to be much more conscious of regulatory controls and the fear that it gets into wrong hands.  The control for political purposes of strategic infrastructure is not an idle fear.  We have seen it time and again, not only in aggressive and often criminal cyberattacks, but also through investment channels, which deserve scrutiny.  Therefore, the intention of this Bill is welcome.  I see it as copperfastening our confidence in the quality of our FDI infrastructure, rather than in any way casting some doubt on the quality of the work of the IDA or the type of investment that it has cultivated.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at the experience in other countries where this type of instrument is in place, it shows that only 1% of transactions that have come under scrutiny have been blocked.  Therefore, this is not a widespread practice.  However, it is one that we need to move on early to prevent it taking hold by those who would seek to undermine the infrastructures that support democratic societies such as our own.<\/p>  <p>  It deserves more thinking among the political class, and those who seek to regulate new industry, about the models we have developed and how they contrast with some other countries where there is complete political control of media, information flows and data among citizens.  We need to value the type of environment that we have here, but not pretend that is devoid of threat.  The significant flows of data and the lack of regulatory oversight in many cases of companies that control these and the rules and principles that they apply is something the regulators the world over in open democratic societies, such as our own, have to take more seriously.  We do not want to see what I heard one political commentator describe as &ldquo;political entrepreneurs&rdquo; exploiting the nature of data management in democratic countries such as our own.  Therefore, it is right that we are considering not only the investment by entities that might seek to distort the infrastructures that we depend on, but also think more strategically ourselves about those.<\/p>  <p>  I have one last comment.  Everyday in this House, I hear blame being applied to companies that seek to have data centres.  Of 275,000 employees in IDA companies, 158,000 of those are in either ICT or business services.  They depend on data centres to be the infrastructure that underpins them.  Let us be blunt.  The EU has consciously created an emissions trading system that promotes the location of those data centres in the countries where they are most efficient, and that is Ireland.  We should not be pointing the finger at data centres for the failure of our energy system to meet the demand, which is an increased demand of 8% in five years.<\/p>  <p>In the case of commitments made to deliver additional power to our infrastructure, the failure is by the entities which contracted to deliver in auctions.  It is all too easy for people to point fingers at others who invest in good faith in critical infrastructures that the EU recognises are efficiently delivered in Ireland and which do not fall onto the Irish inventory of carbon emissions.  Our obligations do not relate to data centres because they are in the emissions trading system.  We need a little more honesty in some of these debates about the role, importance and needs of multinational companies in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100034#MM00400","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663766820,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, I am going to break the habit of a lifetime.

In this regard, we are talking about critical infrastructure companies.  We all get that we are in a very different and dangerous world.  On some level, maybe it is not too different.  We believed we were in a safe and secure situation, particularly in Europe or the West.  Obviously, that has gone out the window since the Russian invasion.  In addition, we are aware of the states, state actors and even semi-contractor state actors that operate in a way that is not necessarily in accordance with the generally accepted rules of engagement.  In light of the attacks on the HSE and whatever else, we are aware that it is vital to have some sort of screening process.<\/p><p>I echo the remarks of colleagues regarding the need to ensure that this is not used as negative leverage against the level of FDI in the State, that all the protections we have and are required are in place and that all the necessary due diligence is completed.  I do not think anyone would operate on the basis that we need to ensure strategic autonomy, whether that is at European Union level or domestic level.  Through the years, there have been certain core infrastructure companies that the State did not maintain when it ought to have done so, and we have paid the price for that.  No matter where National Broadband Ireland, NBI, is in respect of the delivery of broadband, I think all Members accept that we would have started from a better place if Telecom &Eacute;ireann had never been privatised.  For multiple reasons, we need to make sure we have all the protections that are required.<\/p><p>In the 17 seconds I have remaining, I will do my best to deal with protections and the State.

We expect great things and I have no doubt that our expectation will be delivered upon.<\/p>  <p>  There are many ways to approach this legislation.  On Second Stage, we have relative liberty to approach it in any way we choose but the most important thing in respect of this matter is reputation.  It is the reputation of Ireland Inc. and that of our economy.  It is our reputation as an outward-looking country that thrives in the realm of export but, crucially, also in investment.  By passing the Bill and, in turn, transposing the related directive we will further reinforce Ireland's reputation as a wonderful place to do business, invest and recruit top-quality staff.  Obviously, this legislation is protecting the State, the European Union and the wider Single Market but it is also protecting our reputation.  That is why I encourage the Minister of State and colleagues in this House and the Upper House to ensure the swift passage of the Bill and the swift transposition of the directive, as has been done already in other EU member states.  Deputy Bruton made the point that it has only been used in 1% of flagged cases.  This is the crucial importance of this legislation.  There is a very small threat but if that threat is allowed to get into the ecosystem of the Single Market, it will cause untold damage not just to individual persons but to the reputation of the entire Single Market, the world's largest economic bloc.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill allows and requires us to reflect on the importance of FDI in the State, going back to the early establishment of the IDA and the foresight of T.K. Whitaker.  I am not going to lurch into a history lesson or offer my historical considerations on that point but I wish to underline that while we talk about the importance of FDI and cheer on great investments, huge job announcements, expansions, the recruitment of staff and diversification in the regions - of course, all Members welcome the fact that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland activity is bringing job growth in every region of the country at this moment - we have to remember the fragility of the FDI model.  These wonderful large or not so large companies from the US or outside the European Union that are prepared to come to Ireland and invest greatly should not be taken for granted.  Their presence here is not accompanied by some sort of guarantee.  We have to protect that model which has served the State so well for so long, particularly at this delicate point in global economic affairs.  Since the election of this iteration of the D&aacute;il, we have come through a global pandemic the likes of which had not been seen in more than a century, yet, in 2020 alone, Ireland welcomed &euro;839 billion in FDI from America and &euro;15 billion from the UK.  When we were in the darkest point of the storm, FDI was there to ensure that people could continue to receive a salary.  These companies were flexible and allowed people to work remotely.  They were cautious and made sure they followed the public health advice but they kept the economic train going and that allowed the Government to provide the finest level of supports to the population and businesses of any developed country in the world, as noted by the OECD today.<\/p> <p>That is never reflected on.  There is great talk about doom and gloom and how big multinationals are forcing data centres to put a huge drain on our electricity supply and on our grid but when we reflect on the situation in other countries, be they close to home in the European Union or in less developed regions, we manage to get a great many things right in this State, collectively.  This is not just praising the Government, but collectively across the entire House and most importantly our business sector.  When we get things right, particularly our model of foreign direct investment, FDI, we have to be very careful to ensure we can maintain it.  Those people who say we can simply lump loads of taxes on the big multinationals and they can pay for everything, must be wary that there are always alternatives.  They are not simply coming to Ireland because we are a bit of craic.  They come because we have a great model.  At the heart of that model is a believe not only in the rule of law but a belief in our population, a highly educated, English speaking, outward looking population that welcomes FDI.  This sort of legislation of course comes from the European Union with collective input from Ireland.  This will strengthen the Single Market and Ireland's place within it.  In the next couple of years coming out of the pandemic and facing the current global challenges that the war in Ukraine and so much else poses, this will place Ireland in as strong a position as is possible.  It is a position that is the envy of most other countries in the European Union but a position that cannot be taken for granted.  It is a reputation that cannot be taken for granted.  My key closing point is to ensure that this legislation is passed swiftly, thoroughly and most importantly that it is transposed in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100035#NN01900","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663767420,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh leis an Aire St&aacute;it.  We are delighted to see him back in harness.  Whatever he does this time, I ask him not to let anyone try to attempt to take it off him.  He was a capable and engaging Minister the previous time I dealt with him from 2007 to 2011 and since then, and I wish him well with the portfolio.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding this legislation, the Screening of Third Country Transactions Bill 2022 from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, yes FDI has played a huge part in our country.  I can go back to Merck Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme.  It has longevity and is nearly there as long as myself.  I remember I was a buachall &oacute;g when it came.  It is a fabulous company.  It is there 50 years or more, provides wonderful employment and is a wonderful company.  There are huge numbers in FDI with huge employment and many plants.  The Liebherr plant is one I know in the construction sector in Kerry, but I will leave it to the Healy-Raes to mention it, and many others that have done such gallant work.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting, as we see some people getting ready for government, that we no longer have the clamour to get rid of corporation tax from the parties of the left, on my right.  Indeed we have other parties that clamour on a daily basis with outdated ideas that these are anathema and we should not have them.  They bring in a huge amount of taxation.  I will not get involved in any of that but obviously we have to have checks and balances as well.  The perception with the data centres is a very sad one because when people face electricity outages the blame is being apportioned to them.  They came in legally through our mechanisms.  They were probably enticed in.  The EU is happy to have them here for a number of reasons but we should not demonise them because we want more of them to come and to be able to stay here.  However, as I said we have weak spots in legislation in many areas.  Certainly any of the FDI companies I know of have good records.  That is not to say they are all impeccable and we need to keep a close eye on them to make sure we are not a dumping ground for off finance and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned Merck Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme.  I would like to mention many of employees I know both past and present.  One very dedicated former employee who passed away recently was the late George Kelly of Cappagh White and Kilsheelan in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann.  George was a very active, engaged and well-respected member of the workforce in Merck Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme in Ballydine in Clonmel for years.  In his retirement he made a huge contribution in the community in which he lived and in Kilsheelan Tidy Towns etc.<\/p>  <p>  While we are passing the legislation there are senior Members of the Government and indeed the Taoiseach regularly going out to the World Economic Forums and to the Bilderberg conference.  What is going on there?  We have no legislation for it.  People are getting worried about who we are serving, what master we are serving.  I said this earlier even though the Ceann Comhairle thought I was being theatrical.  It is fact.  People see this.  We are meant to look after our citizens in this country, not kowtowing to wealthy multibillion dollar people with huge resources and what they want the world to do for them and for us to be good boys and sign up to it.  We need to look at legislation and keep a record of the travel engagements.  I questioned the Taoiseach recently about what went on there.  He did not tell me but he said sovereignty was not discussed or our neutrality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100036#OO00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1663767420,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thanked the Minister in a public forum the other day but I thank him again.  On a personal basis I followed his political career for decades and always admired him.  I always knew he was a person of great capability and I am delighted to see him where I like to see him.  Enough about that.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset I will tell a story of how FDI can work at its most practical level.  In the town of Killarney was a great man, Macky Shea, who started a great business, M D O'Shea.  He worked very hard.  He started off cutting timber in a place call the High Wood and the Dark Wood outside Killarney.  He drew that timber into Killarney town.  He had a sawmill.  He cut up the planks and sold them.  That grew into a hardware shop which today is known as M D O'Shea and Sons.  That man, Macky Shea as we called him, was friends with other business people in the town.  A man came to Kerry wondering where to locate his business.  He was thinking of going somewhere completely different from Killarney but he met Macky Shea and a couple of other people who took him for dinner.  They explained what the town of Killarney had to offer.  They took him out the following day to the Lakes of Killarney and showed him the beautiful scenery and let him see and feel what Killarney was going to be like.  That man's name was Hans Liebherr.  The result of that was Liebherr Cranes coming to Fossa in Killarney.<\/p>  <p>  I thank God they are there but it would have made sense when importing and exporting much or all of the goods to be near deep water.  That would be more beneficial but those great business people in Killarney at that time sold the location of Killarney.  They sold the Kerry people on Hans Liebherr.  My late father, Jackie Healy-Rae, in his time ensured that he got money for a link road in Killarney and that the name of the road is the Hans Liebherr Road.  When we pass that link road we think of Hans Liebherr and the Liebherr family.  We are so grateful to them for the work and the money they brought and the wealth they created.  There are families in Killarney for many years who have the Liebherr family to thank for their gainful employment over the years.  That is what you call foreign direct investment at its best.<\/p> <p>This involved hundreds and thousands of people back over the years and to this present day being gainfully employed, doing excellent work in excellent working conditions.  When people retired when they were tired and had served their time, they are generously treated by the Liebherr Group.  We have to nurture that.<\/p> <p> I hear some people in this House criticising people who are wealthy, for instance, Denis O&rsquo;Brien or the Smurfits of the world, people who create work; and they are spoken about as if they are criminals or as if there is something wrong with them.  The only thing that is wrong with those types of people is that there should be more of them so that we would have full employment and a lot more jobs.  We would then have people with brains, the ability to create wealth, work, and have a positive environment for our people.  That is what we want.<\/p> <p> My whole point is that we want to ensure that through our tax regime and what people inside in this House say, we do not want people in other parts of the world to think that they will not be welcome in Ireland and that these people in this House are doing there is sitting in brown seats, jumping up and down, and talking about how everything should be for nothing, and that we do not want people who have money because we want to tax them to death, or keep them out of the place.  That is not how the world works.<\/p> <p> For us to work, we need to have people who create the jobs.  We need to people like Hans Liebherr and the wealthy people of the world to come and to create jobs here.  We have to make it attractive.<\/p> <p> I could rely on a person like the Minister of State but there is a great number of people who leave a great deal to be desired because if people were thinking about coming here, they might think twice if they were listening to some the speeches.  I will use my last couple of seconds to say this to the House.  I hear people standing up inside here in the D&aacute;il talking about the sooner that we get to the four-day working week.  This comes from fellas who never got up in the morning and did a day&rsquo;s work in their lives themselves at home, and who are lucky to be here because they would have no place else to work because they could not create a day&rsquo;s work for themselves, never mind anyone else, and they never paid a man or a woman on a Friday, and never will.  To hell with the four-day working week.  Many of us would like to work seven days a week, if we could get it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100036#OO00300","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663768020,"counter":303,"content":"<p>From a map that I have in front of me here, it looks obvious as a country that we stand out as having no screening mechanism in place when it comes to FDI.  Figures released by the CSO in June 2022 show the FDI position in Ireland increased by approximately &euro;16.9 billion in 2020 to &euro;1.1 trillion.  When compared to other OECD countries, Ireland is one of the most globalised economies in Europe, second only to Luxembourg.<\/p>  <p>  The data also shows that the US is the biggest investor in Ireland and accounts for more than &euro;830 billion, or 76%, of Irish inward FDI positions.<\/p>  <p>  There were 258,558 people employed by IDA Ireland companies in the State in 2020.  Some 275,384 were employed in 2021.  Not everything in Ireland is attractive for FDI.  Some of the more obvious downsides to attracting new businesses were housing affordability, general affordability and the cost of real estate.  <\/p>  <p>  On global connectivity in respect of ports and airports, the port in Belfast has been given the contract for the storage of gas in Ireland.  Why is that?  This is because none of our other ports were ready for it.  I mentioned Foynes Port earlier today, which has had a planning application submitted for ten years to try to get storage permission for gas.  We have now lost that facility to Belfast because none of our ports were ready.  What does that tell us?  That is a failure of Government and policy to ensure this investment will happen.  <\/p>  <p>  What would that have meant for Foynes and the county of Limerick?  There would have been significant employment where people would start moving there and infrastructure would be built.  We are talking about the Adare bypass and connecting Foynes Port by 2030 with the rail system from Limerick, but we lost a contract like that to Belfast.  We talk then about investment coming into this country.<\/p>  <p>  The other thing that was being looked at with regard to investors coming in to this country was the super-high cost and availability of electricity.  I spoke about this issue again yesterday with regard to businesses coming in here and the excessive rates they are paying.  Even though the Government reduced the VAT rate on electricity, it still took in &euro;16.4 billion.  The Exchequer is up &euro;4.6 billion from this time last year, even though the VAT rate was reduced.  How is the Government expected to get investors in to invest in this country?  How are we supposed to have sustainable employment?  Even the existing companies we have are running scared and are talking about reduced hours and shifts to make sure their industries will continue to work.  <\/p>  <p>  The new legislation aims &ldquo;to provide for a process to allow for certain transactions that may present risks to the security or public order of the State to be reviewed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment ... It will empower the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to access, investigate, authorise, condition or prohibit third country investment on a range of security and public order criteria.&rdquo;  <\/p>  <p>  If anything has to happen in this country, it is that we need more investment and more people here, and we need security for our electricity supply and for the next generation of employers who wish to come in here.  That responsibility stands steadily on the shoulders of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100037#PP00200","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1663768020,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I wish Deputy Calleary the very best in his new role as Minister of State.

IDA Ireland reported that 249 new investments were won in 2021.  Of that, 161 were North American, 68 were European, and 21 were from countries classified as growth markets.  In January 2021, IDA Ireland launched its new strategy: Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021-2024. <\/p>  <p>   One of the pillars of the strategy relates to regions and IDA Ireland set out a target of having half of all investments, 400 of an 800 target from 2021 to 2024, going to regional locations.  How will this be achieved?  Are accountable mechanisms in place to ensure that half of all new projects are located in regional areas?  If there is no accountability or follow-up, then this strategy will amount to nothing more than an empty target.  Equally, it is important that real and substantive projects are located into regional areas, not merely the smaller or less attractive projects.  <\/p>  <p>  Based on the most recent data, 53% or 133 of the 249 new investments went to regional locations, with employment growth in every region, as shown in figure No. 4 in the strategy.  The latest European Attractiveness Survey 2022 reported that Ireland was one of Europe&rsquo;s top ten locations for FDI with a market share of 3% of all FDI investment in 2021, and that it attracts the highest number of projects per capita among the top ten.<\/p>  <p>  We are talking a great deal about IDA Ireland and jobs but I want to ask about jobs in rural areas.  In the past number of years we have seen the demise of the fishing industry.  It will lead to a significant loss of jobs in my constituency.  The attacks the Green Party has made on agriculture in this country, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, will lead to a loss of jobs throughout rural Ireland.  I was talking to a number of farmers at the National Ploughing Championships yesterday morning before I came up here and they have serious worries.  Where are the jobs going to be and where are they going to get jobs in rural areas like Castletownbere, Mizen Head or Sheep&rsquo;s Head?  One does not have to go that far west; one only has to go as far as Bandon, down along the coastline to Timoleague, Barryroe and places like that.<\/p> <p>They are finding it very difficult and have serious worries.  They were gifted people at their jobs but I find that when IDA Ireland comes to town, it comes to a big town and does not come to rural communities that are losing jobs.  I live in one of those rural communities where good jobs are hard to come by.<\/p> <p> We look at the investment that has not been made by the Government in our roads.  In recent years in west Cork, the Innishannon bypass has been ignored, the Bandon southern and northern relief road has been ignored and the Bantry relief road has received no money.  We need to invest in infrastructure if we want to get the good quality jobs we are talking about and safeguard good jobs in our country.  The problem is that we have shocking transport infrastructure.  I will be talking tomorrow morning to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, about Connecting Ireland but I would call it &ldquo;Disconnecting Ireland&rdquo; because it has disconnected my constituency, which has little or no transport.  It has the same as it had ten, 15 or 20 years ago.<\/p> <p> These are all issues that feed into the labour market.  If there is good transport and good quality roads, people and businesses are inclined to come into an area and invest in communities that are starved of investment.  Unfortunately, we are losing jobs in rural communities for a number of reasons.  Of course, transport and fuel costs are huge, as are electricity costs.  Business owners are coming to me to talk about their doors closing because they do not see a future.  I even see it with some of the hotels in west Cork, which are closing down nearly half of the week already, and we are only in September.  Jobs are vital.  I know people have come here with great ideas.  They want to start a floating terminal in Cork for LNG, which is desperately needed in this country, but the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is kicking the can down the road and putting jobs in serious jeopardy.  It is the same with the Barryroe drilling.  We have potential for better jobs in rural communities but the Minister and the Government continue to ignore the facts, although the facts are there in black and white in front of them.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State is a new man in the job and I wish him the very best.  When IDA Ireland is talking about jobs, I ask him to make sure jobs are given in a geographical spread and that rural Ireland gets as much as urban Ireland, which is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100037#PP00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663768620,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue wants to come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100038#QQ00200","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1663768620,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I want to wish the Minister of State the very best of luck in his new position as I forgot to mention it earlier.

I hope we will assist him in every way possible to achieve the absolute success that he strives for.<\/p>  <p>  I was tied up in committee meetings all day so I was not able to pay attention in the way that I would.  I want to mention a couple of issues that come to mind.  First, Britain is now a third country so we need to be careful as the number of third countries out there is growing, for one reason or another.  It is important that, whatever screening is put in place, it is done in a way that is of assistance, that it protects the security and integrity of this jurisdiction and that it does not discourage FDI, or any kind of investment for that matter.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned that there was a gain for Belfast in recent investment; in fact, there was not.  It is a gain for the island of Ireland.  It so happens that Belfast was the only port available to facilitate the building of offshore electricity generation equipment.  More will be required in every part of the country because that is fundamental to providing the alternative energy we have all been talking about.  We have to strive towards that but we cannot achieve success in that area unless we have the basic facilities.  We must have wind energy turbines, whether onshore or offshore, but we need to start on it quickly.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to transactions, it is important to the integrity of the economy, North and South, that we screen in an effective way the transactions, wherever they come from or go to.  It is also important that we do not impede industry and investment, or impede what is supposed to happen in the shortest possible time.  I listened to somebody talk recently about objections to a public project on the basis that they had the right to object.  Of course, they had the right to object but they do not have an obligation to object unless there is good reason, not just a whim.  There are situations in this country where people on a whim have decided to jeopardise a project, and it is not an isolated situation and has happened on many occasions.  It is not something that is going to be of assistance to us in a highly competitive workspace.  We all know of instances of that.<\/p>  <p>  I want to mention FDI and transactions from third countries.  It is in our interest to facilitate what is going on as long as it meets whatever the statutory requirements are and as long as we are on a good footing.  If we become regarded as a country that might be expected to slow down the process, people are not going to look at us a second time.  They will move away and find some other place to invest and to have interaction with.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is this.  I know one of the things before An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the review taking place.  I hope it is a worthwhile review and I am not in any way supporting light-touch arrangements, or whatever the case may be.  What has to happen must happen, but it must happen with speed.  We have to compete on a worldwide basis.  We have to compete with whoever the people are in the marketplace.  As I said the other day at a committee meeting, we must always ask who are our competitors now and with whom we compete when it comes to attracting FDI.  Those are the things we have to look at.  We have to ask how they are facilitating investors from third countries.  Are they encouraging them, are they putting up obstacles or are they facilitating them?<\/p>  <p>  I recall when we had difficulty filling the various industrial estates throughout the country, when maybe one or two tenants were tentatively approached.  It was many years before we got to the situation we are in now.  Hard work and endeavour brought that about, with forward planning, good solid thinking and the putting in place of whatever was required to encourage investment, business development and growth and, at the same time, ensure that investment, from the investors&rsquo; point of view and from Ireland's point of view, was on a solid footing and that we had nothing to worry about.  We lost a number of investments in previous years, including powerful investments, and I brought this up at a meeting yesterday.  Huge gaps were left in the local economy in Munster, Leinster and every other part of the country, and that has continued.  From County Donegal all the way down the western seaboard and even in my constituency, we have had major losses.  It was not always as good as it is now.<\/p>  <p>  My philosophy would be to hold what we have and to encourage it.  We must ensure that the highest standards apply, ensure the integrity of the systems in so far as we and the incoming investors are concerned, and try to make sure that we can compete with all of the others in the marketplace at the present time, of which there are many and growing.  The tendency heretofore has been to move to low-wage economies.  Mind you, as a previous speaker said, deciding we are only going to work three or four days a week does not impress me as being part of making a low-wage economy in this country.  We either work or we do not work.  If we do not want to work, nobody wants us and nobody will want to invest here either.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the proposal is genuine and will be beneficial as long as it does not backfire on ourselves, the fundamentals are retained and we can live with whatever it is we are now imposing by way of screening, and as long as the screening is effective and sufficient to meet the demands of the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100038#QQ00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1663769220,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their good wishes and I look forward to working with those involved in this sector.  I am conscious of the old saying that there is very little difference between a pat on the back and a kick somewhere else but I nevertheless welcome colleagues' good wishes.<\/p>  <p>  A lot of broader, enterprise-related issues were raised, to which we will come back.  Some very interesting thoughts were expressed earlier in the debate about the direction of travel in regard to investments and so on, which definitely are worth pursuing.  I join all my colleagues in thanking and acknowledging the huge and continuing work done by IDA Ireland in extremely difficult circumstances to secure investment.  That investment does not just come; it comes because many things are done to secure it, one of the key elements being the dedication of IDA Ireland and its staff to pursuing it.<\/p>  <p>  I will go through some of the issues that were raised regarding the Bill and offer clarification.  Deputy O'Reilly asked whether the UK and US are included in the provisions, to which the answer is \"Yes\".  I want to be absolutely clear on that.  We recognise the importance of the US and, indeed, the UK as sources of investment.  They have strengthened their regimes in each of the individual countries but the unit in the Department will be appropriately resourced to take on this work.  I assure the Deputy I will follow up on that.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to bias, this legislation is explicitly not targeting any particular country.  It deals with risk-based issues and it is inevitable that investments from all countries will be affected.  That is the direction of travel.  The 90-day period is very much an outer boundary.  Decisions will be made as quickly as possible, which is relevant to the resource issue the Deputy raised.  The 90-day period really applies to transactions in respect of which risks are identified to give time to work through that particular process.<\/p>  <p>  National security is a national competence and all decisions in that regard will be made by Ireland.  There will not be EU input into that.  Such decisions are made by Ireland only and the process is very clear in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny expressed concern about the whole area of criminality.  The characteristics of each investor will be considered and captured by the screening process that is outlined.  Our main focus is security and public order.  We have a lot of other tools, including CAB, to deal with the issues he raised and to achieve the other goals.  I will bring the issue relating to CAB to the attention of the Minister for Justice.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh spoke about the delay in bringing through the legislation.  We are one of the final countries to do it but, equally, we can learn from what has gone before us in the 18 other member states that have implemented the measures.  We can take on board what they have learned in terms of roll-out and best practice.  The Deputy was worried about the narrow definitions of security and public order.  The Bill covers both public and private actors and includes a wide range and a relatively wide definition of sensitive assets and technologies.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in expressed concern about a reluctance to use the powers set out in the Bill.  We are not putting those powers in place for decoration.  They are not going up on the shelf just for the sake of it.  There will be an exclusive and extensive focus on the security of the State and public order.  The intent is to use those powers.  The reality, however, is that the vast majority of investments do not pose a risk.  This legislation covers the scenario akin to \"in case of emergency, break glass\".  We need to keep that in mind.  It will be rarely used and we still will be a very attractive destination for FDI.  Certainly, there is no disincentive to FDI in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Bh&iacute; an Teachta &Oacute; Cathasaigh ag caint faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais agus infheist&iacute;ocht san oideachas tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; sin mar chuid den Bhille seo ach is pointe an-t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh comhr&aacute; againn faoi infheisti&uacute; i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Patricia Ryan voiced concern about human rights and workers' rights.  As I said, the focus of the Bill is very much on security.  There are other tools to drive a focus onto the issues she raised.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Durkan referred to the UK being a third country, as was the choice of its people.  We did not ask them to do that.  The system as laid out in the legislation is very efficient.  It is clear that in the case of transactions in respect of which no risk is identified, the system is efficient and robust enough to identify that.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all the Deputies for their comments.  We will bring the Bill to Committee Stage and it is important that we get it passed and in place as quickly as possible.  I thank the Acting Chairman and the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating the debate and the officials involved in helping to ensure, we hope, that the Bill secures universal acceptance.  It is a technical Bill that took a lot of work on the part of the officials in my Department, for which I thank them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100039#RR00100","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663769220,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Screening of Third Country Transactions Bill 2022: Referral to Select Committee","time":1663769220,"counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100039#RR00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1663769220,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment pursuant to Standing Orders 95(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 181(1). <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100039#RR00400","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663769220,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022: Second Stage","time":1663769220,"counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100039#RR00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1663769220,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \t&quot;Go l&eacute;ifear an Bille an Dara hUair anois.&quot; <\/blockquote>  <p>Dl&iacute; ceannr&oacute;daioch is ea &eacute; an Bille um Rialail S&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteachta ar Line agus na Me&aacute;n agus t&aacute; &aacute;thas orm &eacute; a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id an T&iacute;.<\/p><p>The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is ambitious, comprehensive and wide-ranging media legislation.  It will be the first major overhaul of the Broadcasting Act 2009 since that Act was last considered by this House.  Since that time, there has been a dramatic transformation in how we consume content, whether on television, radio or by way of services offered over the Internet.  This transformation has been made possible by new technologies, in particular the widespread availability of smartphones and broadband services.  The most radical aspect of this transformation has been the vast amount of user-generated content that is now created by people across the world and made available online.  The rise of online services has allowed new ways for people to communicate with one other and new outlets for creativity and self-expression.  However, with these new benefits come new risks, particularly for our children.  Some of those risks are an extension of existing dangers, such as bullying and harassment, to a new environment in which they can be magnified.<\/p> <p>Others, such as image-based abuse, represent a new challenge.  <\/p> <p> This Government is determined to confront these risks by bringing an end to the era of self-regulation.  For the first time in Irish law, this Bill creates a regulatory framework for online safety, in which online services will be held to account when the public, and children in particular, are not appropriately shielded from harmful online content.  The Bill also provides for the modernisation of the regulation of broadcasting services and video-on-demand services.  This is essential in light of the significant expansion of video-on-demand services and the need for better alignment of the regulation of those services with broadcasters to ensure a level playing field and consistent application of media regulation.<\/p> <p> Prior to detailing the key elements of the Bill, I will briefly update the House regarding the infringement proceedings in respect of the revised audiovisual media services directive.  On 19 May 2022, the European Commission decided to refer Ireland to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failure to meet the transposition deadline for this directive.  Unfortunately, this is likely to result in the imposition of significant financial penalties.  I am aware this House needs no additional motivation to progress this legislation, but I note this development reinforces the need to get this Bill enacted swiftly.  I sincerely thank the Seanad and the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media for their intensive scrutiny of this legislation to date.  I am proud to have been participating as Minister in the interesting and thought-provoking debates we have had, and will have, on this ground-breaking legislation.<\/p> <p> Prior to giving a more structured overview of this Bill, I will first speak about some of its most important provisions.  First, Part 3 provides for the creation of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, a regulatory body which will be responsible for implementing and enforcing online safety and media regulation.  To do so, an coimisi&uacute;n will have a robust and modern suite of regulatory functions and powers in line with EU law and best practice.  Of fundamental importance will be its independence in the exercise of those functions and powers.<\/p> <p> The powers of an coimisi&uacute;n include the power to fund its operations by levying regulated services, create legally-binding regulatory codes, gather information and appoint authorised officers to conduct investigations and the power to seek the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance, including financial sanctions of up to &euro;20 million or 10% of the turnover of the non-compliant service provider, whichever is higher.  While the functions of an coimisi&uacute;n primarily relate to the regulation of services, it will also have wider roles in respect of the protection of children, research, education, media literacy and journalistic and creative supports.<\/p> <p> As provided for in the transitional provisions at Part 16, coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will also take over the current functions of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  This includes the transfer of the staff of the authority to an coimisi&uacute;n.  I envisage that an coimisi&uacute;n will need to scale up quickly to a staffing level of at least 160 people and in the longer term may require a staffing complement of up to 300 people.  This scaling-up process will be particularly important following the Digital Services Act coming into effect because the Government has decided that an coimisi&uacute;n will be designated as the digital services co-ordinator for the purposes of the Act's implementation.<\/p> <p> Given the importance of an coimisi&uacute;n, the Government approved its establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill.  In this regard, an extensive programme of work is under way with the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to recruit corporate and senior staff and to lay the groundwork for an effective regulatory environment.  The posts of executive chairperson, the online safety commissioner and the media development commissioner are being recruited through open, transparent and public competitions.  Each post was advertised by the PAS in July and it is also now managing the next stages of the competitions, which are expected to be concluded by November.  While it was always the intention to appoint an online safety commissioner, as demonstrated by the ongoing recruitment process, to highlight the importance of the role and to provide certainty to stakeholders, and in light of relevant discussions in the Seanad, I brought forward an amendment to explicitly provide for the position in the Bill on Report Stage in the Upper House.<\/p> <p> As I mentioned, perhaps the most significant matter for an coimisi&uacute;n to address will be the regulation of certain online services in respect of user-generated content.  This legislation provides for a regulatory framework for online safety in Part 11.  Through this framework, the online safety commissioner will tackle the availability of harmful online content.  Regarding the online services which may be regulated in line with the revised audiovisual media services directive, the Bill firstly requires an coimisi&uacute;n to designate video-sharing platform services for regulation.  An coimisi&uacute;n may also designate further online services which facilitate access to user-generated content for regulation.  This will encompass a wide range of services, including social media services and many gaming, online messaging and storage services.<\/p> <p> To designate a service, an coimisi&uacute;n must conduct a risk assessment.  This will include consideration of various factors, such as the nature and scale of the service and the risk of exposure to harmful online content.  This risk-based approach will enable an coimisi&uacute;n to direct its energies and resources to the areas where they are most needed.  Once an online service has been designated for regulation, an coimisi&uacute;n can require it to comply with binding online safety codes.  These codes can require online services to adapt their systems and processes in three key areas: in rules for content moderation and complaints handling; in rules regarding the design of a service and how and why it displays certain content to users; and in rules about commercial communications, including advertising.  The main aim of the codes is to tackle and progressively reduce the availability of harmful online content on designated online services.  The Bill clearly defines \"harmful online content\".  Online content is harmful where it relates to one of the 40 criminal offences listed in section 45 of the Bill or cyberbullying, or promotes or encourages eating disorders, self-harm or suicide or makes available knowledge of methods of self-harm or suicide.<\/p> <p> The schedule of criminal offences includes, for example, those under Coco's law, that is, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, regarding image-based abuse, abuse of communications and harassment.  For harmful online content not related to an existing criminal offence, cyberbullying material for instance, a risk test must be met for it to be considered harmful.  This includes consideration of whether the online content gives rise to any risk to a person's life or a reasonably foreseeable risk to a person's mental or physical health.  The Bill also provides for a mechanism, which is subject to Oireachtas oversight, for future categories of harmful online content to be brought within its scope.<\/p> <p> In summary, the online safety elements of this Bill will ensure that an individual will be exposed to far less harmful online content and that online services will be required by law to respond to and robustly deal with complaints when they are made.  In this regard, an coimisi&uacute;n will have significant powers of compliance and sanction to hold these services to account.  In the context of online safety, it is important to mention the work of the expert group on an individual complaints mechanism.  I brought its report to Government yesterday.  As Members may be aware, the expert group was tasked with examining the potential legal and practical issues involved.  It has backed the feasibility of establishing such a mechanism but only if certain key factors and dependencies are addressed.  As an example of those dependencies, the expert group emphasised the importance of allowing appropriate time for the systemic forms of regulation relating to complaints to bed in before phasing in the mechanism.  In particular, the report emphasises that an individual complaints mechanism would not be workable or effective without systemic online safety regulation being in place.<\/p> <p> As part of the report, the expert group included draft heads which provide for an individual complaints mechanism within the Bill.  These draft heads have been provided to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for detailed drafting and it is my intention, subject to Government approval, to bring forward the resulting amendments on Committee Stage.  I thank once more the members of the expert group for their report and comprehensive consideration of the issues at play regarding the feasibility of an individual complaints mechanism in the context of this legislation.  Additionally, regarding the individual complaints mechanism, the recommendation of the expert group is to first deal with harmful online content that targets children.<\/p> <p> Regarding the regulation of broadcasting and streaming services, this will primarily be done through media service codes and media service rules, the provisions for which are set out at Part 5.  Media service codes are mostly about the content of programming, including rules for programme standards and advertising.  Media service rules, on the other hand, are mostly about the presentation and structure of the service, including rules regarding the time given to advertising, accessibility requirements for persons with disabilities and quotas for European works.<\/p> <p>To ensure the uninterrupted regulation of broadcasters, the transitional provisions at Part 16 provide for the existing broadcasting codes and rules to be carried over and to become media service codes and rules.<\/p> <p> Part 5 also provides for the mandatory registration of streaming services to ensure that, in line with the revised audiovisual media services directive, all streaming services established in Ireland are subject to appropriate regulation.  Broadcasters will remain regulated on a contractual basis, as is set out in the current Broadcasting Act 2009.<\/p> <p> The Bill also provides for the transposition of an optional provision in the directive which will empower an coimisi&uacute;n to levy broadcasters and streaming services, including those established elsewhere in the EU, in respect of any revenues that they may make in Ireland in order to fund the production of European work, including Irish-produced works.  Provision is made so that the money collected may be disbursed by an coimisi&uacute;n through a content production scheme.  The Bill does not set the amounts of any such levy as this would be inflexible but enables an coimisi&uacute;n to design and implement a levy having regard to relevant economic factors.  There are potential risks and benefits to a levy, including for consumers, and it is intended that an coimisi&uacute;n would thoroughly examine these matters before these provisions are commenced.<\/p> <p> At this point, I would like to acknowledge the importance of media development and sustainability and note the constructive engagement I had last week with the joint committee and the Seanad on the report and recommendations of the Future of Media Commission.  While legislation separate from this Bill will be brought forward to progress the implementation of the Future of Media Commission recommendations, the appointment of a media development commissioner, who will work in tandem with the broadcasting commissioner, will be key to the successful implementation of those recommendations.<\/p> <p> I reiterate my gratitude to Members of the Seanad for their extensive consideration of the Bill.  Productive engagement with Senators led to 62 Government amendments being brought forward on Report Stage.  In the interests of time, I will not go through each amendment but will highlight a few of them.  They included amendments to require an coimisi&uacute;n to establish a youth advisory committee; an amendment to require coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to promote and encourage the use of the Irish language by communications media operating in the State; and amendments to explicitly expand the educational remit of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, including to provide that an coimisi&uacute;n can engage with community, local and sorting bodies in awareness raising, training and education.<\/p> <p> In addition, I note that there were certain issues raised by Senators which I committed to returning to in the D&aacute;il following a period of further consideration.  I am still considering some of those issues with a view to potentially bringing amendments on Committee Stage, including in relation to the operation of a potential content production levy and content production scheme, as well as amendments in relation to media service codes and rules regarding defining party political broadcasts and the time given over to political parties during electoral periods.<\/p> <p> I also intend to bring forward a number of other amendments on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  These are primarily technical in nature and include consequential amendments in light of the enactment of the Electoral Reform Act 2022, amendments to clarify the nature of the territorial scope of content limitation notices, amendments to clarify that local broadcasters will be able to apply for funding under the scheme for professional journalistic practices and amendments to clarify the application of the provisions providing for the prominence of public service content.<\/p> <p> Turning to a more structured overview of the provisions of the Bill, it is, first, important to note that this Bill amends the Broadcasting Act 2009.  Part 1 addresses preliminary and general matters.  Part 2 amends the 2009 Act to insert and amend a number of definitions to support the operation of the Bill.  Part 3 amends Part 2 of the 2009 Act to provide for the establishment of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.  Key aspects of this Part include provision for the independence of an coimisi&uacute;n; for the appointment of commissioners; for an coimisi&uacute;n to impose levies on regulated services, excluding community broadcasters, to fund its operations; and for the accountability of the chairperson to the Committee of Public Accounts and the chairperson and other commissioners to relevant Oireachtas committees.<\/p> <p> Part 3 also provides for the high-level powers and functions of an coimisi&uacute;n.  These include upholding Ireland's democratic values; protecting the interests of the public, in particular, children; ensuring the diverse needs of the people of this island are served by our media; and sustaining independent and impartial journalism.<\/p> <p> Part 4 provides for matters related to the registration of providers of streaming services through the insertion of a new Part 3A into the 2009 Act.<\/p> <p> Part 5 concerns the duties, codes and rules applicable to radio and television broadcasters and streaming services and provides for these through the insertion of a new Part 3B into the 2009 Act.  Chapter 2 of this new Part concerns duties on those services.  Chapters 3 and 5 of this new Part concern media codes and rules.  Chapter 3 of this Part also provides that existing broadcasting codes and rules made by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will continue in force following the enactment of the Bill.<\/p> <p> Part 6 amends Part 4 of the 2009 Act and primarily concerns changes to take into account the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n and the statutory regulation of streaming services in respect of redress mechanisms.<\/p> <p> Part 9 amends Part 7 of the 2009 Act to, among other things, take into account the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n in relation to public service broadcasting, provide for changes to the calculation of total advertising time for broadcasters and insert a new Chapter 7 regarding the availability and prominence of public service programmes and services.<\/p> <p> Part 11 inserts a new Part 8A into the 2009 Act concerning online safety regulation.  Chapter 1 of this new Part concerns the definitions of harmful online content and age-inappropriate online content.  Chapter 2 concerns the process for designating relevant online for regulation.  Chapter 3 concerns the making of online safety codes, the matters which they can address and matters which need to be taken into account when the codes are being drawn up.  Chapter 4 concerns the making of online safety guidance materials and advisory notices.  Chapter 5 concerns an obligation on an coimisi&uacute;n to establish a super-complaints scheme for nominated bodies and a number of other matters.<\/p> <p> Part 11 also inserts a new Schedule 3 into the 2009 Act containing the list of offence-specific categories of harmful online content.<\/p> <p> Part 12 inserts a new Part 8B into the 2009 Act concerning investigations and sanctions.  Chapter 2 of this new Part provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to appoint authorised officers and sets out procedures for investigations by those officers and for decisions by an coimisi&uacute;n following investigations.  Chapter 4 concerns the imposition of administrative financial sanctions.<\/p> <p> Chapter 5 of this new Part provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to issue notices to end a contravention and provides for secondary criminal liability for senior executives.  Chapter 6 provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to seek court orders to block access to non-compliant online services in Ireland.  Chapter 7 provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to issue content limitation notices in respect of individual items of harmful online content.<\/p> <p> Chapter 8 of this new Part provides for three categories of summary offences under the Bill and provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to prosecute these offences.  This Part also creates a new Schedule concerning oral hearings.<\/p> <p> Parts 7, 8, 10, 13, 15 and 17 amend various Parts of the 2009 Act and other relevant Acts to take into account the dissolution of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n.<\/p> <p> Part 14 inserts a new Part 10A into the 2009 Act concerning European works.  This Part provides for the requirements of the directive for European works quotas and prominence and provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to introduce a European works levy and European works scheme.<\/p> <p> Lastly, Part 16 provides for transitional matters.<\/p> <p> As can be seen, this Bill is, given its subject matter, necessarily multifaceted and wide-ranging.  It deals with a wide range of important issues from modernising media regulation to, for the first time, introducing online safety regulation to tackle the availability of serious forms of harmful online content.  I look forward to Members' contributions and to engaging further during the course of their scrutiny of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100039#RR00700","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663770420,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this Bill, which has been a long time coming.  Those of us who are members of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media have spent the past couple of years working on the Bill, particularly during the pre-legislative scrutiny process, and I am happy that it is finally progressing to the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill was amended in the Seanad and I thank Senators Warfield and &Oacute; Donnghaile for their work on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in in the Seanad.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is vast and wide-ranging, maybe too wide-ranging.  There was certainly a case to be made for breaking it up into a number of smaller Bills, but we are where we are.<\/p>  <p>  Any Bill designed to modernise Ireland's approach to the regulation of online content is welcome.  It is past time and much needed, as I think we can all agree.  This is particularly important for newer online services, which have been operating largely unregulated and unchecked for over 15 years.  The world has changed drastically in that time, as has our consumption of media.  It will be an enormous challenge for regulation to keep up with the pace set by the technology giants.<\/p> <p>The new media commission will not be able to do it alone, and there will be a need for the Oireachtas to keep on top of it too.<br\/><br\/>There have been some recent moves on criminalising certain online behaviours.  What this Bill needs to do, however, is to hold tech platforms to account.  I am glad to see robust penalties in that regard in the Bill.  It is important that the commission will have the powers and the manpower to hold these companies to account.  They have shown us loud and clear that they are not capable of or willing to regulate themselves.  They are purely profit-driven corporations that are happy to profit from content that promotes hatred, conflict, bullying and misinformation.  Those of us on the media committee will recall Frances Haugen's powerful testimony on the algorithms employed by Facebook, which actively target and reward negative content, hate, violence and misinformation.<br\/><br\/>In regulating this type of content, there is a very fine line between personal liberties and freedom of speech and the protection of certain groups from harm.  I am not entirely convinced that parts of this Bill sit on the right side of that.  In particular, I have concerns about subsection 46J(1)(a), which reads:<\/p><blockquote>\tA broadcaster shall not broadcast, and a provider of an audiovisual on-demand media service shall not make available in a catalogue of the service&mdash;  \t(a) anything which may reasonably be regarded as causing harm or offence,  <\/blockquote> <p>I would have serious concerns about legislating against something as fundamentally subjective as causing offence.  I think that this section is a significant attack on people's right to freedom of expression, which is an essential component in any democratic society.  There are concerns that this section of the Bill may even contravene the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects freedom of expression not just with regard to ideas that are considered to be inoffensive but also with regard to those that offend, shock or disturb the state or any sector of the population.  I understand that Senator Higgins proposed an amendment to this section during the debate on the Bill in the Seanad but I do not think the Minister accepted it.  Will she clarify if she intends to replace this section with more appropriate wording?<br\/><br\/>On a more positive note, another one of my concerns about the Bill all along has been the lack of protection from what I consider to be harmful advertising.  This includes infant formula advertisements, but also advertising of junk foods with high fat, salt and sugar content targeting children.  Thanks to the work of Opposition Senators, those concerns are now addressed in the Bill, and I thank the Minister for agreeing to that.  Protecting our children from advertising by multi-billion dollar global corporations is the least we can do as legislators.  We have to do our bit to protect the health and well-being of our children, and the inclusion of these safeguards is a massive step forward.<br\/><br\/>The Bill also creates a significant new regulatory framework, coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.  This will replace the BAI and will have significant additional powers.  The commission will be responsible for the enforcement of new laws governing online content, will have the power to appoint authorised officers to conduct investigations and will be able to impose sanctions for breaches of compliance, including financial sanctions of up to &euro;20 million or 10% of turnover.  There will also be a power to seek criminal prosecution of senior executives of non-compliant platforms.  The commission will have the power to create legally binding regulatory codes.  On this point I understand that there will be Oireachtas oversight, and I would be obliged if the Minister could expand on that point.  While the independence of the commission is of paramount importance, we have to ensure there is appropriate Oireachtas oversight too.<br\/><br\/>The content levy is another important part of the Bill.  I understand that the Minister has been engaging with independent film producers on some of their concerns about the levy.  They include seeking certainty around the timing of the levy, assurances that the levy will be available to independent screen producers, and the introduction of a quota for independent production companies for schemes under the fund.  The sector has raised some valid concerns about the fund, and I hope the Minister will take those concerns on board.<br\/><br\/>The Bill needs to include a section on the well-being of content moderators.  Their work can involve viewing very distressing content, and tech giants and their subsidiaries must be compelled to protect the mental health and well-being of workers in these roles.  If we are happy to have the European headquarters of all these companies in Dublin, we need to be involved in maintaining basic standards for those who work for them.  The Government needs to have a more hands-on approach in that regard.  If we do not have that, it will place undue pressure on the new regulator.  If it cannot be included in this Bill, the Minister could give a commitment that the Government will introduce legislation on this in the near future.  The issue of content moderation was raised at the media committee when Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen appeared before us earlier this year.  She raised this issue and also the levels of expertise that will be needed by the new regulator.  She estimated that we will need at least 20 algorithm experts with deep product expertise.  The problem is that anyone with this expertise will have been trained in-house and, therefore, recruiting suitable candidates is extremely challenging.  Without these experts it will be impossible to hold these tech giants accountable.  Their technology is so advanced and developing so quickly that it is impossible to keep up.  The report of the expert group reporting on the individual complaints commission has also stated that staff of this calibre will need to be recruited for the purposes of the complaints mechanism.  What plans has the Minister to ensure this is done?  The Government has been far too pally with these companies for too long.  It is time to get tough on them and to impose appropriate regulation.  Ms Haugen also spoke about the problem of misinformation.  Can the Minister clarify if this will be addressed in the Bill?  It represents a serious threat globally and must be addressed.<br\/><br\/>Another issue covered by the Bill is prominence of public service media.  This is very important, and I welcome its inclusion in the Bill.  Prominence is particularly important when it comes to the Irish language.  I note that there is an amendment to the Bill from the Seanad relating to section 7 of the Bill, requiring coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to promote the use of the Irish language by communications media.  That is welcome.  My colleague Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has been working on a significant number of amendments to strengthen the Bill in providing for the Irish language, and I look forward to discussing those on Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>Last but certainly not least, I welcome the introduction of the individual complaints mechanism as recommended by the report of the expert group.  This was identified by the joint committee as a central issue that needed to be rectified in our pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  I was surprised, however, that the Minister's Department did not send the report to members of the media committee.  It is not a great way to do business to publish the report on the evening that D&aacute;il Second Stage is due to commence, especially when the Minister has had the report since May.<br\/><br\/>I have a few questions about the report.  Will EU-wide video-sharing platform services be included, and, if so, how will that be funded?  Will the Minister accept the expert group's recommendations on putting timelines into this legislation?  Can she provide detail on that, especially with regard to what media and online safety codes will be prioritised and the expected timelines?  I see on page 25 of the expert report that significant resources will be needed to ensure the complaints mechanism is effective and efficient.  Will the Minister outline her plans in that regard?  I think I asked her at the committee meeting last week for a breakdown.  I know she has mentioned a figure of 160 staff initially, possibly going up to 300, but also the sections and the grades of the staff that the new commission will need.  Will the online safety commissioner be able to impose fines on companies that are found to be in breach under the complaints mechanism?  What other sanctions will be made available to the commission?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100041#TT00300","speaker":"1497","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663771020,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her work on the Bill to date.  Also, the Seanad and the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media put in many hours of work to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny on this important Bill.  I hope the Minister will listen to all recommendations made.  Our thanks must also go to all the stakeholders who made written submissions and gave evidence to committee hearings to ensure their expertise and knowledge played into this process.  Safeguards for people online, especially children, are vital to mental health and well-being.  The Minister must ensure there are ample options for recourse to protect people's safety rights online, including the individual complaints mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  I saw last night in the media that the report from the expert group on this issue was published.  I thought I had missed an email from the Minister and I was disappointed to see that it was not circulated to the Members of this House, especially those of us who are members of the committee that recommended it.<\/p> <p>It is unacceptable that the Minister had the report since May and it was only published at 5 p.m. the day before the issue was to be debated in this House.  This is bad parliamentary practice and, frankly, it is disingenuous to the Members of this House who collaborated with her on the Bill.  On initial reading, the expert group has put in extensive and comprehensive work to consider this issue.  We thank them sincerely for their work.<\/p> <p> There are several issues to be teased out about the individual complaints mechanism.  The commission will require staff with a high level of expertise.  This will require a serious funding commitment and cross-departmental work with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to ensure we have these experts available.  Workers involved will need to have protection in place for their own well-being, especially if they are involved in the triaging of criminal complaints to relevant authorities.  I hope the Minister will respond to these issues and be open to exploring these recommendations as the Bill progresses.<\/p> <p> Another issue that was stressed to us during pre-legislative scrutiny was transparency and the importance of data collection by designated online companies.  Online platforms should be held to the highest standard of transparency and be compelled to provide requested data for public interest research and evidence-based policy.  Will the Bill include a mechanism for the commission to compel designated companies to provide data that is of public interest?  If not, this is something we in Sinn F&eacute;in may table as an amendment on Committee Stage, and we would ask the Minister to work with us on that.<\/p> <p> When we are talking about online safety, we must include well-being and workers' rights too.  Reviewing harmful content is a role that requires safeguards to protect employees' mental health and well-being.  How will the Bill ensure that online platforms will be compelled to protect workers' rights in this regard?  I understand this might fall under the remit of Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but there must at least be a collaborative effort as this Bill is where protections for workers can be enshrined in law.<\/p> <p> Another issue I raise is gambling, although it is not covered directly in the Bill.  Much academic evidence supports the belief that online gambling influences and increases the likelihood of problem gambling.  This is largely attributed to specific targeting of users and constant online visual bombardment, and the covert nature of online gambling.  As this Bill covers online safety, it is important that we discuss the advertisement and promotion of gambling on social media.  I see a vital role here for collaboration between the Online Safety Commission and the new gambling regulatory authority.  Will the Bill outline the relationship between these two vital arms of the State?  It is important for this collaboration to be put on a legislative footing.<\/p> <p> One sees the importance of robust structures, accountability and transparency in public bodies now more than ever, with serious concerns still outstanding in, for example, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The new media commission must have the most thorough and strict process of accountability to ensure public confidence.  I have two issues of concern in this regard.  The first relates to the level of oversight the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media will have.  Will the committee have the power to request information at any time, including that which relates to governance and tendering, as well as financial issues regarding the hiring of consultants and advisers?  Will the committee be able to make recommendations on such issues?<\/p> <p> The second issue of concern is around declarations of interest.  I am aware the Bill covers conflicts of interest, but I believe we need to go further.  Does the Minister agree that the commissioner should be required to fill out a full declaration of vested and commercial interests every year and that it be published in order to improve transparency?  I also want to Minister to revisit the joint committee's recommendation that Ireland should introduce a mandatory quota for production of European and Irish works.  Surely, as a legislative Parliament, we can make sure indigenous works are included, enhanced and protected.  What extensive analysis is needed, as suggested in the Minister's response to the recommendations?  The opportunity is now before the Minister to do this and we ask her to grasp it for the benefit of our talented artists.<\/p> <p> I have several outstanding concerns around the Bill, some of which I have outlined.  I look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100042#UU00200","speaker":"1621","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663771620,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I have a huge interest in this area originating from a previous occupation I had before I made the crazy decision to get involved in politics.  This is very important legislation, for example in the context of the way the world is now.  I have a 12-year-old and a ten-year-old.  As parents, we try to control the platforms they watch and where they get information but, as the ads on the radio say, you cannot control it totally.  It is impossible to do so.  We try to protect them from various information sources and forms of bullying and such things, but it is almost impossible to do so.  The Bill must set a regulatory framework that will work.  It is a good start, and I appreciate that the Minister has taken on a number of amendments.  I will have another amendment later which I suggest the Minister should also take on board.<\/p>  <p>  I have sat in the Minister's chair before - I had to do too many Bills when I was sitting there - but I believe there is too much contained in this Bill.  I personally would not have done it this way.  There is a lot of stuff there that should be in a separate Bill.  The whole issue around online safety should be in a bespoke Bill.  That is just a personal comment.  This Bill is trying to do so much in one go.<\/p>  <p>  The transposition of EU Directive No. 1808, the audiovisual media services directive, was commenced and has been going through the motions since as long ago as when I was an MEP.  I sat on the consumer affairs committee and I remember that they were orienting towards looking at stuff like this at a very early stage, and that was a decade ago.  When we look at how we transpose these Bills, it is important that we do it in a bespoke way that is suitable to our narrative in this country.  For instance, as users of content we are different in many ways from those in other jurisdictions.  We have a large volume of e-services in this country.  We have a hugely sophisticated population.  When we have to regulate our services, every country should do it in a bespoke way.  What I am saying is that we cannot transpose the directive generically.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the new operating framework for online content and the issue relating to public service programmes and how they will be delivered.  We need to look at that going into the future.  Everything is available on demand now.  I use public service programming to watch sports on RT&Eacute; and TV3, or Virgin Media One as it is now called, and for the news.  Everything else is accessed on demand.  Whatever leisure time we have is spent viewing on-demand content, whereby couples or groups of people can watch whatever they want together, at a time that suits them.  However, there is an issue in respect of the volume of platforms.  These platforms are consistently changing and will forever change, and there is a concern about how we ensure the legislation is robust enough to be able to cover those changes.<\/p>  <p>  According to an article I read last night, TikTok is the most used app among certain age groups in this country, more so than in many other countries.  I can see that from my own children.  I am not really on TikTok.  I had better not admit to anything here.  The reality is that there is a need for these platforms.  Even in a political sense, we will all be on TikTok by the next election.  If you are not, you probably will not be elected.  It is simple as that because it will be how we communicate with younger people.  Snapchat was the app of four or five years ago.  It is probably now declining in use.  All these platforms evolve, so how do we ensure these distribution channels will be covered going forward?<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the way in which authorised officers will operate and the powers to be implemented.  I will come back to that later.  I am concerned about the volume of resource required, and I am glad the Minister referred to this in her speech.  This will involve huge resources, especially given the report that was published last night because it changes the volume totally.  I will come back to that later.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the funding that will be provided to local community broadcasters, etc., and the resources for media providers.  We will need a little more detail on that, if I am being honest, as regards the mechanism.<\/p> <p>In fairness, the Minister acknowledged this in her contribution and said she will introduce clarification through amendments.  With regard to the difference between what is real and fake, and what is public and really public news, we all know what has happened in politics throughout the world over the past five to seven years is very dangerous.  We need to ensure we have a process by which we deal with this through the Bill.<\/p> <p> I have an issue with crossover with the online safety commissioner.  It would be helpful if this was dealt with in some way.  I can see a lot of overlap.  The Minister might attend to this when she comes back with her reply.<\/p> <p> With regard to individual complaints and what we found out yesterday, we probably should have known about it a little bit sooner.  In fairness to the Minister, if she were sitting here she would say the same thing.  The way in which expert groups and NGOs will report is fine but \"scale\" is referenced a number of times by the Minister and in the Bill.  This phrasing cannot stay like this.  It will have to be amended in some way.  What sort of scale?  Will it be scale of operation?  Is it that we would go after TikTok, but if it is a new platform set up by a 12-year-old in Carrignavar, County Cork with 200 people on it who are acting in an inappropriate way we could not go near it?  Will it be the volume of inappropriate behaviour?  In this sense, \"scale\" means it would not matter what the platform is if there was a lot of volume.  The word \"scale\" and how it is dealt with in the legislation needs to be redefined across the board.  It is too open-ended.<\/p> <p> The most important component is sanction for harmful content.  This is something on which I will table an amendment, which I will explain later.  We need to define \"harmful content\" in section 139A to deal with the issue of disinformation.  I will get back to this.  My colleague Senator Sherlock, as has been referenced previously, has raised issues which I believe the Minister will take on board.  These include how information on baby products is communicated.  It is not just the whole process by which this is done and the impact it can have purely for greed; there is also the profiling of the data which is slightly dangerous.  How do we ensure this does not happen?  It could be used for other forms of profiling and purposes.  I believe the Minister is taking it on board.<\/p> <p> Self-regulation was never going to work.  The content moderators who are out there on a range of platforms should be brought into this legislation because they need to be made responsible.  We could pick any social media company and its director of online moderation.  It is self-regulatory.  Why can we not state that through this process every platform of a certain scale - that word again - must appoint somebody who is legally responsible under the Bill?  This would make them think a lot about how they act.  We have seen it so often when people make complaints.  In the past I have been involved in advising people who make complaints about content that has been very upsetting.  In fairness to my colleague Deputy Howlin, he drove home the issue of Coco's law as the Acting Chair knows.  It is very good legislation.  Why can we not have a situation whereby the Oireachtas states through the Bill that somebody in each company has to be responsible for this role?  These people would then be accountable.  If they are part of the regulatory process in a formal way, we will have a lot more success.<\/p> <p> When it comes to the issue of individual complaints I note that the Minister has said she will have to come back to it.  She will provide for it in amendments.  Commencement will probably happen after the regulatory process has been set up in a more formal way.  I understand this.  I do not have a huge objection to it because I believe we need to have the appropriate ground work and formation, but there should be some form of formal system.  To get back to the point I made about bringing the content moderators into the regulatory process, if there are companies that continuously have the Ryanair model of complaint management, which is effectively to forget about it or joke on Twitter, and continuously ignore the complaints process and do not deal with it, then the severe fines in the Bill should kick in so they have to deal with it.  I hope the Minister can follow my vision.  Content moderators would become a legal part of the process.  They would have to be appointed in each company over a certain scale, and I agree the phrase \"certain scale\" would have to be included.  When complaints are not dealt with, and a volume of complaints is never dealt with, the legislation should kick in to fine those companies heavily.  Through such a process that includes content moderators, the Minister would deal with issues of volumes of complaints and the Ryanair model of not dealing with complaints.  Through this process and through the fines that would be brought about, the companies would be told they were not dealing with genuine complaints and they would not get away with it.  Genuine complaints would be defined under the Act and I will help the Minister with an amendment on this.<\/p> <p> I know the officials have considered this with Canadian and Australian legislators who have gone through all of it.  I believe this country can be defining in this regard.  We have a responsibility in this country given the volume of e-business, IT and online companies we have on our doorstep.  I ask the Minister to actualise the vision I have put out there.  We need to go this far.  I will suggest an amendment to the Minister so that she can consider it as part of her deliberations.<\/p> <p> The Minister has said she will probably need 160 staff and possibly up to 300.  I can see it going beyond this and if necessary it should do so.  There will be issues with the merger of various State organisations.  I was involved in a number of such mergers.  I am sure the Minister will work very closely with the unions to ensure it is done in an appropriate way.<\/p> <p> The Minister said that for harmful online content not related to existing criminal offences, for instance cyberbullying, a risk test must be met for it to be considered harmful.  This is like the word \"scale\".  We need to define \"risk test\" and I will table an amendment on this.<\/p> <p> With regard to the issue of streaming, all services in Ireland will be under the regulation.  We have capacity in the EU to ensure all streaming services in the EU can be broached through this.  Many online streaming services that come into this country do not come from within the EU.  This is something the Minister needs to bear in mind.  They come from all over the world.  The majority of them are not based in the EU.  How do we deal with this?  I do not think there is huge capacity.  Let us say that a lot can be bypassed.  As legislators, how will we ensure this does not happen?<\/p> <p>Before I get to the amendment I propose, I will raise the issue of the amendments the Minister will bring forward in lieu of the new Electoral Reform Act in which I have a great interest.  They are very important because we all know from a political point of view of the manipulation and process by which these platforms can be used, especially content sharing that is self-produced and all of this sort of stuff, the virality of which can be immense within a short time.<\/p> <p> With regard to the issue of disinformation and section 44, I will table an amendment for a new section to deal with content that is classed as harmful.  The section goes through content that is classed as harmful because it is against the criminal law, while section 44(3) deals with content that is held to be harmful, even though its dissemination does not involve a criminal contravention.  Issues such as suicide are dealt with in this regard and a number of others as the Minister outlined.<\/p> <p> However, one major difference from the current law, as set out in the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial Religious or National Hatred Act 1989, is that the Act criminalised content likely to stir up hatred - this is the important point I wish the Minister to listen to - only if the content itself is, \"threatening, abusive or insulting\".  The world has moved on.  Hatred can be stirred up now even if the content is not threatening, abusive or insulting.  \"Harmful content\", especially in the online space, and disinformation need to be defined in the Bill, otherwise it will have a large gaping hole.<\/p> <p> Content that is written in terms that are non-threatening, non-abusive and non-insulting but that is simply false, made up of complete lies and known to be false, would not be captured by the current definition of \"harmful content\", even if it amounted to a serious defamation of a particular vulnerable group or individual.  One could say something that is completely uncovered by the 1989 Act but is equally as dangerous or, in some cases, worse because it is completely untrue.  <\/p> <p> I appreciate that this might be seen by the ICCL and others as an online restriction of freedom of speech by requiring the take-down protocols to apply to a category of content that is not, under current law, unlawful.  However, we need to deal with it because if we do not, disinformation is the methodology that will be used to avoid the total impact and construct of the Bill in the first place.  If we do not do this, we will avoid an essential opportunity.<\/p> <p> Within what is currently constructed, people will be able to behave in a way that is harmful to others and they will provide content which, by its construct, will be bullying or humiliating and will promote or encourage behaviour that characterises certain facets such as an eating disorder, suicide or many other things.  I encourage the Minister to consider this.  As it is not named explicitly in the Bill, there are other ways in which this harmful content can be provided and it is not covered by this Bill.  I will put table an amendment that I wish to share and discuss with the Minister beforehand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100043#VV00200","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663772820,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I greatly appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I am well aware that the Minister brought it, at great length, through the Seanad.  Having listened in to some of those debates, I will try to avoid the repetition that happened during them and, indeed, in this debate because I only have brief time.  I only wish to focus on one area.  This legislation is ridiculously welcome.  I back it to the hilt.  It is long overdue.  We will be able to follow from clear case models in other jurisdictions but I have a fear.  The Bill is important in that we are providing a legislative framework but will we genuinely be able to see the difference?<\/p><p>When this legislation is passed, will we be able to lose the tag of the wild west when it comes to social media and the scale of the harmful content that is being posted every minute of every day, directly to every Member of this House?  I think we all acknowledge, however, that the ladies of this House get it far worse than the men.  It reaches every facet of our society, from the 14-year-old child at home, to someone who is on television, to someone who has just had a run-in with another person and is faced with continuous and repeated anonymous abuse and the most disgusting type of content.  One post gets taken down and then ten more crop up overnight.<\/p><p>I have said 100 times that I am sick and tired of social media companies that have taken a repeatedly <i>laissez-faire<\/i>approach to this.  How many times have all of us reported accounts or posts about us, colleagues, family members, friends and constituents only to hear that they do not violate X, Y or Z, when they are some of the most disgusting, vile things that anyone should ever have to see?  If someone were to say them on the street, one would be shocked.  One would not believe those words could come out of people's mouths.  However, hidden behind the veneer of anonymity and a screen in a darkened room late at night, people are prepared to say whatever they want.  Sadly, it still continues and too many social media companies are simply checking out when it comes to this area.  <\/p><p>How can we have genuine accountability in this space?  How can we use this legislation?  How can we use the new office of the commissioner to make the Internet and especially social media and messaging platforms a safer place, not just for our children, but for every member and entity in our society?  It is all well and good to talk about the hardship and experiences of people who have come to our offices.  Some of the people who have come to the Minister's office have come to my office as well.  We all know them well.  They are not just from the constituency but from various walks of life.  I genuinely want this legislation to work.<\/p><p>The scope of the Bill is crucially important but I have a reticence.  Perhaps we have all just been burned one too many times.  There has to be genuine enforcement to allow that level of accountability.  We are only on Second Stage and I listened with interest to Deputy Kelly talk about amendments.  Perhaps, in coming back on Report Stage, the Minister might lay out exactly what we can expect to see achieved, not in the general or legislative space, but in this specific place after the legislation is passed.  Where can we make these formats safer for ourselves and, crucially, for the constituents we represent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100045#XX00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1663772820,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I will offer a slightly contrarian view in the short time I have.  From the dawn of humanity we, as a species, have always sought to communicate with one another.  We have reached out, contacted and communicated through whatever means was available to us.  From hunter-gatherer conversations around the camp fire, to communicating with Armstrong on the moon and from Gutenberg to Zuckerberg, we have always innovated over and again to find new ways to communicate with one another.<\/p>  <p>  Right now, social media, in all of its expressions and forms, is the pinnacle of that expression and desire to connect with one another.  It is why my son who lives in Philadelphia can instantly communicate with his friends and family at any time of the day or night.  It is why people who are oppressed can organise and mobilise to rise up against their oppressors.  We are seeing a perfect example of that in Iran right now, where women are rising up and telling their oppressors they will not be dictated to as to what they can wear in public.  <\/p>  <p>  There is much to be protective about with regard to what exists within the social media space.  We need to be especially cognisant of that as we move forward to, quite rightly, regulate how social media works and ensure that in working, it works in the best interests of our people, especially our young people.  The function of government is, ultimately, to robustly analyse and parse the operation of social media and determine what is good about it.<\/p> <p>There are many good and positive aspects to social media but we need to assess where the dangers lie.<\/p> <p> Deputy Kelly spoke about misinformation and disinformation.  This should be one of the most crucial aspects of this Bill and I congratulate the Minister and her colleagues who have done incredible work in bringing forward legislation that will ultimately position Ireland not alone as a global innovator in technology but as a global innovator in the safe regulation of the use of technology.  We saw during the pandemic the serious destabilising power of misinformation and disinformation.  We saw lives lost as a result of disinformation.  I hope that in establishing the office of the commissioner, the Minister will ensure he or she is adequately resourced not only with respect to funds but also the expertise necessary to tackle misinformation and disinformation head on.  Frances Haugen spoke to us in committee about her experience of working in one of the social media companies.  She said the level of sophistication directed at the development of the algorithms that essentially allow us to see what the social media companies think we should see and need to see is such that perhaps only ten or 11 people in that social media organisation have the experience, talent and intellect to be able to figure out how they work and operate.  The commissioner needs to have similar expertise available to him or her.<\/p> <p> I have a final point to make.  It may not be important in the context of developing this legislation but it matters to an ongoing collaboration between the Minister's Department and the Department of Education.  We need to educate our children in how to navigate this space.  If they are to have the skills to be able to distinguish disinformation and misinformation from reality, we need to educate them in doing that.<\/p> <p> In Ireland we have been leading innovators in the development of digital technology and we are seen now as a global hub for that.  We can equally lead in the area of the regulation of that technology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100045#XX00300","speaker":"1483","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663773420,"counter":328,"content":"<p>While there are aspects of this Bill that need further consideration and work, there is so much of it I welcome.  Specifically, I very much welcome the inclusion of an online safety commissioner within the proposed media commission, whose role will be to address the proliferation of harmful online content.  This is very welcome and needs to be given appropriate compliance and sanction powers to deal with the serious threat of harmful online content.  There are so many positives to using the Internet and online content for information or entertainment purposes but it can be used in such a harmful way.  Safeguards for people online, especially children, are vital for mental health and well-being.  The Minister must, therefore, ensure there are ample options for recourse to protect people's safety rights online.<\/p>  <p>  Years ago, bullying in school was usually confined to school but that is not the case anymore and home is no longer a sanctuary.  Much of the hate speech or the harmful posts are published using a fake account as well.  It is clear self-regulation of online media has not been at all successful in recent decades.  Online content and media have changed beyond recognition and regulation has not kept up but tech giants need to be held responsible for the content they allow to be broadcast on their platforms.  They must be required to review and remove content deemed harmful and if they do not, they must face meaningful and severe sanctions.  There must be stricter controls on who can open an account to ensure verification of identity.  The tech giants also need to work with the Garda in providing information on those who post harmful content because it is not always the case.  In saying this, I must state also that reviewing harmful content is a role that requires safeguards to protect employees' mental health and well-being.  I ask the Minister how this Bill will ensure online platforms will be compelled to protect workers' rights in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill includes a content levy that should not be allowed to be passed on to customers.  It should be allocated primarily to the independent production sector to showcase Irish production and storytelling.<\/p>  <p>  Groups such as the Children's Rights Alliance, CyberSafeKids, the Ombudsman for Children and the ISPCA have all called for an individual complaints mechanism and, therefore, I welcome that the expert group has come to the conclusion that such a mechanism is feasible and that the Minister will seek Government approval for that.  However, a timeframe of at least two years for this is a long time for people to have to wait.<\/p>  <p>  The section dealing with freedom of expression is of particular concern.  In regulating content there is a fine line between personal liberties and freedom of speech and the protection of certain groups from harm.  Legislating against something as fundamentally subjective as causing offence is problematic and will also need further consideration.<\/p>  <p>  It is crucial the media commission be adequately resourced to ensure it can carry out its much-expanded work in a timely and efficient manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100046#YY00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1663773420,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill, which has many worthy aspects.  I will touch on some parts that, though they may not necessarily be problematic, certainly require further discussion.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's statements on some of the amendments she has tabled since the discussion in the Seanad, especially to do with the addition of the youth advisory committee.  I hope the Government understands the particular importance of listening to young voices on online safety.  No matter how much research we conduct about social media we will never achieve the level of online fluency those born in the past 25 years have achieved just by growing up in a digital age.  Like a foreign language, we could spend ten years studying it but there will still be terms and context that we do not understand and problematic dog whistles that do not translate.  If I was making policy in that language, I could miss out on messaging that could cause harm.  Online trends change like the weather and it can be difficult to dig into the pitfalls of a passing fad before it is gone.  Only those who have tuned in day in and day out can spot and sometimes even pre-empt the dangers of emerging discourse.  It is for this reason the commission's work on social media should be shaped by experts in that field.  Those experts should be aged under 25 and the membership should constantly evolve to keep people of a young age on it.  The youth advisory committee cannot be tokenistic.  It must be taken seriously or we risk being a step behind when safety concerns arise.<\/p>  <p>  It is all well and good speaking about future online dangers and how we might deal with them but anyone who spends time on TikTok, Instagram or any other Meta platform or Twitter will say kids are being exposed to dangers every time they turn on their phones.  We must stop speaking in hypotheticals about what might happen to a child online without safeguards and discuss the harsh realities they experience for countless hours, potentially each day.  As an example, if many parents of young children were asked what exactly TikTok constitutes, they would say it is where users post dances.  They are unaware the platform harbours hundreds of thousands of different communities and trends and that some of them are harmful.  Some of us might remember that in the early 2010s there was another social media platform called Tumblr that was all over the news for hosting content encouraging eating disorders, especially anorexia and bulimia, and countless children and teenagers fell into those online communities.  It was incredibly detrimental at the time.  The prevalence and severity of the content got so bad the company was forced to take a harder stance on moderation in 2012.  This resulted in users and communities that promoted eating disorders being removed and moving to other platforms.  In the past couple of years, video-based apps have seen a spike in what is described as pro-anorexia messaging and no matter their efforts to ban this content, there remains a high volume of videos on these platforms that could have a negative impact on the physical and mental health of young and older people around the country.  Even seemingly harmless \"Get ready with me\" or \"Choose my outfit\" videos frequently contain \"body checking\", where creators place an emphasis on viewing their body, their shape and their weight from different angles.  Sometimes this is under the guise of showing off clothes.  Though some creators mean no harm in making videos in this style, children and young people around the country are being bombarded with countless videos each day where there body is the subject, where their shape is under scrutiny and where standards are unrealistic and simply unattainable.<\/p>  <p>  It is extremely difficult to moderate content that hides its messaging and, therefore, we must provide educational resources to make users or their parents aware of the effects of those trends.  These examples are covert but explicit and extreme examples of those trends can still be easily accessed online via certain hashtags that evolve as they are banned.  This gives us another reason to listen to those who use the platform every day to warn about their potential dangers.  Eating disorders and body image is only one of thousands of issues this commission will have to tackle on social media.  Other examples include what is described as the alt right where violent messaging is rampant.  This often indoctrinates young people who are in vulnerable circumstances.<\/p> <p>Misinformation and disinformation are growing at an unprecedented rate, leading to kids being influenced by bad actors online.  It is still easy to accidentally stumble upon violent or sexually explicit content on platforms which claim to ban it.  I am sure they do but it just evolves too quickly.  I would like to understand how the Bill we are bringing through will address that.<\/p> <p> We all represent constituents who do not know how some of these apps work and do not know how to speak to their kids about the experience of them.  I would certainly like to see the commission commit to an education campaign informed by the youth advisory committee which would inform parents and guardians of how exactly these apps work.  Aside from the functionality, the campaign should address and explain trends and terms that parents may not understand so that they may identify if or when their child has been exposed to content that can be harmful.  A once-off public service announcement in the form of a pamphlet or online campaign simply would not be effective.  The commission should provide frequent updates whenever harmful trends are identified online so that users, parents and guardians can protect their children from being harmed or misled.<\/p> <p> Education is essential because social media companies often fall short of moderating content that may be dangerous.  It is the platform's responsibility to enforce its own rules and protect its users.  It is essential that we engage with the likes of TikTok, Instagram and Twitter to ensure they are committed to keeping their content safe.  Their standards right now are simply not good enough.  To give one example, I was made aware earlier this year of a trend where teenagers were attacking people on the street so that they could film it and post it to social media.  This phenomenon was organised and cultivated on popular video-based platforms and footage was hosted for an unacceptable length of time before being addressed by the companies in question.  I actually did have a positive experience when I reached out to TikTok and received a positive response from them.  That was one welcome example.  The commission must constantly be on the lookout for harmful trends like this one, which resulted in teenagers ending up in hospital with head injuries.  It must efficiently engage with companies to take down the content immediately as it is happening.<\/p> <p> It is important to keep in mind that content moderation is not an easy job, far from it.  Staff who are employed to sort through often disturbing imagery and footage require much better supports.  We are all aware of some companies advertising roles completely unrelated to content moderation only for staff, once hired, to be stuck sorting through violence, racism and sexually explicit content for hours on end.  It is an extraordinarily unforgiving job that takes a serious toll on mental health.  Social media companies have a responsibility to provide for their employees.  It must be ensured that these staff receive free counselling services, that they are given adequate breaks and that their contracts are fair.  This is not work anyone can do for hours on end without it affecting their health in the most detrimental ways.<\/p> <p> Social media can be an excellent tool for creativity, togetherness, entertainment and indeed for education.  We witnessed many of those positive aspects throughout the pandemic.  However, we must be alert to the pitfalls and protect those who are at greater risk of damage.  I fully believe the Minister is taking this issue seriously.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to working with her as it progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100046#YY00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663774020,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak in support of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  There is a whole realm of online content that is pretty unsavoury.  We all have to use the Internet every day socially and indeed for work.  However, there is a real murky side to it too.  Finally we are going to be putting forward legislation that will be enacted and will help us to police that better.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation paves the way for a new watchdog to regulate online services and to reduce the availability of harmful content.  It will also establish a new regulator, a multi-person media commission to which an online safety commissioner will be appointed.  It will establish online safety codes.  The really important thing here is that it will become a responsible entity with a responsible individual overseeing it.<\/p>  <p>  Heretofore what we have seen is that, in the large social media outlets in particular, all sorts of content appears on their platforms and they are inadequate, so far as I can ascertain, in terms of policing it themselves.  Not a week goes by but that I have to report certain comments or things coming my way.  Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and all social media platforms, in fact, seem incapable of effectively policing this.  The real litmus test will be how social media platforms and search engines respond to this legislation when it is brought into play.  We saw in recent weeks how Elon Musk is embroiled in an argument with Twitter over how it polices its content and how it filters messaging and tweets.  If that is happening at the highest level, with the richest man in the world squabbling with the company he was trying to buy, one would hope there will be enough meat in this legislation to really rein in the practice.  I would say most Members of this House have had to make complaints to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at one time or another.  Very often it can be a face-to-face interaction that can be unsavoury but I have had a number of occasions where there has been horrendous stuff happening online, stuff I have been subjected to myself.  I am not going to get into it here in this Chamber.  Each time I went to the Garda, it found itself pretty powerless in terms of following up on it.  The more legislation and regulation we get going in this regard, the stronger the provisions will be.<\/p>  <p>  It is really for the youngsters, the children of our classrooms.  I was a schoolteacher for 16 years.  They are so vulnerable to this.  As parents we are only fighting back when they are five or six, trying to deny them iPads and access to gaming platforms.  Before they are 11 or 12 they have phones.  They live in an online world and we need to protect them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1663774020,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Four minutes is very little time to do justice to an extremely significant and far-reaching piece of legislation.  I understand it has received very detailed scrutiny on the Seanad Stages.  I know the committee has been extremely active in that space and that the Minister has been very responsive in respect of the amendments that have been suggested and put forward.  I was thinking about smartphones like the yoke I am holding in the context of this debate.  The iPhone only went on sale first in 2007.  It is difficult to conceive of a technology that has rewired all of our brains in such a short space of time.  I predate it.  Thankfully I am a walking history lesson - we get to be that if we live long enough.  The children I used to teach, much like Deputy Crowe, have grown up in this environment and it is ubiquitous.  It is everywhere.  It dominates their waking world, it follows them into their bedrooms.  There is no part of their lives or their world that digital technology does not reach into.  We are seeing that massively in terms of young people's conception of their body image, the unattainable norms that are held up to them to try to achieve, and in the ease and pernicious nature of online bullying.  There is no escape from it.  They cannot close their front door or even their bedroom door on online bullying.<\/p>  <p>  This is an extremely important Bill to which I will struggle to do justice in the time available.  I want to focus on two aspects.  Ar dtosach b&aacute;ire, tos&oacute;idh m&eacute; amach ar mholadh at&aacute; curtha ar aghaidh ag Conradh na Gaeilge.

This is in response to an email I received from a constituent who is extremely worried about its impact on the teenagers in his house.  I was shocked to find we are the third-ranked country in the world in terms of gambling spend per head of adult population, with only Australia and Singapore ahead of us.  We know particularly from the GAA fraternity, where a lot of the intercounty players have spoken about how easy it is now.  It is on their phone and reaches into every aspect of their lives.  There is no time when that betting shop closes its door.  Someone can do it at 3 o'clock in the morning and if they are at it at 3 o'clock in the morning it is very difficult to put down.  Also, increasingly we are seeing advertising that is directed at people who are not adults.  I am referring to older teenagers and even younger children.  Deputy Cathal Crowe was talking about the games that are available on the iPads.  A lot of those have an element in them that begins to train our young people in that pay-off - spin the wheel, see what turns up.<\/p> <p>There is a real need in our society.  The Minister led with the idea of this Bill being very much about protecting our children and young people.  We need to strengthen that because those pieces of mobile technology that unlock so much in our world are also ubiquitous.  It means there is no door that we can close to them and that these concerns reach into every aspect of our young people&rsquo;s lives.  <\/p> <p> I would like the Minister to look at strengthening the Gaeilge provisions in the Bill and how best we protect our young people from what can become a serious and lifelong gambling addiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100047#ZZ00300","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663774620,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I am pleased to speak to this legislation.  Online safety affects all of our lives and we all experience the issue.  It is particularly acute when we think of children and young people at a very vulnerable age.  All of us can be annoyed and frustrated by things that are said about us online and so on.  For adults it is not as big an issue but it certainly is a big issue for younger people.  Teenage bullying, which has resulted in suicide in some cases, is one of the issues that needs to be dealt with in this legislation.  The platforms through which all of this works do not take their responsibility seriously enough.  While many Deputies have mentioned contacting the various companies and asking them to deal with these issues, they are very slow to take down the material.  Taking down the material is not nearly enough.  There needs to be consequences for people who will set out intentionally to damage someone&rsquo;s life in that way.  I hope the online media commission to be set up under the legislation will be able to deal this situation in a real way.  Too many people have suffered serious anxiety, worry and fear as a result of what has happened online in their lives.  I listened to some of the debate earlier and the issues raised are very serious for very many families.<\/p>  <p>  One of the problems this legislation will face is resourcing.  We have so many multimedia companies based and headquartered in Ireland and so much traffic, if you like, from all quarters of the world goes through here that we need to resource this adequately to deal with the problem we face.  <\/p>  <p>  Prominent among the issues being raised is freedom of speech.  People are entitled to have an opinion and put that view forcefully forward and have everyone see who they are when they are doing it.  When it is done anonymously, to cause hatred and fear or attack and undermine somebody there is a problem.  The multimedia companies have to be held to account for the way in which many people hide behind anonymous accounts when they engage in this sort of behaviour.  It is not appropriate that they can get away with that and simply allow people to behave in that fashion anonymously. <\/p>  <p>  Changes to the defamation law are needed to ensure that people who defame people, wherever they do it but particularly online, cannot just hide behind an anonymous account and get away with it.  In those circumstances, the multimedia or social media account holder needs to be held responsible for that defamation.  That is one measure that could be included in the Bill.  I have looked at legislation in respect of that and this is one of the ways forward.  <\/p>  <p>  In general, while the Minister is trying to do the right thing, she is trying to do an awful lot in one Bill.

Therefore, I welcome this legislation as a step forward, however small.  There are important issues around finding the best balance between preventing harmful content and the protection of free speech.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has raised important issues in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In this contribution, I would like to discuss the impact of social media and other online platforms on mental health.  This legislation defines one type of online harm as &ldquo;a risk of significant harm to a person&rsquo;s physical or mental health, where the harm is reasonably foreseeable.&rdquo;  There should be no space whatsoever for online content that is abusive and damaging to people.<\/p>  <p>  What about algorithms that promote and expose young people to such posts?  The creators of such algorithms may even be aware of their harmful impact but continue to allow them to run because they have demonstrated themselves to be profitable.  Such algorithms can create and promote unrealistic expectations.  Their interfaces are designed to be as addictive as possible to keep people coming back.  I am talking, for instance, about last year&rsquo;s Facebook leaks, which revealed that Facebook, now called Meta, the parent company of Instagram, had commissioned internal reports that showed the harmful mental health impact of their algorithms on young people.  One internal Meta presentation stated that among teenagers who reported suicidal thoughts, 13% of British teens and 6% of American teens traced the issue to Instagram.  Some 32% of teenage girls surveyed said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.  The research found 14% of young boys in the US said Instagram made them feel worse about themselves.  More than 40% of Instagram&rsquo;s 1.2 billion monthly users are 22 years of age or under.  Social media websites are constructed in this way not because it is the easiest or cheapest way but because it is the most profitable way, maximising time spent on these websites &ndash; engagement - and, of course, advertising revenue.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time as this internal report was produced, Meta's pre-tax profits in Ireland were &euro;890 million.  Globally, the company's revenue for this quarter alone is expected to be nearly $30 billion.  We have a situation where multibillion-euro companies are allowed to operate in a way that their own research shows is actively harmful to the mental health of young people.<\/p>  <p>  There is a huge positive potential that social technologies can offer in terms of communication and the interconnection of society.  However, it has been clearly demonstrated that we cannot trust these corporations to use these technologies in the best interest of society.  These massive corporations are actively and knowingly harming the mental health of young people.  They need to be taken out of the hands of the tech billionaires and run on a not-for-profit basis.  How that would be done precisely or in more detail is an issue that I will return to in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100048#AAA00300","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1663774620,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I am scheduled to share my time, so if my colleague shows up, I will yield to her.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Bill.  I know the Minister, the Department, the committee and a great many others have put a huge amount of work into it.  I commend everyone on their significant work on this extremely important Bill which has been long called for and is even more important today than it was when it was originally proposed.<\/p>  <p>  The creation of a new regulatory body that will implement, enforce and update rules on content is extremely important.  The commission will also update the new online safety codes and help tackle and reduce harmful content, with Schedule 3 to the Bill listing a range of categories on the basis of the legislation, including sexual offences, rape, people and drug trafficking and other offences that will be included.<\/p>  <p>  I will focus on the measures relating to cyberbullying, eating disorders and self-harm and-or suicide, which have the potential to cause extreme distress to young people engaging in the online world.  It is extraordinarily important for the children of Ireland and it is long overdue.  It also incorporates elements of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, which should not go unmentioned.<\/p> <p>As noted by other contributors to this debate, online bullying can have devastating consequences.  We know of many unfortunate incidents that have led to tragedies through many years.  While the online element of bullying is not always the beginning and the end of those experiences as it is often done in person as well, the anonymity that is offered online is a massive problem with which global society must deal, but if we can tackle it in Ireland, we should try to do so.  As Members of this House know only too well, bullying can be insidious and almost constant.  Younger people may not be as well equipped as adults to deal with harmful content or cyberbullying, or both, and any measure the Government can take through the establishment of the commission is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p> We can all speak about the more vulnerable members of society and the various tragedies that have befallen society in recent years with cyberbullying playing a significant role in tragic circumstances.  I understand, however, that several concerns have been raised in respect of the Bill and are being given due consideration by the Minister and the Department.  The Minister will be reviewing recommendations emerging from an expert group on this matter.  It is important that we get the steps correct and that the Bill reflects stakeholder views as much as possible.  I also recognise that the complaints mechanism is a complex area of legislation, not least due to the sheer volume of online content.<\/p> <p> I will mention infant formula because it is important.  I am pleased that the commission is being given the power to regulate this area, in line with public health advice.  It is worth noting that the Broadcasting Authority has been given authority under EU law to ban the advertising of such infant formula by broadcasters in Ireland.  There are certain things that some people might consider to be over-regulation and there are other areas that just make sense in terms of public health guidance and this is probably one of the latter.  I am not necessarily in favour of banning things but, in this instance, this may be one that should be acceptable to all.<\/p> <p> I note the creation of flexible legislation that will be able to incorporate forthcoming legislation and allow the commission to adapt to new measures.  That is very much to be welcomed.  As the Minister will know from her time on the Opposition benches, the most important aspect is the adequate resourcing of the commission.  That is imperative.  There is no point in giving the commission a role, particularly one that is this big, but not adequately resourcing it to carry out that role.  I acknowledge that there are acute difficulties in the area of employment because the State is virtually at full employment and it is difficult to encourage people to join the ranks of the public service or a semi-State body, whichever the commission might be considered, but, ultimately, if we resource the commission adequately then it will be able to perform its crucial role.  I have touched only on the role of the commission.<\/p> <p> It is important to go back to the major issue of our time, which is online content.  The ability of the commission to adapt to new platforms and new methods of communication and how that will interface, particularly with children, is of the utmost importance.  A couple of minutes ago, I got my first text message from my 11-year-old son, who has just been given a mobile phone.  He has three names in his phonebook and he will not be able to add to it, I am pleased to say.  One becomes acutely aware of these things.  As a public representative for 18 years, I have been subjected to horrors, quite frankly, as, I am sure, have all present.  If we can do something in this House, however, to protect the children of today and those of tomorrow, it will be worthwhile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100048#AAA00400","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663775220,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister, the Department and the committee on the work they have done on the Bill to date.

The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice has completed pre-legislative scrutiny on the gambling regulation Bill and is awaiting the publication of the legislation.  In the interim, however, a CEO has been appointed.  I wish her well in her role and look forward to meeting her to discuss her plan of action.  It has taken eight years but, finally, we have a person in place who I hope will have a much-needed impact on the regulation of gambling and the reduction of harm.  I have undertaken a series of meetings with various stakeholders, including large social media companies, regarding the impact their services have on those who are vulnerable to gambling harm.<\/p>  <p>  There are some seriously concerning trends.  Most recently, a large gambling company promoted advertising through other companies.  I was on a social media site recently and watched a video from Comedy Central only to see, at the bottom of the screen, a big promotion from a large gambling company.  The video was topped and tailed with gambling advertisements.  Similar links between newspapers and gambling companies have come up on other social media sites.  I know the Minister made some movement on this issue on Report Stage in the Seanad and, while that is good to see, I am not convinced it is strong enough or goes far enough.  There is a difference between having regard to policy and having a formal relationship.  I believe the media regulator and the gambling regulator require the latter.  Social media platforms must do more and must be held responsible because they are not protecting people, especially younger people and children, from online bullying and abuse.  Anonymous accounts that viciously attack people must be stopped or shut down.  Social media companies must not be allowed to self-regulate because their self-regulation so far has failed to protect people.  It is their duty to protect people.

In the previous Government, I worked in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We were involved in the online advisory group, which I chaired.  I know there is a difficult task ahead to try to rein in cyberbullying and make sure we put in place legislation that is not just valid in this country but can be used along with international law to make sure that cyberbullying and all that goes with that is curtailed on a global scale.  In this regard, I think of young people, the vulnerable and the innocent.  We cannot drop our standards in respect of what is tolerated on social media and the exposure of young and not-so-young children and teenagers to some of the abuse that can go on.  These standards must be kept at the highest level.  There is a significant onus on tech companies to conform and engage with Governments to ensure the legislation that is put in place is workable and that they work with it.  It is important that if there are issues, they act swiftly to make sure every action possible is taken to stamp out the problem and protect children.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that social media and all that goes with it has brought the world closer together.  It is a marvellous tool that we can use.  I know of many people living in Australia who can speak to their parents or grandparents using social media.<\/p> <p>They can look at them and chat in an instant using devices in their hands.  That is an unbelievable march we have made in digital development.  The potential is there to bring that further in regard to healthcare and whatever else we need to do.  The sky is the limit.  However, one legacy that is building up is the abuse that takes place on these online services.  I commend the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.  It is important that we tackle this issue and work with everybody involved in this industry.<\/p> <p> The Bill also included provisions on media regulation.  Our local radio stations are close to my heart.  Most Deputies rely on their local radio stations to get their views out and see them as a listening tool to know what is happening in their constituencies.  The development of local radio has a positive influence and a major impact.  Local radio stations are also balanced in their approach to current affairs and the entertainment they provide.  I will highlight to the Minister a number of issues that we need to ensure we get right.<\/p> <p> I understand local radio stations are excluded from the journalism bursary that is on offer.  We should amend that to ensure that any bursary that is offered is available in the regions to train young journalists in the regions in order that we have a supply chain of good journalists to take care of future needs.  Dare I say it but journalists do not have to be in Dublin.  They need to be in the constituencies, working with local radio.  They get a better experience of life by doing that.  It is important that local radio stations are included in any bursaries available.<\/p> <p> There is a levy on independent stations.  We should reduce that levy to allow radio stations to develop and ensure they are fit, viable and sustainable into the future.  They are competing for advertising, as are the local newspapers which are also a vital component of regional Ireland.  It is important that local radio stations get every opportunity to survive and become sustainable and get as much of a break as possible throughout this legislation.  We will look at the legislation with a view to bringing forward some amendments on which I will speak to the Minister.<\/p> <p> Local radio stations should be funded in a way that makes them competitive and viable.  If we are to have a democratic society, we must have local radio stations and other local media reporting local issues.  They do that in a fair way so it is important that they are treated fairly and even shown some positive discrimination to ensure they survive.  We must remember all of that when dealing with this Bill.  We will introduce amendments on Committee Stage and we look forward to working with the Minister on those.<\/p> <p> To return to my first point, our children are the most important thing we have.  They are our future and we have to make sure we mind them and regulate online safety.  I will support the Minister in any way I can help to make sure that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100049#BBB00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663775820,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Deputy Murnane O'Connor missed her slot but as the next slot is a Government one and there are no other Government speakers present, she can speak in this seven-minute slot.

For too long, the Internet has been the wild west and our children's exposure to it has been devastating in many cases.  This Bill is historic.  It proposes a long-awaited reform to the Irish media regulation landscape by establishing a watchdog to regulate online services and reduce the availability of harmful content online.  Despite much legislation we all accept that there is a massive gap both internationally and in Ireland when it comes to addressing harmful online content.  This new law will close the legal gap and establish a robust framework to deal with the spread of harmful online content.  We must have accountability by platforms for online safety and a more joined-up approach to audiovisual media regulation.  I urge all Members to support that.  One of the most important aspects of the Bill is that it establishes a new, powerful regulator to enforce accountability in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will introduce a content levy on online media services.  I support the many calls I have received asking for this levy to be set aside to increase investment in the Irish audiovisual sector.  Each year that we do not introduce a content levy the Irish audiovisual sector loses out on a minimum of &euro;25 million in additional investment according to an analysis by Indecon.  We must do all we can to nurture Irish creative talent and opportunities for Irish casts, crews and audiences.  I am a great believer in supporting Irish and supporting local and this is all about the local.  Irish audiences are currently paying for online media services, with only a small number of homegrown productions using local casts and crew available to watch.  If Irish people are to choose these platforms, we have to ask that they support Irish-made productions in the same way they support Irish-made crafts, food and other items.  For the same reason, I support the content production scheme to encourage the creation of European work, including independent Irish productions.<\/p>  <p>  I will also support amendments providing that an coimisi&uacute;n will have a particular commitment to the safety of children and to require an coimisi&uacute;n to have regard to matters relating to child safety and to the regulation of gambling and the policies of Government, relevant Ministers and public bodies in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Previous speakers also spoke about infant formula.  It is important that families can access objective information regarding feeding their infants and young children free from commercial interests.  I would like to see society becoming more supportive of the decision and actions of mothers around feeding, whatever they may be.  To do that, we must ensure that we are not promoting heavily in one area and not offering the same support in the other.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, I support all things local and Irish.  We spoke about young journalists and local media.  I was at the ploughing championships today.  There was a huge crowd there, which was excellent.  Local media were also there, including KCLR from Carlow and Kilkenny.  We have to make sure we have funding for everything local and the job local radio does.  To give an example, during the Covid pandemic it was crucial that people got information in their homes.  It is all about supporting local.  I ask the Minister to support local media and radio stations in any way she can.  Having spoken to her, I know this is a concern of hers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100050#CCC00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1663775820,"counter":343,"content":"<p>My apologies, I need to catch my breath.  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill provides for the establishment of a multi-person media commission, including an online safety commissioner.  It also dissolves the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and assigns its functions to the media commission and transposes the revised audiovisual media services directive.  This directive provides for the regulation of video sharing platform services and establishes a framework for the regulation of online safety to address harmful online content, which will be administered by an online safety commissioner.  The modernising of our laws in these areas is to be welcomed.  It is clear that stronger safeguards for people online, especially children, are vital in terms of mental health and well-being.  Self-regulation of online media has not been successful and the current legislation is outdated.<\/p> <p>Online content has changed beyond expectation and the legislation has failed to keep up.<\/p> <p> Other issues that need to be addressed include a wider definition of harmful content to include 40 existing criminal offences; cyberbullying; the promotion or encouragement of eating disorders, self-harm or suicide; and the making available of knowledge of methods of self-harm or suicide.  The Bill also provides for additional categories to be added in the future, including both criminal and non-criminal categories.  It is all very well providing the framework in this legislation, but the Minister must also ensure there are ample options for people who are aggrieved to take action to protect their safety rights online.<\/p> <p> We must ensure there is investment and promotion of Irish-language media.  Online platforms should be held to high standards of transparency.  The media commission must be adequately resourced to ensure it can carry out its expanded workload.<\/p> <p> This Bill provides for a complaints mechanism under the new commission, but it does not go far enough.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, several groups including the Children's Rights Alliance, CyberSafeKids, the Ombudsman for Children and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children called for an individual complaints mechanism to ensure an option is open to members of the public when platforms refuse to take action to remove content.  Not surprisingly, social media companies like Twitter and Facebook lobbied against such a mechanism.  The chosen mechanism must strongly favour the protection of the public.  A similar model exists in Australia.<\/p> <p> We must consider the well-being of the staff who work in the area of reviewing harmful content.  There must be safeguards to protect employees&rsquo; mental health and well-being.  What better place than this Bill to implement these safeguards?<\/p> <p> Gambling is not covered directly in this Bill but there is a great deal of academic evidence to show that online gambling can increase problem gambling behaviours.  We must ensure adequate safeguards are included to address the harm caused.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100050#CCC00500","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663776420,"counter":345,"content":"<p>We move now to Deputy Michael Collins.

There are two other speakers coming like a train behind me.<\/p><p>The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 has the potential to create a level of accountability that is sorely needed.  According to the Children's Rights Alliance, however, critical measures are needed to ensure the legislation lives up to its name.  The Bill envisages the appointment of an online safety commissioner and the creation of a new media commission with the power to fine non-compliant companies up to &euro;20 million, or 10% of turnover.  However, complaints can only be brought by nominated bodies and not by individuals.<\/p><p>This is a very serious Bill.  It is something I support.  I feel it is going in the right direction.  Young people have very serious concerns.  They are being bullied online.  All sorts of shenanigans are going on, unfortunately, on their mobile phones and in the world that we live in today.  My own feeling, and this was the case with my own children even though they are not children now, is that children have too much access to mobile phones.  The dangers that are on them can upset children, and that can lead to many serious mental health issues.  That issue needs to be addressed and I hope this Bill helps to address it.<\/p><p>I also encourage parents to act.  I was talking to a person recently and their child was with them.  I spent three and a half minutes talking to the child.  During that time, the child never took its head out of the phone, even though the child was answering me to the side.  I like talking to children - it is lovely to do so - because they are very intelligent and tend to be more open about things, but that child would not look away from the phone during that time period.  Mobile phones have children completely perplexed.  Parents need to stand up and be a little stronger in saying to children that they need to put away the phone sometimes in life.  Children need to get back to the ordinary things that young people used to love, such as helping out in the local community and doing things in local community organisations, even if it is only a bit of Tidy Towns work or something small like that.  These activities deliver a great deal more satisfaction than looking at a mobile phone during every spare minute that the child has.<\/p><p>I would like to make another point while I am talking about the media.  I was at a presentation in Leinster House on a slightly different issue last week.  I suppose it was also about getting out the freedom of information to advise young people.  Two newspaper organisations, Local Ireland and NewsBrands Ireland, were lobbying for a 0% VAT rate for publishers to bring them in line with many other countries, including the UK.  This would help in some way to meet the massive challenges they are currently facing.  A total of 16 newspapers have closed in Ireland in the past decade.  This does not just concern print media; it also concerns digital media.<\/p><p>While I am at it, I would like to thank the digital and print media in my constituency of Cork South-West, including the <i>Southern Star<\/i>and <i>The Courcey Chronicle<\/i>.  I also thank Neil Michael who recently travelled with us to Belfast on our 100th Belfast or Blind coach journey.  He saw for himself the difference this makes.  He was good enough to print some of the patients' stories and experiences.<\/p><p>It is very hard to get a fair trial from the media at times.  I am often quite critical of RT&Eacute; for rarely having members of the Rural Independent Group on its political shows.  We have a political voice out there.  If that is bullied and pushed aside, it leaves a great deal to be desired.<\/p><p>As we all know, the Internet is a fantastic tool as long as it is used properly.  We all saw the benefits of the Internet over the lockdown period.  We saw how invaluable it is in Dublin and in bigger cities where it is available.  Unfortunately, rural Ireland still does not have proper connection.  This is a very serious issue that has not been completely addressed.  The wireless operators have been trying to address that to the best of their abilities but certainly the roll-out of broadband has been a big failure of this and of previous governments.<\/p><p>As I have said, this Bill has the potential to create a level of accountability.  That is what every one of us here should support.  We should not have to see people being hurt or wrongfully tried by someone on social media.  In quite a number of cases, people's lives have been ruined.  It is something I feel very strongly about.  I hope that this Bill will go a long way to create an open society.  One of the biggest things is that when people are wronged and they try to rectify that wrong, nobody is there to do that.  Hopefully, this Bill might be able to work on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100051#DDD00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1663776420,"counter":347,"content":"<p>We have four minutes remaining.

I look forward to the Minister passing and enacting it because the pernicious activities that go on with online content are quite shocking.  As adults, we can deal with it but we have seen horrible cases in the past.  As we know, people have been under very significant pressures.  Some people have lost their lives as a result of it.This legislation is a long time coming and is badly needed.

I look forward to a day when this issue will be dealt with.  I hope the laws will be strong enough and will be effective in dealing with this behaviour.  This is not an easy area to traverse.<\/p><p>I would like to salute the print media in my own county, and in Waterford and beyond.  The local press is a very important part of our whole story, heritage and being.  It was so sad to see the diminution of many of those outlets.  Indeed, we meet them here regularly.  We met representatives of <i>The Nenagh Guardian<\/i>last week.  I salute that newspaper, the <i>Tipperary Star<\/i>and all of the many other outlets that are there, including the <i>Waterford News and Star<\/i>.<\/p><p>It is a different story with <i>The Nationalist<\/i>because there has been a takeover involving up to 14 publications.  They were taken over by a big company, a conglomerate of quite nasty people.  They sold the offices of our newspaper, <i>The<\/i><i>Nationalist, <\/i>and have all of the staff working from home.  Many staff with 30 or 40 years of service were dumped unceremoniously - they were just dismissed - and treated outrageously.  It is a terror what greed can do, and what people who are reckless and careless and think they are answerable to no one can do.  Now the newspaper has no home to work in.  It has no office.  Everyone is working from home, as everybody was during the Covid-19 pandemic.  When I spoke to some journalists last weekend, I learned that they are still working from home.<\/p> <p>I have no idea if they will ever again have an office but I do not believe they will.  An old building was bought in the town but there is no sign of that being refurbished.  We must be conscious of the workers, the great people, the reporters, the scribes, the editors and the different people who worked there over the decades, and all local media, which is so important.  We then have the national broadcaster and the competition there, and the unfairness in regard to TG4 and others.<\/p> <p> I have to thank Gript Media.  But for Gript Media, an independent organisation, some of us would not exist at all because if you do not suit the narrative here and do not obey the narrative and fall in line with it, you are banished.  That is a sad state of affairs for the national broadcaster and it should be looked into and examined.  It ill behoves the name &ldquo;national broadcaster&rdquo; when it will not cover every group and every Teachta D&aacute;la who has something to contribute.  It might not suit its narrative and everything else, but it is important that all voices are heard, whether it be in the print media, on television or otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100051#DDD00500","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663777020,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to adjourn the debate.

Shortly after the Bretton Woods Agreement (Amendment) Bill completed Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in March 2022, the European Central Bank, ECB, made a determination on two IMF transactions in which Ireland, together with many other IMF members, participated.  These transactions concerned the transfer of funds from two IMF accounts, the special contingency account, or SCA-1, and the deferred charges adjustment, to the administered accounts for Somalia and Sudan for the purpose of clearing the arrears that both countries had with the IMF.  In anticipation of the ECB finding and the likelihood that corrective measures may be required, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, indicated on Committee Stage that an amendment to facilitate a payment from the Central Fund to the Central Bank of Ireland for IMF transactions was being considered.  The amendments to be discussed here today are the result.<\/p><p>It is important to understand that these transactions took place in the context of the heavily indebted poor countries, HIPC, initiative.  The Deputies may recall the HIPC initiative was launched by the IMF and the World Bank in 1996 to allow the international community, including multilateral creditors, to work together to lower the debt burden of the most heavily indebted poor countries and to permanently end repeated rescheduling of debts for these countries.  Somalia and Sudan were deemed eligible for debt relief under the HIPC initiative in 2020 and 2021 respectively.  However, as the IMF did not have sufficient internal resources to clear the arrears that Somalia and Sudan owed to the fund at that time, they instead invited member countries to forgo their portion of two accounts, the SCA-1 and the deferred charges adjustment, to fund the debt relief.  This followed the model that the IMF had previously used for Liberia in 2008-09.  Ireland, together with over 100 IMF members, agreed to contribute to the clearance of arrears to the IMF by consenting to forgo its share of SCA-1 and the deferred charges adjustment.  In total, Ireland agreed to the transfer of &euro;8.3 million from these two accounts, the IMF&rsquo;s administered accounts for Somalia and Sudan.<\/p><p>Following the clearance of arrears to the IMF and other multilateral creditors, both Somalia and Sudan successfully reached the HIPC decision point which provided both countries with vital access to the grant financing necessary to meet their public finance and development needs.  In the case of Somalia, on the day the country reached the HIPC decision point, the IMF executive board approved a new three-year arrangement for just over &euro;363 million under the extended credit facility and the extended fund facility.  Similarly with Sudan, the decision point was accompanied by an announcement that the IMF had approved an extended credit facility programme for approximately &euro;2 billion.  These outcomes were warmly welcomed by the two countries and the international community, given the strong signals they gave against the context of protracted conflict and economic problems in these regions.<\/p><p>In late 2021, a number of member states raised a query with the ECB regarding the transfer of these resources to the administered accounts for Somalia and Sudan.  Upon further investigation, it transpired that both transactions may have contravened a prohibition on monetary financing under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  This issue arose from the manner in which the funds for the SCA-1 and deferred charges adjustment were generated and the fact that, in several member states, a portion of these resources actually belonged to the national central bank rather than the finance ministry.  Without wishing to get too technical, a brief explanation may be helpful.<\/p><p>Both the SCA-1 and the deferred charges adjustment were established under the IMF's burden-sharing mechanism, which raises funds by marginally increasing the rate of charge paid by countries which owe money to the IMF and reducing the rate of remuneration paid to creditor members.  The Central Bank of Ireland, as a custodian of Ireland's SDR, or special drawing rights, which are held as part of the country's national reserves, receives the interest payments made by the IMF on Ireland's quota.  As such, the portion of the SCA-1 and deferred charges adjustment generated from the reduced rate of remuneration was technically owed to the Central Bank rather than to the Exchequer.  In April 2022, the ECB made its final determination, including that the financial donations provided by several national central banks via the IMF for debt relief from Somalia and Sudan were not compatible with a prohibition on monetary financing.  The ECB also instructed the member states concerned to take corrective measures and, in Ireland's case, the breach of the prohibition on monetary financing had to be rectified by the restoration of these amounts to the Central Bank by the Exchequer.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 2 introduces a new section to the Bill which provides the legal mechanism for this corrective measure, a once-off payment of &euro;6.6 million from the Central Fund to the Central Bank of Ireland.  This sum represents the Central Bank's share of IMF resources that were transferred to the administered account for Somalia in 2020 and for Sudan in 2021, namely, &euro;876,071 and then &euro;5,676,032.<\/p> <p>Following close consultation with the Attorney General's office, the amendments being discussed were drafted to provide the legal mechanism for the Minister for Finance to make this once-off payment of &euro;6.6 million from the Central Fund to the Central Bank of Ireland.  These amendments will restore the Central Bank's share of the IMF's SCA-1 and deferred charges adjustments, thereby satisfying the ECB's requirement for corrective action.<\/p> <p> While it is regrettable that we should find ourselves on the wrong side of an ECB ruling in any instance, I would like to think Deputies understand and appreciate the motivation for the actions that have led us to this situation, that is, to provide much-needed debt relief to HIPCs at a critical time in their histories.  Ireland, along with more than 100 member countries, was willing and able to work with the IMF to help Somalia and Sudan to address their significant debt burdens.  Legislative measures are now required in this Bill to remedy the situation.  The amendments we are considering provide the necessary legislative basis for a once-off payment from the Central Fund to the Central Bank in respect of a sum of up to &euro;6.6 million.  This sum represents the Central Bank's share of resources in the IMF's SCA-1 and deferred charges adjustments, which were transferred to the administered accounts for Somalia and Sudan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100052#EEE00700","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663777620,"counter":357,"content":"<p>We are dealing with the recommital of amendments Nos. 1 and 2.

I would appreciate if the Minister of State could outline the specific purpose of these IMF accounts.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation had been well flagged before reaching the D&aacute;il.  It aims to facilitate the State's participation in the IMF's new arrangements to borrow, NAB, process and streamline procedures for contributing to IMF trust funds.  The role of the IMF is crucial.  It includes the facilitation of international trade, promotion of employment and sustainable economic growth and the reduction of global poverty.  A core responsibility is the provision of loans to member countries that are experiencing balance of payments problems.  Resources for IMF loans to its members are provided by member countries, primarily through their payments of quotas.  Multilateral and bilateral borrowing serve as a second and third line of defence, providing temporary and supplementary resources.<\/p>  <p>  The NAB facility constitutes a second line of defence to supplement IMF resources to cope with an impairment of the international monetary system, with member countries and institutions lending additional resources to the IMF.  In January 2021, a reform of the NAB process took effect following consents from NAB participants, almost doubling the fund for the period from 2021 to 2025.  The core provision of the Bill is to allow the State to participate in the NAB facility within the IMF.  Section 2 provides for the approval of Ireland's participation in the NAB decision, whereby the Central Bank, acting in its capacity as Ireland's fiscal agent to the fund, will be responsible for providing a loan to the IMF in the case of a call on the NAB.  Under the terms of this decision, adopted on 16 January 2020, the State committed approximately &euro;2.3 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State has gone through the various sections and I will not do so again.  We recognise the need for Ireland to fulfil its obligations within the international community.  We recognise the role of institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank in our multilateral system.  For that reason, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the legislation, which will see Ireland participating in the IMF's NAB facility and thereby providing credit to the IMF in its operations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100053#FFF00500","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1663777620,"counter":361,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has moved the recommital of both of these amendments.

I have no wish ever to confuse the House or speak in any way that is not clear.  Sometimes, however, it is important that I put the exact wording on the record.<\/p>  <p>  By way of explanation, what we are talking about here is a 1996 initiative by the World Bank and the IMF called the HIPC initiative, the purpose of which is to provide debt relief for extremely poor countries.  More than 20 countries have qualified for relief under the initiative.  In the case of Somalia and Sudan, Ireland had lent them money through the IMF and the idea was that we would relieve them of that debt and nullify the amounts involved.  A Central Bank deposit was used to pay off the debts but the Central Bank is not allowed to spend money that should be spent by the Government.  That is considered to be monetary financing, which the ECB does not allow.  A technical ruling by the ECB found we should compensate the Central Bank for the sum it spent to relieve the debts of Sudan and Somalia, which is &euro;6.6 million.  There is no legal mechanism to do that without passing these amendments to the Bill.  To enable everything to remain legal, avoid the possibility of monetary financing, comply with the ECB rule and help Somalia and Sudan to be relived of their debt, we are proposing these amendments.

Turning specifically to amendment No. 16 in this grouping, I introduced provisions into the Bill on Committee Stage to underpin the creation of an office to be called zero emission vehicles Ireland.  It is intended that this office will play an important role in advancing us towards our target of having 1 million electric vehicles on our roads by 2030.  In establishing ZEVI and developing electric vehicle policy, the intention has always been that the concept of electric vehicle includes a wide range of electric and electric-assisted vehicles, including bicycles, tricycles, cargo bikes, mopeds, motorbikes, microcars, velomobiles, cars, buses, vans and a full range of goods vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  As I explained on Committee Stage, ZEVI will take on functions currently spread across my Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, the NTA and TII.  It will provide drive and focus for our efforts to promote electric vehicles in particular.  The intention was to establish this office, in the first instance, within my Department on an administrative basis, pending the passing of the legislation.  This has now been done.  The passage of the legislation will provide the basis for ZEVI's functions and I intend to transfer it over to the TII later.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Leddin is proposing to insert a definition of \"Zero to low emission vehicles\".  This would bring a level of clarity in this regard, and I shall discuss this with the Attorney General with a view to tabling a similar amendment in the Seanad.  Deputy Leddin is also proposing a wide suite of specific research and reporting activities for ZEVI.  The principles behind this are already provided for in section 56(3) in Part 15.  This section refers to the Minister and the ZEVI office being initially, as I shall say, in my Department.  We plan later to transfer this office to TII and for it to \"carry out, arrange to have carried out or assist the carrying out of training and research activities in relation to zero to low emission vehicles and recharging infrastructure and refuelling infrastructure for zero to low emission vehicles\".<\/p>  <p>  We also wish to \"promote and assist research, development and demonstration of technologies connected with zero to low emission vehicles and recharging infrastructure and refuelling infrastructure for zero to low emission vehicles\".   We also wish the office to \"provide advice, information and guidance in relation to design, standards, accessibility, operation and consumer use of zero to low emission vehicles and recharging infrastructure and refuelling infrastructure for zero to low emission vehicles provide information\".  Finally, we expect ZEVI to \"engage with stakeholders and prepare reports in relation to the development of the electricity network to meet requirements for charging infrastructure for zero to low emission vehicles\".<\/p>  <p>  The additional points proposed by Deputy Leddin may help to round out these functions.  Therefore, as I said, I will also discuss these with the Attorney General with a view to proposing a similar amendment in the Seanad, with legislation subsequently returning to the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100054#GGG00900","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1663778220,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Having listened to this debate, do I understand correctly that an office is being set up that will be tasked with getting 1 million electric vehicles on our roads by 2030?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100054#GGG01000","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1663778220,"counter":382,"content":"<p>The ZEVI office has already been established on an administrative basis, pending the passing of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100054#GGG01100","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1663778220,"counter":383,"content":"<p>It simply beggars belief.  I am sorry.  I am again going to say that I admire the Minister's hopes and ambitions, but at some point policy will have to be grounded in the reality of where we are.  I do not have a problem with electric vehicles, but I do have a problem with forcing cars off the road.  There are very few charging points in rural Ireland even now.  A bigger problem, however, is that most people in this House, for example, would drive perhaps 50,000 km annually.  I see Deputy Michael Healy-Rae here and perhaps he, or Deputies Daly or O'Rourke, might concur with me.  Many people would drive that distance.  Most electric vehicles now have a lifespan of a maximum, I would have thought, of 250,000 km, or at least that is what I was told at the briefing by representatives of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, we have electric vehicles with a lifespan of five years, at which point they must be replaced.  They will be recycled, but a great deal of energy is involved in recycling vehicles.  Electric vehicles are fine for a certain cohort of the population.  If we are to have 1 million electric vehicles operating by 2030, however, has anyone thought of where the required energy is going to come from?  We are eight years away from 2030.  Do we have a plan?  We are struggling to fuel the State this winter, while we are intending to have 1 million electric vehicles by 2030.  Where is the required electricity going to come from?  I am serious about this point.  <\/p>  <p>  I am not deriding the idea, the hope and the ambition in this regard.  Only last year, Equinor pulled out of the Irish wind energy market because, apparently, there was a complete lack of ambition to bring in the regulatory and planning reforms required.  Today, representatives of the wind energy sector told us no ports in the Republic of Ireland have the necessary capacity to facilitate the development of the mammoth offshore developments that will be needed if we are going to harness wind energy on the scale required to provide all this electricity.<\/p> <p>We have no ports, no regulatory structures, no planning structures and an office tasked with getting 1 million electric vehicles by 2030.  Is there to be an office tasked with training pigs to fly by 2030?  I am genuinely baffled by the disconnect between where we are at and where we hope to get.  It seems the Government is continuing on blithely unaware of that.  Unfortunately, I do not see the plans to tackle that.<\/p> <p> I accept it might be possible.  I accept that Ardnacrusha went from conception to being commissioned and fuelling the energy needs of the State in the time period the Minister is talking about, which is eight years, but I simply do not see any sign of anything like that happening today.  On that basis, this amendment is as useful as an amendment providing for pigs driving cars or pigs flying and the absolute necessity to regulate that.  On that basis, I must oppose the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100054#GGG01200","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663778820,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I reiterate what I have said previously about electric cars.  I have nothing against electric cars but it is a fact people will buy electric cars when they are reliable and when they are a real alternative to what we have at present.  People cannot be forced out of good diesel cars that can travel the distance, let us say from Kerry to Dublin, without having to refuel.  I can actually go back home again, just about, without refuelling, but if that was an electric car, there is no way in the world that I would make it up here in one day, given the length of time it takes to charge cars the distance they would go.<\/p>  <p>  I will say for the benefit of whoever is listening that one of my cars has 750,000 km done.  It is a diesel car and it is going perfectly.  It is 16 years old.  Will the Minister tell me what electric car will travel that distance?  What account of the electric car will there be after two or three years?  What will it be worth and where will you go with it because you cannot dispose of the battery without paying an enormous sum for it?  No scrap dealer will take an electric car for scrap because he or she must pay too much to dispose of the battery.<\/p>  <p>  To get back to the crunch of the issue, if we added all these electric cars now coming up to Christmas and the worry that we have with providing electricity for the utilities it is needed for at present, where would they be?  Would they be all parked along the M50, N7 or whatever it is, having given up because there would be no electricity to keep them going?  We must be realistic.<\/p>  <p>  As for forcing people, the Minister has this idea, and his party and the people who support him are saying, that people should not be allowed to buy diesel and petrol cars.  That is democratically wrong.  Let people make up their mind, and when the electric car is a reliable and useful option, they will buy them without being forced to buy them.  They should not be forced to do that.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister seems to be electric mad and for nothing else, but there are other options out there.  There are biofuel options.  I have been told - my group met with these biofuel groups - that the Government would not listen to them.  If that biofuel was added to the diesel, there would be no emissions.  The Government does not want to listen to that.<\/p>  <p>  People are stressed and they cannot buy new cars.  The Minister told them to buy diesel cars in 2007 and now he is telling them they must get rid of them and buy electric cars.  What will the Minister think of in a couple of years' time?  That is the worry.<\/p>  <p>  There are options.  Take the petrol car, for example.  In 1975, my father had a petrol car.  Its registration number was 236 PRI.  It was converted to gas.  The same crowd, the liquid petroleum gas, LPG, crowd, came into us.  They say that if that type of gas was used in the petrol cars again, it would reduce the emissions to practically nil.  They also told us the Government would not meet with them, the same as the biofuel people.  What connection has the Government that it does not want to listen to any other option?<\/p>  <p>  There is no harm in getting down emissions, and I have nothing against electric cars, but they are not a viable, realistic or affordable option right now.  Everyone here knows how much people are caught up short of money for everything with the cost of everything gone up.  Do we want to exacerbate the problem by telling them it is a matter of keeping what they have for the foreseeable future?  Maybe the Government wants them to get out and walk.  The Minister suggested that one car would do 30 people in a village.  I can assure him that three people in Kilgarvan village would not manage with one car.  Everyone needs the car they have and they will not give it to anyone else because they need it.  You cannot go anywhere in rural Ireland without a car.  It is fine here, as there are brand new shiny buses the Government is putting the carbon tax it collects into and which the people in rural Ireland are paying for, but the Minister has to be realistic.  The electric car will be bought when it is a reliable, affordable and realistic option.  Right now, it is not and forcing people to do just that is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  To top it all, the Government does not have the infrastructure.  I did not hear of any extra charging points being placed along filling stations or anywhere.  In Kerry, they cannot afford to do it and they are getting no help from the Government.  The Government will have to wake up.  The Minister will have to be real.  People have to get up in the morning and they must have something reliable to take them to work.  If they are travelling long distances, an electric car will not do that.  It will suit some housewives and people doing short runs but at present the design is not good enough to take them on long journeys.  Until that happens, the Minister is wasting his time, and everyone else's time as well, and he is hurting and making more angry the people in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100055#HHH00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1663778820,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I would like to speak to this amendment.  Of course, the discussion is mainly built around electric cars.  We have 50,000 electric cars in 2022 and the target, to the best of knowledge, is 850,000 by 2030.  Everybody else in the world knows that is not achievable.  Most likely, by 2030 anyway, they will be in the dump heap and most people will be told to go back to some other forms of transport.<\/p>  <p>  On a private note, and I very rarely use private conversations I had with the Minister, on one occasion the Minister asked me what was wrong with a car and a plug-in unit for an electric car out in Goleen where I come from and the lovely pubs that are out there, mentioning there is O'Meara's, the Lobster Pot and the Fastnet Bar.  The Minister probably knows well.  In fairness, he has been cycling - not maybe drinking in the pubs but cycling - around that side of the country.  The problem is we do not have any plug-in chargers.  That is a major issue in rural Ireland.  For instance, I had to leave there yesterday at 4 a.m.  How far would it have got me if I had a plug-in unit in the local plug-in station, wherever it would be - probably closer to the Cork side?  There are probably a few in west Cork, but not many.<\/p> <p>It is a shame that we are talking about electric cars, which are meant to be the future, but that they have not delivered and the Government has not delivered the proper resources for people to have or to purchase electric cars.<\/p> <p> I got an email recently from a taxi operator who bought a second-hand electric car and it basically went wallop.  I stand to be slightly corrected on this but I think the cost involved was &euro;14,000.  He said buying an electric vehicle was the biggest mistake of his life.  That person is in a city, where he could have had plenty of opportunities to plug in, but the battery or the unit gave him trouble and there was no warranty.  It is like a pig in a poke.<\/p> <p> We have also the issue of potentially having no electricity.  There is a great danger that the power in this country will blow out some night.

I live on Mizen Head and I know how long it takes to travel to the D&aacute;il daily, or maybe once or twice a week sometimes, and I know for a fact that if I were to depend on an electric vehicle, I would not be here serving the people.  The fuelling of vehicles, whether a lorry, a tractor or even a basic lawn-mower, will not be worked by battery or by air.  It will have to be worked by fuel, no matter how long or short the journey and no matter how much we talk about it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said earlier that the Government will not meet to discuss the alternatives, and there are alternatives.  There is a gap to be bridged there.  The Government is afraid to do that.  For some reason it is determined to put fuel out of the price reach of people trying to make a day-to-day living.  The Government is quite happy with fuel prices going out of control and with a hefty tax take out of that going into the Government coffers, leaving people severely out of pocket.  The Government can boast that it has a massive surplus to give out in the budget.  I certainly hope it will give it out properly.  If it does not, I hate to think of the anger that will be put onto the anger out there already.  Fuelling vehicles is such an important thing, and the price of it is hurting people very badly in the pocket.  We do not have the confidence, and I do not think this country has the confidence, in purchasing electric vehicles and getting delivery from them.  People have been priced out of fuel, with the carbon tax added to it.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have Connecting Ireland in our rural communities, and that is forcing people to use the fuels that are there at present.  We do not have a proper bus service.  I will be talking to the Minister or maybe some other Minister tomorrow morning about that.  Connecting Ireland was meant to deliver.  It has failed miserably to deliver in my community, so people are forced into purchasing the vehicles and the fuel that are there at the moment.  I ask the Minister to meet to spend some time discussing the alternatives and the options out there.  His ideas might be good in 15 or 20 years' time, but for now they are not good for the people of rural Ireland, they are not viable and they are not there.  The Minister has to understand that we have to live the same as everybody else.  If I am talking about a man leaving from Mizen Head and travelling a journey I have to travel regularly, many more besides me have to travel to the cities and to Cork city daily, and they tell me the same thing.  Many of them are afraid to buy electric vehicles.  They feel that it will lead them into a massive loss, and many of them cannot afford to lose any more than what they are losing already.  When we have Connecting Ireland and proper public transport for people in rural Ireland, maybe we can look at the Minister's dreams to have 850,000 electric cars by 2030, but at this stage I do not think that will be achievable.  The Government has a long road to go, and we certainly will be keeping a very close eye on how all these targets will be delivered because this will not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100056#JJJ00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1663779420,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 10 to 16, inclusive, relate to pedal bicycles and pedal tricycles.

I have nothing at all against electric vehicles if they are to be used by people in areas where they can actually use them, but I look around this country and see the age of the vehicles and the age groups of people who have cars.  I am a father of four.  There are nine people in my house but seven cars.  They all go in different directions and do different things.  I recently upgraded my car after I overturned my previous one in February.  An electric vehicle would not do me because I tow.  I went and talked to the electric vehicle companies and asked them what the tow capacity of various cars would be and asked them about the mileage of the car if I was towing.  They said, \"Richard, this is not suitable for you in the position you are in.\"  There are many other people in this D&aacute;il for whom such cars would not be suitable either.  I average somewhere between 40,000 km and 50,000 km a year.  The companies also told me that it would not be viable for me to keep the car after X number of years.  Everyone knows that cars in this country are at an absolutely astronomical price at the moment, so to go from a petrol vehicle or a diesel vehicle even to another petrol or diesel vehicle is a big cost, not to mind going to an electric vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, a car dealership in Limerick did an open day for its new range of electric vehicles.  I will not mention the garage.  On its opening day it sold 12 electric vehicles ranging in price from &euro;120,000 to &euro;80,000 to &euro;60,000, only to be told by the manufacturer when the dealership went back to it the following day that it could supply only four of the 12 vehicles this year.  This is a mainstream dealer doing what the Government wants it to do and providing electric vehicles.  It can provide only four of those electric vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  I then talked to people in the local authority who had one electric vehicle in their family.  It would be a good idea if people who cannot afford to change cars were incentivised to change one vehicle in the house, but the Government has not come with such an incentive yet, and it should do.  There are people in this city who might do only 10,000 km in one year.  An electric vehicle should be ideal for them.  I left at 7.30 a.m. to come in here this morning from the Bray-Wicklow side.  I spent an hour and 20 minutes in traffic, lanes in and lanes out.  I tried to count how many electric vehicles I was passing.  I passed only seven in that hour and 20 minutes, in a city where there is public transport, including Luas, buses - you name it.  Then again, all the buses that were passing were on diesel fuel.  How do we incentivise people to buy electric cars or even hybrids?  The issue is the cost.  At the moment people are dealing with the cost of trying to keep the lights on.<\/p> <p>The Government is trying to put electric vehicles onto that grid and the power is not there, at a cost. <\/p> <p> Everyone I have been talking to about the charging points has told me they are going to increase the cost on the charging points because of what it costs them.  I was on the radio in Limerick last week.  The programme looked to see how many charging points were in Limerick city and then they looked at how many were working.  Only two were working within the city of Limerick.  Then going out to the hotels.  They had actually put in four and five points because they knew the tourist&rsquo;s point of view.  Therefore, the infrastructure in this country is being put in by businesses, not by Government.  Coming along the motorway to Dublin, some filling stations also have put in electric charging points.  It is businesses not Government.  The Government is going back to businesses all the time to try to put in infrastructure.<\/p> <p> I see where the Minister&rsquo;s vision is going and I agree with some of it.  We all want to bring down emissions.  However, when talking about electric vehicles, how much will they cost?  We have 2.2 million vehicles in this country.  Some people look at these vehicles in the context of a ten-year cycle in order to be able to afford them.  In most lease agreements that people get to upgrade their cars, they are looking for between five and seven years - it depends on the vehicle.  Many of the Jeeps that farmers have are 2006 and 2007 vehicles because that is all they can afford to make sure they can get to the market with cattle and get fodder for cattle.  That is all they can afford.  The Government wants them to upgrade to electric vehicles.  Inflation has gone through the roof which means car prices have gone through the roof.  There is also the issue of the recycling of these vehicles.  It does not make sense.<\/p> <p> Deputy Michael Collins recently referred to a person who bought a second-hand 2018 electric vehicle with 122,000 km on the clock.  At 130,000 km a fault arose with the car and the person was told, &ldquo;Sorry, the warranty only covers you to five years or 100,000 km&rdquo;.  He was being charged &euro;14,000 to upgrade the battery and they could not guarantee that the new battery would provide the same amount of power as the previous battery.  The wiring loom in some of the older electric vehicles in this country will not take the new upgraded longer life battery.  It is all downhill.  Yes, we see the vision, but we must also make sure it is affordable going forward, so why not incentivise something?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100056#JJJ00600","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663780020,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak to amendment No. 2 and related amendments Nos. 10 to 16, inclusive.

The Government has put the horse, the donkey, the jennet and the whole lot before the cart.  We do not have the infrastructure - full stop.  While this legislation is well and good, the power points are not available and the battery life is not there.  I got a taxi in Dublin last night.  It was a hybrid car.  They are fine because they keep charging themselves.  I do not understand the mechanism exactly, but they recharge when they are at a certain speed and when the petrol is added.<\/p>  <p>  Take a place like Clonmel.  I met the famous footballer, Babs Keating - he will not mind me quoting him &ndash; at a funeral recently in Ardfinnan.  He came from Dublin in his electric car and he greeted all the people who were waiting to go in.   He called me over and said that he had a bit of useless information for me.  He came down to where he normally charges his car, but the power charger was out of action.  He went to Clonmel, where there are two charging points in the car park, but there were three cars at one point and two at the other, so he could not wait as he had to go to the funeral.  He was at 20% charge leaving Ardfinnan on his way back to Dublin.  I said that he could stop in the motorway service station in Cashel.  He said that he could not as the station has different chargers that will not fit the car that he drives.  That is like when the mobile phones came out years ago, and they are still the same, with different chargers.  Is it a fact that electric vehicle chargers are not universal and that people have to be selective in what car they have and where they can be charged?  That surely is madness.<\/p>  <p>    Many of us meet with representatives from the Society of the Irish Motor Industry at the briefing yesterday.  They have their issues in trying to keep garages and everything else going but they cannot get the cars.  They simply are not available.  It is not only electric cars that cannot be got.  A taxi driver from the city got in touch with me about three months ago, shortly after the start of the holiday.  The battery went in his 2017 BMW car.  He did not know what happened.  It just stopped dead on the road.  So he had to get the AA or whoever it was to tow it away.  The battery was gone; just like that.  No warning.  It would cost him &euro;14,000 for a new battery and &euro;1,000 to fit it.

Where are these mined from?  The Minister has issues and hang-ups with fracked gas and bringing oil in from Barryroe.  He has issues about LNG storage.  Does he not mind child labour?  I am shocked and appalled by the Members in this House who will not even refer to it.  Child labour is used to mine cobalt for these batteries.  The children are seven and eight years of age.  This is our new dream electric industry built on the backs and the sweat and blood of children.  It sickens me to the bloody core of my being that this can be totally ignored by the Minister and all the global warriors for climate change.  This happens and we are passing legislation to try to protect our children from interference online.  This is shocking.  It is child labour in 2022 and we are turning a blind eye to it internationally.<\/p>  <p>  I was contacted about six weeks ago by a good friend of mine, an old businessman in Tipperary, who has an electric bike.  He had the bike which he had not used for about two or three weeks in his downstairs kitchen.  At 2 a.m., while he was upstairs, he heard an all-merciful explosion.  He thought it was someone breaking in, so he got dressed to go downstairs.  His wife ran down.  The battery had exploded in the bike.  It was not left charging or anything like that.  He had an awful job of covering it with coats to try to get it outside into the yard.  The manufacturer said that it would replace the bike.  No questions asked; do not tell anyone about this.  Cars have exploded.  Batteries have exploded in many places and it was all hush-hush.   They are a danger in apartments and houses.  The whole house could have burnt down.  His kitchen was seriously damaged.  I met him at the Bansha shows and he showed me the pictures of it and everything else.<\/p>  <p>  Come clean with the people, please.  We all want to mitigate against harmful emissions, but come clean and be honest with us.  We do not have the infrastructure.  We do not have longevity in the batteries.  People have said that when cars are driven for a certain number of kilometres, possibly 20,000 km, the battery life diminishes quickly.  Getting all the infrastructure in place, ensuring safety is paramount and, above all else, the heinous crime of child labour should be top of our agenda here.  I remember many people complaining about Nicaragua and the Sandinistas.  God knows, every other issue in the world has been complained about here.  It is self-righteousness and it should not be happening.  However, we are being told to go electric while child labour is used to mine the main ingredient for the batteries.  I could rest my case on that because it is sickening.<\/p>  <p>  We will not be supporting these amendments - the whole thing is based on a three-card trick, a con job really - until the Government comes clean with the people, is honest and truthful, and that the infrastructure is there and safety can be guaranteed.  What happened in the car park near Mahon where they could not extinguish the fires?  What happened with this battery points that were put up around the country?  They are a danger.  Firemen are not trained or do not have the equipment to deal with them if they go on fire.  The number is not massive but there are a substantial number of batteries in them.  There is a danger to the neighbours, the firemen and all and sundry.<\/p>  <p>  We need an honest debate in the House and we need to come clean with the people.  As far as I can see, climate change is all about controlling our people.  There is no better way to control them than when their battery goes flat after a few miles and they are left in the middle of the road with nowhere to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100057#KKK00400","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1663780620,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Teddy McCarthy, a diesel engine mechanic, garage proprietor, petrol seller and bus operator from Sneem in County Kerry recently recounted to me the following.  I will not name the vehicles involved because it would be wrong to do so.  No more than naming people who cannot be here to defend themselves, naming the vehicles could be very damaging to the people who produce them.  I will say they were expensive models of motor cars.  One of them took off from Dublin.  It had cost &euro;82,000 and it was heading to Sneem.  It made it as far as Tipperary.  The next car cost &euro;117,000 and it made it as far as Limerick.  It is a sad day when someone pays almost &euro;200,000 for two motor cars that cannot drive from Dublin to Kerry without stopping.  I know of plenty of cars that could be bought for &euro;200 that would go from here to Belfast and from Valentia Island to Derry no problem in the world without stopping once.  People would not have to stop them.  One fill would carry them.  Everybody who wants to know already knows that the best-performing vehicle we can have is a well-serviced and well-maintained diesel engine.  The Minister does not want to admit this because he is on a solo run but I will give him a couple of hard, sore facts and I would like him to listen to them if he does not mind.<\/p>  <p>  We look at what a electric vehicle is and what makes it work.  Lithium is used in it.  What about cobalt?  Cobalt is the most valuable ingredient in electric vehicle batteries.  Two thirds of the global supply is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Human rights activists have raised concerns about conditions there, in particular about child labour and harm to workers' health.  Like other heavy metals cobalt is toxic if not handled properly.  Alternative sources should be exploited, such as the metal-rich noodles found on the sea floor.  They present their own environmental hazards in trying to retrieve them from the sea floor.  If that was being done the Minister would not be happy with it either.<\/p>  <p>  I want to ask about the children.  I ask the Minister, the Green Party, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il whether they have any concerns for the children who have to mine these materials for their fancy electric cars and their electric vehicles.  It is a fair question.  Do they have any concern about what is being reported by child protection agencies around the world?  They have stated that children's health is being completely undermined and they are being hurt every day by being forced to work in these mines to produce the materials for the batteries they are proposing.  It is a form of child abuse.  No one of us would entertain a child being abused in any way.  There is no reason a child in this world should not be protected and nurtured.  The Government and its electric vehicles are paying no attention.  I have never heard the Minister raise a concern about it.  I ask him to please tell me if I am wrong.  I never like to wrong anybody.  I ask him to stand up here and tell me I am wrong if he has made a speech in the D&aacute;il or any other public forum raising concerns about how the batteries are produced.  Please let me know if he did so and I promise that I will correct the record.  I am accusing him of ignoring this fact.  I ask him to please put me right if he thinks I am wrong.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister cannot stick his head in the sand forever.  He cannot ignore the facts forever.  The wherewithal is not in Ireland at present to produce enough electric vehicles to do the job he is asking them to do.  For example, how we will replace farm machinery with electric vehicles?  How will the machines work on the roads or in our quarries?  How will they propel themselves?  How will a hydraulic motor be worked that is powerful enough to break rock, to dig deep into the ground to make the roads and piers, to build the bridges and to do the everyday things we have to do if we are to exist in this world?  In other words, the technology is not yet there.<\/p>  <p>  Something the Minister has always supported is the proper storage of slurry on farms.  Farmers cannot be told if a tank is full of slurry that they cannot have a tractor to agitate it, suck it out or spread it.  How does the Minister propose to empty the tank?  If we cannot have animals inside in the sheds we cannot have food.  What will we all do?  Will we go hungry?<\/p>  <p>  It is like earlier today when I highlighted the Minister's glib comment that he would ban boilers by 2025.  He did not think that one through either.  Certainly he has not thought through the electric vehicle issues.  If he did, the very first thing he would have said was that he is worried about the children.  He is not because he has not said he is.  I do not know how much longer he and the people who support him can ignore the hard fact that he seems completely detached from day-to-day living and the ordinary problems people have.<\/p>  <p>  We are an island nation.  How will the lorries go around the country to deliver the food required to keep us all alive?  What about all of the other produce that needs to be brought here by ship?  What will we have?  Will we have sails or electric ships?  The technology is not there to replace the diesel engines that are powering these vehicles, be it at sea, in the air or on land.  Air travel is something else the Green Party never seems to want to talk about.  It seems to completely ignore air travel.  It certainly has not told us its proposals.  Will it ban the people from getting up in the skies?

I had to try to work out if Deputy Leddin had somehow inserted an amendment into the Bill that we would make electric vehicles mandatory.  Of course we are not doing so.  In may ways those who have spoken have outlined exactly what the challenges are.  There is a shortage of electric vehicles.  They are expensive.  There is no second-hand market.  It is incredibly difficult for people who are struggling with the cost of living to try to make decisions that are carbon neutral.  My understanding of the amendments and the broader commitment in the programme for Government is that we are trying to meet these challenges rather than using them as an excuse to say we do not want to have change.<\/p>  <p>  Many people in the House speak about agreeing that climate change is a factor.  We know all human activity has an impact on the planet.  We want to be able to drive from Dublin to Kerry.  We want to be able to do so when fossil fuels are gone.  We want to continue to be able to have the type of lifestyle we do while reducing the impact on the planet.  We have effectively taken all of the sea creatures and vegetation that took millions of years to distil into oil and in the space of 200 years we have burned it all.  We put it all in our atmosphere.  It will run out.  When this happens we want to keep driving to Kerry so we have to find a different way of doing so.  One of the ways of doing so is with electronic vehicles.  I have no doubt that humankind will find other ways of meeting the challenge.<\/p>  <p>  My understanding of the amendment and the broader point the Minister is making is that infrastructure is key.  Deputy Mattie McGrath speaks about the lack of infrastructure and he is right.  It is not a reason for us not to have electric vehicles, it is a reason for us to have better infrastructure.  The amendment speaks about favouring versions of low-carbon travel other than electric vehicles.  The Deputies might have missed the irony of their contributions.  It includes electric cycling and e-scooters in the scope of the Bill and not only electric vehicles.

Therefore, I look forward to them supporting the amendment on that basis.<\/p>  <p>  On that idea of infrastructure, it is crucially important we get the infrastructure in place in order that people have the confidence to make the switch.  It will be a very difficult switch.  The cost aside, although that is a significant factor, the infrastructure will be crucially important.  I especially welcomed when the Minister came to Finglas a couple weeks ago where Dublin City Council installed a new mobility hub, which included charging points for electric bikes and cars and a bike-sharing scheme by the ESB.  It is a publicly funded project, but we need to see far more of them.<\/p>  <p>  As the site is owned by the council, in some ways, we are taking public space away to provide this facility, and I understand that, but we also have to look at private infrastructure providers.  There are many petrol stations in urban and suburban areas that could accommodate more charging points.  A petrol station very close to me no longer does car washing and has the equivalent of 14 or 15 car parking spaces that lie pretty much idle most of the time.  It could provide the infrastructure for e-charging.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look at the infrastructure for those who do not have driveways.  Many people want to have the insulation of a socket where they can plug the car in, but in doing so, it would drape across a public footpath, and that, we know, would not be satisfactory.  We need to get better at making sure of the regulations around how that is done and that the interaction with the local authority and so on is reduced and we need to put more supports in place for our local authorities to continue.  The scheme the Minister opened in Finglas was very good.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation also deals with the issue of scrambler bikes.  It takes a very strong line on how they should be dealt with, giving the Garda increased powers to ensure bikes can be seized from the curtilage of the property and bringing in a new classification of vehicles and so on.  That is very welcome.  As a first-time Deputy, it is a bit soul destroying that the Minister, along with the Taoiseach and others, agreed that at Cabinet in January 2021 and we have not yet passed the legislation through the House.  I encourage the Minister to continue because it will make a life-changing impact.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies throughout the House, including those from Sinn F&eacute;in, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and all parties, acknowledge that we need to take strong action on scrambler bikes, and I very much welcome it.  What I do not want to see is e-scooters, which are a very good low-carbon option when used properly on cycling lanes within the network, replacing the antisocial behaviour that happens on scrambler bikes.  We regularly see, outside schools and in our local villages, e-scooters being used on public pavements.  It would be disappointing to, in one breath, close the door on the scrambler bike antisocial behaviour and, in another, not do enough to tackle the antisocial behaviour that arises from e-scooters.<\/p>  <p>  Some of it will be a Garda matter.  I know there are limitations in this Bill that talk about responsible use of e-scooters, but I ask the Minister to press on the Minister for Justice to ensure the Garda, as well as getting additional powers on the issue of scramblers, also implement the obligations e-scooter riders will be under in this legislation.  This is about giving people more options to allow them to have a lower carbon impact on the planet.  We need to have politicians who are climate brave and are willing to say things that sometimes might be unpopular or on which they might need to lead people.  Some of the contributions here today were more about scaring people about electric vehicles than providing the infrastructure, which we all know needs to be provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100059#MMM00100","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1663781220,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 11 and 16, in particular.

It was also involved in that announcement, was it not, where it said the Government intended to ban all petrol and diesel cars by 2030?  Is that not mandatory?

The Minister has not thought this out.  Many issues such as safety are thrown up with the electric vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  There is no confidence among the public in electric vehicles.  I know of one State agency in particular that will not use electric vehicles if it has to use them on long journeys.  Does that not say it all?  There is a lack of confidence in the ability and reliability of electric vehicles.  There are issues.  They are obviously not accessible to the ordinary person because of the cost.  The Minister makes the point about going for zero to low-emissions vehicles and making the changes.  However, our hauliers are still waiting on incentives to upgrade to the Euro 6 engines.  The Minister is expecting people to change without putting any incentives, proper supports or even proper planning in place.  That is the most worrying thing of all.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to amendment No. 16, Deputy Leddin mentions the promotion and assistance of research and providing advice, information and guidance.  What stood out to me here was that he also mentions engaging with the stakeholders.  I sincerely hope the Minister does engage with the stakeholders, especially those who do not share the same viewpoint as the Green Party.  It is important to hear all views about how to achieve low emissions.  It must not be a tick-the-box exercise to shove the green medicine down people's throats and only engage with them if they are saying the same thing, which is what happened with home heating and biofuels, when the Minister point-blank refused to meet the Alliance for Zero Carbon Heating.  I hope the Minister will engage with stakeholders on electric vehicles and that it will not go the same way as what happened with biofuels for home heating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100059#MMM00200","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1663781220,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Before I call the proposer, I wish to say that, on Report Stage, it is appropriate for all Members to adhere to the subject matter of the amendment.

These amendments relate to provisions we have put into the Bill to give an underpinning to the BusConnects projects.<\/p>  <p>  Section 44 provides for the insertion of a new section 51AA into the Roads Act 1993.  This new provision in the Roads Act provides for an extension of An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s existing powers.  The board currently has the power to materially contravene a development plan under sections 37(2)(a) and 37G(6) of the Planning and Development Act.  The Bill aims to strengthen existing legislation in order to ensure the BusConnects core bus corridors are captured.<\/p>  <p>  Section 44 provides the board can only approve a scheme or proposed road development that contravenes materially a development or local area plan in very specific and limited circumstances, including where the scheme or road development is of strategic, regional or national importance and where the scheme or road development should be approved having regard to the transport strategy made under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s proposed rewording of section 51AA(a), 51AA(b) and 51AA(d), it should be noted the development of the core bus corridors comprises a road development within section 51 of the Roads Act.  While I appreciate the intention of the proposed rewording, it is not appropriate for inclusion in primary legislation.  Amendment Nos. 3 and 5 in particular propose tests which are close to impossible to prove to a legal standard.  Inserting them would provide an opening for plenty of legal challenges to any decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that relies on this section.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la and presumably the applicant would have to prove there would be no increase in private car travel or induced demand in any way before this clause could be used.  By contrast, the standard terminology under environmental legislation is an obligation to set out likely environmental impacts and not to guarantee a set of impacts, which is what the amendment seeks.  On a practical level, if an overall transport scheme removes traffic from one corridor and reduces traffic overall but causes some minor increase on a small number of streets through diversions, that scheme would still be likely to fail this test.  Similarly, the test to confirm the scheme will not contribute to carbon emissions from the transport sector will be failed the minute a single non-electric vehicle travels along the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are similar difficulties in respect of amendment No. 8, which sets standards many valuable schemes, including BusConnects projects, could not meet.  It should be noted local authorities cannot propose a development that is in contravention of a development plan under section 178 of the Planning and Development Act.  Accordingly, the application of section 44 is very limited and does not alter the position for most road development as it is generally carried out by a local authority.  These must be in accordance with the relevant development plan.  The delivery arrangements for BusConnects are different as the NTA has temporarily stepped into the role of a road authority to implement the BusConnects projects.<\/p>  <p>  Section 44 is being brought forward to reduce the potential for legal challenges and delay in these circumstances.  It is important to ensure the programme&rsquo;s progress through the planning system is not unnecessarily impeded due to potential deficiencies that may exist with current legislative provisions and the existing provision will ensure Government ambition in the area of megaproject delivery is complemented by a robust and appropriate legislative framework.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Leddin for bringing forward these amendments.

When someone who is elected by the people comes in here, having got enough votes, those people are depending on the person to do the right thing.  For someone to come in here and try to use his influence to obliterate the rights and proposals put in place by a local authority that has arrived at something collectively - there are 33 councillors elected to Kerry County Council.  To think that someone in this Chamber, or a group of people, would try to deny them what they had put together over hours and days, together with management.  Think of all they do together.  I must remind those present councillors hardly get paid anything for their time save expenses and mileage.  To think we would try to take all the powers they have and entrust it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We know what An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been at in recent times and indeed in times long ago.  It has not acted fairly and squarely much of the time.  As for suggesting the taking of powers away from local authorities, given some of the things that are here by way of amendments, I am glad the Minister is not accepting them.<\/p>  <p>  It looks to me as if any proposed road development or scheme would not be accepted or allowed to go ahead if it was to help cars or vehicles that were not electrically operated or if it was not for walking or cycling.  God almighty, man alive, what kind of a mind would put this kind of a story together?  It would mean we could not remove a shrub or a tree to give vision around a turn on a narrow road where there might be a good bit of traffic and it is dangerous to travel, even for school buses or vehicles bringing materials or feed to farmers.  For someone to think they could blindfold us here and make us vote for something like that and put it through the D&aacute;il, who the bloody hell does the Deputy think he is to try to do this to the people of Ireland or to the people of Kerry we are representing?  We would not be able to widen a turn, remove a bend or straighten a bit of a road where there are accidents day after day unless the people were driving an electrically-operated car or bicycle.<\/p>  <p>  I will tell the Deputy so much about two electric bicycles anyway, seeing as it came up here.  I have a man across the road from me.  He bought two electric bicycles.  He paid &euro;1,700 for them over a year ago.  The two of them are broken down now and they want two new batteries.  He will have to give over &euro;500 for the batteries for these bicycles.  That is God's gospel truth; I am not making it up.  I meet him every day when I am at home.  He is my next-door neighbour.  This is the kind of a mind that is here telling us we will not be able to widen a road unless it is for walking, cycling, use by electric vehicles or public transport.<\/p> <p>There is no thought about the man or woman who is getting up this morning and leaving some rural place like Gneevgullia, Scartaglin or Brosna and trying to make his or her way maybe down miles of narrow roads to get on to the N72 or the N22 which will take them to Cork, Mallow or wherever.  There is no thought about those people at all only trying to deny them the right of widening a road.  God help us.<\/p> <p> Where are we with the Killarney bypass?  It is no wonder this is going on since 2004.  We were told it was to go ahead and that tenders would be put out in a couple of years but it is backwards it has gone now in the last two or three years since this Government got into power.  It is no wonder because with roads that were sanctioned we see the Minister himself trying to block them in Limerick and other places.  The Killarney bypass is vital because the town is choked because of the lack of it.  God only knows when that will go ahead if he remains in power.  I can see that the Government has gone frantic at the present time.  They know what we are hearing, that they are finished after this term and they are trying to rush through everything drastic and any kind of proposal at all they get in their head here knowing they are finished - I do not know who will be elected next time.  I may not be elected myself.  There is one thing sure - the Green Party candidates will not be elected, not in rural Ireland anyway, I can guarantee it.  They will not be elected by the people of rural Ireland.  They would want to be fairer with their ideas if there are certain things they want to get through here.  What they are proposing at the present time is absolutely ridiculous, trying to force people so they cannot be allowed to widen roads or straighten bends and that they must buy electric cars after 2030.

I would be cautious in respect of these amendments on giving powers to override or bypass local democracy.  I do not think that is the intention at all; it is to ensure that is enhanced.  We need to do whatever it is that we can do.<\/p>  <p>  I am speaking this evening after being in contact with a man, Neil Fox.  Neil's sister Donna, a very committed cyclist, was knocked down and killed.  He is a cycling campaigner and I am in touch with him on a fairly regular basis.  I am a very recent convert myself.  The last time the Green Party was in government it advised us all to buy diesel cars.  I did that.  I believed at the time that I was doing the right thing.  I now realise that possibly was not the best idea but I am reluctant to change a car that is still functioning.  I am trying instead to leave my car at home to the greatest extent possible, so I use the train and walk and I have now started to cycle.  It is a bit of a revelation to be on the bike when I am used to the car and I would have been a bit of a petrol head.  The Acting Chairman and I share a constituency.  It is quite the adventure to get on the rothar sometimes.  We really need to be doing whatever we can to ensure that we make the roads safe for those who are cycling on them.  In Skerries a couple of weeks ago, Sustainable Skerries organised a Critical Mass cycle and we took over the streets in our small town.  It was very empowering as a cyclist to be able to cycle in a group.  We did it at a time when it did not discommode people but we made our point fairly effectively.  I try to channel the spirit of the meteorologist, Joanna Donnelly, when she says \"whatever lane I am in is the cycle lane.\"  I have to share the lane with motorists and sometimes as a motorist I share the lane with cyclists.<\/p>  <p>  While I appreciate that we will not get to amendment No. 7 this evening, I ask the Minister please to take a look at it.  It is a very well-written and well-intended amendment.  It will enhance safety.  While we are waiting on the infrastructure, we have to have a mechanism by which we hold all road users to account.  I gave a commitment to Neil Fox that I would speak on this issue.  It is important for those of us who are starting on the road to becoming regular cyclists that we are part of this conversation and that we have a chance to make a contribution.  It can be quite nerve-wracking.  I was not very familiar with what a close pass felt like until about a year and a half or two years ago.  It is quite scary.  When we talk about putting infrastructure in place, that needs to be done quickly.  It also needs to be done in consultation with local communities.  When we go out and talk to people, we find they do want that enhanced infrastructure.  They want their kids to be able to cycle to school.  The Minister also has to recognise that not everybody can cycle or access public transport.  Sometimes people have to use their cars.  Where we have to share the road, we need to maximise whatever safety measures can be put in place to ensure that we can all use the road safely and share the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100061#OOO00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1663782420,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I remind Members that there is just short of 13 minutes left before I have to draw a conclusion to this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100061#OOO00300","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1663782420,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I am disappointed that the Minister did not reply to some of the questions we asked him.

It should not be, but it seems to be Green Party policy to dictate to everyone, regardless of where democracy stands this country.  We have difficulties.  Just because someone is a cyclist or drives an electric vehicle does not mean that they do not have difficulties where there are bad bins or shrubs that need to be cut back.  That accounts for everybody and every road user.  Every road user should have that right.  This amendment states: \"...only where the scheme or proposed road development will not contribute to carbon emissions from the transport sector and only where the scheme or proposed road development will not otherwise increase private vehicle travel, induced demand through the provision of road capacity for private vehicle use or induced demand through the provision of private car storage.\"<\/p>  <p>  I am totally opposed to this amendment.  I sincerely hope the Minister kicks this out, like the other amendments that have been put before us.  I am pleased we are in here as a Rural Independent Group to try to mind the little bit of democracy we have in this country.  Quite a lot of it has been eroded over the past number of years.  Amendments such as this certainly erode it further.  I will not be playing a part in any way, shape or form in that kind of a trick.

I thank them for that.<\/p>  <p>  I want to commend Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly of Sinn F&eacute;in who spoke very well on the challenges facing cyclists and pedestrians in this country.

I commend Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly on that contribution.<\/p>  <p>  In the limited time I have available, I will take on board the Minister&rsquo;s points.  I would ask that he considers them in the round on the next Stage.  There is a situation in Galway where the Galway BusConnects plan has been lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and it seeks to demolish private houses to create lanes for vehicles.  I do not think that is a positive development.  When we are creating sustainable and active travel infrastructure, we should not be taking people&rsquo;s private property and demolishing houses.
