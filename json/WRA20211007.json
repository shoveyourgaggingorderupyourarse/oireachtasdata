Even allowing for their inclusion, the Covid adjusted youth unemployment rate has fallen sharply from its 2021 peak of 61% in January.  This rate is expected to fall further in the October unemployment estimates as students, previously in receipt of PUP, will no longer be included in the estimate.

This is a poverty reduction effect of 68.5% for all social transfers and pensions, one of the highest in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that any measures being considered for Budget 2022 will be guided by research, including the minimum essential standard of living research, to target resources at those who are identified as being in most need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700055#WRA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Prices","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700055#WRA03300"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[48661\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700055#WRA03400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to expand the fuel allowance given the significant increases in fuel prices.","asker":"1453","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[48635\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700055#WRA03425","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons availing of the fuel allowance; her plans to widen eligibility for the scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1602","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[48519\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700055#WRA03450","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if consideration will be given to increasing the fuel allowance in Budget 2022 as a result of rising energy prices; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[48554\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700055#WRA03475","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on whether eligibility for the fuel allowance should be expanded given the increases in electricity prices and carbon tax.","asker":"1628","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 83, 89 and 93 together.<\/p><p>The Fuel Allowance is a payment of &euro;28.00 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;784 each year) from October to April, to over 370,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;300 million in 2021.

Expenditure on the enhanced illness benefit was &euro;57 million in 2020, in addition to &euro;593 spent on standard illness benefit.  Expenditure on the enhanced payment was &euro;68 million from January to the end of September this year and is expected to be circa &euro;84 million for all of 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period only.  <\/p>  <p>  The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected. This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system. <\/p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.  The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people not to attend the workplace due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  <\/p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children. <\/p>  <p>  My Department provides a suite of income supports for those who are unable to work due to an illness or disability. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work. My Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means-tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit.  The Department may also make an Exceptional Needs Payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.    <\/p>  <p>  The enhanced payment was brought in on a temporary basis and has been extended on several occasions due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic and the rollout of the national vaccination programme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the public health situation, the effectiveness of income supports during this time, and will be cognisant of any requirements to extend the duration of the enhanced illness benefit payment beyond 8 February 2022, the end date set out in regulations. <\/p>  <p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700056#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Policy","counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700056#WRB02200"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[47792\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700056#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the measures that are being examined to exempt qualifying arts sector workers from unsuitable activation measures during periods between arts work; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1551","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>My Department, as the Public Employment Services (PES), has a key role in the provision of activation measures, including a range of job placement, assistance and employment services, training programmes, employment subsidies and direct employment provision.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. <\/p><p>The main income supports provided by my Department include Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, and the Carer's Support Grant.  Over 135,000 carers benefit from regular income supports and spending on these payments in 2021 is expected to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion.  The value of income transfers to family carers has increased by over 50% since 2015.<\/p><p>Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn adequate income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.  In August, there were 90,207 recipients of Carer's Allowance.  The estimated expenditure for the payment this year is in the region of &euro;953 million. <\/p><p>The means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system.  Currently, &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.<\/p><p>By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;140 per week.

Payment (PUP) was introduced in March 2020 to support employees and the self employed who lost employment due to Covid-19.

Changes in the rate of payment were introduced in mid-September with further changes to place from 16th November 2021 and 8th February 2022.

This means that affected customers, including those in the live entertainment sector, will continue to receive their PUP payment until 26th October when the process of their transition to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment will begin.

In total over the four half day events the total number of persons who attended this on-line event was over 12,400. <\/p><p>ERD hosted two large online events on the EU EURES platform, one for the healthcare sector and one for the horticulture sector.  There are a further 5 EURES events planned for the remainder of 2021.  ERD has also presented at eight events reaching almost an additional 1400 employers, providing information on recruitment and financial supports available to employers to employ unemployed persons.  Currently ERD is working in collaboration with IBEC on an event to address labour shortages in October and a further event is planned for early December in relation to disability supports. <\/p><p>JobsIreland.ie is the Department&rsquo;s recruitment website available to both employers and jobseekers.  The platform allows employers to post and promote vacancies including posting vacancies across the EU Members States through our EURES service. <\/p><p>ERD also works with Activation Case Officers, Job Coaches, and Employer Relations teams in Intreo Offices countrywide.  These teams have been engaging directly with employers on an ongoing basis throughout the pandemic, matching suitable vacancies with jobseekers via email notifications, pre-recorded recruitment videos featuring employers, job slots on local radio, and hosting online recruitment events across many sectors of the economy including construction, hospitality, retail, manufacturing, sales and customer service.  <\/p><p>In June a live online recruitment event was hosted highlighting vacancies in the hospitality sector featuring a number of large employers in the Dublin\/Mid-Leinster region.  Over 1,000 jobseekers attended the event. <\/p><p>The Government's national employment services strategy; Pathways to Work 2021-2025, sets out commitments for further engagement with employers including:<\/p><p>- A National Employer Roadshow is planned to promote supports and incentives available to employers and to encourage employers to avail of schemes and incentives.<\/p><p>- Developing a promotional campaign to increase employer awareness and take-up of the available supports and<\/p><p>- Planning 150 job promotion events each year to showcase employment opportunities.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700056#WRB04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700056#WRB04300"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[48535\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700056#WRB04400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on whether persons on illness benefit should be included in the fuel allowance scheme.","asker":"1569","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>The Fuel Allowance is a payment of &euro;28.00 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;784 each year) from October to April, to 370,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;300 million in 2021.

Wicklow in receipt of the PUP.  This is a reduction of 84% from the peak in May 2020 when 18,629 people in Co. Wicklow received the PUP. <\/p><p>While many people who have been receiving the PUP are returning to employment as restrictions ease and the economy re-opens, it is inevitable that some jobs will be permanently lost, and additional numbers of persons will require State support to find new jobs transitioning back to work. <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Activation teams of Case Officers and Job Coaches are supporting PUP recipients and the Local Employment Service in Bray, Co. Wicklow continues to support jobseekers in that location who are long term unemployed.  My Department is supporting initiatives to assist people to get back to work, as COVID-19 restrictions and their impact on the economy and labour market begin to ease.  For example, during August and September all long term PUP customers in County Wicklow were contacted by phone to determine if they needed support in returning to work and my officials responded to the requests for support and information that this elicited.  <\/p><p>Throughout the pandemic my Department has been assisting employers with vacancies as the economy reopened by matching vacancies to relevant jobseekers via email notifications, pre-recorded recruitment videos featuring employers and the hosting of live recruitment events.  <\/p><p>Last month my Department hosted a 6-day series of online recruitment events, which were available to all PUP recipients in Co. Wicklow, featuring 30 employers with over 1,000 live vacancies.  Many sectors of the economy were covered including construction, hospitality, retail, manufacturing, sales and customer service.  Many large-scale companies took part including Amazon, Ryanair, McDonalds, Circle K, Butlers Chocolates, DID Electrical, Musgraves, Accenture and public sector employers.  One of these events focussed on training and education opportunities currently available. People on the Live Register and people on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment were invited to attend these events.  In total 12,217 individuals participated in these events.  Feedback to date from employers and jobseekers has been positive and recruitment for the positions available is continuing.<\/p><p>A further series of events is being planned for Co. Wicklow clients for the remainder of the year to include regular vacancy alerts for jobseekers, live and pre-recorded recruitment events as well as events to highlight training and upskilling opportunities.

Pathways to Work 2021-2025 is a key delivery mechanism of the Economic Recovery Plan&rsquo;s second Pillar on &lsquo;Helping People Back into Work&rsquo;.<\/p><p>In supporting people back into employment the Pathways to Work 2021&ndash;2025 strategy seeks to minimise any long-term scarring effects of the pandemic on the labour force for those whose jobs are permanently lost while providing support to those unemployed pre-pandemic.  The strategy also sets out how an expanded Public Employment Service will utilise its existing and expanded capacity to deliver effective services in a post-COVID labour market with an overall target of increasing the caseload capacity by 100,000 per annum.<\/p><p>Some of the key supports form part of Pathways to Work and the Economic Recovery Plan include:<\/p><p>- Expanding the JobsPlus scheme to 8,000 places and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers in particular, by increasing the youth age limit from 25 to 30 years.<\/p><p>- Accelerating rollout of an additional 50,000 education and training places to support jobseekers to upskill and reskill for the labour market.<\/p><p>- A new Government Youth Employment Charter for intensive engagement with young jobseeker which will build on the new EU Reinforced Youth Guarantee.<\/p><p>- A new work placement scheme is open to all people regardless of age and should be particularly attractive to and beneficial for young people requiring work experience. <\/p><p>My Department works closely with the Further Education and Training sector, including the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (ETB), to provide access to training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science also last week announced the extension of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme until the end of December 2021.

An employee must work for a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a  maximum of 39 subsidised hours per week.  The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and the amount  of the subsidy is based on the number of hours worked.<\/p><p>Strand II subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with a disability who are supported by a WSS Strand I payment.  Strand II is intended to cover the additional supervisory, management and other work-based costs relating to these employees.  This top-up payment is a percentage of the Strand I subsidy and is based on the overall number of employees with a disability employed under Strand I.  It ranges from an additional 10% of wage subsidy for 3 to 6 employees with a disability to a maximum of 50% of wage subsidy for 23+ employees with a disability. <\/p><p>Strand III subsidy enables employers who employ 25 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme to be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer to support these employees.<\/p><p>Dormant Accounts Funding to Support Employment Opportunities for Carers and People with Disabilities<\/p><p>The Dormant Accounts Act 2001, together with the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003 and the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Acts 2005 to 2012, provide a framework for the administration of unclaimed accounts in credit institutions (i.e. banks, building societies and An Post) and unclaimed life assurance policies in insurance undertakings.  <\/p><p>The legislation introduced a scheme for the disbursement of funds that are unlikely to be reclaimed, but only for the purposes of programmes or projects to assist:<\/p><p>- the personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged;<\/p><p>- the educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged;<\/p><p>- persons with a disability.<\/p><p>On 30th July, the Minister for Social Protection announced over &euro;7.5 million in funding to support and improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities.

I acknowledge that many early learning and childcare services are reporting staffing and recruitment difficulties, with increased pressures as a result of Covid-19. My Department is actively monitoring the issue and has sought data and evidence-based proposals from sectoral representatives.<\/p>  <p>The primary data source for the sector is the Annual Early Years Sector Profile. In the most recent published Sector Profile (published in 2021, and relating to data from 2020), 44% of services reported challenges in recruiting suitably qualified staff over the past 12 months. While this figure was down 9% from the previous year, it remains very high. The staff turnover rate has similarly fallen from 23% to 18%, but remains unacceptably high. <\/p>  <p>Recruitment and recruitment difficulties in the sector are undoubtedly linked to poor terms and conditions in the workforce, with for example the average pay being &euro;12.45 per hour.<\/p>  <p>I am conscious of the need for significant improvement in pay and conditions of employment for early learning and childcare professionals. The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, families and the wider society and economy.<\/p>  <p>The State, however, is not the employer and therefore cannot determine wages in the sector. Nevertheless, I am committed to doing what is in my power. That is why last December, I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee (or \"JLC\"). In agreement with IBEC\/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process.<\/p>  <p>On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March, I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector.<\/p>  <p>In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, and the Minister of State has now accepted the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations. <\/p>  <p>I am pleased to confirm that the Establishment Order came into effect on 1 July last. The JLC will provide an opportunity for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine pay and conditions for early learning and childcare professionals. <\/p>  <p>Work is also progressing on a new funding mode for the sector, with recommendations from the Expert Group due to be made in November.  I anticipate that the report will offer potential new avenues through which the State can support providers to improve pay and to meet the requirements of any future Employment Regulation Order that may arise from the JLC.<\/p>  <p>Work on a new Workforce Development Plan is also well advanced, with the final report due for completion by the end of the year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700059#WRE04350","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700059#WRE04375"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[48662\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700059#WRE04400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the steps he will take to increase the funding and resources for services combating gender-based violence and assisting those impacted by Covid-19 given the well documented rise in gender-based violence during the pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1522","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":292,"content":"<p>The response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV) is a cross departmental and multi-agency issue.

In its Fifth Interim Report, the Commission of Investigation noted that 'About 100 acres were sold in 1973 for the building of the N25 and for social housing. The Commission understands that there are about 60 acres of ground around the building now.' <\/p>  <p>The Commission concluded that it is likely that burials did take place in the grounds of Bessborough but that the location of burials at Bessborough could not be ascertained, that the site was too large to feasibly excavate and that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of the likely location of burials.<\/p>  <p>It is my understanding that, currently, the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary retains part of the site; some land has been transferred to the HSE; and other land is owned by private parties who intend to develop the site for housing, subject to the appropriate permissions. <\/p>  <p>As the Deputy will be aware, I made submissions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Cork City Council as part of the normal planning process in respect of two planning applications made on the Bessborough lands requesting that due consideration be given to the sensitivity of the site and the conclusions of the commission&rsquo;s report. Like himself, I attended and made an oral submission to the Oral Hearing on the SHD application.  This application related to a particular part of the site which is identified on a 1950s ordnance survey map as a burial ground and which campaigners consider to be the most likely location of burials. <\/p>  <p>As the land in question is in private ownership, it is not open to Government to procure or carry out investigations there.  However, it is notable that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has refused permission to develop the land because it 'is not satisfied that the site was not previously used as, and does not contain, a children's burial ground and considers that there are reasonable concerns in relation to the potential for a children's burial ground within the site [...]'. <\/p>  <p>I have recently written to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage asking him for support in encouraging local authorities to provide specific protections within their Development Plan processes for any burial sites that may be linked to former Mother and Baby Homes or County Homes.

This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:<\/p><p><b>(1) Modernisation: <\/b>Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency.

The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.<\/p><p>In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.<\/p><p><b>(3) First 5 Initiatives<\/b>: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.

Tusla is committed to promoting safe practice in all areas of alternative care, including residential care and foster care.  Safe practice is defined as the implementation of appropriate safeguarding measures necessary for working with young people in a manner that acknowledges their need to live in as normal an environment as possible. All children have the right to be cared for, fulfill their potential and be protected from harm.<\/p>  <p>  Once a child has been received into care, the most crucial task for the social worker is to find a placement that matches that child's needs. Children, depending on their identified need, may be placed in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, special care or other placement types. A key part of the social worker role is to develop, in consultation with the child and relevant others, a care plan which will guide the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits. There are safeguards surrounding each child's care placement, whether foster or residential care, and all placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.<\/p>  <p>  Regulations govern the placement of children in care.  These provide for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions. The Regulations also provide that the allocated social worker oversees the implementation of the child's  care plan, visits the child and consults with family members, foster carers and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met and that the care being provided is optimal.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA carries out announced and unannounced inspections of children&rsquo;s services including Child Protection and Welfare Services, Foster Care Services, statutory Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres and Special Care units. HIQA carry out these inspections against Regulations and Standards, by reviewing files on site, interviews and questionnaires with staff and service users and their families. Following an inspection, HIQA share their initial judgements and draft report with the service\/area. HIQA then works with the management of the centre or area in order to agree an Action Plan to address any identified deficits. Final reports are published, and are submitted to the Department with the area or service&rsquo;s Action Plans and are monitored as necessary by DCEDIY officials.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has policies and procedures for responding to concerns, allegations and complaints made by or on behalf of children in care.  This includes ensuring all allegations, concerns, and complaints by children in care are taken seriously and receive the required response as stated in policies within Tusla.  In addition, the Ombudsman for Children and Tusla&rsquo;s own National Review Panel will report on specific topics relating to the work of Tusla which prompts further improvements in Tusla services.<\/p>  <p>  The foregoing sets out the safeguards in place with regard to all placements of children in care. Tusla in discharging its statutory responsibilities under the Child Care Acts must have the best interests of the child as its paramount consideration. It actively monitors every placement of every child in care to ensure its appropriateness to the needs of that child, and any concerns or breaches of standards are addressed in this context. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700061#WRG04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700061#WRG04600"},{"type":"question","counter":413,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[48633\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700061#WRG04700","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the total allocation in 2021 for the childcare capital grant scheme; the projected drawdown of this funding by year end; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":414,"content":"<p>My Department has, since 2015, administered an annual capital funding programme, under which early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC) service providers are invited to apply for capital funding, to maintain and improve their services.<\/p><p>In 2021 I secured &euro;10.5 million in Capital Funding for ELC and SAC childcare services.<\/p><p>The objective of the first round of grants under the 2021 Capital Programme was to provide grants to providers to help them to comply with fire safety regulations, a condition of their registration with Tulsa.

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 1 October, over 257,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Over 108,000 premises are under construction across 30 Deployment Areas and the first homes are connected in Counties Cork, Cavan, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan.<\/p>  <p>  Surveys are complete or underway in County Limerick, including in Killalee, Caherline, Ballynanty, Pallaskenny, Toreen, Old Kildimo, Askeaton, Adare, Croagh, Rathkeale, Kilfinny, Croom, Ballingarry, Patrickswell, Crecora, Banogue Cross, Granagh, Lees Cross and Ballykennedy. Main works have started in townlands outside Limerick City including Mungret, Patrickswell, Crecora, Castleconnell and Caherconlish. Further details are available on specific areas within County Limerick, through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 1 October, 379 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Hospital Herbertstown GAA Club, Glenmore Community Centre, Coolcappa Community Centre, Cappamore Community Centre (located 6.6km from Meentula), Galbally GAA Club, Glenroe GAA Club, Kildimo GAA Club,Shanagolden Education Resource Centre, Rathkeale Riverside Training Workshop ,Halla &Iacute;de Naofa, Caherline Community Centre and Patrickswell GAA Club.

I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 1 October, over 257,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed and over\u00a0108,000 premises are under construction across 30 Deployment Areas.

Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 01 October, 379 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Streete Parish Park &amp;amp; Community Hall, Whitehall Community Centre, Milltown Emper Community Centre, Clonkill Hurling Club, Ballycomoyle GAA Club and Castledaly Community Centre.

Overall, the Government envisages expenditure in excess of &euro;700 million in 2021 on a number of measures to support households meeting the cost of energy.  Good progress has been made under the strategy including:<\/p>  <p>  - Funding for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased dramatically over the period from &euro;15 million in 2015 to over &euro;109 million for 2021;<\/p>  <p>  - Free upgrades were carried out in over 24,000 lower income homes under the main Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) energy poverty retrofit schemes;<\/p>  <p>  - The Housing for All Strategy has committed to introducing minimum Building Energy Ratings for rented properties from 2025;<\/p>  <p>  - The allocations for retrofit of social housing have also increased significantly with an allocation of &euro;65 million for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Income supports from the Department of Social Protection to help households with the costs of heating their homes have also increased.

The transport sector currently accounts for 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions levels and a reduction in emissions levels in the sector, through a combination of taxation and incentivisation, will form a key part of achieving that target. Road Traffic usage represents 96% of those emissions.  In this regard, the CO2-based motor tax system for private cars, which comprise the bulk of the vehicle fleet, is structured in such a way as to incentivise the uptake of electric and lower CO2-emitting vehicles, with these attracting lower motor tax rates than higher emitting vehicles.  <\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 which is due to be published shortly will chart a course to achieve these targets by 2030 and it will include specific and challenging measures in that regard. The overall target here is very ambitious and will require a mix policy interventions and significant behavioural change, taking account of their relative impact on mobility options, including social, rural and urban impacts.  <\/p>  <p>  Electrification of the national fleet, significant investment in improving public transport options, ramping up walking and cycling infrastructure for short distances, increasing biofuels in the existing fleet and improved engine efficiencies will all play a significant role. Finally, demand management, or reducing the need to travel by private car,  will also be key. I am very aware that this is the most challenging element since it will impose restrictions on current travel behaviours.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the importance of finding a path to reduce emissions without removing people&rsquo;s access to travel, transport and services. Measures such as working from home and using online tools to access services will become more prevalent and usual with the digitilisation of our economy and society. Many of the trips we currently take and services we currently access in person can be accessed through online means. I am also very encouraged by proposals for 15 minute neighbourhoods, so that most of the key services people need can be accessed within 15 minutes of their home, so curtailing the need to travel long distances by car. We need to reduce emissions as a country because of the global crisis we are facing as a planet. However, we need to do so in a way that does not negatively impact people&rsquo;s lives and wellbeing.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the recently published National Development Plan, the Government is committed to strengthening rural economies and communities and enhancing regional accessibility, with a range of investments proposed in new and existing public transport infrastructure.  The Plan also commits to significant investment in the land transport network and the upcoming National Investment Framework for Transport in Ireland will set out the priorities for investment in the land transport network.  The National Transport Authority&rsquo;s Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan aims to improve access to towns and cities for those in rural areas by improving existing bus services, increasing capacity and adding new bus services, and builds on from the Authority&rsquo;s TFI Local Link, which provides access to essential, educational and leisure services in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Rural Development Policy 2021 &ndash; 2025, &ldquo;Our Rural Future&rdquo;, also commits to improved and accessible public transport in rural areas and to the piloting of new rural transport initiatives.  <\/p>  <p>  Further, it should be noted that the National Development Plan commits to continuing investment in improving access to remote working facilities, enabling people to work in rural areas, thereby potentially reducing the need for car journeys for commuting purposes. It is becoming increasingly clear that over the coming years we must all undergo a transformational change how and why we travel if we are to meaningfully tackle the climate crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700062#WRH04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Policy","counter":467,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700062#WRH04100"},{"type":"question","counter":468,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[48752\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700062#WRH04200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the BusConnects process will take regional connections into account from the county to the city transport hubs (details supplied).","asker":"1514","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":469,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

The first aspect of these proposals, Pillar One, provides for a re-allocation of a proportion of the profits of highly profitable very large multinational groups to taxation in the market jurisdiction. Pillar Two proposes a global minimum effective tax rate to multinational groups which have an annual turnover in excess of &euro;750 million.<\/p>  <p>  It is likely that, if agreed and implemented, these proposals will result in a reduction of corporation tax receipts in Ireland. Department of Finance officials previously estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of the OECD reforms may be up to EUR &euro;2 billion annually. This is the estimate included in both the Stability Programme Update published by the Department in April and the Summer Economic Statement published in July, with the full amount to apply from 2025. Notwithstanding progress on headline aspects of the proposals, there remain a number of important technical details outstanding on both Pillars, making it very difficult to provide an update to this estimate at this juncture.  <\/p>  <p>  The way in which business operates internationally has changed significantly in recent years due to the digitalisation and globalisation of the economy and I believe that the international tax system must evolve to reflect these changes.

The Expert Group have engaged, and will continue to do so, in bilateral discussions with interested stakeholder groups as part of the review.<\/p>  <p>  The EPA&rsquo;s Water Quality Indicator&rsquo;s Report 2021 shows that nearly half of Ireland&rsquo;s rivers have unsatisfactory nitrogen concentrations and over one quarter of rivers have unsatisfactory phosphorous concentrations. One of the purposes of the revised Nitrates Action Programme is to help reverse these declining water quality trends. The EPA have also estimated that up to 85% of nitrogen in mainly rural catchments comes from agricultural sources.<\/p>  <p>  Following the first public consultation in late-2020, a second consultation phase on the draft Nitrates Action Programme has just been completed, with over 600 responses submitted. These are currently being assessed with a view to adapting and finalising the measures in the Nitrates Action Programme 2022-2025. <\/p>  <p>  I note and appreciate that concerns have been raised in some submissions around the proposed measures.  These will be taken into consideration by the Nitrates Expert Group in the design and recommendation of the final measures. I should also note that the proposed measures are based on robust scientific assessment and are designed to achieve the objectives of the Nitrates Action Programme and must respond to the water quality trends reported by the Environmental Protection Agency. <\/p>  <p>The 2 public consultation processes which have been held on the proposed Nitrates Action Programme are important in informing the design of the final Programme. As the current round of submissions are currently being assessed it would not be possible to provide for a 3rd round of public consultation give the deadline of 31st   December 2021 for the publication of the final Action Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700065#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Horticulture Sector","counter":566,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700065#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":567,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[48862\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700065#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the point at which his attention was drawn to the fact that the report of the working group on horticultural peat would not be furnishing the Minister of State with a completed report by the end of September 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":568,"content":"<p>The request by the Chair of the working group for an extension to the end-of-September timeline for submission of the Report referred to by the Deputy was first brought to my attention on the morning of 29 September.<\/p><p>The Chair indicated that a brief additional period of time would be required in order to take account of technical meetings conducted by the group on the different strands of peat requirement for each of the horticulture growing sectors, which concluded on 10 September, and to allow time for the group to discuss and finalise its report.<\/p><p>I agreed to this request and my response was communicated to the Chair the same day.

The actions set out under Pathway 4 of <i>Housing for All<\/i>, &quot;Addressing Vacancy and Efficient Use of Existing Stock&quot;, and in particular action 20.3, &quot;Review and extend planning regulations that exempt certain vacant commercial premises from requiring planning permission to change of use for residential purposes to 2025&quot; will help us to deliver this. <\/p><p>Much housing demand within Local Authorities is for smaller homes for single people.

The initiative will be adjusted so that there will be a particular focus &lsquo;to encourage private owners and\/or occupiers to bring vacant floor area in historic buildings back into use&rsquo; and projects &lsquo;that address dereliction and vacancy &rsquo;. There will be an additional &euro;2 million in funding in the 2022 scheme.<\/p><p>These measures are in addition to the vacant property tax and vacant site tax being pursued by the Department of Finance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700065#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700065#WRL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[48932\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700065#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to protect the small remnant of ancient oakwood at the Uragh woods Special Area of Conservation from destruction by both wild and domestic grazing animals.","asker":"1559","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":574,"content":"<p>National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) officials of my Department monitor designated sites and, in conjunction, with other public authorities, as appropriate, investigate incidents within these sites in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife Acts and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The re-fencing of Uragh Wood Nature Reserve is intended to form part of my Capital programme for 2022.

Full-time students are not traditionally included in unemployment estimates as they are not considered part of the labour force as they are generally not available for full time employment.<\/p>  <p>  Thanks to the continued reopening of our economy and society, the number of young people on PUP has declined significantly, falling by 91% since the 2021 peak in February to just under 10,400 this week.

The last two Budgets have seen a series of evidence-based increases in some social welfare payments targeted to improve the situation of the people who are most at risk of poverty and to ensure the most vulnerable were protected. <\/p>  <p>  For example, in recognition of research which indicates that those who are aged 65 years and over are more likely to be at risk of poverty, deprivation and consistent poverty if they live alone, the Living Alone Allowance was increased by &euro;10 per week over the course of Budgets 2020 and 2021.  This brought the rate from &euro;9 to &euro;19 per week. <\/p>  <p>  To take account of increased costs arising as a result of increases to the carbon tax, the Fuel Allowance was increased by &euro;2 per week in Budget 2020 and a further &euro;3.50 per week in Budget 2021, raising the weekly rate of payment from &euro;22.50 in 2019 to &euro;28 currently.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Minimum Essential Standard of Living (MESL) research has consistently shown that households with children, and particularly older children, face higher costs than those without.

In the most recent published Sector Profile (published in 2021, and relating to data from 2020), 44% of services reported challenges in recruiting suitably qualified staff over the past 12 months. While this figure was down 9% from the previous year, it remains very high. The staff turnover rate has similarly fallen from 23% to 18%, but remains unacceptably high. <\/p>  <p>  Recruitment and recruitment difficulties in the sector are undoubtedly linked to poor terms and conditions in the workforce, with for example the average pay being &euro;12.45 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the need for significant improvement in pay and working conditions for practitioners in early learning and childcare services.

An Implementation Office monitors progress supported by an Inter Departmental Group and produces an Annual Implementation Report. The implementation structures of the Better Outcomes Brighter Futures framework provide further support and oversight for implementation.

The processing of all international protection applications is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice.<\/p>  <p>  While Tulsa has no role in the asylum system, it has a specialist team of social workers dealing with separated children - the Separated Children Seeking Asylum (SCSA) team. The SCSA team also works with unaccompanied minors that Ireland has agreed to accept under specific projects led by the IRPP. The SCSA will assist the child in completing a protection application form for the International Protection Office and will also provide emotional support to the child.<\/p>  <p>  Separated children are the largest cohort of children who come into Tusla care when they present to the immigration authorities at our sea and air ports. The service provided to these children is demand-led, and accurately estimating future demand is challenging as the international situation can change quickly. These children are received into care and are placed in residential and foster care.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla's SCSA team received 80 referrals in 2020. Often such referrals include children who arrive unaccompanied at a port of entry but who have an adult relative or friend who lives in Ireland and is willing to care for them. The children who do not have adult relatives or guardians are received into care. There were 52 of these children in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to children who are accompanied by their parents or guardians, such children are included in the protection applications made by their parents. The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department has no role in the processing of asylum applications. IPAS is responsible for the provision of accommodation and other services to persons who indicate their need for such accommodation during the protection application process. IPAS has also developed its own developed a Child Protection and Welfare Policy, the implementation of which is overseen by a social work team leader on secondment from Tusla to IPAS.  In addition to this oversight role, the social work team leader also works directly with centre staff and families within IPAS accommodation centres to ensure they receive the child and family supports they require.<\/p>  <p>  Numerous organisations, including NGOs and State Partners, also provide in-reach assistance to the families to assist with their orientation to the country.

The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy. <\/p>  <p>  The State is not the employer and therefore cannot determine wages in the sector. However, I am committed to doing what is in my power to improve wages and conditions of employment in the sector. Increased investment by my Department in early learning and childcare services over a number of years has aimed to support improvements in pay. Overall, investment in the sector increased 141% over five budgets to 2020. This investment included specific measures to assist employers to improve pay and conditions such as: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare to make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.<\/p>  <p>  Last December I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC). In agreement with IBEC\/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process.<\/p>  <p>   On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, and Minister English has now accepted the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations. The Establishment Order came into effect at the beginning of July. The JLC will provide an opportunity for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine wages and working conditions for the sector.  <\/p>  <p>  Work is also progressing on a new funding model. The recommendations of a dedicated Expert Group are due later in 2021 and will be central to addressing both affordability and quality issues. The Expert Group&rsquo;s Draft Guiding Principles to underpin a new funding model recognise the importance of the workforce in delivering quality services. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, work continues on the Workforce Development Plan in setting out an approach to achieve commitments in First 5 relating to the workforce in early learning and childcare services, including commitments to raise the profile of careers in the sector and to ensure sufficient numbers of staff at all levels within the sector along with leadership development opportunities, and to work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce. It is expected that the Workforce Development Plan will be completed by the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700070#WRQ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":819,"content":"<p>Question No. 303 answered with Question No. 301.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":820,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700070#WRQ03400"},{"type":"question","counter":821,"qnumday":304,"qnumall":"[48928\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700070#WRQ03500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if information regarding potential avenues of State funding from his Department will be provided to a service in (details supplied) County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":822,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that my Department's responsibilities include a range of policy and service activity, direct and indirect, for children and young people, adults, families and communities and have a diverse range of cross-cutting impacts on other policy areas.

If I, or my officials, become aware of a situation in which a child is considered to be at risk, that concern is communicated to Tusla as a matter of urgency. <\/p>  <p>  If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, the concerns should be reported to Tusla. Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website.  If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) should be alerted without delay. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla acts urgently on notification of an immediate risk to a child. Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by AGS or by Tusla, but in the main both agencies work together in such cases. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has an out of hours emergency number for AGS which provides advice to the AGS based on the circumstances and also can identify where a child is listed on the Child Protection Notification System. There is a 24\/7 'out of hours' social work team available in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Cork and on call social workers in other areas. Tusla has a network of emergency foster care placements for children in need of emergency care out of hours.   <\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have specific powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act to remove a child from a situation of danger, and under Section 13 of that same act, to deliver that child into the custody of Tusla. Tusla will at that point carry out an assessment to determine the child's needs. This may in some cases include applying for an Emergency Care Order.  In all cases, a plan will be put in place to ensure that the child is safe from harm. Where a child is already in care, Tusla will make a determination as to whether the child is safe in their placement or if they need to be moved. <\/p>  <p>  In April 2021 Tusla published research undertaken by National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) which examined the actions undertaken by Tusla social workers when AGS transfer custody of a child to their care, following the AGS removing the child under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991.

The findings showed that most of the children were aged 15 to 17 years and there were slightly more boys than girls. The research also showed that the most commonly reported reasons for invoking a Section 12 were: <\/p>  <p>  - Severe parenting Difficulties<\/p>  <p>  - Parental Alcohol\/Drug Abuse<\/p>  <p>  - Child Behaviour Difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  As the data for the report was collected in 2016\/2017 many of the findings of the report, and subsequent recommendations, have been addressed through ongoing service development and improvement in Tusla, including, as mentioned, the standardised processes of communication between Tusla and AGS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700070#WRQ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":829,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[49005\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700070#WRQ04100","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the extent to which his Department continues to meet any necessary requirements in respect of deficiencies in the protection of children in care or as reported at home; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":830,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is the statutory body with responsibility for child protection and welfare services.  <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team which produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, including detailed reporting on child safety and protection services.

Its purpose is to promote and protect human rights and equality in Ireland and build a culture of respect for human rights, equality and intercultural understanding in the State. In mid-October 2020 the transfer took place of the Governance function of IHREC from the Department of Justice and Equality to my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Significant advances have been made in recent years to address inequality in Irish society, with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fostering a diverse, inclusive and equal society re-affirmed through the Programme for Government commitments to achieve social solidarity, equality of opportunity and economic equity for all.<\/p>  <p>  The suite of national equality strategies, overseen and coordinated by my Department, act as the central policy framework adopted by Government to address inequality across Irish society. The strategies include the Migrant Integration Strategy (MIS), the National Strategy for Women and Girls (NSWG), the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS), the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, the National LGBTI+ Strategy for Youth and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES).<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of each equality strategy is overseen by a steering committee which draws together State and non-State actors to deliver a better quality of life for all through targeted actions to promote social inclusion and improved access to public services.

The Plan, which will be completed by year-end, is intended to set out an approach to achieve the workforce commitments in <i>First 5<\/i>(the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families) relating to early learning and care (ELC) and school age childcare (SAC), including commitments to ensure sufficient numbers of staff at all levels of qualifications within the sector, and to raise the profile of careers in the sector, along with strengthening leadership development opportunities, and working towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.<\/p><p>In addition to involvement of representatives of the sector and of further and higher education institutions in development of the Plan, public and sectoral consultation on the Plan took place in 2020.<\/p><p>I am not aware of a shortage of places on further and higher education courses for ELC. Rather, the staffing challenges experienced in ELC and SAC services primarily reflect challenges of staff recruitment and staff retention.

A pathway to addressing this is through the ongoing Joint Labour Committee (JLC) process which I commenced in December 2020 in coordination with employee and employer representative organisations.<\/p><p>The strengthening of a career framework and clear career pathways - through the Workforce Development Plan - should complement the efforts underway to improve pay and conditions of employment in the sector.<\/p><p>My Department continues to fund a number of workforce training and development initiatives, including Higher Capitation payments for ECCE services with graduate room leaders, the Learner Fund, and the LINC (Leadership for Inclusion) programme.

Prioritising visible policing in rural and urban communities will ensure community policing is at the forefront of our police service and an integral strand of our social contract with the public. <\/p>  <p>  To this end, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion in 2021. This level of funding is supporting the ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff. There are now approximately 14,400 Garda members and over 3,300 Garda staff nationwide. <\/p>  <p>  Although the budget was available for the recruitment of 600 Garda&iacute; this year, the Commissioner has indicated that, due to the impact of the pandemic restrictions in Templemore, Garda recruitment is likely to total approximately 450 trainees spread over four intakes this year.  Three of these intakes have already commenced training and the final intake are due to commence next month. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is introducing the new Garda Operating Model, which is designed to make each Division the central unit of policing administration, rather than the current smaller District model. This is to provide a more comprehensive and inclusive policing service and will help strengthen the focus on community policing. As part of this process, trained Garda&iacute; are freed up from desk duties and redeployed to front line policing.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to delivering on the report of the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI), which acknowledges that policing and community safety are not the sole responsibility of the Garda&iacute; but require a whole of Government approach. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department recently published the General Scheme of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. This Bill will improve the performance and accountability of our policing and security services, and support the human rights of all people throughout Ireland to be and feel safe in their communities. It will represent the most wide ranging and coherent reform of policing in a generation.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill has four main objectives:<\/p>  <p>  1. Make the prevention of harm and protection of people who are vulnerable or at risk, and the safety of communities,  a &ldquo;whole of government&rdquo; responsibility,<\/p>  <p>  2. Strengthen and consolidate independent, external oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na,<\/p>  <p>  3. Enhance the internal governance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the role of the Garda Commissioner as CEO, and<\/p>  <p>  4. Improve the independent oversight of our national security infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill has been developed on the basis of the recommendations of CoFPI following its fundamental in-depth review and builds on the work of the Policing Authority.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission found that community safety requires a whole of Government approach in partnership with local communities. My Department has been developing a new Community Safety Policy and this new policy will be given a statutory basis in the Bill. To support and inform the policy, three Local Community Safety Partnerships are being piloted in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City, Waterford and Longford and will run for the next two years.  <\/p>  <p>  Local Community Safety Partnerships are designed to take a holistic approach to safety issues in partnership with the community. The Partnerships will allow local communities to identify issues  of particular concern within their area and work with the relevant State services to develop a local Community Safety Plan to specifically tackle these issues. The Local Community Safety Partnerships will be rolled out nationwide to all local authority areas after the pilot phase of two years.<\/p>  <p>  I am very aware of recent incidents of anti-social behaviour in on our communities. I met senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives of businesses in Dublin city centre, as well as local representatives, in recent weeks to discuss the issue of anti-social behaviour in the city. I will be in continuing contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others as we progress through the autumn and winter on the actions being taken to ensure people feel safe in Dublin and other towns and cities. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to implement high visibility policing plans to address public disorder related issues and anti-social behaviour, with particular overt and targeted policing of public places at times when public order incidents and anti-social behaviour typically increase, such as at bank holidays weekends. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour has been established, chaired by Minister of State James Browne. This forum considers the effectiveness of existing legislation and proposes new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders. A sub-group of the forum has already considered measures which can be taken with regard to the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes in communities and similar sub groups can also be established for other issues where appropriate. For example, a further subgroup on the issue of knife crime has now been established and had its first meeting on 28 September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700073#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cybersecurity Policy","counter":935,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700073#WRT01100"},{"type":"question","counter":936,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[48855\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021100700073#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will determine the steps the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau are taking in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders in response to the rise in phishing over the past year and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":937,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that the criminal activity known as 'phishing' or 'smishing', as well as all fraudulent calls are taken very seriously by my Department and is the subject of on-going engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, telecoms service providers and the banking and technology industries.  <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau proactively engages with telecommunications providers to suspend VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) numbers which are suspected of being used to commit fraud and it is the experience of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that telecommunication companies based in Ireland will provide assistance in the suspension of such numbers upon notification that they are being used to commit fraud offences.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p><p>Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p><p>Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p><p>At the request of my Department, the HIQA are conducting a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on a school based HPV mop-up vaccination programme (for those that were previously eligible and missed or turned down the vaccine).

The type and level of service provided varied widely across the country.  This resulted in a situation whereby access to services depended on where the child lived, where they went to school, their age and their diagnosis.  In some cases, children were transferred between waiting lists as their diagnosis was unclear. In parallel, many families were advised to apply for an Assessment of Need (AON) under the Disability Act (2005) as a means of securing a diagnosis and subsequent access to services.  Consequently, waiting times for AON increased and the HSE was unable to meet its legislative obligations in this regard. <\/p><p>The Progressing Disability Services for Children &amp;amp; Young People (PDS) programme represents a major reform of services for children with complex needs.  Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams are being established that will provide services for children with complex needs based on their needs and on their address.  Access to these CDNTs is not linked to diagnosis or school placements.  To address issues associated with AON, the HSE implemented a Standard Operating Procedure for AON for all new applications from January 2020.  This procedure defines an AON as a preliminary team assessment that determines whether or not a child has a disability as defined by the Act.  This system is designed to ensure that children access timely assessments and intervention.  The establishment of CDNTs in association with implementation of this SOP ensures that children and families access appropriate supports as quickly as possible.  <\/p><p>The Children's Disability Network Team includes a range of health professionals, such as Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Psychologists, Paediatricians, Physiotherapists and Social Workers. The HSE has its own standards and criteria for employing health professionals and all professionals on the team will have the appropriate level of expertise to assess the child.<\/p><p>There is no legislation that prohibits a health practitioner from offering a private diagnosis, however, a diagnosis of autism can often require an assessment by a multi-disciplinary team. <\/p><p>When seeking any private health service, it is always advisable to check the health professional&rsquo;s qualifications. Some professions, such as psychiatrists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists are statutorily regulated and the register of their regulator can be checked to ensure they are appropriately qualified - www.medicalcouncil.ie\/public-information\/check-the-register\/,  <i>system.coru.ie\/index.php\/SearchMember\/Find<\/i><\/p><p>Other health professions are not currently statutorily regulated but this does not mean that practitioners are not fully qualified to practise their profession.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p><p>Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p><p>Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.
