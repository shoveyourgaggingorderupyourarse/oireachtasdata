It is vital importance to people across my own constituency of Meath West and that of my colleague Deputy O'Rourke, Meath East.  Tara Mines employs over 580 people directly and hundreds more indirectly and supports thousands of jobs across County Meath.  The importance of Tara Mines to the economy of Navan and County Meath cannot be understated.  There is considerable concern across the county about the seriousness of the flooding now occurring in the mines.  Last week, while a pilot borehole was being drilled for a ventilation shaft, a vast amount of water was encountered that began to flood the underground mine.  Thankfully, all workers vacated it safely but the seriousness of the situation only became apparent when the massive amounts of water flowing in and flooding the underground tunnels did not subside.  Since then, millions of litres of water continue to flood the new part of Tara Mines, known as Tara Deep, and also the old part of the mine that currently produces lead and zinc.  Production has stopped and efforts are being made to try to stop the flooding.  I commend the workers who are working tirelessly to try to fix the problem.  On Sunday, a surface drill rig arrived and was set up over the borehole and a packer was to be used to try to address the issue from the surface above.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's visit to the mines on Friday evening and hope he took away the seriousness of the current situation.<\/p>  <p>  Tara Mines is Europe's largest zinc mine and one of the largest in the world.  Since mining began in 1977, more than 85 million tonnes of ore have been extracted.  Zinc is used to galvanise other metals such as iron to prevent rusting, with galvanised steel used in everything from cars to street lamps and bridges.  Lead is used in batteries among many other things.  We need these metals for essential everyday items.  This highlights the importance of the work of the skilled employees in the mines.  As mentioned, the flooding has not stopped since the initial breach last week and the rising waters will threaten underground workshops and pumping stations if they do not reduce.  We hope the plan to plug it from above, which was supposed to happen yesterday evening or today, will work successfully.  If the packer seals the breach, the next job will be to try to pump out the incredible amount of water now present in the mine.  Obviously, the mines have their own pumping system but it has never faced a crisis like this before.  Will the Minister of State ensure all assistance the Government or State agencies can offer is made available should Tara Mines management require it?  It is vital everything is done to try to recover the mine and protect these jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100003#A00500","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1638349920,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is unavailable this morning.  I thank Deputy Guirke for raising this very important matter for his constituency and for County Meath.  I concur with his concerns and also with his comments on the workforce, which is very skilled and dedicated and works in a high-pressure environment.<\/p>  <p>  Boliden Tara Mines DAC is the operator of Tara Mines, located in Navan, County Meath.  While drilling a pilot hole for venting purposes for its return air raise shaft No. 7 for the Tara deep exploration drive, there was an inrush of water to the mine.  Thankfully, there were no injuries.  The pilot hole broke through into the underground vent drive early in the morning of Sunday, 21 November 2021.  Initial water flow was minor but built up over a number of days to a substantial volume and became greater than the mine pumping capacity.  The mine authorities took the decision to allow the Tara deep exploration drive, which is over 2.4 km long, to flood.  They removed equipment from the deeper sections of the mine and stopped production operations to facilitate this work.  Efforts are ongoing to stem the inflow of water into the mine and a number of contingency plans are in place.  The mine is containing the water from the pilot hole within the mine workings and it is currently not being discharged to the surface.<\/p>  <p>  Mining in Ireland is highly regulated.  For any mine to operate in Ireland it requires planning permission from the relevant local authority, in this case Meath County Council, an integrated pollution control or industrial emissions licence from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and a State mining facility from the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Health and safety for the mines are regulated by the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, which brought in new mining legislation in 2018, namely the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Mines) Regulations, Sl 133 of 2018.  The regulations apply to all mines where people work and set out duties on the owner, operator, manager and employees at a mine with respect to persons at or in the area immediately surrounding a mine.  The regulations came into operation on 30 April 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, through the Geoscience Regulation Office, GSRO, is actively monitoring the situation and is liaising with the EPA and Meath County Council on the matter.  Officials from the GSRO visited the Tara site earlier this week and engagement is ongoing between the regulators and Boliden.  However, it is not yet known when mining operations will restart.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is currently finalising a draft policy statement on mineral exploration and mining.  Submissions as part of a public consultation which concluded on 15 October last are currently being considered.  The Government will consider the draft policy statement early next year.  The draft policy statement highlights the important role of minerals in our everyday lives and the critical role they will play in our transition to net-zero emissions and carbon neutrality by 2050.<\/p> <p>As is the case with the Navan mine, mining activities also have the potential to enhance and grow local communities, not just in terms of the provision of skilled jobs and the financial contribution they make to local economies, but also in terms of infrastructural improvements and improvements in the human capital they deliver in rural areas.  It is not possible at this point to say when the Navan mine will become operational again, but the situation is being closely monitored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100003#A00600","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638350520,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response.

From what I have heard, the flooding is very extensive and it has consumed large parts of the current mine and the new mining area vital to the long-term future of the mine known as Tara Deep.

Environmental enforcement activities are carried out by the EPA through inspections, audits and emissions monitoring.  Inspectors assess the results of emissions monitoring carried out at licensed facilities to determine the impact, if any, of the emissions on the environment.  Officials from the GSRO in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications also monitor mining operations.  Inspections of each of the main State mining facilities are undertaken by specialist mine inspectors to ensure that they are compliant with the terms of their mining leases or licences.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland still maintains significant status for zinc production in Europe due to operations at the Navan mine, the largest underground zinc mine in Europe and by far the most significant mining facility in the State.  Approximately 600 people are directly employed at the mine, along with additional contract staff, as outlined by the Deputy.  The mine is also important in terms of supplying the raw materials we need for our future solar and wind energy, as well as batteries required to decarbonise our energy systems.  <\/p>  <p>  As stated, it is not possible to say when the mine will become operational again but the relevant regulatory authorities, including the GSRO, the EPA, Meath County Council and the Health and Safety Authority continue to monitor the situation closely and to liaise with the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100004#B00300","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","time":1638350520,"counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100004#B00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1638350520,"counter":15,"content":"<p>It is fair to say that school communities around Ireland are this morning grappling with another chaotic management of messaging and leadership from the Department of Education.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, and I are in absolute agreement that it is incredibly important that schools remain open.  It is profoundly damaging for children when schools are closed.  We know that when they were closed it was very difficult for students, particularly those in disadvantaged areas and those with additional needs, to get the type of educational services they needed.<\/p>  <p>  For the past 18 months, the Department and the Government have been saying, \"Schools are safe\", \"Schools are safe\", \"Schools are safe\".  Last month, I stood here and asked the Minister and the Government to stop saying that, but they continue to repeat that schools are safe.  Last week, we heard a new line from NPHET, that is, that it never said that schools are safe.  Having taken five days to consider what NPHET has suggested in terms of mask-wearing for nine-year-olds, from third class upwards in primary schools, we get an overnight diktat from the Department of Education, delivered with all of the subtlety and compassion of a gas bill.  This morning, principals have to police mask-wearing by nine-year-olds, from third class upwards, without any sense of what the legal implications are if a parent was to refuse, no sense of a lead-in period and an absolute absence of commentary, guidance or leadership from the Minister.  <\/p>  <p>  All we needed last night was a video message or other communication from the political leader of education in Ireland acknowledging that this change is difficult, telling parents that they are part of the solution and asking them to talk to their children about wearing masks - children have seen adults wearing masks - and telling them that the reason for that is we are trying to make sure that people do not get sick, that they can help us in that regard, that they should not feel anxious or worried, that we will get through this together and that they are part of the solution.  Instead, we got a classic, soulless communication, a follow-up to a communication from the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, Dr. Tony Holohan, and NPHET to each individual school stating that this change was required to come into effect today.  After everything schools have been through, the Minister being asked last April to do something around antigen testing, but doing nothing about it until this week, all of the failures of communication heretofore and the Minister and Government parroting the line, \"Schools are safe\", \"Schools are safe\", \"Schools are safe\", they have given principals and school communities 16 hours to get their act together to enforce a diktat, a requirement from the Department of Education on face mask wearing among, potentially, very anxious children, with zero compassion and zero leadership from that Department.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government has been described as a bad debs committee.  That is the best description I can come up with this morning.  I would like the Minister to respond to that and to speak not just to me, but to take this opportunity to speak to the children of Ireland who may see this contribution later today.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100004#B00500","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1638350520,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House, as he has requested, the current position regarding Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in schools.<\/p><p>Ensuring that schools can continue to operate through Covid-19 has been a key priority for the Government.  The Department always has been guided by our public health authorities, such as NPHET, the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, regarding the appropriate Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in place in schools.  Additional funding and staff have been made available to schools to support the implementation of these measures.  Furthermore, I would like to record again that I am deeply appreciative of the strong work that has taken place and continues to take place on the ground in schools around the country to implement these public health measures.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there have been a number of additional measures recommended by public health recently.  First, the Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with the Department of Education, recently commenced a programme in which antigen tests are made available to children in primary schools when a case of Covid-19 arises.  The Deputy will be aware that there were varying views at various times in regard to the effectiveness of antigen testing, but it is now the strong recommendation of the CMO that there is a place for antigen testing as an additional tool to augment all of the other tools that are in our schools.  For that reason, as public health have recommended it, it is now going forward.<\/p><p>Parents and guardians of a primary school child who is a confirmed case of Covid-19 following a PCR test are asked to inform their school's principal.  The school principal will then inform the parents of other children in the pod of a confirmed case.  Where there are two cases in a class in more than one pod within a seven-day period, antigen testing will be provided to every child in the class.  No personal details of the child will be shared.  These parents will be provided with the option to receive free antigen tests for their child, which they will be able to order using a freephone number for delivery to their home.  School principals will not be required to gather evidence of participation or of any antigen test results.<\/p> <p>Information materials for parents were shared with schools last week and publicised directly to parents.  It has been referenced that, following recent advice from NPHET, the Government has approved the wearing of face masks by children aged nine years and older in a number of settings, including for children in third class and above in primary schools.  Guidance has issued to primary schools on this basis, setting out the recommendation and the exemptions which apply in respect of children with medical or special needs.  Of course, it may be difficult for some students with special needs or certain medical issues to wear face coverings.  Schools know their children and are best placed to identify those children whose complex needs are such that the wearing of face coverings may not be possible for them and to discuss this with parents as required.<\/p> <p> Schools have been provided with guidance and information for parents and children.  It is expected that schools, as usual, will take a practical approach over the next day or two, as has been communicated, in order to communicate the new measures to parents and ensure parents have the opportunity to provide masks to children.  The measure is being introduced on a temporary basis and is subject to review in mid-February 2022.<\/p> <p> The Deputy will appreciate that this is a public health measure.  It is guided by public health.  It is the strong recommendation of the CMO and NPHET that this is an additional tool for our schools.  The decision was taken yesterday but schools have been given the latitude over the coming days to engage with parents and students on the wearing of face masks.  I confirm that this well-being approach is typical of the approach we have taken since the reopening of schools.  It is a public health measure in the best interests of children, as advised by public health for the protection of children, individually and collectively, and the school community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100004#B00600","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638351120,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The Minister cannot stand here and tell us it is a public health measure and that is just the way it goes.

What happens if somebody comes to the school gate and refuses for their child to wear a mask.  What does the principal do then?  Does the Minister what principals should do in such circumstances, and has she informed them of this in the 16 hours given for them to prepare for this measure?  We all know we are trying to protect people from getting sick, hospitalised and ending up in ICU.  We know what the point is.  Government Members were the ones telling us for the last 18 months that schools were safe while school communities, principals and managers were screaming out for support.  I think the Department is depending on the goodwill of principals, who are hardwired to ensure they defend the reputation of their schools at all costs in the school community, to ensure there are not high anxiety levels among their student body or parent body and to keep the show on the road, rather than telling the truth of what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  The Department expects a practical approach over the next day or two.

This heightens anxiety among parents and pupils who are sitting next to peers who have been offered a placement and wondering where they will be going to school next year.<\/p>  <p>  Against that backdrop, Le Ch&eacute;ile Secondary School was opened last September and was a welcome addition to the educational infrastructure in Ballincollig.  Unfortunately, the school received a significant setback last week when Cork City Council issued a refusal of planning permission to the Minister.  I have, courtesy of my colleague in Ballincollig, Councillor Garret Kelleher, a copy of the city council's decision.<\/p> <p>While it indicates that there was pre-planning done by the Department of Education in consultation with the city council, any reading of the planner's report and the terms of the refusal would bring into question why the Department felt it was appropriate to pursue this planning application and waste time.  While I acknowledge the support of the local GAA club in facilitating the site, it is clear that the site is dead in the water for the reasons enunciated in the planning refusal and that we now need to move on.  We need to work with all stakeholders to get a solution.<\/p> <p> Of particular importance is ASD provision for September 2022.  While Ballincollig has a positive network of educational establishments, it is sadly lacking in ASD provision.  I have seen cases of children from Ballincollig having to go to Farran, Berrings and elsewhere for ASD provision.  Fortunately, this issue has begun to be addressed recently and there are now ASD units in primary schools in Ballincollig - I acknowledge the role of Mr. Gerry Ryan, the special educational needs organiser, SENO, in that regard - but the only ASD provision available for the classes graduating from primary school next September was to be on the Le Ch&eacute;ile campus.  I ask the Minister to give a clear commitment and signal in replying to this matter that, if we do nothing else, the ASD unit will be up and running for next September.  I ask her to ensure that all of the stakeholders meet and her Department takes a proactive position.  We need to ensure that enrolment proceeds next September.  There are 120 pupils who have been offered places in Le Ch&eacute;ile for next year and there are 60 on standby in one of the secondary schools already.  We have a clear problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100005#C01400","speaker":"1454","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638351720,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Deputy's ongoing commitment to this issue in his constituency.  It is an issue on which Deputy Aindrias Moynihan has also engaged with me.  I thank Deputy Creed for raising the matter, as it allows me to provide an update to the House on the current position on the provision of interim accommodation for Le Ch&eacute;ile Secondary School in Ballincollig, County Cork.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2021, the school opened in contingency interim accommodation in the former Cork Film Centre in Ballincollig.  The school will operate in interim accommodation pending delivery of its permanent school project.  As the Deputy outlined, the Department of Education had sought planning permission from Cork City Council for the planned interim accommodation for the school on the grounds of Ballincollig GAA Club.  That planning application has been refused by Cork City Council.<\/p>  <p>  At the moment, my Department is exploring what other options may be available, but it is proving difficult.  Having done this previously, my Department had identified the Ballincollig GAA site as the best option.  My Department will be liaising urgently with the local authority on alternative options.  My Department will endeavour to make the appropriate and necessary interim accommodation arrangements in the shortest timeframe possible and will keep the school and its patron informed as viable options are examined and arrangements for September 2022 are made.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been in contact with the school regarding its first year enrolment for 2022.  The school's admissions policy, as published on its website, confirms that 72 places are available.  My Department understands that the school made offers to applicants on 11 November and that the closing date for acceptance of these offers is 7 December.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with the school and its patron in exploring the accommodation options for mainstream and special education needs pupils for the 2022-23 school year.  Officials in my Department continue to liaise with officials in Cork City Council on the identification and acquisition of a suitable permanent site for the school in question.  A number of permanent site options were identified.  Each of these was investigated by the Department in conjunction with officials from Cork City Council.  Unfortunately, in the case of all options identified, either the land could not be readily acquired from the landowner or the site was ultimately considered unfeasible for development.  There has been consistent engagement and liaising with the local authority on identifying an appropriate and suitable site, and this will remain ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  A potential suitable site has been identified in conjunction with the city council and discussions are ongoing in terms of exploring all options available to the Department to obtain possession of it.  The Department is unable to provide any further information at this stage due to commercial sensitivities related to acquisition of the permanent site, but this is a priority for the Department.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the need within the area.  We have taken a proactive approach.  We have engaged from a pre-planning point of view and in respect of a variety of other sites that had potential, each of which was evaluated in conjunction with the local authority.  I acknowledge the liaising with the local authority, which has been most helpful.  As we proceed, we needing that liaising to continue.  I assure the Deputy that we will do everything possible to prioritise the acquisition of a site and move matters forward in a timely and appropriate manner so as to meet the needs of the school and the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100006#D00200","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1638351720,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.

Time is of the essence.  We have ten months before enrolment commences next September.  That is worrying for the vast cohort of students, but it is particularly worrying for those students in ASD units who have no other place to go in Ballincollig.  They have been educated in these ASD units in their local community.  It is cruel beyond belief that we would be unable to solve their particular problem within this bigger problem.  If there is any specific commitment that I would like the Minister to give, it is that the ASD unit at least will be open in September 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the issue of the permanent site.  I accept that a permanent site is the ultimate ambition for all of us.  However, I find it difficult to believe that something that has eluded us to this date can be concluded and a temporary structure put on it by next September.  I ask the Minister, in convening all stakeholders, that she consider advertising locally for a temporary site.  It is clear that the GAA site is dead in the water now.  The school has advanced the idea that, on its existing site, which is courtesy of the city council, there may be some scope to resolve the September 2022 situation, if not beyond that, including for the ASD unit.  That idea should be explored as a matter of urgency.  However, it is likely that there will be a requirement for a new site on a temporary basis and every effort must be made to find that while continuing the efforts to find a permanent solution, which has eluded us to date notwithstanding the best efforts of everybody.

I appreciate the difficult task she has in trying to rectify what seems to be a crisis in special needs assistant, SNA, shortages and allocations.  At the same time, I must speak up on behalf of the parents of children with special needs.  Principals of national schools throughout the country, and in west Cork, seem to be engaged in a constant battle for extra SNA allocation.  These principals are already dealing with extra Covid measures such as those announced last night.  They must explain to parents why their children must now wear face masks.  They are dealing with the prevention of Covid, pods and ventilation and they have an extra battle to get SNA allocation for the students who deserve this help and support.  There seems to be a particular problem in and around the Skibbereen area because schools are contacting my office and pleading for help, including Dreeny National School, Caheragh National School, Ballydehob National School, and St. Joseph's National School, Skibbereen.  I do not expect the Minister of State to be familiar with each of the schools individually, but there is a major shortage of SNAs in and around this area and the situation is at crisis point.<\/p>  <p>  I will try to outline the difficulties the schools have.  I will not name the individual school, but the schools are all in or around the Skibbereen area.  One school has a child with Down's syndrome, a child with severe autism and a child with spina bifida.  The school has an allocation of 1.83 SNAs.  Because of the lack of mobility, the child with spina bifida requires two SNAs to physically lift the child into the hoist apparatus used.  That requires approximately two hours of SNA help per day, and it leads to a situation where the principal, who is in the classroom, must look after the other two children with special needs requirements, without any SNA support whatsoever.  One of the children is a flight risk.  In addition to everything else the principal must deal with; it is not good enough that they are left without support for two hours.  This is the type of thing that is happening.<\/p>  <p>  In another two-teacher school, a junior class has two children with significant needs and the senior class also has two children with significant needs.  The SNA allocation for the entire school is 0.5.  It has been said time and time again that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, seems to have no idea of the reality on the ground for these principals, parents and students.  One parent, who is in social housing and is on a low income, has offered to help out financially and pay for extra SNA support.<\/p>  <p>  The final example I will give is a school that has one class with severe and profound difficulties.  The SNA allocation for the class is 2.87.  There are five students in the class, but two of them have almost no mobility.  Again, two of the SNAs must bring those students to the bathroom, leaving the rest of the class in the care of the special needs teacher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100007#E00300","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1638352320,"counter":41,"content":"<p>We are running out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100007#E00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1638352320,"counter":42,"content":"<p>This is the type of thing that is happening on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100007#E00500","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1638352320,"counter":43,"content":"<p>We are way over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100007#E00600","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1638352320,"counter":44,"content":"<p>It is proof that the NCSE has no idea of what is happening on the ground and that needs to be resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100007#E00700","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1638352320,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for comprehensively outlining the SNA allocations issues west Cork in particular faces.<\/p>  <p>  I will put in context my role as Minister of State with responsibility for special education in the rolling out and administering the &euro;2.2 billion budget we secured this year, which is more than 25% of the entire education budget.  That is an increase of 60% since 2011.  Within the &euro;2.2 billion resource, we managed to secure funding for an unprecedented number of 1,165 SNAs.  By the end of December 2022, we will have 19,169 SNAs circulating within the education sector.  That is an increase of 81%.  The statistics can sound abstract and cold when we are talking about special education.  I simply outline them to show the Deputy the progress that has been made in the sector.  That is not to say that, on occasion, schools will not require additionality of SNA posts.  The Deputy outlined some of the matters faced by schools in Skibbereen.<\/p>  <p>  He will be aware of the exceptional review process, which is a valuable process whereby a school can apply directly to the NCSE to increase its allocation in circumstances where it is of the view that such an increase is required.  He outlined some cases.  I assume these are mainstream schools as opposed to special schools.  It is important to stress that the allocation for SNAs in April 2021 has remained at that level.  The front-loading allocation model will be introduced in September next year and it may benefit the schools to which the Deputy referred.  The allocation is purely based on the school profile, as opposed to the individual needs of the children within the school.  It is up to the schools themselves to allocate the SNAs as they see fit to individual children.  The NCSE takes a number of criteria into account when assessing whether a new SNA is required.<\/p>  <p>  I had a look at Cork in general to examine the success rate of the exceptional review process.  I am not sure if the schools to which the Deputy referred applied.  This year, there were 195 applications from 164 schools in Cork.  He specifically mentioned primary schools.  Some 72 of them received an increase totalling 42.86 SNA posts.  Some 15 post-primary schools received a total of 10.75 SNAs.  There was an increase for 87 schools in Cork.  The NCSE does assess the individual requirements of schools, as per their school profile.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that a mainstream class no longer requires a diagnosis for a child to access an SNA.  That saves the family having to go to the expense, trouble, and inconvenience of trying to get a professional report, as that is no longer required.  SNAs are freely available for mainstream classes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100007#E00800","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1638352320,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I genuinely appreciate the efforts that are being made.  I do not disregard the figure of in excess of 19,000 SNAs that are in circulation.  That is a large increase, and we must acknowledge it.  At the same time, in many instances, the increase in SNA allocations is not being reflected on the ground.  In the cases I outlined, many of the schools have applied to the NCSE and appealed decisions.  In some instances, they may have received a minor increase in their SNA allocation.  In one case, a school received an increased SNA allocation of 0.87, but it goes nowhere near addressing its needs.<\/p>  <p>  I will return to an example I gave where there are two children in a junior class and two children in a senior class, all of them with significant needs, and the school received an SNA allocation of 0.5.<\/p> <p>In this instance, even the SENO recommended an increase to an allocation of one but the NCSE turned it down.  I am trying to highlight the disconnect between the NCSE and schools, principals and staff, regarding how things are operating on the ground.  It is impossible to expect the NCSE, or anyone, to be fully aware of the day-to-day running of a school and the different incidents that may evolve or happen during the course of a day but it is clear to me that the NCSE is not aware at all of what is happening on the ground and what these principals and teachers, in particular, have to deal with and cope with.  <\/p> <p> I am asking for a little more discretion, especially when it comes to a very well thought-out appeal.  I also ask the Minister of State to look at the individual cases of the schools I mentioned, namely, Dreeny National School, Caheragh National School, Ballydehob National School, and St. Joseph's National School, Skibbereen.  I appreciate there is a separation between her and the NCSE, but they make very strong cases for extra SNA allocation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100007#E00900","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638352920,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for outlining his concerns regarding these schools.  It is my role as Minister of State with responsibility for special education to ensure that I hold the NCSE to account.  It receives &euro;20 million from the Department every year and employs its SENOs to liaise on the ground with schools, families and parents to ensure sufficient resources are available to each school.  I can bring this matter to the attention of the NCSE.  I am not aware if it has recently inspected these schools.  The Deputy may wish to consider requesting the NCSE, via the schools, to inspect them.  I often visit mainstream schools, special schools and special classes.  When we are talking about hoists and mechanisms like that, visits are a very real, tangible and practical way for SENOs to see what is needed as opposed to seeing it in an academic way on paper.  If there have not been NCSE inspections, that would be a good thing to look at.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the SNA is critical when we talk about special education.  It is often the only way a child with additional needs can survive in school at all.  Most children would not be in position to do so, if it were not for the SNA.  Training is now being provided through a new national SNA programme at University College Dublin.

They include Orla Hegarty, John Wenger, Dr. Kim Roberts and others who are on the expert group on ventilation.  They have been very clear and very consistent on this issue, despite the fact it seems the Minister for Health is determined to ignore the expert group on ventilation, which was set up precisely to look into this issue, and instead take advice from a group with no expertise in it.  I also thank Diana O'Dwyer and the People Before Profit team for their work in helping to prepare and promote this Bill.<\/p><p>The central point of this Bill is to give workers and students the right to clean air in workplaces, including schools.  It does so by defining &ldquo;sufficient fresh air&rdquo; as &quot;air with a CO<sub>2<\/sub><font color=\"#6E87A2\">\u00a0<\/font>concentration of less than 900 parts per million, where appropriate air filtration devices have not been installed.&quot;  Those who have followed the science on this question will know that CO<sub>2<\/sub>parts per million acts as a very useful proxy for the potential for Covid to be hanging around in the air.  It provides two routes whereby we can guarantee clean air for workers and students, either through bringing that level down to less than 900 parts per million, that is, a safe level, or where that is not possible, through the mechanism of filtration, for example, high efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters.  It provides that in circumstances where workplaces go over that level and there is no appropriate air filtration, 24 hours can be given to improve the situation.  Where the level goes over 1,500 parts per million, a workplace could be shut down immediately by the Health and Safety Authority.<\/p><p>Ireland has laws setting minimum standards for clean air in chicken coops, but until now we have had nothing for schools, buses, pubs or offices.  For more than a year, we have been calling for the Government to get serious on ventilation and air quality in the fight against Covid.  The Government ignored those calls.  In March of this year, the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, expert group on ventilation report made a number of proposals, including recognising the role HEPA filters can play in our schools, especially in winter months.  Again, those calls were ignored by the Government.  Instead, it preferred to repeat the mantra that schools are safe as if it was some sort of magical spell from Harry Potter, which could prevent Covid from entering classrooms and hanging around in the air spreading among the entirely unvaccinated students.<\/p><p>People Before Profit has now done the job for the Government.  We have produced this workplace ventilation Bill to finally establish a right to clean air and enforceable standards for schools, pubs, offices and all workplaces.  This Bill establishes a right to clean air and makes that right tangible and enforceable.  Some 150 years ago, we were fighting pandemics of cholera, typhoid and other diseases.  Despite attempt after attempt, it was not until the issue of clean water was addressed that we were able to bring those diseases under control.  Looking back, it seems obvious to us but at the time, many simply did not realise how polluted water could be the transmission belt for disease.  Today, clean air is the modern challenge as we fight not only Covid, but other SARS and respiratory viruses.  If we do not tackle ventilation and we do not ensure clean air in schools and other workplaces, then we will be doomed to repeat the doom loop of outbreaks and restrictions.  If we put in the investment now, provide HEPA filters for every classroom and enforce CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors and ventilation across the board, we can put ourselves in a much stronger position to fight this virus and future viruses.<\/p><p>The Government is reported as having said it will not oppose the Bill, which we obviously welcome but it must not leave it sitting on a shelf gathering dust.  The Bill also needs to be backed up by funding.  We cannot provide for funding in an Opposition Bill.  The Government needs to follow the example of Germany or Australia in rolling out air filtration.  It needs to increase funding for the Health and Safety Authority to properly enforce these standards, put HEPA filters into every classroom and public building and provide free FFP2 masks to encourage the use of these much more effective masks.  I note that we, as Deputies, are provided with these much better and higher-quality masks free of charge, but not teachers, bartenders, bus drivers or other front-line workers.<\/p><p>We need action now to ensure clean air in schools and workplaces.  HEPA filters can help clean the air, especially during colder days when it is simply not possible to have windows wide open all day.  The NPHET expert group said so in March, the Department of Education acknowledged it in May and the EU and US centres for disease control have been saying it for months.  Up until last night, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was peddling the line on television that these filters were not recommended for schools.  The Minister for trampolining seems to think that his training as a management consultant makes him more qualified than all those experts.  It is an embarrassment.  The truth is the Minister has lost the confidence of people, even Government Deputies and, it seems, his Taoiseach.

I did so because I was personally involved with a number of teachers who were in a group called the Forgotten Families.  They were teachers who were vulnerable at school and who stayed at home to avoid Covid because of their vulnerability.  They offered their time and services to do online teaching for children who had to stay at home because of vulnerability in their households.  This group was completely ignored by the Department of Education, which continually told the parents that they must send their children to school, even though there were vulnerable members of the family in the house.  The teachers themselves were constantly being checked and rechecked by Medmark and told they had to go back to school and teach and that there was no problem in the classrooms.  One of these women, who is a personal friend of mine, went back to school with all her vulnerability and within two weeks she got Covid.  She now suffers from long Covid and only two days ago she told me that she thinks she will never teach again.  She is extremely weak and she does not have the energy to concentrate or think much.  What a tragedy it is that the Irish education system has lost such a wonderful teacher and what a personal tragedy for her that her entire career has been wiped out.<\/p><p>That happened because there was an attempt, as Deputy Paul Murphy said, to create a mantra that somehow schools were magically safe and that they were bubbles of protection from a pandemic that existed nowhere else.  That has been blown out of the water.  In the last two weeks we have seen the numbers of cases among children at 20 times what they were in the last year.  That is because we have allowed the situation to get out of control and because we have said that Covid comes from the community and not the schools.  Schools are in our community and are part of it.  As children go to school they also come home from school and bring the virus back into the house.  This has been ignored to the point of the type of tragedy I have just outlined.  If there is one teacher like my friend there are more and they are all over the country.  We need to speak out for them and for the children and their parents who this morning faced a stressful situation at the school gates.<\/p><p>Principals got a letter late yesterday to tell them that from now on masking of nine to 12-year-olds is mandatory and that they were to implement that overnight.  They were also told that if there were vulnerable children they could get a doctor's note.  How does one get a doctor's note overnight?  How does a principal who is trying to manage hundreds of nine- to 12-year-old children and their stressed-out parents implement a policy of mandatory masking of that nature without giving them time to convince the kids?  They should have been given time to bring in the older sisters and brothers of those kids to show them how to mask and to explain that they have to do it to protect each other.  The Department of Education has made a bags of dealing with Covid in the schools and I say that without any qualms whatsoever.  The vast majority of people have a distaste for politicians who pretend that what is staring them in the face is not staring them in the face.  To repeat over and over that schools are safe when the dogs in the street know they are not is a real kick in the face to the population.<\/p><p>It has been said already that HEPA filters are not by themselves a method to get rid of Covid.  Rather, they are part of a suite of measures that must be introduced.  When Covid broke out and when we were looking at what we could do, we knew that 80% of our schools were not properly ventilated.  HEPA filters do not cost a king's ransom.  Deputies Boyd Barrett and Paul Murphy got a figure for our alternative budget of &euro;12 million to fit a HEPA filter system in every classroom in the country.  If that is the case then why are we not spending that money to help protect children, teachers and their families from the spread of the virus?  I will quote from the expert group on the role of ventilation in reducing the transmission of Covid from 2 March 2021:<\/p> <blockquote> \tStand-alone HEPA filter devices can be useful in reducing airborne transmission in spaces with insufficient ventilation [i.e. 80% of our schools].  They are an easy-to-apply and cost-effective short term mitigation measure. <\/blockquote>  <p>It went on to say they can be &quot;useful in reducing airborne transmission&quot; and that important steps need to be taken now to prepare for the autumn and the winter.  The expert group told us that back in March but this country and Government chose to ignore that advice.  Children, their parents, principals and teachers are paying a hefty price for that.<\/p><p>As has been said, I hope the Government does not oppose this Bill but rather pushes it through quickly.  The Government should ensure that, like has been done in other countries, it spends a few bob and provides the schools with HEPA filters.  I know of one school in my constituency where the principal used a bit of excess from its budget to fit HEPA filters in every classroom but not all principals have that budget excess.  I know of other schools where parents are pooling money to buy HEPA filters for the classrooms that their children attend.  Why is the Government failing people in this way?  This needs to be addressed with urgency,<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100009#G00100","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1638353520,"counter":54,"content":"<p>We are 20 months into a global pandemic and the Government has introduced zero legislation on improving air quality or combating air pollution indoors.  The Government has introduced CO2 monitors into schools in a half-arsed way as it shares them between the classes.  No HEPA filters have been installed as a matter of course and there has been no legislation on them.  This is despite the fact that NPHET's ventilation subgroup is in favour of HEPA filters and Professor John Wenger first called for them to be fitted in August 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's performance on this is in contrast with what has happened in other countries.  Capitalist countries have dragged their feet on this in every country in the world but pressure has forced them to act in some countries.  There is legislation for minimum standards for air quality indoors in Belgium and Japan and by law CO2 monitors have to be in place in pubs and restaurants in Belgium.  The German Federal Government has spent &euro;200 million on HEPA filters for schools.  This is all in sharp contrast to the performance of the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party Government here.<\/p>  <p>  Orla Hegarty from the department of architecture in University College Dublin has raised a point of information which is stark and which is worth pausing to think about.  She says that 60% of people who have died from Covid in this State contracted the infection in one of just 400 buildings.  That is a powerful piece of information.  What would the position have been if legislation, CO2 monitors or HEPA filters had been in place in those 400 buildings?  I am not saying by any means that none of those people would have died.  I am also not saying, nor can I prove, that a majority of those people would not have died but it is reasonable to say that a significant number of those people would not have lost their lives had those safety measures been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy brought another piece of information to the discussion which is also worth pausing to think about.  He pointed out that there is legislation in this country to regularise and standardise air conditions and levels of air safety and pollution in chicken coops.  However, we do not have such legislation for buildings where people go and spend their working lives.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith raised the point of parents voluntarily clubbing in to buy HEPA filters for their children's schools.  That attitude can only be admired but it should not be necessary for them to do that.<\/p> <p>I am also aware of a situation where parents in private fee-paying schools have clubbed together to pay for HEPA filters.  In the majority of schools, parents may not be in a position financially to make sacrifices of that kind.  Therefore, we have a two-tier education system and a two-tier society where some kids get treated better than other kids.  That is not right and that is not the way that it should be. <\/p> <p> An online survey asked employers about their experience of Covid-19 inspections.  People had four options to choose from on the way in which Covid-19 inspectors had dealt with the question of ventilation and safety when inspecting their workplace.  Some 37% said that they had not inspected the ventilation at all, 15% said that they had done it a bit, 2% said that they had done it in detail and 46% said, &ldquo;What inspections?&rdquo;  That is a survey of 117 employers and it is online, but I do not take that as gospel.  It is a straw in the wind, but it does indicate something.  I am not surprised by it, given the tone that has been set by the Government about the relative importance of air pollution and air safety when dealing with an airborne disease.  The point has been made by some people contributing to this debate outside of this House that expenditure on improving air quality is money well spent, because when Covid-19 is behind us, that will still have a use.  It will stand to us.  It will be of benefit into the dim and distant future.  A total of 2.3 million people die globally every year from indoor air pollution.  It is a good investment to invest in HEPA filters and other measures that improve air quality indoors.<\/p> <p> I understand that the Government has indicated that it will not oppose the Bill and that the Bill will pass through the D&aacute;il.  I ask the Minister of State for clarification on that.  If that is the position, something flows from that.  The Government cannot allow a Bill calling for improved workplace ventilation in the middle of a global pandemic pass through the D&aacute;il and then return to the issue in six, 12 or 18 months.  If the Bill goes to Committee Stage, it must be dealt with in committee as a matter of urgency, priority and brought to the top of the agenda.  It would be cynicism of the most extreme kind, which this Government is well capable of, but we are talking about life and death here - if the Bill was allowed to pass so that the Government does not look bad by opposing a workplace ventilation Bill, supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and I imagine pretty much every working person in this country, in order to shunt it off to a committee with an instruction to its Government committee members to kick it around and not let it go any further because the Government does not want this to progress any further.  The Government has done this with so many other Bills.  It cannot do that with this Bill.  This is a matter of life and death.  It is an urgent issue.  If it passes this Stage, let it go to Committee Stage and be put to the top of the agenda immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100009#G00200","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354120,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Paul Murphy and his colleagues for introducing the legislation.  The Government is not opposing the Bill, which seeks to amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to provide for a definition of sufficient fresh air bases on CO<sub>2<\/sub>levels in the workplace as an emergency Covid-19 prevention measure.  The Government supports the principle behind the Bill and it will work with all involved on it.<\/p><p>Existing occupational safety and health legislation already creates a requirement for employers to ensure that sufficient fresh air ventilation is provided in enclosed places of work.  It is acknowledged that close-range transmission can cause Covid-19 infection and that is why it is essential to adhere to public health advice on vaccination, physical distancing, wearing masks and coverings, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and, importantly, staying at home if one has any symptoms of Covid-19 or are feeling unwell.  <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s expert group on ventilation, in its second report published in March 2021, concluded that ventilation is an important factor in reducing the risk of transmission of Covid-19 particularly in enclosed places.  Providing fresh air through ventilation and air filtration measures where necessary can provide practical and effective ways to facilitate clean air in enclosed workplaces.  The objective of this proposed amendment is to put an additional focus on the importance of ventilation in workplaces, especially in the context of mitigating against the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace.  <\/p><p>From the outset, the Government has committed itself to protecting workers from Covid-19.  The development of the work safely protocol and the ongoing updating of it has been carried out as a partnership between Government, employer representatives and employee representatives in conjunction with key State agencies such as the HSE, the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, the Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as well as my own Department.<\/p><p>The work safely protocol sets out the most up-to-date public health advice and measures to be taken in workplaces to prevent and to minimise the spread of Covid-19.  The protocol has a specific section on ventilation that includes guidance on how to increase ventilation and on how to use CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors to identify poorly ventilated enclosed areas.  Many businesses and workplaces are already using these devices to identify poorly ventilated areas, but it should be stressed that a CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitor is simply a proxy for measurements of air circulation.  It does not detect Covid-19.  <\/p><p>While the Government can accept the principle underpinning the Bill, certain legal and practical aspects of it will require greater consideration between now and Committee Stage.  I am happy to engage with Deputy Paul Murphy and his colleagues on that as well.  I will touch on these briefly.  On the legal considerations, legal advice will be needed as to which part of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 is the most appropriate to amend.  My officials have advised that it may be possible to achieve a speedier amendment by way of amending the section on ventilation in the general application regulations under the Act  This will also enable further amendments made as necessary and could be a vehicle for introducing a more long-term focused approach on ventilation across our workplaces.<\/p><p>In the area of potentially unintended consequences, again I stress that Government supports the principle and objective of the Bill.  However, some proposals require further practical consideration.  With regard to the use of enforcement measures, such as improvement notices and prohibition notices, such measures are provided for under the 2005 Act and enforcement under the Act should be in line with an existing approach to occupational safety and health and, indeed, with the approach currently being taken to inspections of the work safely protocol.  <\/p><p>The Bill, as currently drafted, is overly prescriptive.  It might not be practical to use primary legislation to deal with every place of work.  We believe that could be achieved in regulations.  Workplaces in various sectors differ greatly from each other.  The impact of CO<sub>2<\/sub>readings would have to be judged in the context of different workplaces with different workforces at different times.  The Government&rsquo;s expert group on ventilation also did not recommend the use of CO<sub>2<\/sub>measurements as an indicator of ventilation when there are CO<sub>2<\/sub>sources, other than people, present in the workplace.  An example of this would be a kitchen setting or a setting where HEPA air filtration is in use.<\/p><p>The approach in the Bill, as currently drafted, particularly the prescriptive limit value suggested, could lead to unnecessary closures of workplaces based on a high CO<sub>2<\/sub>reading, especially where those workplaces operate in older buildings, such as schools, hospitals, etc, even when other mitigating measures are in place.  It is also important not to create the impression or the expectation among workers that a particular CO<sub>2<\/sub>reading is the only or the main factor in mitigating against the spread of Covid-19 in a workplace.  It has to be judged in the context of the nature of the workplace and other factors, including the infection prevention and control measures in place.  The measurement of CO<sub>2<\/sub>levels has been recommended by the Government&rsquo;s expert group on ventilation as an effective method for identifying poorly ventilated multi-occupant and enclosed indoor areas.  The work safely protocol sets out how these monitors should be used in the workplace.  It is clear, however, that a high CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitor reading is not a proxy for the risk of exposure to Covid-19 but rather for identifying poor ventilation.  It is important that this is fully appreciated by those reading CO<sub>2<\/sub>levels as well as the fact that other sources of CO<sub>2<\/sub>can legitimately exist in certain workplaces.  <\/p><p>The legislation does not provide for a HSA inspector to form an opinion as to whether an indoor workplace location has adequate ventilation.  This will cause difficulties when other sources of CO<sub>2<\/sub>exist from workplace activities.  The Bill as drafted is well-intentioned, but it will need some re-drafting to ensure  it does not inadvertently deter employers and businesses from incorporating Covid-19 mitigations into their overall workplace risk assessment policies and practices.<\/p> <p>Ventilation in workplaces needs to be looked at beyond Covid-19, as said by Deputy Barry and others already.  This is an opportunity to put in place measures to bring about a longer term, sustainable and holistic approach to workplace ventilation.  Workplace is required and I would strongly argue that this flexibility can be found in regulations as opposed to primary legislation.<\/p> <p> Regarding the role of inspection bodies and the Health and Safety Authority, although the Bill might appear to offer a pragmatic approach, I am sure the Deputy will recognise that it is not possible for every single inspectorate to monitor every workplace or carbon dioxide monitor in the country.  While I want to ensure the objective of the Bill can be delivered in an effective and efficient way, I also want to avoid creating an unbalanced burden on the Health and Safety Authority to the detriment of its other work areas.  Given the sheer number of workplaces covered by this proposed legislation, care will be needed in determining it will work in practice so that only the most high-risk settings in the case of breaches require an on-site inspection.  We can work through that with the Deputy and address the regulations.<\/p> <p> The Government supports the objective of this Bill.  I assure the Deputy that my officials and I will work with him to determine the best approach to achieve these objectives.  My officials will engage with the Health and Safety Authority to determine the best mechanisms to deliver the objectives of the Bill, including carrying out inspections and compliance checks across workplaces to determine the potential impact on the Health and Safety Authority and how impacts can be addressed.  Officials from the Health and Safety Authority and my Department would like the opportunity to meet Deputy Paul Murphy prior to Committee Stage to discuss the Bill and how its objectives can be achieved speedily and implemented in an effective and practical way.  I hope the Deputy takes that as a commitment to genuinely work with him on this.  It is not a case of sending it to the committee and setting it to one side.  We believe it is worth working through this legislation to get it right and to maybe focus on regulations as a quicker way to do it.  I will contact the Deputy this afternoon to organise that and to move this forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100010#H00300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354720,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I am glad the Government is not opposing our Bill on ventilation and the need for clean air in workplaces, but we need more than that.  We need critical urgency in taking on this issue and legislating for a proper level of ventilation, air filtration and clean air standards.  There are two ways to respond to a pandemic.  It is understandable when we are facing a new situation that there are many knee-jerk responses, we do not quite know what we are dealing with, and emergency measures taken at short notice are inevitable.  We are two years into the pandemic and we have learned a lot.  Critically, we now know that this is an airborne disease.  The question of how we prevent the transmission of Covid-19 through the air is critical.  To put it in stark and simple terms, unless we address that, we are not going to bring this pandemic to an end.  The doom loop of restrictions, widespread illness and the threat of our hospitals being overrun will continue.<\/p>  <p>  The facts are stark.  I commend Orla Hegarty for pulling together the facts about this and championing the arguments.  She puts it starkly when she says that, given that we now know that this is an airborne disease, the way to tackle it is not about what individuals do but about what happens in buildings.  There is a stark concentration of superspreading events in particular types of buildings.  More than half of the people who died as a result of Covid-19 were infected in just 0.3% of buildings.  That is really stark.  That allows us to target our approach to dealing with the virus, if we absorb the significance of that fact.  Other facts further corroborate this point.  Half of workplace outbreaks have been in just 150 buildings.  Infection in overcrowded private homes is twice the rate of in uncrowded homes.<\/p>  <p>  One in four school buildings has had a Covid-19 index case in the past four months.  That nails the ridiculous lie that the Government persisted with, as Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and others said, that schools were not a vector for Covid transmission.  It was ridiculous and everybody knew it.  We knew that overcrowded spaces of any kind were places where transmission was taking place, yet the Government persisted with this nonsense.  There now has been a swing to the opposite end of the spectrum where all the burden of trying to address the crisis is being loaded onto the schools.  It is all about the schools now.  It was apparently not happening in schools at all before and now it is all about the schools.  I support the idea that children should wear masks.  However, I do not think it is sensible to talk about excluding kids from school, if they are distressed by that, have not been fully convinced, do not fully understand, or are caught between parents and the school when their parents are resistant.  I would drop any discussion of excluding kids from school and putting that on teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Now we have finally admitted that schools are a setting in which the virus transmits and is likely to transmit, for the obvious reasons.  There are large numbers of people in overcrowded buildings.  Many of them are poor quality buildings and, disgracefully, many are prefabricated units.  They are some of the most overcrowded classrooms in Europe.  Is it a surprise that airborne disease is likely to transmit in those kinds of environments?  Of course it is not.<\/p>  <p>  It happens in other similar environments, often in the face of Government denial for a long time.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has just given me some facts she got from Orla Hegarty last night, which underline this.  There is currently a meat plant outbreak with 240 cases of infections, as there have been throughout the pandemic.  They are closed, overcrowded environments with poor ventilation.  There are currently 52 nursing home outbreaks.  One home has 64 infections.  Fifty-three children have been hospitalised in the past two weeks, a number which has more than doubled in one month.  Cases among children are 20 times what they were last year.  It is all happening in certain types of buildings which are overcrowded, have poor ventilation, no air filtration, and so on.  Orla Hegarty points out that in 1918, during the Spanish flu, Chicago suppressed the pandemic by making ventilation a condition of trading in workplaces, during a terrible pandemic that claimed 30 million lives globally.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy's analogy is absolutely right.  He stated that addressing the lack of clean water was critical to wiping out certain types of disease.  Even here in Ireland, tuberculosis was addressed by the regulation, to some degree, of overcrowded in housing.  Tuberculosis was rampant in overcrowded conditions, in other words, among the poor in overcrowded, poor quality housing.  Is what needs to be done, how urgent it is, and that we have the science to do it starting to get through to the Government?<\/p> <p>It is not just about what the health professionals say.  If it is in certain types of buildings with poor ventilation, air filtration and so on, we need to listen to the people who know about buildings.  It is about how to manage the transmission of air within buildings and there are people who know this - people like architects, people like Orla Hegarty and people who have developed air filtration systems that can filter the molecules that carry Covid-19.<\/p> <p> Against that background, what the Minister said last night on television was simply unbelievable.  He was asked why HEPA filters should not be put in schools.  They are not very expensive.  We could put them in every single school in the country for &euro;12 million.  Germany has spent &euro;200 million on HEPA filters.  He said \"No\", because of what our advice is telling us.  I do not know what exactly his advice is telling him but he said that we are not doing it.  We will instead open the windows in the midst of winter.  Some of the stuff that was sent out by the Minister for Education on ventilation and opening windows in the depths of winter is unbelievable.  One piece of advice stated that if it was really cold, teachers should open the window slightly near where the radiator is.  Our kids have a choice between freezing in the cold or getting Covid-19 in overcrowded situations.<\/p> <p> This is not directly to do with air filtration and ventilation, but added to this issue is the failure to maintain contact tracing in schools.  That is, of course, linked to the understaffing and resourcing of public health teams to follow it up.  That is why the Government did not do continue with contact tracing.  It had nothing to do with any public health advice.  It was because we do not have proper public health teams to follow up.  We also do not have temperature checks.  Why are there not temperature checks in schools?  When you go to certain radio stations in this city to do interviews, there are temperature checks on the way in.  Why do we not have them in schools?  Critically, why do we not deal with overcrowding in schools?<\/p> <p> Healthcare and hospitals are the other big issue.  One of the worst hit groups are healthcare workers, who we need to combat this pandemic, and it is precisely because many of our hospital buildings are poorly ventilated and old.  They need refurbishment.  Our healthcare workers do not have proper protection.  I hope the Minister for Health gets the message and progresses this Bill as soon as possible because if we do not address this issue we will not get on top of Covid-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100011#J00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638355320,"counter":60,"content":"<p>The issue of adequate ventilation in the workplace is extremely important.  I thank Solidarity-People Before Profit for bringing this legislation forward.  The Bill aims to give workers the right to request an inspection of their workplace by the HSA to verify sufficient levels of fresh air.  I have no doubt that the right to clean air would be viewed by most people as a fair and reasonable right that should be afforded to every worker.  It is not always possible to achieve this with open windows and doors.  In Belmullet last Friday, I could not physically open my front door due to the storm.  What are schools and workplaces supposed to do in that situation?  It is bonkers.<\/p><p>A similar approach has already been taken in Belgium, where a minimum standard for air quality is set.  This was proposed in 2019, prior to the Covid outbreak.  Workers should have the right to expect that the air in their place of work is clean.  This has taken on new meaning and significance with the onset of the pandemic.  We have known for over a year that Covid is an airborne virus and that clean air is crucial in preventing its spread.  This has made measures such as ventilation and air filtration crucial in any serious attempt to tackle transmission.  I remember the importance of ventilation being discussed in this House as far back as September 2020 in relation to the safety of workers in meat processing plants.<\/p><p>There is a lot I could say about schools.  This is also an issue in third level institutions and right through our education system.  I commend those who have done everything in their power to keep schools open and as safe as possible.  It is atrocious that, even at this stage, the Government is still not admitting fully that Covid is transmitted in schools.  I was reminded this morning of exactly this time last year and the issue with Claremorris Boys National School.  There was a dogmatic approach by the Minister for Education and the Department in castigating the school and its board of management because there were high Covid levels within the school and they needed to close for their own safety.  This is symptomatic of the relationship between the Minister, the Department and the boards of management of the schools.  It is not right that parents and teachers are treated with such disrespect.  Now there are nine-year-olds on the battleground of Covid.  This did not happen by accident.  This is happening because the Government has been reactive and in denial of the situation within schools.<\/p><p>I will read out a letter from Ellen.  She says:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... I'm a student at [I will not say what the college is].  In college the policy is to leave doors and windows open during the lessons for covid prevention.  While this is sound in theory, in practice it is preventing myself and other students from learning.<br \/><br \/>I have an autoimmune condition and am autistic.  I'm often painfully cold in class and cannot focus.  I'm an art student and my hands are so cold that I often can no longer hold my pencil and have to leave class to go to buy a cup of tea to warm up.  It is nearly December and it is freezing.  Often my classmates and I are shivering and have to wear coats, hats or gloves in class.<br \/><br \/>Leaving the doors open means that we have the noise of outside where the children of [the school next door] are screaming and shouting, and the noise of students and cleaners in the hallways.  This makes it impossible for autistic students like myself to focus in class.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately the college doesn't have sufficient heating in all classrooms, especially the old buildings to combat this.  This is not unique to [my school], a lot of schools in Ireland are in old, hard to heat buildings.  The teachers cannot close doors or windows as if a classmate tests positive for covid they must do a report and disclose if the doors and windows were open in the classroom.<br \/><br \/>It seems there is nothing that the college can do, as the policy of leaving doors and windows open even in winter is in your hands.<br \/><br \/>The cases may be going up but the temperatures are going down.  This policy needs to be re-examined as my right to education and the rights of other students who are ill or likewise disabled are being taken away. <br \/><br \/>I urge you to reconsider this policy and give me back my right to an education. <\/blockquote>  <p>That is from an autistic young person who is telling it exactly how it is.

It has resulted in major reliance on video calls and remote working, but there are workplaces for which other measures are needed to work safely.  Ventilation and clean air is a key factor in ensuring the ability to work safely in this time of Covid.  Our schools are an example of this.  Many schools are too old to allow for significant ventilation or for various reasons opening windows may not be a ready option.  Since the onset of this pandemic last year, we have been asking the Minister for Education to address the need for ventilation and clean air in our schools.  Instead of taking the steps needed to adequately address this, children were sent back into school with no mitigation measures, no filtration in classrooms and contact tracing has since ended.  Cases of Covid have now increased significantly in schools and since contact tracing was stopped the level of infection has more then trebled among primary school age children.  Overnight, schools have gone from being so safe that contact tracing was not needed to needing children to wear masks to keep safe.<\/p>  <p>  When we appealed for ventilation measures for schools, the response from the Government was largely to open windows and not to invest in HEPA filtration.  HEPA filters actively remove contaminants from the air, while the CO2 monitors that the Minister has given us reassurances about only monitor the quality of air.  They do not improve it.  Now we hear of instances of kids sitting in freezing cold classrooms where they can neither stay comfortable nor concentrate effectively on their lessons.  There is no need for this.  It is just the result of a penny-pinching measure that lets down our children and teachers.  It dismisses the recommendation of the Government's expert group on ventilation, which in March stated that these devices \"may be useful in reducing airborne transmission in spaces with insufficient ventilation.\"  The Minister for Health must act now.  If he wants to keep our schools functioning, the time for dithering and indecision has passed.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is not confined to schools alone, however.

This morning, I received an email and a photograph from a school which proudly announced that the parents have bought a filtration system for every single class in the school.  However, there is another school in my area that does not have a single filtration system.  Some parents are buying them for single classrooms.  That is not what we need in society.  A two-tier education system is being created.  It has always been such a system and that needs to end.  I urge the Minister to go to his colleagues who are in charge of education and demand that these filtration systems be installed.  We already have the costings.  We know other countries are doing this.  It is important it is done for children and staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100013#L00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1638355920,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I will take a slightly different angle on this issue.

I urge it to take the common-sense approach and get HEPA filters into classrooms.  Let us close school windows again.  Please God, let us preserve everything and go back to a small bit of normality.  There are many young children who will not have the capability to wear a mask because of a medical condition.  That will cause additional strain.

The Government was asleep during the summer and for the past six months when filters and CO2 monitors should have been put in.  The whole area of area filtration in schools should have been tackled.  For 12 months we were told schools were safe, but then at 6 p.m. yesterday evening we were told that, by this morning, every child would need to wear a face mask.  Where is the consultation with unions and parents?  Every parent wants to ensure the safety of his or her child and for the child to be able to attend school, but the Government has done nothing for the past 12 months to ensure schools are made safe.  It is talking about personal responsibility, but where is the responsibility of the Government?

All present are aware of the current waiting times for testing and getting the results back.  Ordinary people cannot afford to be down two, three or four days' wages while waiting on results.  If we want to keep workplaces safe, we need people to self-isolate while awaiting a test or results and they will only do that if they can afford it.  Many people cannot afford to go without their wages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100013#L00400","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1638355920,"counter":66,"content":"<p>At its core, the Bill will give workers the right to fresh air and require employers to ensure proper ventilation is in place to enforceable standards to help in the ongoing fight against Covid.  We have known for more than a year that Covid is an airborne virus and that clean air is crucial in preventing its spread, making measures such as ventilation and air filtration critical.  This is of extreme importance currently in school communities but the response of the Minister, Deputy Foley, and her Department to ventilation has, at best, been sluggish.  It is now crunch time when it comes to schools.  Sinn F&eacute;in is calling on the Minister to act urgently to provide HEPA filtration devices in every classroom that requires them.  The Minister has dithered and delayed on ventilation for too long and that must end now.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of CO2 monitors is not sufficient to ensure clean air in classrooms.  Monitoring the air quality is not good enough.  Many classrooms do not have adequate ventilation and some classrooms do not even have windows.  Children and teaching staff are freezing in their classrooms, wearing hats and scarves and now masks during the school day while windows are open in an effort to keep them safe.  It should not be like this.  It does not have to be like this.  HEPA filtration has a key role to play in ensuring classrooms have clean air because they actively remove contaminants from the air.  The Minister keeps telling us she wants schools to be kept open and functioning well, but she has to be willing to do what it takes to make that happen.  She has to be willing to put money where her mouth is, and that means HEPA filters in classrooms.  We hear this new mantra of \"suites of public health measures\", but in reality what we are seeing is more slapdash lack of leadership in schools and principals operating in a vacuum while parents are at their wits' end.<\/p> <p>It truly seems remarkable that we are in this House today debating the introduction of legislation that relates to common sense when most of all, and this truly strikes me, we see the Government parties' failure again and again to deal with the most obvious during this pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100013#L00500","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638356520,"counter":68,"content":"<p>We all hoped that we would not be in this space but, to use that terrible term, we are where we are.  We cannot do anything about the past mistakes.  I think it is fair enough to hold the Government accountable and say that opportunities were missed.  There has been probably some fly commentary on ventilation.  We all know at this stage what the European and the US centres for disease control have said.  We know NPHET's expert group on ventilation has spoken about the necessity and the requirement, and that what we basically need at this point in time is HEPA ventilation systems.  We just need filtration and ventilation as best as can be done.  We know that CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors do not do the business required.  They are a simple test.  The fact is we do not even have the roll-out of them that was required.  These are the small things.  These are the tools.

Why should they?  They are just getting on with their lives and just want a clear message, but it is beyond that.  We know the situation we are in now.  We need the Government to step up to the mark because we have this scenario concerning guidelines around events that people need to think about going to.  We already know there is an impact on certain businesses, if we are talking about taxi drivers.  We are talking about this as we see reductions in the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  We know the difficulties around the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  All of this needs to be revisited.<\/p><p>If we are going to be serious, then we need to play our part around the TRIPS waiver.

It is very timely but it is not the first time the Deputy has brought up this matter.  In fact, if memory services me correctly, this matter was brought up as far back as the Covid committee, which was summer of 2020.  This is something, therefore, that group has pushed for for a long time.  The reason they and others have done so is because this is a real measure that will help reduce and suppress the transmission of this virus.  It is not a reactive or panicked measure.  It is a forward-looking proactive measure that will help, if implemented in schools, workplaces, public buildings and buildings used by the public, to reduce and suppress the virus.  The measure will also have the longer term effect of improving the air quality inside buildings and prevent the transmission of other viruses.  At home we can open our windows as and when we wish.  If we are heading to a shop, we can get a draught through the house or whatever we want.  We do not have that luxury in businesses, workplaces and schools.<\/p>  <p>  We know where we are at with schools at the moment, and Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in will speak in more detail about that.  We have kids who are freezing cold, wearing their coats and masks but the windows are open.  It is bizarre.  We do not want to sit here criticising Government policy just because we are in Opposition, but it is hard not to criticise something so bloody ludicrous when we have, and have spoken about, a potential solution for nearly a year and a half.<\/p>  <p>  HEPA filters work.  Let us consider an environment where HEPA filters have been used for many years.  There is no more contained and enclosed environment than aeroplanes and they have used HEPA filters for years.  In all studies that have been done on the spread of this virus, and I am not talking about travel or anything like that, the risk of being on an aeroplane and spreading the virus is very low because of the use of HEPA filters, yet we are not putting them in schools where our children are learning.  We are not putting them in businesses.  We are not putting them in venues where the arts community is able to work.  Why?  Because this Government continues to take a reactive panicked approach.  It continues to hope that every wave is going to be the last even though the WHO has said this pandemic is going to be here until 2023 and we need to put in place long-term measures to pandemic-proof, as best as possible, our society to protect the health service, protect our children in school, protect workers and protect society.  The reason the temperature of anger in Opposition is getting so high is because we have been putting forward practical solutions such as this for a long time that would have benefits far beyond this pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to health and safety inspectors, if we go back to the spread of the virus in meat plants in the summer of 2020 and indeed beyond that, we know we do not have enough health and safety inspectors.  We need to resource the Health and Safety Authority to ensure we have inspectors who are able to monitor workplaces, schools and public buildings in terms of the measures proposed in this Bill.  This is good public health policy.  This is not radical stuff.  This is proven good public health policy, so it beggars belief as to why it has not been done.  As we have heard, money is not an object here.  This is political will and that is why we are so angry.  We fully support this Bill.  This is a very good Bill and it has our support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100014#M00400","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1638356520,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I am beginning to think that the new phrase in political circles, which is not opposing the Bill, feels a bit like you can go and talk to the cat because it has pretty much the same effect.  The frustration we have on the Opposition benches is we have spent the past 18 months trying to bring forward practical solutions to benefit workers and people in society and to fill the gaps and fault lines that Covid has exposed.  I am talking of basic protections for workers and young workers who have been asked to work from home and the protections they need.  Sick pay is a basic provision in almost every other European country, yet we still struggle to grapple with such pay.  I believe the Government's recommendation is that 7% of a person's wages would be covered by sick pay, which for a minimum wage worker would not even cover on a daily basis the price of going to a GP to get a certificate.<\/p>  <p>  Now we have this recommendation in terms of legislation from the Opposition.  Again, it is a basic provision in the fight against Covid.  Schools have been mentioned and we had a debate with the Minister for Education this morning as to why people like Professor Orla Hegarty are not being listened to when she says it would cost &euro;12 million to install a HEPA filter in every primary school class in the country.  Yet, when it comes to Government, it seems as if, when it gets advice or a recommendation from the Opposition, it has to deal with it with a mindset of scorn and not being open-minded enough to work on this together.  When we asked about antigen testing and when Professor Mark Ferguson said last May that it should be introduced in primary and second level schools, the Government sat on it for six months.  Meanwhile the Government has repeatedly told us schools are safe until NPHET told us last week it never said that in the first place.  Then the Government gave schools 16 hours to implement a mask-wearing measure for third class and up.  Meanwhile, as my colleague has said, children are sitting in classrooms wearing coats, scarves, hats and gloves with the windows open and what Professor Orla Hegarty is saying seems to be irrelevant.  When practical and goodwill legislation is brought in to protect workers, we get the not opposed line from Government, which has the same legal basis as saying you can talk to the cat.<\/p>  <p>  What we are trying to bring forward here is a practical suggestion from the Opposition as to what is actually happening on the ground because we want to be part of the solution.<\/p>  <p>We want to drive leadership in our own communities.  We want to assure everybody that there is hope, that we can get through this and that things are not disimproving out of control.  That is the level of anxiety every public representative must deal with day to day.  What the Government sometimes throws back at us is that we are not putting on the green jersey or we are not part of the same team.  That is deeply insulting to those of us who are dealing on a day-to-day basis with people who are losing hope, who are cracking up and who are now facing into what they think is going to be a very difficult December, Christmastime and January.  This is particularly so as yesterday the Taoiseach was again very unwise in his words on school opening in January.  Meanwhile, basic supports such as the EWSS and the PUP are being cut.  I ask the Minister of State to take advice from the Opposition in good faith, to stop using this line about not opposing and to embrace what we are trying to achieve here to protect workers in their workplaces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100014#M00500","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638357120,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill and commend Solidarity-People Before Profit Deputies on the work they have put into it.  They have been strong campaigners on the issue of ventilation almost from the start, as many of us have also been.  That is all the more reason it is impossible to understand the Government's attitude to ventilation and its central role in combating Covid.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is a very practical one.  It does three main things.  It provides a definition of fresh air based on CO2 levels in workplaces.  It provides for health and safety inspections based on CO2 measurements and provides for improvement or prohibition notices.  It also allows employees to request inspections.  They are very basic provisions to safeguard workers but also to safeguard us all by ensuring workplaces are safer places.  We have known for a very long time that Covid is an airborne virus.  For that reason, we need to put a clear focus on ensuring air is made as clean as possible in all kinds of settings.  That should be the advice for people in their own homes, in workplaces and especially in schools.  There is no question but that we are paying a very high price, or more accurately, children in Ireland are paying a very high price, for the fact that the issue of ventilation has been largely ignored in schools.  It is impossible to understand the reason for this.<\/p>  <p>  A NPHET subgroup that was set up at the end of last year, comprising very eminent people with scientific and public health expertise, was asked to look at the whole issue of ventilation and the steps that could be taken to achieve cleaner air and address the issue of the airborne virus.  In January of this year, the subgroup produced quite an extensive report which set out very clear recommendation that were unambiguous about the need to measure the cleanliness of the air based on CO2 readings and to follow through on putting in place mitigating measures to clean that air.  It was very sensible, straightforward and practical.  That report went to NPHET and there was essentially no response to it.  The subgroup continued meeting and in March produced its second report.  It again came to very clear conclusions and made very practical recommendations.  It stated that ventilation is an important factor in reducing the risk of long-term airborne transmission of Covid and that it reduces the risk of superspreading events, of which we have had many.  It stated ventilation is part of a layered strategy to reduce transmission.<\/p>  <p>  It is annoying that when we raise issues like ventilation, standards for mask-wearing or antigen tests, the Government's response is always that ventilation is not a silver bullet.  Nobody is saying it is.  It is one of a number of tools that should be used.  It just does not make sense; it is pure stupid not to use all the tools available to us.  That is why it is so hard to understand how the Government has been so negligent on the issue of ventilation.  The subgroup's report also talked about how measurements of CO2 levels in indoor air are the most effective method of identifying inadequate ventilation and how stand-alone HEPA filter devices can be and are useful in ensuring we have clean air in indoor settings.  The subgroup called for guidelines and sectoral advice based on its expert examination of this issue.  It also called for improvements in ventilation and indoor air quality in general because these make a very positive contribution to improving people's health and well-being anyway.  Again, this is especially the case in school settings where there are so many different infections and viruses floating around.  It is a common thing for young children in particular to be out sick on a regular basis.  We also have a very high level of asthma in this country.  Thus, in general and in normal times it makes sense to have air filters in our classrooms and that is why it would be such a good investment to do that.  We have been told it would be possible to do that at a very small outlay.  It has been estimated at about &euro;12 million.  Even if it is more than that, it makes absolute sense to do it.  When you consider this in the context of the billions upon billions the country is spending in response to Covid, why is the Government not doing the sensible and practical things that can make such a difference?<\/p>  <p>  By the time of the second report from the expert group, the Government had decided that a senior officials group would be established and that there would be wider consideration of issues relating to Covid by that group rather than NPHET.  Thus the second report went to the senior officials group.  Again, there was no response whatsoever to that apart from minor things about CO2 monitors in classrooms.  I ask Deputies to look at how long it took to put those in place.  They were not ready for the return of school in September, 18 months after the start of the pandemic, and even then many of them were faulty.  The Government was given clear advice, as was NPHET, by people who know about these things.  There is not that kind of expertise in NPHET and that must be recognised.  Having got that expert advice on two occasions very clearly in the first quarter of this year, the Government proceeded to ignore it and as I said, we are paying a very big price for that.<\/p>  <p>  The analogy made with the virus in the air is that it is very similar to what happens when somebody is in a room smoking - the smell of the smoke goes all around the room or all around the building.  You must get clean air in to remove that.  That is the simple analogy and the message that has been sent out, certainly in the UK.  There is NHS messaging that explains that to people.  Why are we not doing that?  The key issues are the enforcement of good air quality, the need to set standards for CO2 monitors and air purifiers and the importance of clear public health advice.  We have had none of those so far.  I do not know why the Government is ignoring the level of clear advice from international agencies such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  I welcome this Bill and support it wholeheartedly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100015#N00200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1638357120,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank Solidarity-People Before Profit for bringing this Bill to the House.  When it comes to the Covid-19 response, we as a people wear masks, wash our hands, socially distance and abide by complete lockdowns.  We have even paid for &euro;9 meals, endured hotel quarantine, largely taken vaccinations and applied and used vaccine passports, yet we are where we are.  We need to look at other solutions rather than extending the failed ones.  We now know we have an airborne virus yet none of the focus of our Covid response has been on improving air quality or air filtration.<\/p> <p>Why do we need this legislation?  Last week, during a visit to a primary school I received an email from a primary school principal who outlined the current situation very well as follows:<\/p><blockquote>\tI just walked past fourth class sitting in a room of barely 40 sq m, windows open, radiators hopping off the wall, children wrapped up in coats, hats and scarves, the temperature in this room 13.7<sup>o <\/sup>.  Surely, we have to look at HEPA filters as a solution.  Our board of management is very eager to purchase but the cost is a major problem.  Please make representations on our behalf.  Our children are going to have a miserable experience of school if we do not act quickly.  December, January and February are going to be carnage at this rate. <\/blockquote> <p>In researching the topic of air filtration, I came across a study published on 22 September 2021.  It investigated the removal of airborne SARS-CoV-2 and other microbial bioaerosols by air filtration on Covid-19 surge units.  It is worth noting that this study has yet to be peer reviewed, but I believe its findings are worth exploring for application in both our healthcare and education settings.  The researchers conducted a crossover study of portable air filtration in sterilisation devices in a pre-purposed surge Covid ward and surge ICU.  They found that airborne SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the ward on all five days before activation of air-UV filtration, but on none of the five days where the air-UV filters were operational.  SARS-CoV-2 was again detected on four of the five days when the filter was off.  They concluded that these data demonstrate the feasibility of removing SARS-CoV-2 from the air of purposed surge wards and suggest that air filtration devices may help reduce the risk of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2.  <br\/><br\/>Given all of the money spent during the course of the Government's response to dealing with the spread of an airborne virus, surely now one obvious place to direct our attention would be the improvement of air quality.  It is but one measure of many choices not taken by this Government that could help.  In general, the Government's approach to schools has been completely hypocritical.  On 16 November, the Taoiseach said, &quot;Public health advice has been consistent from the get-go that schools are safe places.&quot;  That statement took a complete U-turn last night, just two weeks later, when the Taoiseach said, &quot;Covid in schools has gone through the roof.&quot;  Based on this alone, I believe an apology should be extended to the principal of CBS primary school in Wexford, Ms Vicky Barron, for her proactive approach and that of the board of management.  <br\/><br\/>We need to consider better alternatives to having students and teachers sitting in the freezing cold during winter, in danger of catching pneumonia, never mind Covid.  The need to introduce air filtration measures is obvious.  Why has it taken so long to reach this point?  Why are we now putting the burden of mask-wearing on small children, when the Government should instead be providing the funds to all schools and hospitals to install HEPA filtration systems so as to serve and prepare for the fifth inevitable surge of this virus in the future?  In the same way, antigen testing should also have been rolled out a long time ago.  Antigen testing should be free for everyone, in which case it could not be abused.  Yesterday, I received a message from an in-house residential carer who is spending &euro;25 per week on antigen tests.  How many will do this?  Not many.  We spent &euro;80 million plus on ventilators from which we got no benefit.  There is a benefit in rolling out antigen tests, but the Government is choosing to be pound foolish and penny wise, a decision we as a nation will live to regret.<br\/><br\/>Following on from the delay in acknowledging antigen tests and the use of them as part of the armoury to fight this virus, the Government now says that to enter the country you must have a clear PCR test 72 hours in advance and a laboratory-conducted antigen test 48 hours in advance of arrival on this island.  This morning, on the national airwaves, an assistant virologist at UCD, Dr. Gerald Barry, said that this is a pointless exercise; that it is just window dressing; that while the intention behind the antigen testing before flights is correct, the manner in which it is being done will not achieve the aim; that it is completely pointless to carry out an antigen test 48 hours in advance of travelling as a one-off test does not identify the virus; that a PCR test is probably better, but 72 hours in advance is too long a window; that there must be a greater emphasis on controlling the disease and that we need to dramatically ramp up our testing and tracing system to detect new cases and rapidly clamp down on them.  This is not new.  This has been said many times over the past 18 months on the floor of this House by many Opposition Deputies, but it is not happening.  I am pretty sure we will not hear from Dr. Barry any time soon, as has been the case with other eminent medics with alternative views.<br\/><br\/>The installation of proper filtration in schools is also not new.  The Government said it was looking into it.  Surely, it is a more effective policy and far less divisive than forcing children to wear masks all day in school, not to mention that it only applies to half of the classroom if some of those children are not yet nine years old.  Government cannot continue to say that we as a people, having returned to some semblance of normality in social interaction, are the reason we now have to endure more restrictions.  Government needs to put up its hands and admit that it was wrong to remove contact tracing in schools and wrong not to ensure that the capacity was there for test, trace and isolate as the best measure to contain the spread.  Government is wrong not to increase the ICU capacity to the level required to prevent further restrictions and lockdowns and, in being wrong, it needs the help of the people to get it right.  Following on from the announcement yesterday with regard to travel requirements, the Government needs to hold up its hands and explain why an antigen test by way of proof of a person's Covid status, as opposed to his or her vaccine status, is sufficient to gain entry into this country but not sufficient to gain entry to a restaurant or any indoor setting deemed high-risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100015#N00300","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638357720,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on this Bill.  There is no doubt that workplace ventilation is of huge importance to all at this time.  Every effort must be made to safeguard those working in largely populated workplaces.  In my view, the Government has been reactive rather than proactive on so many fronts in regard to this pandemic.  It should for once seek to be one step ahead, the proof of which would be the installation of ventilation systems in our schools, which is not addressed in this Bill.  Our classrooms are overcrowded.  Many of these classrooms are in prefabs and others are in very old rooms.  It is well known that our pupil-teacher ratio is the highest in Europe.  In classrooms the length and breadth of this country there are windows open daily and, thus, very young children are perished with the cold.  This is preventible.<\/p>  <p>  My Rural Independent Group colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, was the first to speak in the D&aacute;il early last year about a system of proper ventilation that could be cheaply fitted into every classroom in the country.

I said earlier that I welcomed the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  However, I do not see any mention in this Bill of who will pay for the increased cost of fitting these air filtration devices.  The State must take some responsibility for this.  The importance of these ventilation systems cannot be ignored.  I listened to the interview with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, on RT&Eacute;'s \"Today with Claire Byrne\" on Monday morning.  It is clear that neither he nor the HSE has bothered to read any of these studies.  The Minister said that the advice from the HSE advisory group was that ventilation filters would not work in our schools, based on research done by the HSE.  I do not know if the Minister and the HSE have really studied this.  A recent study by Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge found that there are benefits from air purification in preventing airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2.  This has been studied for some time now in education and medical settings with positive results.  The most recent study in Addenbrooke's Hospital generated first-class data which demonstrated the efficiency of air purification in reducing the spread of Covid within indoor environments.  The study is also really interesting as it aimed to determine how air purifiers stand up to real world conditions.<\/p> <p>Dr. Vilas Navapurkar, who is an ICU physician at the hospital in Cambridge, installed air purification devices in two fully occupied Covid-19 wards, a general ward and an ICU ward.  The team then chose HEPA filters which drew air through a fine mesh to capture extremely small particles known as aerosols.  Air samples were collected from the wards during the weeks when the air filters were switched on and two weeks when they were turned off.<\/p> <p> The Minister is taking advice from the HSE, which I would like to see.  Will he publish that and make it public at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100016#O00200","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638358320,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy who introduced this Bill.  I would give it a guarded welcome as it does not specifically mention ventilation in our schools nor does it mention who will pay for the increased cost of fitting these air filtration devices.  The Minister of State is acutely aware of what is involved in running a business, be it a small, medium or large-scale one.  Some Members in this House are of the view that employers can manage and pay for everything but they must also balance their books and ensure they can keep people in employment.  If the Government goes along with this measure, it would be insisting that it would have to provide funding by way of grants to all the businesses to insert these devices.<\/p>  <p>  In the limited time available, I wish to discuss what is happening with respect to ventilation in our schools.  Parents are deeply concerned.  We must remember students, be they the small youngsters in national school or the teenagers in secondary school, are perished with the cold.  They are sitting in classrooms with the windows and doors open.  We want to keep our schools open.  The phones lit up today with calls from parents who are concerned about their children having to wearing masks.  We must think about our youngsters.  The virus is an awful worry to all of us but the other health issues related to young students and children who are perished with the cold in classrooms every day are also worrying.  We must think about how we are managing their welfare at this time.  We must be very careful because this is horrendous.  The Minister of State can think back to when he was going to school and he can imagine if he had to sit in a classroom all day with no heat and a gale-force wind blowing through the school.  It is frightening.  Like every other public representative here, I have been inundated with parents contacting me to say they are very worried and angry because they are concerned for their children&rsquo;s welfare.

It is fine to talk about schools in the context of the Bill but that aspect is being used to bring the same regulations into businesses.  That is my worry.  Private businesses, the small employers, are struggling to cope with every kind of an increase in the cost of insurance and fuel to keep workplaces warm.  If such a measure were to be introduced, we need to know the cost of it and how much per square foot or square yard it would cost employers to put these measures in place.  I note the Bill includes the words \"to provide for health and safety inspectors to take CO2 measures\".  That is all fine but who will foot the bill?  Many businesses are in trouble and barely managing to carry on after the long lockdowns they have endured and are now trying to get going again.<\/p>  <p>  I support the aspect of the Bill dealing with ventilation systems for schools.  As has been said, children are cold in school at present.  The Government said schools were safe and now to top it off it is insisting children aged nine and over will have to wear masks in school.  That will be hard for many children who may have health issues.  We all remember the way it was in schools in the past.  The generation before us had to bring a sod of turf with them to keep the schools warm.  That is not needed with the heating systems in place now but the doors and the windows are open and that is not acceptable.  The Government will have to address the ventilation systems in schools.  It must take that on board and ensure children are not impacted in terms of being vulnerable to getting more bouts of flu, colds or pneumonia.  I support that part of the Bill but I need more assistance regarding what will happen or who will pay for these ventilation systems in the workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100017#P00300","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1638358320,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I will move to the Independent Group.

I thank People Before Profit and, in particular, Deputy Paul Murphy, for highlighting this very important issue.  I completely support the Workplace Ventilation (Covid-19) Bill.  In fact, I am surprised this has not been considered as a serious option prior to now.  It is hard to believe anyone would argue against the need for clean air, especially given the fact we are in the midst of a global pandemic due to an airborne virus.  We know Covid-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus.  Why then are we not putting the steps in place to reduce the risk of this?  Surely effective ventilation and clean air are an obvious solution.<\/p>  <p>  If we are going to live with this virus and establish a new normal, we need to make sure there is a low risk of transmission in our workplaces.  Employers should be responsible for creating a safe, ventilated workplace in the same way they were responsible for employee health, safety and welfare prior to the pandemic.  We need to make sure our workers are protected and feel safe and comfortable to return to work.  This is the only way we will be able to move forward and live with this virus.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that vaccines alone will not get us out of this pandemic, especially in the face of new variants.  The Government needs to stop relying on vaccination alone.  As well as that, we cannot continuously impose lockdowns forever.  It is just not sustainable.  We have been told of the importance of clean air time and again by many different experts.  It is time the Government stopped ignoring the need for ventilated workplaces and put in place enhanced regulation to ensure proper and adequate ventilation. <\/p>  <p>  The Government also needs to stop giving the public mixed messages.  The whole \"schools are safe\" or \"actually, we never said schools are safe\" mixed messaging from NPHET and the Government was a complete farce.  It was completely absurd.  We all knew that schools were not safe.  We had all seen the high transmission rates in our local schools and we brought it up time and again to constant reassurance it was not an issue, and then we are told this never happened.  It makes a joke of the whole organisation, or lack of organisation, of the whole thing.  We know there is an issue in schools but it is better to keep the schools open and that is what should have been said from day one.<\/p>  <p>  Here we are, once again, bringing to the Government's attention the need to establish a right to clean air and require employers to ensure proper ventilation and air filtration.  I hope the Government has learned from the mistakes made and will listen this time.  This Bill makes sense.  It is needed.  I sincerely hope we can rely on the Government to support it.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill would not only require employers to ventilate their workspaces but would give workers the right to seek to have their workplace inspected by the HSA.  I strongly support this as I believe it is very important workers have the option to request to have their workplaces inspected by an outside authority in order to feel truly safe in their places of work.  We need to provide enforceable standards for air quality and the HSA should be able to inspect the air quality at the request of workers.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot see any reason the Government would not support this Bill or consider introducing enhanced regulation to ensure proper ventilation, other than pride.  There can be no other logical reason apart from that it is too proud to admit it is wrong and to admit this should have been looked at a long time ago.  I see no shame in admitting you are wrong.  It is one of the bravest things you can do.  I believe this House would function much better if many of us would do that from time to time.  There is especially no shame in admitting you are wrong when human lives are potentially at risk and we have the option to protect them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100017#P00500","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1638358320,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Paul Murphy and People Before Profit for bringing this Bill before the House.  It is a practical, down-to-earth Bill that will achieve real progress.  <\/p> <p>I am pleased to hear that the Government supports the Bill in principle.  However, I hope to see real urgency in progressing it.  Earlier, the Minister of State, Deputy English, mentioned that there may be some legal difficulties with the Bill.  That may be the case but we all know that Covid waits for nobody.  Therefore, there must be immediate movement on this legislation.  This is a practical, real measure that will make a difference.  Listening to all the different speakers in the debate, it is clear that there is general agreement on that.  That is fine.  We can talk here but I will not be satisfied unless I see this Bill moving rapidly through the legislative process.<\/p> <p> My time is short and I will focus on schools.  As a former teacher, I have some idea of what is involved here.  While this Bill is for all workplaces - it is important to remember that - that is where I will focus.  One of the reasons I am doing that is because there is a real sense of urgency around schools.  Teachers did their very best to work online from home but there is overall agreement that students need to go to school.  Therefore, there is a special sense of urgency to make sure that they are safe places to work in.<\/p> <p> The Department of Education website has a guide entitled, \"Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools\".  There is a long list of instructions.  The first is: \"The over-arching approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use ...\".  They tell us when that is: \"break-times\", \"lunch-times\", etc.  Then we are told;  \"As most schools rely on the opening of windows ... it is important that windows and air vents can be accessed and opened.\"  The third recommendation is to ensure rooms are \"well ventilated before occupancy each day.\"<\/p> <p> Moving down, recommendation 7 tells us, \"In colder weather any local chilling effect can be offset by partially opening the windows nearest to and above the radiators.\"  Recommendation 8 tells us, \"It is important to make sure that air movement is not blocked by furniture or ... blinds and curtains.\"  It is in the same vein, right up to recommendation 19.  If ever I saw the Ladybird introduction to opening windows, this is it.<\/p> <p> If I were a teacher now, or a school principal or a member of the board of management, I would be tearing my hair out reading what the Department is telling me, in steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices in schools, when that is all there is in place to ensure good ventilation in classrooms for students, teachers and school staff.<\/p> <p> That is why I am so pleased to see this Bill.  Hopefully, we are finally moving from the Ladybird version of how to ventilate the schools to legislation that will help to make our schools safe places.<\/p> <p> Like every other Deputy present, I have received so many emails from parents and teachers, with parents telling me their daughters are coming home frozen and teachers telling how concerned they are, especially for those with underlying conditions.  We have a good basis for legislation here.  I would like immediate movement on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100017#P00600","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638358920,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I reiterate that the Government supports the principle, and the objectives behind this Bill.  I assure the Deputy Murphy that the Minister of State, Deputy English, and his officials, will work with him on determining the best approach to achieving its objectives.  It is important that the objectives of the Bill can be delivered in an effective and efficient way.<\/p>  <p>  Officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will also engage with the HSA to determine the best mechanisms for the delivery of the objectives of the Bill, including compliance checks across workplaces, and to determine the potential impact on the authority and how this can be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Since the arrival of Covid-19, it is clear that the vast majority of employers, business managers and employees have stepped up and implemented not only the requirements, but also in the spirit, of the work safely protocol, which sets out the public health measures to be taken in the workplace to mitigate against the spread of Covid-19.  As alluded to earlier, ventilation is covered in the protocol and Government's expert group on ventilation supports the manner in which ventilation is addressed in the protocol.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to working together to deal with Covid-19 in the workplace, the majority of employers and employees have neither been found wanting or been reluctant to embrace new measures and updated advice as time has moved on and levels of knowledge and expertise have improved.<\/p>  <p>  I would stress to Deputy Murphy that we are not starting from scratch here.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 create a requirement on employers to make sure that there is an adequate supply of fresh air - ventilation - in enclosed areas of the workplace.  The evaluation of ventilation in a workplace should form part of an overall workplace risk assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The HSA currently has enforcement powers to seek improvement in ventilation in workplaces.  In parallel with the work safely protocol, the authority has also produced a ventilation check list for employers to assist then to comply with the protocol.  The authority will also put a greater emphasis on the general provision of adequate workplace ventilation over the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  What we all need to do is to ensure is that any further enhancements in our collective approach to better workplace ventilation are carried out in a thorough, effective and streamlined manner.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I understand that officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the HSA would like an opportunity to meet with the Deputy prior to Committee Stage to discuss the Bill and how its objectives can be achieved speedily and implemented in a practical way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100018#Q00200","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1638358920,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for the contributions to the debate.  I welcome the strong support for the Bill and for taking action on the crucial issue of ventilation to prevent the spread of Covid and to give workers the right to clean air.<\/p>  <p>  I need to address some of the smaller questions that came up from Opposition Deputies first and then go to the question of the Government Members.  A number of Deputies raised the concern that schools would not be covered by the Bill.  I assure them that schools are definitely workplaces.  Teachers are not volunteers; they work.  Therefore, schools are definitely covered by the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The second question raised was about who will pay.  Of course, as Deputies will be aware, as an Opposition party we cannot bring forward a Bill that imposes any costs, either on the State or on businesses, and we are not able to outline who should pay.  However, I am happy to speak about who should pay.  Certainly, in schools and in public buildings, the State should pay.  The cost is not massive, as it is an estimated &euro;50 million to cover pubs, restaurants, schools and public buildings.  It is &euro;12 million for schools alone.  This is money that will save lives, will save health but also even save money in terms of the impact on the health service.  Second, we think that grants should be made available for small businesses to enable them to provide CO2 monitors in all pubs and restaurants where people can see them so that workers can see them as well as customers and, where necessary, HEPA filters.<\/p>  <p>  While we welcome the fact that the Government is saying it will not oppose the Bill, let us get into what that actually means.<\/p> <p>I underscore the fact that it is scandalous that, almost two years into a pandemic, an Opposition party, People Before Profit, is forced to bring forward legislation to state that workers should have the right to clean air.  That is scandalous.  The Government has stated there is already a legal requirement for sufficient fresh air.  That is true and I discussed that with the Minister of State, Deputy English, yesterday in a committee meeting.  The central point is that there is no definition of that.  There is no definition as to how many parts per million of CO2 are required.  It is, effectively, meaningless.<\/p> <p> I was a little concerned that in the final response from the Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, said that ventilation is already adequately addressed in the protocol.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, early referenced the protocol, guidance and so on.  The central problem in that regard is all of it is optional.  It is guidance; it is not mandatory.  Some of what was included by the Department of Education was wrong, in that it referred to 1,500 parts per million of CO2 rather than 900 parts per million. The crucial and central issue is that a legally binding standard of air quality is required. <\/p> <p> I discussed these issues with the senior Minister, Deputy Varadkar, who, three or four months ago, did not seem to know we had no binding legislation.  His absence from this debate is concerning and I wonder about the priority that is placed by the Government on this issue.<\/p> <p> It is clear that over the summer, the Government put all of its eggs in the vaccination basket.  Vaccination is absolutely crucial, there is no question about it, but things such as ventilation, testing and contact tracing were cut.  No serious action was taken to increase intensive care unit capacity to withstand further surges.  The Government sat back and hoped the vaccines would do all the work.  Instead of that, we need a vaccine-plus strategy, which includes vaccination, ventilation and vastly increased testing.  We need booster vaccines as soon as possible but we also must push for the lifting of the patents so the whole world can be vaccinated to lessen the chance of more and deadly variants.<\/p> <p> Ventilation is an important measure of prevention, along with hand hygiene and mask wearing.  We must also step up the use of FFP2 and other quality masks that give far more protection.  We should provide them free of charge.  Vastly increased testing, including free antigen tests, and proper backward and forward contact tracing are also crucial to help us bring the outbreaks that take place under control.<\/p> <p> I will make some points in response to the central point of the Government.  We welcome that the Government is not opposing the Bill but we have been in that situation for other Bills in the past.  We have managed to get other Bills passed on Second Stage.  The Provision of Objective Sex Education Bill is currently languishing, three or four years since it was passed on Second Stage, and nothing has happened.  Children still do not have the right to objective sex education because the religious ethos of schools can still stand in the way.  The Planning and Development (Climate Emergency Measures) (Amendment) Bill, intended to leave fossil fuels in the ground, has been blocked by a money message.  We are open to meeting with representatives of the Department.  We would be happy to do it and to consider how this can go forward.  That is not a problem.  However, we should be forgiven for having some scepticism.  We will keep the pressure on to demand that we get the change we need.  The Government often feels under pressure on an issue and decides it cannot block a Bill at this stage but finds a different way to block it.<\/p> <p> We are not precious about how this is legally implemented.  If it could be done rapidly through regulation; we would be open to that.  The bottom-line point is the necessity for legally enforceable standards for air quality that are then checked and observed, with sanctions and consequences for work places that do not meet those standards.  Those are the bottom-line points that are non-negotiable.<\/p> <p> I noted that the Minister of State, Deputy English, earlier spoke about the danger of overburdening the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  I would pose that in a different way.  The point is that the HSA is under-resourced.  I discussed that matter with the Minister yesterday and made the point that a budget 2022 expenditure report claimed that the HSA now has greatly increased staff but it was revealed in March that the HSA hired only one extra inspector in 2020 and three extra inspectors this year, giving it a total of 70 inspectors.  That is completely inadequate.  We saw the failures of that in terms of the meat plants.  We can see open outbreaks in the meat plants now.  The truth is that the amount of total funding going to the HSA has actually fallen when one takes into account income from sources other than direct funding from the Department.<\/p> <p> It is a failure of the Government not to have moved to introduce legislation on the issue of ventilation.  That has had an impact in terms of the public health messaging.  We all have been in pubs, restaurants and hotels, and on public transport, where the right things are being done in terms of hand sanitising, where there is hand sanitiser all over the place and everything is being sanitised, but none of the windows is open.  That is a real failure and the public health messaging must change.  Covid was, in general, handled disastrously in Britain.  One thing that can be said about the messaging of the NHS is that it places the correct emphasis on the issue of airborne transmission.  It has pictures and diagrams to show people how Covid hangs around and, therefore, the importance of ventilation.<\/p> <p> In some contributions, I sensed a suggestion that high-efficiency particulate absorbing, HEPA, filters are an alternative to masks or to having windows open.  It is certainly not as simple as that.  These are layered measures that must be used collectively to improve ventilation.  We are generally talking about these things happening in addition to mask-wearing but that is particularly the case when we are talking about schools, for example, and cold temperatures.  That is where the advice of the expert group came in.  The windows do not have to be open as much or for as long because the HEPA filters are there in the context of very cold weather.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Government's statement that it will not oppose this Bill.  We will try to push forward and make sure this happens as soon as possible because we cannot delay in a pandemic.  However, that is in contrast with the responses from the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, just last night on RT&Eacute;.  He continues to hold an incredible position.  He is going to follow the advice of those who are not experts on the question of ventilation.  He is going to ignore the advice of all those who are experts on the question of ventilation and is not going to act on the question of HEPA filters.  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, expert group on ventilation stated in March that HEPA filters \"may be useful in reducing airborne transmission in spaces with insufficient ventilation\".  The Department of Education, in May of this year, stated, \"Where the practical measures for the deployment of good ventilation practices have been undertaken, and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room\/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available.\"  It suggested that in such a scenario, a room-air cleaner with HEPA filter should be considered.  It seems to me there is a point about costs here.  It is a very small amount of money but the Government does not want to go there.  The consequence is that schools that can scrape together the money to put HEPA filters in place can provide them for their students and those without the money simply cannot provide them.  That is wrong.  The Government does not have to wait for Committee Stage discussions or anything else.  It could move on that tomorrow and provide HEPA filters for every classroom in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100018#Q00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638359520,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1638359520,"counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100019#R00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1638359520,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Before proceeding to Leaders' Questions, I want to remind Members and all in attendance that they are asked to exercise personal responsibility in respect of protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.

They have lived this and waited for yesterday's announcement.

We are coming up to Christmas and we thought today was going to be positive.  We thought we would be there but we are not.  For an average home there is a shortfall of &euro;45,000.

Ms Angelene Kelly from Inishowen peninsula said the cheapest quote she could get to rebuild her home is &euro;155 per square foot and estimates she will need to cover a shortfall of almost &euro;64,000 under the Government's proposals announced yesterday.  She said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am absolutely devastated, disgusted and disappointed.  I feel that our Government has just driven a final nail in the coffin for the mica homeowners.  Where did this sliding scale come out of? <\/blockquote>  <p>This is the question I have for the Taoiseach today.  Where did the sliding scale come from?  Yesterday, he said it was based on the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland, SCSI, calculator but it does not use a sliding scale.  I told the Taoiseach yesterday when we dealt with Leaders' Questions that the SCSI shows through its calculator the real cost for demolishing and rebuilding a house in the north west and it is way above what was announced by the Government yesterday.<\/p><p>Donegal County Council has told the Government that the tender price received from contractors to demolish and rebuild the first 43 houses that have come through the existing scheme is an average of &euro;150 per square foot.  That takes in all the house and not just the first 1,000 sq. ft.  The Government's proposals go nowhere near that.  This is not 100% redress; it is nowhere near it.<\/p><p>The Government must go back to the drawing board.  There are measures in yesterday's announcement that I welcome and I have no hesitation in saying that.  They have been delivered in respect of rental, storage and testing costs.

The Taoiseach might take the opportunity in his reply to confirm what he knows about this.  It is important that the House is updated immediately on this.  Obviously, it is a very serious, but not surprising, issue for us.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise the matter of the two letters issued by the Department of Education and the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, on school masks in primary schools, because there is utter confusion in relation to how this was done.  The communication process around it was nothing short of diabolical.  We support public health advice.  I have a son who is ten, a daughter who is 11 and a wife who is a primary school teacher.  This measure protects teachers and children.  I appreciate and support that.  However, for 20 months the Taoiseach has been saying that schools are safe.  It took the Government five days to make a decision on these new mask rules, but it gave schools 16 hours notice.  Last night's communications arrived after six o'clock when principals had finished.  What sort of way is that to communicate with the principals of Ireland in primary schools and boards of management, who have gone through so much over the last year and three quarters in dealing with this virus and keeping the education system going?  Surely, there should have been a communications process whereby principals and unions were engaged with, but also children were engaged with.  There is a huge difference from a developmental point of view between a nine-year-old and a 15-year-old.  This cannot just happen overnight and that is what is being asked.  I understand, despite questions from my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, the Minister of Education has now clarified that there will be a couple of days' grace.  Ultimately, this measure is mandatory, and that is fine, but the communications process around it has been frankly diabolical.<\/p>  <p>  Principals were at school gates this morning wondering what they were meant to do.  It will be the same tomorrow.  There are communication issues regarding the volume of kids who come from non-national backgrounds, for instance.  One cannot just push a light switch and think that this will operate perfectly.  It will not.  There are issues with GPs.  Their time cannot be taken up giving out exemptions for masks to kids in school.  The GPs are wrecked.  There are issues about where they will get all the masks if they have to give more masks to kids during school because I suspect they will need multiple masks during school.  Also, there are issues with mixed classes.<\/p>  <p>  The real and most important issue I want to ask the Taoiseach about is what the legal basis for this is and has he guaranteed that principals are legally protected?  If they refuse entry to a kid into school, are they legally protected by this State?  I note the pdf sent out had no signature on it and was not on headed paper.  I want to know if this is non-statutory guidance or if it has a legislative basis.  If someone rocks up to the High Court to challenge this, will the Government defend the principal, who will be the person taken to court?  This is a critical question.  The principals of Ireland are genuinely concerned about this.  I am not making this up.  They have been on to me and Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and are really concerned.  What happens if someone challenges them on this?  Are they legally protected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100021#T01200","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1638360720,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I accept what the Deputy has said in that this is a public health measure which he welcomes and accepts.  He also said that he accepts it is a requirement and that it is fine.  I accept that in good faith.  It is a public health measure.  The Chief Medical Officer and deputy Chief Medical Officer have expressed to the Government their deep concern about the very rapid increase in the incidence of Covid in five-year-olds to 11-year-olds and, critically, the parents of those children as well.  As part of the general measures to reduce community transmission and the volume of incidences in the community, this is now a measure they recommend.  It is also to protect education and our schools.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the idea of children wearing masks is not new.  The Deputy is correct in saying there are developmental differences between nine-year-olds and 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds and 15-year-olds.  Nonetheless, mask wearing has been a requirement for over 13-year-olds and has not generated any huge issues.  There may have been a legal case or two taken that did not hold up.  I do not have the details of that to hand, but I can check that and come back to the Deputy in respect of what happened at post-primary level.  Suffice to say that mask wearing has been a requirement at post-primary level for quite some time and has operated on the ground.  I would also add that there are clear directions in terms of mixed classes as to what is to happen.  In terms of the guidelines, as ever in education, school management know and will engage with their community and will be attentive to the needs of students and individual students.  Obviously, for special needs children, there will not be a requirement if it is not suitable nor should there be.  The wearing of masks could be difficult and challenging for children with special needs and for children that may have issues with masks.  There has to a be common sense, practical approach to this and I think in the main, there will be.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, we have to look at this as a collective.  There has to be a societal response.  That is how we have got through this pandemic up to now.  Where there are high incidence rates in the community, we have to take a community-wide approach to reduce the level of incidence and, for example, that is the case with vaccinations.  We now have 93.5% of those over 18 vaccinated.  Yet, one of the problems when one looks at what is happening in hospitals, 48% of Covid hospitalisationa are unvaccinated; 50% in ICU are unvaccinated; and 2% are partially vaccinated.  One can see the huge disparity.  The point I am making is that the community-based response is crucial and it also applies to mask wearing.  It is challenging and I appreciate that.  It is not something I am entirely 100% comfortable with as a person, a parent and as a former teacher.  I am very much alive to the different situations that can apply in different schools, localities, backgrounds and so on.  We have to be sensitive to all that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100021#T01300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1638360720,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Not being comfortable with it is one thing; not being legal is another.

I believe he has a couple of years on me but, like myself, he will remember the greats of the 1970s and how they would manoeuvre their opponents onto the ropes and punish them with a seemingly never-ending barrage of body blows.  Ordinary people are being punished with a seemingly never-ending barrage of financial body blows in the form of these price hikes from the energy companies.  They suffer blow after blow after blow.  This morning, there were two more.  SSE Airtricity hiked its gas and electricity prices by 9% while Pinergy hiked its by 19%.  These are the 34th and 35th energy price hikes, the 34th and 35th financial body blows from energy companies, in this year alone.  For the ordinary householder, this is a hit of approximately &euro;700 to &euro;800 for the year.  For many, it is over &euro;1,000.  For some, these price hikes represent a grave danger.  Every winter, large numbers of our people die from the cold.  Some years, it is 1,000 people.  Sometimes, it is 1,500.  It is not unknown for 2,000 people to die in this way.  The excess winter death rate for this country is consistently one of the highest in all of Europe, higher even than the rate in many colder countries such as Norway.  Those who die are far more likely to be old and to be poor.  They do not really die of the cold but of fuel poverty and an inability to afford to heat their homes in Ireland in the 21st century.<\/p>  <p>  What is the Taoiseach going to do about this?  Is he going to stand idly by and watch the likes of the ESB make profits of &euro;363 million in the first six months of this year alone while households struggle to make ends meet and old people die?  To date, the Taoiseach has done very little.  He has increased the fuel allowance by a miserable &euro;5 and promised to consider reducing the VAT rate on gas and electricity from 13.5% to 12%, which would be a miserable cut.

This is a problem across Europe and the globe.  In anticipation of that, we increased the fuel allowance and brought in a set of social protection measures in the budget that are designed to help people deal with this issue.  I said \"help\" because it does not cover it in its entirety.  We have also introduced a taxation package.  The social protection package comes to approximately &euro;550 million and the taxation package comes to in and around &euro;520 million.  This gives extra disposable income to people to deal with this issue.  We are also looking at other measures and ascertaining whether we can do more to reduce household bills, particularly household energy and electricity bills.  We recognise that this is very challenging for many families.  The budget was designed around helping people with the cost of living.  The European Central Bank is clear that it is still holding to the view that this is a temporary spike in energy prices and that prices will reduce in the first half of 2022.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to VAT, as I have illustrated before, we are not in a position to reduce VAT to 0% or anything like that, as has been suggested.  It just cannot be done because of the decisions we have already taken to opt for a lower rate of VAT on energy more generally.  Under European Union rules, our reduced rate of VAT, 13.5%, on energy cannot be reduced below 12%.  If we were to attempt to reduce the rate to, for example, 9% for a few months, the rate would revert to the standard rate of 23% afterwards because we got a derogation a long time ago in respect of the lower rate.  I know other parties have suggested that we go back to 0% but I have been informed we simply cannot under the EU frameworks we operate under with regard to VAT.  However, we are looking at other ways to see if we can reduce the impact of these current increases in energy prices on household bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100022#U01600","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1638361320,"counter":142,"content":"<p>When older people are freezing in their homes this winter, will the Taoiseach knock on the door and tell them that it is all right because the European Central Bank says the spike is only temporary?

In many circumstances, they have been unable to register a birth at all, and that means those parents are being denied the opportunity even to apply for such services as GP-visit cards, passports, baptism certificates and child benefits.  In addition, these parents are unable to include a newborn baby on any housing application, which is vital to those relying on housing assistance payment, HAP, support to pay their rent.  This situation also means that a housing application cannot be upgraded to take into account the new accommodation needed for a household.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will be aware that a family with one child is entitled to apply for a home with two bedrooms, while those with two children can apply for accommodation with three bedrooms.  What is happening now, however, is that people on the housing lists are waiting between four and six months to get registered and to get birth certificates.  In the meantime, if such families were to accept an offer of a two-bedroom house, that would mean they would end up on a transfer list and be waiting for another six or seven years, if not longer, to get suitable accommodation.  This is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  I understand and appreciate we are living in unprecedented times.  It has been difficult for everybody.  These parents of newborn babies, however, are being punished because of this situation.  As I said, they are having extreme difficulty in registering their newborn babies and are unable to register them at all in some cases, which means they are being deprived of vital State services.  In my home town of Dundalk, there are no walk-in services, and trying to contact those services is nearly impossible.  Every time my office tries to contact the services, we are greeted by a message service advising that we should expect delays, that the services are understaffed and have a high workload.  I call on the Taoiseach to rectify this situation.  Additional staff are needed to sort out this problem, and I appeal to the Taoiseach to get his Government to put new staff in these posts.<\/p>  <p>  A lady came into my office during the week who had a brand new, five-month-old baby.  The child had a rash, so she went to the GP.  The first thing the doctor asked her was if she had a birth certificate or personal public service number, PPSN, for the baby, and she said she did not.  The GP examined the child and then gave that lady a bill for &euro;60.  The Taoiseach might think that is not much money to a parent with a baby, but it is.  One thing families will do is to sacrifice everything they have for the health of their child.  This is only one example of such circumstances.  Acquiring a birth certificate must then be followed by an application for a PPSN, so this situation has a snowball effect.  With the stroke of a pen, can the Taoiseach ensure GP-visit cards are issued straight away for newborn babies or help to push the system so these families can secure birth certificates?  These are important things for families.  The Taoiseach is a family man and, as the saying goes, your health is your wealth.  Therefore, I plead with the Taoiseach to please sort out this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100023#V00300","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1638361920,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I do not know the details of the scheme, but the GP did not have to issue the &euro;60 bill immediately.  I just want to make that point.  The Deputy's overall point is correct, however.  There is a huge challenge in respect of the registration of births and deaths and getting certificates.  My understanding is there is a major problem in the greater Dublin area especially.  One third of all births and deaths occur in Dublin and the surrounding area.  Some 1,500 births require registration each month in that area.<\/p>  <p>  We are informed by the HSE, and it is the case, that the Dublin office was impacted severely by the cyberattack.  Registrations were not possible for five to six weeks during the summer in what was already an extensive and busy service.  It has not recovered sufficiently since to clear the backlog of applications for certificates.  Dublin HSE civil registration staff are working to clear the backlogs.  We are advised by the HSE that additional staff have been allocated to the registration service and staff are working weekends to deal with the backlogs.  HSE management has been requested to give priority to clearing the registration backlogs.  It has also been requested to make use of resources in other parts of the registration service to provide support in the coming weeks to ensure delays are minimised.  The HSE operates an online certificate ordering service which are all processed by the Dublin registration office.<\/p>  <p>  I fully accept there are huge challenges in this area.  We will continue to keep the pressure on in respect of increasing resources to ensure that we can get this backlog dealt with.  To be fair to the Department of Social Protection, it will be very flexible and responsive in respect of the issues concerning birth registration, remuneration, etc.  Once a child is registered, a PPSN is automatically allocated by the Department of Social Protection.  It automatically processes any payments due to parents for child benefits or related payments.  For new parents, an application for child benefit is automatically generated and issued to the mother of a child by the Department once a child's birth has been registered.  As the Deputy pointed out, that is the critical issue.  We do understand the importance of this issue and the prioritisation required in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  During the summer, because of the nature of the cyberattack and given we were dealing with criminal elements that are quite ruthless in how they approach things, I think society in general did not perhaps understand fully the impact of that cyberattack on our systems, especially on the HSE systems.  It had a particularly devastating impact on front-line services, including those in hospitals, in acute services and on those services mentioned by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100023#V00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1638361920,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I asked the Taoiseach for a definite timeline.  To be honest, most of the people who come into my office are women with children.  They are looking for help.  I became a grandfather recently again and it is a fantastic and joyous time.  However, these people coming to me are struggling and want help.  They need medical attention, a GP-visit card and the children's allowance.  These people are looking for help, but they can get nothing done until they get registered.  Then, when they have that done, they must look for a PPSN.  There always seems to be some kind of obstacle in these people's way.  I am asking the Taoiseach, given the way the situation is now, can the HSE or some other body not issue some kind of paperwork that will enable a child to be covered straight away, as soon as it is born, and to have access to a free doctor?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said that GP should not have charged &euro;60.  Is he telling me now, that if I come in to him tomorrow morning and I give him that receipt for &euro;60, he will give me the &euro;60 back so I can give that parent the &euro;60?  The detail has to be down in black and white.  You have to tell the hospitals or the doctors exactly what is happening.  It is not fair on the young girl I mentioned.  I think the young girl thought the child had meningitis.  When you see for the first time a child with a rash, the first thing that comes into your mind is that it is meningitis.  The second thing that happens is the parent goes to the doctor with the child, and the next thing is the doctor asks for &euro;60.  Maybe the doctor is entitled to ask for &euro;60, but a simple solution could be achieved with a stroke of a pen.

This research is part of a comprehensive research programme on shared island matters, involving NESC, as well as the ESRI, the Irish Research Council and other partners.<\/p><p>NESC is providing advice on just transition, including case studies and work on developing indicators.

In 2022, it will further consider practical aspects of a more proactive land management system.  It will also continue to examine housing systems that achieve affordability, inclusion and sustainability, drawing on aspects of the Irish system, including initial cost-rental projects, and international experience.<\/p><p>In 2021, NESC carried out a consultation with a range of stakeholders and experts in the context of Ireland's well-being framework.  In the coming year its work will examine the implementation of well-being frameworks, looking at international work and drawing on selected Irish work in such areas as performance and equality budgeting, and sectoral approaches in certain areas, such as children's well-being.  It will also look at how specific groups within society experience inequality.<\/p><p>The work on recovery and resilience will examine aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic to help identify strategic lessons about public governance and how Government can be supported to arrange and manage its activity to deliver the best results for society.

In fact, in the Taoiseach's remarks yesterday, he made a similar point and he was right.  The difficulty, though, is that the LEADER programme has been hollowed out in recent years.  In the 2007 to 2013 programme, the allocation to LEADER represented &euro;60 million per year.  Between 2014 and 2020, it was nearly halved to &euro;35 million per year.  The proposed funding for the next round will see, in real terms, a reduction of somewhere between 6% and 10%.  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge and accept that the LEADER programme is crucially important for regional and rural development?  There is not a community that has failed to benefit from it in recent decades.  The &euro;100 million that has been allocated to the programme needs to be &euro;300 million in order for LEADER projects to deliver the type of investment that those communities need.

One of the key Government policies was the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  I have long called for this to be turned into a permanent short-term working scheme - a call which the Government has obviously ignored.  More critically right now, cuts to the rates of payment under the EWSS come into force today.  I ask the Taoiseach to reverse that.  As I was sitting here, I received a WhatsApp message from an employer who is basically saying his business will not survive.  Last month, 25,900 employers availed of the scheme using it to supplement the wages of 290,400 workers at a cost of &euro;52.7 million.   As the Taoiseach will be aware, the restaurant and hospitality sectors are being badly hit now.  I was just sent a list through WhatsApp by a gastropub owner in my hometown of Nenagh showing details of hundreds of cancelled reservations.  It is a well-known gastropub, and the owner does not think the business will survive because he was depending on trade during the Christmas period.<\/p>  <p>  This is short-termism.  The Government needs to change tack here.  Otherwise, these businesses, particularly restaurants and those in the hospitality sector, really will go out of business.

Accessible Community Transport Southside is a charitable, not-for-profit, voluntary group that provides 1,200 door-to-door trips for people in wheelchairs and those with mobility issues.

Similarly, to actually move to a fully public healthcare system will clearly require public investment.

In that context, I requested that a specific study be undertaken by the NESC on the particular challenges faced by the Border region, North and South.  I again emphasise that the needs of the central Border area need particular attention.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit unfortunately impacted on areas such as Cavan, Monaghan and Fermanagh where our economy is very dependent on the agrifood, engineering and construction product sectors.

Let us face the reality that the Dublin-Belfast corridor would be more than capable of looking after itself.  It is the areas that have fewer advantages that need a particular focus.  The strengths, the opportunities, and the potential of the region - not just the difficulties - need to be part of a detailed analysis in planning the further development of the all-island economy and the cross-Border economy.  Without sloganeering, thankfully there has been a huge development of the all-island economy since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.

I believe we also need a debate around what is to happen to the docklands in Cork.  Last week there was announcement on the plan to develop on the South Docks. The highlighted key points were three office blocks of nine to 12 storeys high, a private hospital and apartment developments.  The last big announcement for the Port of Cork was for a 34 storey hotel, which would be Ireland's tallest building.  I described it then as a capitalist glory project, and I stand over that statement today.  In the meantime, we have the greatest housing emergency in the history of the State, there is a huge need for social housing and a huge need for affordable housing.  There is talk in relation to Cork docklands about housing targets but I would like to see specific targets for social and affordable housing.

plan was published on 1 June, and is helping to drive a sustainable recovery in economic activity and employment, while also investing in the transition towards a decarbonised and digital economy.  The plan is based on four key pillars: helping people back into work; rebuilding sustainable enterprise; a balanced and inclusive recovery; and ensuring sustainable public finances.  Good progress has been made in all these areas, with very strong increases in employment over recent months, as well as a strong performance of the public finances.<\/p>  <p>  Other significant milestones achieved under the plan, notwithstanding ongoing challenges around Covid-19, include implementation of the Pathways to Work strategy, which provides training, support and activation to help people back into work; the summer economic statement; finalisation of the Housing For All strategy with record levels of investment in social and affordable housing: the publication of the revised national development plan, allocating more than &euro;165 billion for public investment over the decade; and the new Climate Action Plan 2021, which sets out ambitious targets and measures across all sectors of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Other significant developments include a new Al strategy which was launched in July, while work is also well-advanced on a new national strategy for research and innovation.<\/p> <p>In all of these actions under the plan, the focus is on a recovery that aligns with the Government's ambitious green and digital objectives.<\/p> <p> Another key deliverable under the economic recovery plan is a well-being framework for Ireland.  This is being jointly sponsored by my Department and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance.  The first report on this was approved by Government and published in July.  It will help us to consider, understand and measure Ireland's progress more holistically through the recovery and beyond.<\/p> <p> A follow-up phase of consultation and engagement on the initial framework is currently under way. This public conversation on the well-being initiative was launched on 26 October to create awareness, gain feedback on the framework and get a broader sense of people's priorities.  Key elements of this conversation include an online survey targeting a wide audience; thematic workshops; and a large online stakeholder event, on 17 November, to which I contributed.  A Government well-being portal has also been developed alongside the CSO's interactive dashboard.  A follow-up report will be submitted to Government in early 2022, informed by this public conversation and broader ongoing work.

The committee works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of programme for Government commitments regarding housing and related matters.  The focus of recent meetings has been on progressing the Housing for All plan.  It is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of our State and contains a range of actions and measures to ensure more than 300,000 new homes are built by 2030.  This figure includes 90,000 social, 36,000 affordable purchase and 18,000 cost rental homes.  The plan includes measures to support availability of the land, workforce, funding and capacity to enable both the public and private sectors to meet the targets.  The actions outlined in the plan are backed by more than &euro;4 billion in annual guaranteed State investment in housing over the coming years, including through Exchequer funding and Land Development Agency and Housing Finance Agency investment.<\/p>  <p>  Through Housing for All, we will also continue to support our most vulnerable, including those experiencing homelessness and who have more complex housing needs.  The plan will provide the basis for a long-term sustainable housing system for this and future generations and supports the ambitions of the climate action plan through measures on retrofitting and waste reduction.  The committee supports a strong focus on delivery of the Housing for All plan.  A delivery group of Secretaries General oversees implementation, and a unit in my Department oversees the cross-government implementation of the plan.  The next quarterly report, due in the new year, will set out performance against the targets and actions in the plan for quarter 4.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100030#CC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1638366120,"counter":309,"content":"<p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2021 went through the Seanad last week and is in the D&aacute;il this week.

The Labour Party tabled an amendment on this in the Seanad but it was defeated by the Government.

The strategic housing development, SHD, process has squeezed local people out of the planning process, leaving them with little choice but to pursue judicial reviews.  As I said last week, the majority of the judicial reviews that have been taken have been upheld, which is further proof that this is bad planning law.  The changes represent a sustained attack on the planning process.  They make a mockery of development plans and local area plans where the purpose of a development plan is to respond to local circumstances and need.  The SHD process has also squeezed out locally elected councillors and very much sidelined the professional planners in the local authorities.  All of that has been very bad, so I welcome the fact that the intention of the Bill is to eliminate the SHD process and return to the two-stage planning process.<\/p>  <p>  My concern, however, is that the SHD process is only one element of the weakening of the planning laws that has taken place in recent years.  Sometimes the SHDs are used as shorthand for all the other negative things that have happened over the last five or six years.  In 2015, the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, introduced mandatory guidelines.  Irrespective of what local authorities or even An Bord Plean&aacute;la think, the local authorities are obliged to adhere to the mandatory guidelines that were set down.  For example, one of the things the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, did was reduce apartment standards.  He introduced studios that could be 27% smaller than was the case previously.  That was followed by a later Minister, Deputy Coveney, introducing the SHDs and the following Minister, former Deputy Eoghan Murphy, introducing new mandatory standards in 2017 and 2018.  Those standards allowed up to 50% of any development to be one-bedroom or studio and there were no minimum requirements for three-bedroom or bigger sized apartments.  The minimum area of studios was reduced to 37 sq. m.  That is smaller than the smallest hotel room in the InterContinental Hotel, so they were tiny shoe-box apartments.  Dual aspect was reduced to 33% near city or town centres and close to public transport or strategic development zones, SDZs.  The standards also allowed car free developments, which can only result in car parking in surrounding areas.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to that, there was the buy-to-rent phenomenon, which was facilitated by the then Minister, Mr. Eoghan Murphy.  There was no restriction on the dwelling mix in buy-to-rent developments.  It was outrageous stuff.  That is why 70% of the units in the Clonliffe Road development are one-bedroom or studios.  There was no maximum number of units on floors in respect of buy-to-rent units.  There could be long corridors, like cheap hotels, with any number of apartments opening out on them.  There was no requirement for a cr&egrave;che, for example.  Also, there was a reduced number of stairwells and lifts.  There was a huge race to the bottom in the standards for apartments, with implications for fire safety.  Our planning laws have taken a very negative direction over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make a point regarding the mandatory standards.  I acknowledge the fact that the current Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, introduced a change to the guidelines which eliminated the co-living phenomenon.  Again, that was a retrograde phenomenon.  That has been a good change, but I hope the Minister will use his powers to get rid of all those other aspects which have led to very poor quality apartment developments, particularly in the buy-to-rent sector.  There should be a drive for better, not weaker, standards with regard to what we expect people to do.  If we are aiming to achieve a situation where apartment living is regarded as a standard and a good thing and where people would buy apartments, although one cannot buy any because of the buy-to-rent stuff at present, and put down roots and settle in them, there is no reason that families cannot do that if they are high-quality apartments.  However, they currently are not and that is a major problem.  If we are to move to that European model, and we should be encouraging that, there must be good quality apartments and there have to be reasonable heights.  The idea now is that the sky is the limit.  There is no height limit.  People living in two-storey houses could have an 18-storey apartment block at the end of their gardens.  That is simply not on.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has made a start with the SHDs.  If housing developments are to be sustainable and of a quality people require, and the Minister should be ensuring that quality exists, then he has no choice but to ensure that the low standards are removed.  The Minister has the power to do that.  On Committee Stage later today, I and other Members have tabled a number of amendments seeking greater consultation with communities at the pre-planning stage and publicity for what is being proposed at an early stage.  In addition, there are other amendments tabled by me and others to remove the mandatory nature of the national guidelines.  I strongly urge the Minister to accept those amendments because that is the only way to achieve good-quality, sustainable apartment developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100032#LL00400","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1638367320,"counter":343,"content":"<p>There are five speakers in the next 20-minute slot.

They have been taken for granted for far too long.  We have moved away from the full meaning of local authorities and what they deliver to the people they represent.  In the context of the pre-planning phase, I fully agree that there must be greater consultation with the local communities involved.  That can be enforced or enhanced by having proper planning through the councils in terms of what they want the land used for or what the desire of the local community might be.  There can be an input from long before the pre-planning stage to establish what type of development is required or wanted in that area in terms of housing, infrastructure and facilities.  When a developer comes in at a pre-application phase, that must be opened up more by involving people, publicity and ensuring people know what is happening.  Much of the angst that can be created by lack of information at that point can be relieved through the transparency that will be provided at the pre-application phase.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad there is an eight-week timeframe and a 16-week timeframe for the other two phases.  I have seen many worthwhile projects being delayed repeatedly by lack of information of some kind and by misunderstanding.  Good applications simply get caught up in the system, thereby depriving people of the possibility of having their own home in their locality.  I encourage the Minister to ensure that local authorities, from the pre-planning phase, have their plans in place, know what they want and are prepared to engage with local communities.  If the Minister is spending in excess of &euro;4 billion per year and trying to eliminate one of the worst housing crises in the history of the State, there must be greater efficiency where this all begins, which is at planning level.<\/p> <p>We have spoken of the involvement of communities and of local authorities being imaginative in how they present their plans.  As some sites are shoehorned into local communities or become additions, I hope we are not creating difficulties for ourselves down the road.  It is essential to have high standards in the units being provided and the amenities within the development.  We need to ensure that the houses are not on top of each other, that there is ample car parking space and that there are facilities for children to enable families to develop and establish local communities.  A community cannot be retrofitted to a housing estate that is poorly developed or badly managed.  I encourage all concerned, developers, planners and the Department, to have those rules and regulations in place to ensure we get the best outcomes for the families who will live in these housing estates in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100032#LL00600","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638367920,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I also welcome the Bill.  The bureaucratic system surrounding planning is fundamental in blocking or stopping development.  That bureaucratic system has been allowed to develop because local authorities, An Bord Plean&aacute;la or others are unwilling to take decisions.  We need to strip it back if we are serious about proper planning.  We have seen the effects of negative planning but we have also seen how objections and delays have impeded welcome development in communities across the country, not just in the large urban centres but also in rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will help to tackle and resolve those issues and certainly brings into focus the role of local authorities.  There is a reluctance by local authority planners to give a clear direction to people building houses as to what would be allowed.  They simply outline the regulations, the development plans and so forth.  Then they say it is entirely up to others to make decisions on it.  I think that is a retrograde step.  There should be clear guidance in any engagement between the local authorities and those who are willing to build.  When they are leaving the meeting or series of meetings everybody should know what is acceptable to both sides.  There is too much confusion and an inability to make clear decisions on some of these issues which is leading to frustration.  That frustration is leading to people leaving the building and architectural industries.<\/p>  <p>  A critical planning and development issue is local authorities' interpretation of the various planning and development Acts.  Small community organisations in rural communities have been forced to engage senior counsel to get advice on the correct interpretation of the various planning and development Acts.  It is unacceptable that they should need to do that and spend money they do not have to try to build a badly needed community facility.<\/p>  <p>  Autonomy should be given to the local authorities allowing them to make decisions.  I have seen a case where a layman's interpretation of the law would side with the local community organisation to build a community facility.  The planning authority is refusing on the basis that its interpretation of the law is different.  It is totally unacceptable for a local community to have to engage legal people to get advice.  There is frustration with the entire planning system.  Whether for large developments or smaller developments, there needs to be goodwill to meet community organisations face-to-face to try to thrash out the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100033#MM00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1638367920,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I join other speakers in complimenting the Minister on the introduction of the Bill.  I am not a great admirer of development at all cost; we need to have quality development.  From all the speakers so far, the same theme has emerged that we need to have quality, particularly with large-scale developments.  There must also be regard for local residents who have already paid for their houses or are in the course of paying for their houses by way of mortgage and may have their houses devalued by the nature and density of the development superimposed upon them, for want of a better description.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example of how this works.  In a local rural community in my constituency, numerous applications for one-off houses have been refused on the basis of water levels and all the usual reasons.  I accept that if it is not acceptable, it is not acceptable.  In the case of a recent planning application for a private mental health facility - which is laudable and I fully agree with the need for it - the local people felt it did not have any regard for their views or entitlements.  On their behalf, we lodged an objection which proposed a modification of the proposal.  However, the applicant sees other ways and means of doing it by bulldozing and denigrating anybody who stands in their path, which is not acceptable.  They think they can bulldoze their way through the planning system regardless of what the neighbours think.  Notwithstanding that none of them live in the area, they do not mind superimposing it on somebody else.  We need to be careful about allowing too much scope for such people.<\/p>  <p>  I will certainly accommodate anybody who wants to facilitate a debate on that issue which is fundamental to what we are trying to do in this House.  We need to acknowledge the rights and entitlements of people who are already here.  We know we will not be here for too long; we will be replaced by somebody else who will represent those needs.  I strongly support the building of houses and other essential services.<\/p>  <p>  An application has been made for a development that encompasses 28 or 29 houses in an area where countless applications have been refused.  It is on a site which is virtually landlocked behind council houses that were built years ago.  Residents were sneered at when it was brought to the attention of the authorities that building right at the rear of those houses could be a security issue.  Of course, it is a security issue.  Building behind and overlooking existing houses is obviously a security issue and is certainly a privacy issue.<\/p>  <p>  I support the points made by the previous speakers.  I know the Minister will take these into account because they are fundamental to what we need to do at present.  We need to provide desirable development of a quality that is not a blight on society or the landscape and does not override the rights and entitlements of the existing population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100033#MM00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1638367920,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Like other speakers, I welcome this legislation, which seems to be getting universal acceptance in the House.  It implements a commitment given in the programme for Government not to extend the strategic housing development provisions beyond the expiry date of 25 February 2022.  The SHD planning system has had an adverse impact on my constituency of Dublin Bay North.  Planning permission was granted for enormous build-to-rent apartment schemes backed up by vulture funds.  This was facilitated by ministerial guidelines.  In the process, sustainable planning went out the window.  The need for mixed-tenure developments which foster community development and integration was ignored.  Communities felt under siege.<\/p>  <p>Those wishing to buy new houses were frozen from the market.  Local authority area and development plans were cast aside.  Areas in my constituency particularly affected by the strategic housing development provisions include Baldoyle, Clongriffin, Belmayne, Clarehall, Howth village, Griffith Avenue and, of course, it all kicked off in Dublin Bay North with a controversial planning application for 657 apartments on the playing fields of St. Paul's College at St. Anne's Park in Raheny.<\/p> <p> One of the worst examples in all of this was in respect of the former Chivers site in Coolock.  City councillors were duped into supporting the rezoning of this industrial site for housing and planning permission was granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for 471 build-to-rent units up to nine storeys high.  Now, Platinum Land is flipping the site on for sale, which is outrageous.<\/p> <p> In any event the strategic housing development process has been a complete failure.  Many of the applications were bogged down in judicial reviews, as other speakers said, and the process did not deliver the much-needed housing throughout the country.  That is why this legislation is so important and welcome.  This Bill restores decision-making powers on large-scale residential developments to local authorities in the first instance, providing greater transparency and clarity and enhanced public participation in the process.  In addition, local authorities must now ensure owner-occupier tenures are provided for and accommodated in their housing strategies.  I understand that amendment was made in the Seanad.  This is all good news.<\/p> <p> I also take this opportunity to welcome the decision of Dublin city councillors last month to finally vote in favour of the proposed housing scheme at Oscar Traynor Road in Santry.  There will be 853 social and affordable homes built on this site, with 40% as social housing, 40% as cost-rental housing and 20% to be sold to low- and middle-income workers qualifying under the new affordable housing scheme.  This has been a very sorry saga that has gone on for years.  Of course, Sinn F&eacute;in voted against this scheme last month in Dublin City Council.  My hope now is that construction of this much-needed housing can commence next year.  The Minister is familiar with the site on the border with his constituency.  I am sure the planning process must take its course but if there is anything the Minister can do to speed up the development, it would be more than welcome for the many people on social housing lists in my constituency and also those seeking affordable housing.<\/p> <p> I mentioned the impact of the strategic housing development provisions on my constituency.  I briefly mentioned one area in particular earlier on the north city fringe bordering on Dublin Fingal, as the Minister knows.  There have been massive planning applications for housing units with no consideration given to local communities.  I think in particular of The Coast at Baldoyle, where only in the past few days a planning application was granted for 1,221 units.  This is on top of a planning application granted during the summer in the same area for 882 units.  Another planning application is apparently expected for that small site.  We all want housing but there must be sustainable planning and local communities must be facilitated.  That is why this legislation is so welcome.<\/p> <p> Deputy Shortall outlined the problems with the ministerial guidelines introduced by the Minister's predecessor and the previous Government.  We can see a litany of problems that the ministerial guidelines have brought about.  Again, it is something the Minister must consider.<\/p> <p> I welcome all the other measures taken by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, since he became Minister with responsibility for housing.  In particular I welcome the Affordable Housing Act 2021 and the facilitation of the various schemes in that Act.  I hope all the schemes remaining to be finalised can be up and running as early as possible in the new year.  There is also the Land Development Agency Bill 2021, and these are two landmark pieces of legislation brought forward in record time.  I have no doubt that they will make a major combined impact on the housing crisis, both here in Dublin and throughout the country.<\/p> <p> I welcome this legislation and the Minister is fulfilling a commitment given in the programme for Government.  Damage has been done because of the strategic housing development provisions and communities will have to rally around to undo it, particularly in the areas I mention on the north city fringe in Dublin Bay North, including Clongriffin and Belmayne.  Fostering community development in those areas will take time because of the build-to-rent developments.  There is a need for commercial development in such areas, as well as mixed tenures, so the work by public representatives and their local communities should begin.  A start has been made with this legislation and I welcome all the time limits in it.  The planning process should not be unduly delayed and this gives certainty to developers and others who will make these planning applications.  All that is to be welcomed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100033#MM00400","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638368520,"counter":350,"content":"<p>The strategic housing developments were probably one of the worst changes to our planning regime for many decades.  It is not the only bad change made by the previous Government and other Deputies have correctly identified the section 28 mandatory ministerial guidelines and there are also key aspects of the national planning framework that are continuing to cause us significant problems.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill, although there are elements the Minister should still consider changing.  It is worth reflecting on the passage of the strategic housing developments legislation in 2016 and early 2017, when many of us on the Opposition benches and some in Fianna F&aacute;il rightly recognised that the legislation was not fit for purpose.  We argued strongly at the time on Committee Stage that it would not speed up the delivery of homes.  We said it was a developer-led change to the planning system that would cause very significant problems in terms of the type of proposed developments and lead to a significant increase in judicial reviews, which would delay the delivery of much-needed housing.<\/p>  <p>  That argument that many of us made was subsequently confirmed in a very important piece of academic research done by academics from University College Dublin and Queen's University Belfast, who interviewed over 40 individuals involved with that process including development lobbyists, Ministers, officials and Opposition spokespersons.  The research had an anonymous basis and it confirmed that this was a classic example of industry capture of the planning regime with all the negative consequences we have seen since.<\/p>  <p>  I have a slightly wry smile when I hear Deputies opposite criticising the legislation, particularly those from Fine Gael, given that they supported it and were warned not to do so.  Some Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies who were very vocal in their criticism of strategic housing development applications have been very quiet in accepting the fact that while they abstained on the original legislation, they facilitated it.  I say this because the same thing happened, albeit under this Government, when we gave Deputies the opportunity to remove those two sets of mandatory ministerial guidelines that Deputy Haughey has correctly criticised.  Recently he voted to maintain those mandatory ministerial guidelines in a vote on legislation in this House.  They will come back to cause difficulties for him and his constituents in the time ahead.  That is a matter he will have to explain to those constituents.<\/p> <p>The real problem with the SHD legislation is that it was never about speeding up the delivery of homes; it was about, in the words of one senior official who was involved in the drafting of the Bill, removing the idiosyncrasies of the city and county development plan to make things easier for developers at their behest.  The consequence was the undermining of the democratic decision-making power of the local elected representatives in those city and county development plans, the alienation of local communities by not having the right to appeal and, ultimately, not delivering much need homes.  Only 15% of the approximate 70,000 units of accommodation that have been approved to date by the SHD process have commenced.  This is a tiny number, which shows that even when projects are not judicially reviewed, they do not get built.<\/p> <p> At the time, I and others argued strongly to the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, that instead of the SHD process he should do something very simple, namely, put in place statutory timelines for pre-planning, for further information requests and for An Bord Plean&aacute;la appealed decisions.  Thankfully, that is what the current Minister is doing in this Bill and I welcome the fact that he is returning primary responsibility for decision-making in planning to local authorities and improving the system with statutory timelines.  That is an eminently sensible thing to do and it is on that basis that we will support the Bill.  However, often when Opposition Members make proposals, they do so out of genuine intent.  The measures we propose should get better consideration from the Government.  There are six issues I want to genuinely highlight that the Minister has got wrong in this Bill and urge him to reconsider key aspects of it.<\/p> <p> First, there is no provision for public participation in the pre-planning stage of development.  I know there are issues with commercial sensitivity, etc., but the greater the involvement of local communities and third parties at the outset of the development process, the less likely there will be large-scale concerns and subsequent legal challenges.  There are different ways to do that.  It can be done, for example, through greater use of placemaking or master planning by the local authority or some form of public involvement in the pre-planning process.  There is a way of doing that, which would deal with many of the problems Deputy Haughey and others raised earlier, and I think it is an omission in the Bill.<\/p> <p> The second issue is on material contraventions of the city and county development plan.  The reason 90% of the judicial reviews of SHDs were on material contraventions was the changes to the ministerial guidelines by the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, on building heights and design standards and the misapplication by the board of aspects of the national planning framework national planning objectives.  That created a tension between the city and county development plans and those other planning policies.  That should all now be ironed out of the system with a new round of county development plans and a planning regulator involved directly in ensuring compliance between local and Government policy.  We need to return to a position where contraventions of development plans are the exception.  No planning application should be accepted with a material convention to the development plan without justifying why.  I am not saying such applications should be automatically excluded, but if a planning application proposes a material contravention, the developer should have to justify in explicit terms in the application why that is being done, otherwise we will continue to have these problems in the future.<\/p> <p> I am very concerned about where we might go with the restrictions by way of regulation on further information requests.  I urge the Minister in his reply to this debate to give more information on where he plans to go with those further information request regulations.  A local authority should not be prohibited from requesting any information at further information stage that it believes is necessary to make its final decision.<\/p> <p> I am still not convinced by the Minister's justification for the leapfrog provision in section 6.  I heard his contribution in the Seanad.  I do not believe this is anything to do with residential development, because appeals to the Court of Appeal have been incredibly rare in SHD cases.  This seems to me to be something that probably came from the Attorney General for some other purpose.  The Minister needs to tell us why the provision is in the Bill.  If he tells us why, that will allow us to make an assessment of it.  I think it is to do with strategic infrastructure developments and not large-scale residential developments, but until we have an adequate explanation, I am not in a position to support it.  I am all for speeding up the process; I do not object to that.  I just do not see why this provision is in the Bill and, therefore, greater clarity would be very welcome.<\/p> <p> The final two issues I wish to raise relate to the transitional mechanisms.  There were always going to be transitional mechanisms - I was clear on that - but the Minister is being excessively generous, and I say that in all honesty.  Allowing those with a pre-planning approval from the board a period to put in a planning application is completely legitimate, but we should have given them until February of next year.  Everybody knew this process would end in February.  I do not see why the period is 16 weeks; eight weeks would have been more appropriate.  I do not accept that developers can come along at the last minute and put in a pre-planning application through the SHD process on 16 December, for example.  The developers will get all the benefits of the SHD process into the middle of next year for the application, into the autumn for the decision, and if it is judicially reviewed into the courts at the end of next year and the year after.  I see no reason the Minister could not have allowed them to go through pre-planning in the old SHD process and if they were approved after nine weeks by the board next year, they would have been redirected into the large-scale residential development process.  I suspect it would have been quicker to do it the way I have proposed because it is less likely to be judicially reviewed.  I urge the Minister to consider that option again, because giving people nine weeks for the board to make its pre-planning application decision, 16 weeks for submission of application and 16 weeks for decision means that Deputy Haughey, in north County Dublin, could face SHD decisions in his constituency in October next year, with all the consequences of that.  I accept the transitional mechanism.  I think the Minister has got this wrong and I urge him to rethink it.<\/p> <p> Even when we get rid of the SHD process, which I welcome, we will not get rid of the real problem, which is the negative impact of Eoghan Murphy's mandatory ministerial guidelines on building heights and design standards and the misapplication by the board of the national planning objectives.  National planning objectives are high-level strategic objectives, but they are currently being used in decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to approve plans that are in direct contravention of new country development plans that have the approval of the Planning Regulator.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Some of those developments are in or very near Deputy Haughey's constituency.  If people think that moving from the problematic one-stage approval process to the two-stage local authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la process will resolve the problems that other Deputies have mentioned, they will be sorely disappointed.  So long as those mandatory ministerial guidelines on heights and inferior design standards for build-to-rent apartments remain on the Statute Book, we will have a problem.  So long as the board is misapplying and misinterpreting the national planning objectives in conflict with new city and county development plans, we will also have a difficulty.<\/p> <p> I know we have very little time on this Bill.  Committee Stage is to be taken later today.  I ask that the Minister listens to us on some of these issues.  If the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, had listened to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien's colleagues on the Oireachtas housing committee and to me in 2016 and 2017, we would not have the mess we have today.  If we work together more collaboratively, we can come up with an even better Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill, notwithstanding the problems in it, but, in my view, it is inadequate.  We need further changes and I ask the Minister to work with us between now and Christmas so that we get the best possible planning system with the best possible outcomes for the people who currently live in those areas and those who will move into those areas once the new homes are built.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100034#NN00200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638369120,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in is clear in its support for good quality, affordable and well-planned homes.  We support this Bill, despite some of its flaws, as it repeals the SHD legislation.  The legislation was undemocratic and undermined democratically agreed local, city and county development plans.  It also reduced public participation and led to an increase in legal challenges.  It was yet another deliberate attempt to erode the public and the community's engagement with planning matters.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the original legislation that was rushed through by the then Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Simon Coveney.  It was a throwback to the good old Celtic tiger days, and some developers are getting very rich by flipping land on which planning permission has been granted.  We are still playing the price for developer-led planning today.  Poor planning decisions have led to poor quality developments, a lack of quality public open spaces, a severe lack of public services; and a lack of public transport infrastructure, in particular.  They also failed in the provision of housing supply.  According to the Dublin Democratic Planning Alliance, of the 70,000 plus units for which permission was secured through the SHD process, only 10,000 have commenced.  The ministerial directive also opened the flood gates to material contraventions of the development plans.  As a former councillor, I spent many hours, weeks and months working on county development plans with planning officials and consulting local community representatives, and democratically decided what we believed was a sustainable plan for our county.<\/p> <p>The ministerial directive rode roughshod over those democratic decisions and further diminished the powers of local government.  It is not often that I welcome a Government decision but I welcome the Government finally seeing sense and rowing back on this legislation.  We said it would not work then and we were right.  As the Minister knows, Sinn F&eacute;in is not in opposition for the sake of opposition.  We offer solutions to the problems the Government creates.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed solutions, including the provision of statutory timelines for decisions from planning authorities, but these were rejected by the Government.  <\/p> <p> We have concerns.  Due to the generous transition periods provided for in the new legislation, the flawed SHD legislation will, unfortunately, be with us through most of 2022, with the process remaining open for planning applications until June 2022.  Some applications will be allowed up until October and there is a possibility of legal action late in 2022.  The Minister delayed the introduction of planning restrictions on co-living and is now providing developers with the opportunity to benefit from the SHD legislation long after it expires.  This is typical bad policy and bad governance.  Sinn F&eacute;in submitted amendments to halve these timelines but they were unfortunately rejected by the Government, leaving the door of financial windfall ajar.  I have no doubt that developers will walk through that door.<\/p> <p> There is also no provision in the legislation for public participation in the pre-planning stages.  Does the Government not believe it is best practice to involve the local community early when planning decisions are being made?  <\/p> <p> We also have concerns regarding the motivation for section 6.  We oppose this leapfrog provision.  The Minister has not made the case for this provision's inclusion in the Bill.  It has nothing to do with residential development.  We suspect it has been inserted for other reasons relating to large infrastructural projects.  I call on the Minister to explain honestly why this section is in the Bill.<\/p> <p> We introduced legislation that would remove the undemocratic power of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to issue mandatory local planning guidelines for local authorities.  This eats into the already diminishing power of local authorities and local councillors who are democratically elected to make decisions on county and city development plans.  These powers were introduced by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Kelly, and were used twice by Eoghan Murphy to bring us co-living, build-to-rent accommodation and mandatory height limits.  Sinn F&eacute;in has introduced legislation that would repeal these powers and the guidelines issued under them.  Again, we are working on solution-focused responses to bad Government policies.  SHDs, co-living and material contraventions of development plans are undemocratic.  They undermine local city and county development plans, reduce participation and confidence in the system and have led to an increase in the number of legal challenges as people rightly believe this is the only route they can take to ensure their voices are heard.  I ask the Minister to take these concerns on board and to explain honestly and openly why he has opposed the amendments proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100035#OO00200","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638369720,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Danny Healy-Rae of the Rural Independent Group.

I appreciate the urgency and the number of people who are looking for housing.  I know there is a very real problem and that his number one consideration is to deal with that and to get the numbers down.  I raised an issue here in the D&aacute;il with the Taoiseach a week or two ago.  I was grateful for the Minister's response at the time but it is not the response I want.  Heretofore, there were always extensions of five years to planning permissions for one-off housing.  That is now being ruled out.  I ask him to reconsider that because many people who got planning permission now find that their time is now running out because they were not able to build during the coronavirus pandemic or because they were not able to get loans for one reason or another.  Work has not been great and some were not able to get going.  Such people now face another conundrum because materials have become so expensive that many will not be able to start building their houses for the foreseeable future.  There is also a scarcity of contractors.  There are many different problems.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister does not know but there is an awful problem with getting planning permission for one-off houses in rural Ireland.  People can get over all the hurdles, provide further information when sought and have their permission duly granted only for the application to be appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is now the case that 90% of decisions appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la are overturned.  Even if the inspector who comes down is of the view that the permission should be upheld, what do the members of the board do, people who have never been down in Kerry, but refuse the permission?  Most of these objections and appeals are vexatious.  We are now going to put people who have planning permission through that rigmarole again.  <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that the Minister wants to get big sites here in Dublin going but this is affecting the ordinary person in rural Ireland who wants to put a roof over his or her head and who will only be doing this once in his or her lifetime.  I understand what is happening here in Dublin.  It is a different scenario.  People get planning permission for a site and then hold that site until they see the time is right and sell it off.  The next owner may do something else with the planning permission.  They may increase the density and make the site more valuable.  That is holding things up and I appreciate that but the scenario I am outlining to the Minister is totally and absolutely different.  I ask him to change that.  <\/p>  <p>  Surely this issue is affecting Deputies in other rural counties, such as Clare.  This five-year extension must have been available there as well.  I ask the Minister to look at that again because it will hurt people.  I know he wants people to build homes but this will stop people doing so.  They cannot get going right now because they cannot get loans or meet the current exorbitant building costs.  Some are trying to get on their feet because they have not been working for a couple of years.  There are many other little reasons, although they are big reasons for the people who are being held up.  They would not have sought planning permission in the first place if they had known these things would arise.  These sites are for themselves.  They are not sites for sale or anything like that but sites to build a house on.  People want to put a roof over their own heads and young couples want a place to rear their families.  Such families may be needed to keep local schools going because numbers are going down in rural areas.  I represent and adore people in places like Shrone.  These areas need people to build houses around their schools.  There are several other such places.  <\/p>  <p>  There are also other issues.  From time to time, local authorities have zoned lands around towns and villages that belong to farmers and other landowners who have no notion of ever selling these lands or building houses on them.  Zoning these lands makes them more valuable and the owners have to pay more stamp duty on them.  That has to be looked at as well.  These people cannot be forced to build houses on land they never wanted to sell in the first place.<\/p> <p>What I honestly believe, even regarding land here in Dublin, is that there should not be any such thing as zoning.  Let every applicant apply for planning permission and let that be decided on the merits of the place involved.  I refer to all this wasting time with zoning land, and all the time it takes.  Let applicants, whether the land is zoned or not, apply for planning permission and let every case be decided on its own merits.  That is the real way of building houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100036#PP00300","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638370320,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I appreciate the whole aim of what the Government is trying to do, with the removal of the initial phase regarding the local authorities from the planning process for large-scale developments.  I, of course, appreciate it and in a workingpersonlike way.  We are talking about the housing crisis.  Whether that concerns a local area level, like in our county of Kerry, allowing a single person to build one house for himself or herself or allowing the small- or medium-sized builder to go into a field and build five or ten houses, the only way that we are going to deal with this housing crisis is by making more houses available in the market.  It is very simple and straightforward.  No rocket science of any kind is involved in any aspect of this matter; none whatsoever.<\/p><p>I am proud and glad that Kerry county councillors are working diligently on formulating a county development plan.  We all know that sets out the roadmap for the county for the next several years and will seek to ensure that the council will know how to go about building in an orderly fashion and the rules and regulations that will apply in that regard.  However, there are things that are distorting the market completely.  At the start of a debate like this, by the way, I always say, in case anyone might be saying anything about me afterwards, that I of course have an interest in this area, because I have been at this type of affair since I was 19 years old.  I have no denying of that, and if more people were doing the same as me, maybe we would have much more housing available.  I have no denying of that either.  <\/p><p>Coming back to the job we are at here now, namely, trying to make more houses available, when a local authority, a developer or anybody goes to apply for planning permission, we must try to streamline the process and make it more user friendly.  Local people have a right to object; of course they do.  If a development is taking place and if it is going to adversely affect another property owner or people living in the locality, then of course those people have a right to object.  I wish to ask a simple and straightforward question, however.  We have excellent Deputies here from County Donegal, for example.  As a person living below in Kerry, is it not total insanity that if I stick my hand in my pocket and put down &euro;20, that I can then object to any man, woman or person building a house above in Donegal?  Can anyone tell me why that is right?  Can anybody tell me why it is right or normal behaviour?<\/p><p>As the Acting Chairman knows, I will not say anything wrong or name anybody, but I am going to talk about a category of person.  Right now, this minute, I know of individuals who have five, ten, 15 or up to 20 objections on the go.  I will not name those people, but I will say what those people are.  They are not normal people.  They are not living normal lives, because if they had anything better to be doing, then they would not be objecting to other people's business and planning.  They have sad lives, in the context where it is now possible to live to be between zero and 100 years of age on average.  I will not use the language that I would like to use in this regard, but we have people who think it is normal to be objecting to other people's hopes, dreams and aspirations.  That is not normal behaviour, and they are not normal people.  They are not living normal lives, and the sooner that God takes them out of the world, the better it will be for themselves, because they are miserable, useless and horrible people objecting to other people's business.  I mean it.  If any of them are listening today, I tell them, from here on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, that they are useless, horrible and miserable.  I say that because it is crazy for any person, for no good reason, to want to be objecting to some young couple.  I know the Acting Chairman would agree with me.  <\/p><p>I turn now to another level, that of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It makes no sense in the world to me.  Again, regarding vested interests, and because someone will say that I am giving out about them because of my own interest in this regard, I am not.  People who have come to me have experienced the same type of scenario.  Let us take an example of a person who goes to the local authority and gets the required planning permission for a project.  If that decision is then appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it will send down an excellent inspector, who will look at the issue on its merits, completely impartially.  Let us suppose that inspector agrees that the development should go ahead.  That decision would then go up in a paper form and it is thrown up in front of everybody.  Anybody at home who might be watching and who thinks that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is this great, big organised thing, it most certainly is not.  It is an <i>ad hoc<\/i>organisation that meets whenever it suits itself.  It could be 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock in the evening, and all that is needed to convene a meeting is three people.  <\/p><p>To continue with my example, the inspector could produce a report saying that a development should go ahead.  Let us think what such a development could be.  It could be a hotel in Ballinskelligs, 50 houses in Cork, ten houses in Tralee or any size of a development, and the inspector's recommendation could be for such a project to go ahead.  Lo and behold, then, the other two people, who know nothing about the project, nothing at all in the world, can go against the decision of the inspector who examined the development and read all the reports and who made a positive decision.  It is possible for those two people, who may never have stood in the county where the development they are deciding on is located, to say that they do not agree with the decision made by the inspector.  It has happened, over and over again.  <\/p><p>There is often talk about what other people get paid.  When we start talking about how much these <i>ad hoc<\/i>people in An Bord Plean&aacute;la get paid, and the Minister might respond on this point, I believe it is somewhere in the region of &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 for a part-time job.  That is not bad work, if people are above here in Dublin and have nothing else to do but be a member of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  After saying this about them, I would not like anyone to have the job of getting a positive decision from the board if they were in my shoes, but I will tell the truth because I am not afraid of those people.  Perhaps other people around the country are afraid of them, but I am not.  I am not afraid to stand up here on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, call them out and ask them how they can justify that type of a decision.  If those people have not read the reports, how can they go against the local authority, the local area planner and their own An Bord Plean&aacute;la inspector, who might be a head inspector, because a tiered system operates?  We have had situations where a chief inspector could go out from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, do up a positive report and bring it before the board, but if the board members do not like the smell off the project, for some reason or other, they can dash it.  That could be worth millions of euro in building and infrastructure, but, most importantly, such a development could represent beds, kitchens and living quarters.  It could have been a place for people to bring little children into the world and to have their own unit for them.  The Minister is trying his level best and trying to provide housing, but how can we stand over that type of nonsense?  I am not attacking the Minister about this issue.  I am saying &quot;we&quot;, and including every one of us.  How can we get rid of that type of nonsense?  <\/p><p>One of the things I have a great interest in and that I have been studying for years and years is our planning process.  I know an awful lot about it.  I know the rights and the wrongs, and the one thing I always say to the planners at home, and the one thing I like about it so much, is that we learn something new every day.  Nobody has all the knowledge in planning because the rules change so much.  However, rotten things are happening in planning, and I have referred to one example.  We have seen situations before where politicians did what I would call bad things or things that were not right, proper or above board regarding zonings, etc.  I would like to think and hope, however, that we have gone away from all that now.  <\/p><p>What I want to see is transparency.  I wish to see how the system of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, that <i>ad hoc <\/i>organisation, whose members meet when it suits themselves to draw their &euro;70,000, &euro;80,000 and &euro;90,000 salaries, can stand over some of the decisions it has made.  The board has taken away projects such as hotels, restaurants, houses and even individual houses in the countryside, where the sons and daughters of farm owners wanted to build a house.  How can the board justify some of these decisions and how can it go against its own inspectors?  How can the members of the board turn around to an inspector, who goes up to Dublin after doing a lot of work and being diligent about it, and refuse planning permission for that project?  How can they then say as well that they may not have had a vested interest, perhaps, in some way or other in making that decision?  I will tell the House one thing.  If it smells, looks and acts like it is rotten, then it is rotten.  That to me is An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  <\/p><p>I still have time, do I?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100037#QQ00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1638370920,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I have to wrap up at 4 o'clock.

I appreciate the legislation is about expediting arrangements to build large-scale developments, but there are related matters the Minister might want to address.  First, touching on points made by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, when are we going to address the issue of vexatious appeals?  They are costing us housing and other investments in the country.  It is beyond time for that issue to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of impediments to development, housing or otherwise, Irish Water and its resourcing is probably one of the most significant roadblocks.  I had an engagement with Irish Water recently on a project in my own constituency related to quite substantial housing delivery, for which the funding was committed.  Irish Water told me the best case scenario was four and a half years and in a worst-case scenario it could be seven years before the infrastructure was in place.  I accept there are a lot of complications in this particular case but if we are really committed to resolving these issues, we need to resource Irish Water sufficiently.<\/p>  <p>  It feeds into the issue around zoning as well.  It is one thing for local authorities to zone land and allow Irish Water to follow suit in terms of providing the infrastructure on this identified land for development.  However, we need a kind of traffic light system so that all local authorities would be identifying the land they are going to develop in the next five years and the infrastructure that needs to be put in place, be it roads, footpaths, public lighting, water, sewers or whatever.  They also need a line of sight, as do builders and developers, of what is coming on next so that they are confident to make the required investment that makes sense in terms of their businesses.  They need to know what will happen in the next five years.  Irish Water also needs to have a line of sight of where the required investment would be in the period after that.  Without that, proper planning is impossible.  We need to put more money into Irish Water but we must also give it the vision it needs to plan infrastructure beyond the five-year horizon.  That is what it is constrained by currently in development plans.<\/p>  <p>  I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Michael Healy-Rae for the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100038#RR00600","speaker":"1454"},{"type":"speech","time":1638370920,"counter":364,"content":"<p>We must conclude this business straight away.

The purpose is to correct the misspelled &quot;coexistance&quot; by replacing &quot;a&quot; with &quot;e&quot;.  There was an amendment that arose from an Opposition proposal that we were happy to accept.  While we thank Deputies for their significant and useful contributions in respect of their amendment, their proposed spelling, &quot;coexistance&quot;, was incorrect.  This amendment corrects the typographical error.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 13 is to provide that Chapter 4-designated maritime area plans, DMAPs, be approved by the relevant coastal planning authority and are not required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This amendment was agreed on the Committee Stage discussion of section 19 on Tuesday, 2 November 2021.  I thank the Deputies who brought this to the attention of officials during the debate.  I would like to think this is an excellent example that reflects the truly collaborative nature of the discussions on Committee Stage.  We entered Committee Stage in the spirit of collaboration and continued in that regard to the conclusion.  All Members will agree that the Government sought to work in a collegiate manner whereby proper and respectable consideration was given to all proposals to achieve the best possible legislation for all maritime users.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 14 amends section 20, which provides for the designation of public bodies that may make DMAPs.  It is accepted that we want high-quality DMAPs that can successfully achieve what is set out in sections 21 and 22.  It is acknowledged that not every public body has the necessary capacity, competency or skill to prepare a DMAP.  It is intended to be mindful of these matters when designating.  On Committee Stage it became clear that we had inadvertently used too broad a definition of &quot;public body&quot; in respect of such a designation.  As defined in the Bill, it includes the Minister, local authorities and bodies established under enactment.  It also includes companies.  While appropriate in other contexts, it would not be appropriate for a company, a commercial entity, to prepare a DMAP.  It was therefore flagged on Committee Stage that I would be introducing an amendment such as this on Report Stage to modify the definition of &quot;public body&quot; for the purpose of this section.  For clarity, this excludes public bodies as defined in paragraph (d) on page 19 of the amended Bill from being able to prepare a DMAP.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 15 is to amend section 22(2)(f) to add &quot;or coexistence&quot; after &quot;colocation&quot;.  This amendment arises from an expansive discussion of a Opposition amendment on Committee Stage.  That amendment was to replace &quot;colocation&quot; with &quot;coexistence&quot; as this would be more consistent with the language used in the MSP directive.  I raised concerns about this approach and committed to reverting to the House with a more appropriate formulation.  The inclusion of both &quot;colocation&quot; and &quot;coexistence&quot; is designed to reflect the intended versatile nature of DMAPs.  The formulation is necessary to allow for a specific DMAP to provide for the colocation of particular future maritime usages.<\/p><p>It does not dilute the requirement to comply with the maritime spatial planning directive in terms of coexistence of maritime usages and, seen in the amendment No. 13, this requirement exists for the national level plan, under which DMAPs must sit.  It is simply a drafting tool to provide for the flexibility required for this innovative type of sub-national planning.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 19 arises from Committee Stage amendment No. 122, which was withdrawn in error as part of a grouping of amendments on Committee Stage.

We should also ensure we have consultation with organisations that have expertise in and knowledge of the marine environment such as the Heritage Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, An Taisce, the Sustainable Water Network, the Marine Institute and so on.<\/p> <p> Other Deputies will elaborate further on this point because the amendment is tabled in my name as well as the names of Deputies Cian O'Callaghan and Eoin &Oacute; Broin.  To summarise, our concern, a concern that was corroborated by the officials dealing with marine protected areas, whom we met yesterday, is that in an ideal world we would be doing things the other way around as to how we will manage our maritime area of 220 million acres, an enormous area multiples the size of the land area of this country.  It is a hugely important resource for biodiversity and in its role as a carbon sink.  In an ideal world we would have had our designated marine protected areas before talking about giving consent for human activity and major development, particularly major industrial development, in the maritime area when that human activity and industrial development could potentially do damage to our marine resources, to biodiversity and to the capacity of the marine as a key environmental protection for humanity in its capacity to absorb carbon.  The officials acknowledged that we would have done that first.  Ireland is at the bottom of the league table when it comes to the designation of marine protected areas, with only a little more than 2% of our huge marine area, one of the biggest marine areas of any country in Europe, protected, as against France, at over 40%, and other countries at 50% to 60%.  We are behind the curve.  The officials acknowledged that.<\/p> <p> We are concerned because the legacy projects that get special status in the national marine planning framework, which were sites developed for industrial offshore renewable infrastructure, were selected by the developers and the developers have said very explicitly they want \"a developer-led approach\" to developing offshore wind.  We do not believe it is in line with sustainable planning and development or with the spirit or the word or letter of environmental protections in EU directives that we would have a developer-led approach.  However, the companies that have those specially designated legacy projects have selected their own sites.  We do not know whether those sites are incredibly sensitive and important to the protection of marine biodiversity and our marine environment.  That is a problem and, therefore, we want the maximum protection put in place and we want the national marine planning framework to be reviewed in that context in order that we do not have inappropriate, potentially damaging development taking place before we have a plan-led approach that is fully in compliance with all the key environmental directives of the European Union to protect our precious marine resources and environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100039#SS02600","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638372120,"counter":406,"content":"<p>During the very lengthy Committee Stage hearings we had on this legislation, one of the points I made regularly was that our party, and in fact everybody on the committee, urgently wants us to be able to get up and running with the planning regime for the marine in order that we can progress our renewable wind energy projects to meet those crucial targets, not only as part of the Government's climate action plan but also to meet our commitments under international and European agreements.  The concern many of us had through the course of the passage of the Bill was that, while we are doing that work on the planning regime, we also have to make sure we fully protect marine biodiversity and the marine.  I know that is very close to the Minister of State's heart.  The officials who were dealing with this legislation were, justifiably, not in a position to update us on what is happening with the marine protected areas but yesterday, thankfully, officials working directly with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, on the marine protected areas gave us a comprehensive briefing over three hours on progress in that regard.  The concern I had about the Maritime Area Planning Bill is probably greater now, on foot of that briefing, than it was at the start and this amendment speaks directly to some of those concerns.  The officials told us yesterday that we are not likely to get a general scheme of the marine protected areas legislation until the third quarter of next year.  Obviously, that will have to go through important pre-legislative scrutiny and then through the D&aacute;il, so realistically the passage and enactment of that legislation is likely not to happen until 2023.<\/p><p>International best practice, particularly from jurisdictions such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Scotland, argues that these two things should absolutely be done in parallel.  If they are done in parallel, you get better quality planning outcomes and greater protection of marine biodiversity and you are less likely to be subject to legal challenge.  We thought there might have been a delay of a year or so but realistically we are now looking at three to four years because, once the legislation on marine protected areas is through, it will take the relevant officials two to three years to get through those designations.<\/p><p>The officials also made some interesting comments on the fact that the extent to which the area of the marine one mile out from the shoreline currently protected, albeit not through legally prescribed protected areas, is about 60%.  Yet we know - again, the Minister of State will have more intimate knowledge of this than I do - that while an area can be designated, it is another thing enforcing that designation and ensuring that it is properly protected and, where infringements of the protection in place occur, properly remediated.  The challenge many of us face now is that we want the wind energy and we want the planning process to be able to deliver offshore wind as quickly and as efficiently as possible, yet the time lag between the setting up and the progressing of the seven legacy projects off the east coast of the island and the establishment of the marine protected areas is far greater than we had originally envisaged.  In addition, the Minister of State can correct me if I have misinterpreted this, but I came away from yesterday's meeting with his officials unclear as to whether any interim measures will be put in place, particularly in those areas of the marine where the seven legacy projects are due to be progressed, through both ministerial maritime area consents and applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la before the creation of the new maritime agency.  Therefore, the big question many of us have is to what extent we, both the Oireachtas and the wider public, can be confident that the very significant challenges to key aspects of marine biodiversity will be adequately captured through the round of marine area consents, MACs, and planning decisions of the Minister and the board between now and when we eventually get the marine protected areas.  That is a real challenge.<\/p><p>The purpose of this amendment, therefore, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, is, first, to try to fast-track a review of the marine planning framework because that would at least allow us to deal with some of these outstanding issues but, also, not just to have the review because, as the Minister of State will notice, the amendment is quite long.  The officials are quite adept at reading long amendments from us on this and giving the Minister pithy notes to respond to them.  The review needs to do a number of key things.  First, it needs to ensure full compliance with a range of legal obligations that Deputy Boyd Barrett outlined.  It also needs to outline very clearly who needs to be consulted as a matter of urgency.  There are other issues that need to be broadly addressed.  Probably one of the most important points of amendment No. 10 is subsection (3): &quot;Notwithstanding anything else in this Act no Maritime Area Consent, or Development Consent can be granted pending the conclusion of the review under <i>subsection (2)<\/i>.&quot;  It is not like we are trying to delay any consents or planning permission.  We are trying to get the Government to accelerate that bit of the process that is now three years behind schedule in real terms to ensure we can do two things which are absolutely crucial to meeting our climate change challenge.  One is renewable energy and the other is protection of biodiversity, particularly marine biodiversity.<\/p> <p>I do not expect the Minister of State to support the amendment.  We know the view of the officials and the line Minister of State, Deputy Burke, because we went through this in quite some detail.  In addition to reading out the note to explain why he is not going to accept this amendment, I would like to hear the view of the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, because it is the first time we have got to question him with respect to the marine protected areas in the context of the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021.  How are we going to manage those two key things?  The scale of the technology that is required to meet the renewable energy challenge that we are going to need between now and 2030 is so great that it is clearly going to have an impact on the marine area and marine biodiversity.  What mitigating measures are we going to put in place to ensure the maximum protection so that the coexistence we talked about in the earlier amendments is able to happen in a way that does not mean we sacrifice marine biodiversity to meet our much-needed renewable energy targets?<\/p> <p> Obviously, the Minister of State will read out his reply, but I would like him, beyond that, to reflect directly on that wider issue because it is one that is directly within his responsibility as he will be stewarding through the marine protected areas legislation next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100040#TT00200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638372720,"counter":408,"content":"<p>First, I wish to say that there was very good engagement at committee level on this legislation.  During that process we sought a number of written clarifications on a number of matters, which we were looking for in advance of Report Stage.  It is regrettable that the commitments in written clarifications never came forward and we did not receive them.<\/p>  <p>  The previous speakers made some very good points.  There is an urgent need for renewable wind energy and a marine planning framework.  To facilitate that, and indeed other activities in our marine area, there is an urgent need for a review of the national marine planning framework, which is what this amendment is about.  We can have renewable wind energy while also urgently protecting our marine biodiversity.  The strong concern I have is around the slowness in designating the marine protected areas.  The briefing that we got yesterday at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage confirmed that we effectively will not be seeing a huge amount of progress on marine protected areas getting designated and being put in place probably until 2025, according to the current timescale.  That means we are going to have a lot of active consents, without first properly identifying the areas of the marine that need to be protected.  That allows for the possibility of significant damage taking place.  The commitment in the programme for Government for marine protected areas to form 30% of Ireland's maritime area is a very positive one, but getting that implemented as quickly as possible is absolutely key.<\/p>  <p>  There are two points that I wish to raise about this amendment, in particular.  First, if we are not going to have marine protected areas in place quickly enough and at the same time as this planning framework, which is what should be happening but it looks like it is not going to happen, there is an urgent need for interim measures and protections to be put in place to ensure that in granting consents, areas that need to be protected but which are not yet designated as marine protected areas are protected, and that the marine life biodiversity and so forth are properly protected.  That is urgently needed.  Perhaps the Minister of State can address that point, in particular.  What is going to be done in terms of putting in place interim measures and protections until we have a full network of marine protected areas fully designated?<\/p>  <p>  The second part of the amendment which I think is particularly important is around section 6, which concerns the urgent review of the national marine planning framework to ensure compliance with Articles 17, 10 and 11 of the marine strategy framework directive, Articles 16 and 17 of the habitats directive and Article 10 of the birds directive and, particularly, to assess its compliance with the latest Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services report.  I think that is particularly important.  Doing that would provide some level of protection pending the full designation of the marine protected areas.  I ask the Minister of State to address, in particular, what is going to be done to put in place interim measures and protections pending the full designations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100041#UU00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1638372720,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I would like to speak to this amendment.  I am not a member of the committee, but we have been kept apprised of the progression of the Maritime Area Planning Bill through the D&aacute;il.  I do not think there is any Deputy in the country who would have anything to say against having offshore wind energy and renewable wind energy projects.  I have no issue with it whatsoever.  Of course, others who have spoken on this amendment have spoken about the protection of maritime biodiversity.  That is 100% correct.  However, I have major concerns about the fishermen, their protection and the protection of their income.  I have spoken previously about the consultation with fishermen.  I would like to see where the consultation has taken place.  I was at a meeting recently at the Maritime Hotel in Bantry where there were around 35 to 40 fishermen in attendance.  I was not the public representative who asked if they would support the Bill because I knew the answer before the question was asked.  One public representative was unwise enough to ask the question, and they answered that they would not support the Bill.  My worry is that we are going to tie ourselves up in knots here in legal actions being taken to stop the progression of the legislation because the consultation has not taken place.<\/p><p>There is 220 million acres of sea out there.  Certainly, according to <i>The Skipper<\/i>magazine, most of those acres are taken up by foreign vessels.  The rights of the Irish fishers are being squeezed.  They are being squeezed out of their own waters.  We are going to take more acreage away from them, and a massive amount of acreage is required for the construction of these offshore wind projects.  It looks like developers have picked out sites that they feel are suitable and they are going to go ahead.  That will take a massive amount of sea away from the men and women who are out there fishing and are already struggling.  They are asking what compensation they are going to get.  They are going to lose a massive amount of sea when these projects are constructed.  Will they regain some of the fishing areas that have been handed over to the foreign fleets for the past 30 years?  Is that where we can win back areas of ground?  Is important that the Minister of State clarifies that.  Most of the fishermen at the meeting I attended are members of the Irish south-west fishermen's co-operative organisation.  They were 100% against any developments that are planned at sea because they feel that it will lead to a massive loss in income for them.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could allay their fears.  Better consultation needs to be undertaken out there to ensure the Government brings people like that with it.  <\/p><p>Marine biodiversity is a huge issue and we need to ensure that it is protected.  However, the income of fishermen is currently at an all-time low thanks to the passing of the massively negative Brexit deal that was done against the Irish fishermen.  There are further worries that they could lose more acreage of sea out there.  There was good engagement on Committee Stage, but I think we need to look outside the committee and bring the people of this country with us on this issue.  If the Government can win that battle, I will be 100% behind it.  It is going to be a big struggle, because there is a lot of suspicion on the part of Irish fishers in relation to politics in this country.  I think it is an issue that this Government will be unable to tackle.  Perhaps I am wrong.  However, on the developments that are going to be happening at sea, the fishers want clarity and have asked for it.  They made it very clear that they are totally opposed to the legislation until they get that clarity.  The Government will struggle to bring them along with it, but it cannot walk away and turn its back on them and expect them to accept another blow to their income.  While we have to protect marine areas and marine biodiversity, we must protect the fishers out there who are going to lose heavily as a result of this legislation.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify that point.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100041#UU00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1638372720,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I concur with Deputy Michael Collins in his point in relation to fishermen's incomes.  Their situation is bad enough as it is.  <\/p> <p>It cannot make their situation any worse.  When one sees how expansive Ireland's shores are, we realise how far-reaching the Bill will be.  The sea is all around us.  One can barely think of what is involved because there is so much involved, especially with our piers and harbours.  People hope the Bill will not impinge on people's rights in using the sea, which they have been doing in different ways to make a living.  We must also consider people in the tourism business such as those who run the small boats that take people out for tours of the bay.  We hope this will not mean anything will change for them, only to improve things.<\/p> <p> Included in the Bill is provision for dredging piers and harbours.  The nearest pier to me is Kenmare.  It is a beautiful place all around it, but I feel that it could be developed way more.  The pier has not been cleaned out for nearly 70 years.  The slag boats came into Kenmare up until 1960 or 1962, but they could not get in there now because the pier is badly in need of dredging.  That needs to be looked at.  I am sure there are other places apart from Kenmare with similar issues, but Kenmare pier is the nearest one to me.  I gave a lot of my time on the edge of the pier working for Kerry County Council, even with cleaning of the seaweed along the pier.  I hope that this will be included if the Bill is to be effective to help our local situation.  This place is only 50 m away from the top of Kenmare town.  If the pier was dredged it would have a massively positive impact for the town and for places local to the town.  The pier itself should be developed and modernised to allow more boats to come in during the summer.  The River Roughty cannot get out at the pier when the mouth of the bay is blocked, and then we are talking about flooding, and it is said that climate change is causing it.  There are a lot of things that used to be done before that are not done at all now, including dredging of our rivers and dredging the mouths where the rivers run into a bay.  Those things also need to be looked at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100041#UU00400","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638373320,"counter":412,"content":"<p>The Deputy is moving away from the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100042#VV00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1638373320,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I am also concerned about wind turbines out in the bay and where they will be placed.

With regard to marine protected areas, members of the committee will remember, and Members of the House will have seen, the report from the Oireachtas committee and the recommendations we made when we were carrying out the pre-legislative scrutiny on the marine development management Bill, as it was known at that stage.  The first recommendation of that report was that marine protected areas would be included in this Bill or that we would designate marine protected areas under separate parallel legislation, which is exactly what is happening at the moment.  That is exactly what we are doing.  We are taking that committee recommendation and putting together a fit-for-purpose and very clear planning Bill for how we are going to develop Ireland's offshore area.  It is not just about wind turbines; it is also about laying cables and anything that might happen in our massive marine area, which is 500,000 sq. km.  This legislation is needed because all we had previously was the Foreshore (Amendment) Act, which is pretty outdated now and not fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  The committee spent a lot of time on Committee Stage of this Bill.  The marine protected areas were discussed on Committee Stage.  The committee agreed that we would have an update from the Department on the progress on marine protected areas.  Yesterday we had a very long, interesting and comprehensive presentation on marine protected areas from the Department by a very knowledgeable contributor, and we heard about the progress that is being made on that.<\/p>  <p>  Contrary to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's expression earlier that he is more worried now, I am actually more confident now because we are not starting from scratch with regard to marine protected areas.  Yesterday we heard that we will look to those other countries that lead on this, and we will take their learning experience and apply it to the Irish situation.  To me that makes a lot of sense.  One does not reinvent the wheel.  I am heartened by the amount of support and the attention that the protection of the marine area is getting lately.  I am aware that this is prompted by consideration of offshore renewable development, but for many of us who have been at this for the past 20 or 30 years, including with terrestrial protection, aquatic marine protection and marine protection, this is positive.<\/p>  <p>  If we create a marine protected area, it does not mean we ignore everything that is outside that marine protected area.  One applies a precautionary principle where such designations are not done.  We know this, we heard this yesterday and it makes sense.  One of the tenets of environmental protection across European directives is that one applies the precautionary principle.  Any planning application out there at the moment will have gone through a lot of hoops to get to the planning application stage.  There are surveys to be done and a lot of scientific data and information that we do not have at the moment to be generated.  That would be helpful for us in protecting our marine areas.  One applies the precautionary principle and carries out stringent environmental impact assessments on any type of development proposed in the marine area.  We know this has to be done, regardless of the fact that a line is drawn or a marker is put out to say that this is a marine protected area.  At the moment we do not have a definition of what a marine protected area is.  We do not know what we are going to have to apply to marine protected areas.  We do not know what one can do in a marine protected area.  We do not know whether there are activities that might be complementary to each other.  We do not know if there are activities that should be suspended for a certain period of time.  These things will change over time.  It is not a matter of just drawing a line on a map and saying \"It is a protected area, job done and away we go.\"  One of the concepts of environmental management is the constant monitoring and addressing of issues as they arise.  One goes through that and then there is the plan.  This is what we are doing at the moment.  We heard that yesterday and the planning is advanced on this.<\/p>  <p>  We are aware that the general scheme for the marine protected areas Bill will be coming to us sometime next year.  The committee will meet on that, and we agreed on this yesterday.  I look forward to the pre-legislative scrutiny.  I have no doubt that the three Members opposite me in the Chamber today will also be in attendance for that.  It is very important.  We will get it right because it is vital, critical and important that we get it right.<\/p>  <p>  On the review of the national marine planning framework, I believe this is the most comprehensive document out there.  I have said many times on the record that if somebody came to me and asked me for information about our marine area, the first document I would direct them to is the national marine planning framework.  We are aware of the amount of mapping that has been done and the amount of information that has been gathered in that regard.  That is our overarching policy.<\/p> <p>That is how we intertwine everything we are going to do in the marine area.  We know that one of the core tenets of that document is the protection of the environment, which comes first in every heading on that document.  We know that is the overarching principle we are going to apply to development we do in that sea area, namely, to protect the environment.<\/p> <p> I heard the contribution from Deputy Danny Healy Rae and concerns about fishermen.  Environmentalists, those who want to protect the sea, and fishermen want the same thing.  They want to see the marine area healthy, whether it is for their livelihood or for all the other benefits that a healthy marine and healthy seas bring, such as carbon sequestration, tourism and recreation.  Everybody wants the same thing out of the marine area and I think we are all united on that in this House.  However, with regard to the national marine planning framework, NMPF, we know that document will be reviewed.  We know these planning documents generally get reviewed every six years but we did hear, when we had the briefing in committee, that we expect that national marine planning framework review to happen in a shorter timeframe than six years and I am confident we will see that happen.<\/p> <p> It is the first iteration of that document.  The consultation and the putting together of that document took a long time.  I think it started in 2017, a wide range of stakeholders were involved and the stakeholder group still meets on it.  However, because of how comprehensive the first document is, it makes sense to review it in a shorter term than that six years.  I believe we heard a commitment to do that when we discussed it in committee the last time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100042#VV00400","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638373920,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I will read the scripted response and then try to address some of the concerns, although quite a few of them have been addressed by my colleague, Deputy Matthews.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 10 proposes that a review of the NMPF be commenced within one month of enactment of this legislation.  It is similar to amendment No. 83 on Committee Stage, which proposed that the recently-made NMPF be reviewed within one year of the first publication, although that was voted against.  We are now at one month post-enactment of this Bill.  Indeed, this proposed amendment contains many of the same deficiencies as earlier proposed amendments of the NMPF, including providing for particular pillars of sustainable development and sectors to the exclusion of others, thus upsetting the neutrality of the legislation by requiring compliance with very specific and selected provisions of directives other than the maritime spatial planning, MSP, directive, some of which are already covered elsewhere in the Bill, such as the birds and habitats directives and other matters outside the requirements of the MSP directive, to which this Bill is giving effect.<\/p>  <p>  These points have been discussed in detail on Committee Stage.  The intention to up-end a plan that has only just been adopted and has yet to properly bed in is simply unacceptable to the Government.  I understand the Deputies are not happy with the NMPF but it is Ireland's national marine plan, the first of a series of interconnected and related spatial plans for the maritime area, and we will simply not go back four years to the beginning, holding off everything else just to keep a small number of Opposition Deputies happy in this regard.  The Government takes marine management seriously, we take decarbonisation seriously and we take the protection of our maritime area very seriously.  We must move forward and we are moving forward.<\/p>  <p>  As stated on Committee Stage, the requirement of section 17 is that the review will be carried out within six years but it is our intention that we will carry out this review sooner, particularly for the first national maritime spatial plan.  However, we must focus our resources on getting the system up and running and I am happy that the existing NMPF underpins the system appropriately in its current form.<\/p>  <p>  To touch on some of the details of the proposed amendment, it has the effect that no maritime area consents or development consents can be granted pending the conclusion of the aforementioned review.  This would simply have the effect of rendering significant parts of this Bill inoperable for a period of time, thus undermining the purpose of the legislation.  This proposal is, of itself, extremely concerning as it would also mean that where one is currently permitted to obtain planning permission on the foreshore under Part 15 of the Planning Act, this right would effectively be removed by the proposed subsection (2).  To be clear, under this amendment, no harbours could be expanded, no boat houses constructed and no recreational jetties or pontoons erected pending a review of a national plan that is just six months old.  Moreover, this subsection runs counter to another amendment proposed by some of the Deputies where planning permission can in fact be granted provided, strangely, and in a first for the State, that An Bord Plean&aacute;la carries out a review of the NMPF.  Amendment No. 55 also refers.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the bodies that should be consulted during the proposed review, many of these bodies were already central to the production of the NMPF and sat on the marine advisory group for the four years that the plan was being prepared.  The NMPF has, I should note for the record, been broadly and widely welcomed by members of the advisory group and further afield.  I appreciate the Deputies&rsquo; intention to ensure participation of certain organisations and that is why public participation, including the input of relevant organisations, is stitched into the very formulation of the maritime spatial plans, ensuring that relevant views are taken into account throughout the entire process.  Prescribing certain organisations in primary legislation for consultation is actually a lesser form of participation than the one the Bill envisages.  I would be concerned that any attempt at prescription in this regard runs the risk of inadvertently excluding organisations that may have valuable input to offer.  The spirit of the proposal is, therefore, already incorporated in a more effective way into the Bill.  In fact, the advisory group involved in the preparation of the NMPF was far more comprehensive but did include some of the reference groups such as An Taisce and the Sustainable Water Network Ireland, or SWAN.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed amendment also provides for a list of provisions of the MSP directive to be taken into account in the review of the NMPF.  I point out to the Deputies that sections 16 and 17 of the Bill already ensure compliance with the MSP directive for the purpose of maritime spatial planning.  We clearly disagree on this but I am happy with the text we have produced.  I must say I find it challenging to understand why Deputies are insisting on compliance with the recitals of the directive in addition to specified articles which are to be completed in any event, but this is an aside.  Our approach was discussed in detail on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment also refers to matters relating to marine protected areas, MPAs.  As I have previously indicated, this Bill simply does not legislate for this as marine protected areas are subject to separate legislation and there is no requirement to conflate the MSP directive with the marine strategy framework directive in one piece of enabling legislation.  Indeed, the latest MSP global international guide on maritime spatial planning prepared by UNESCO and the European Commission, published this year, reinforces the distinction between the two maritime governance tools.  I can, however, assure members that any review of the NMPF will be undertaken in the context of the prevailing regulatory environment.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the substance of the amendment, I am happy with the current NMPF and it forms the basis for all future plans and projects in the maritime area.  I will not be ripping it up after just a year and starting again.  I am happy that the legislation as set before this House is robust and in compliance with the directives that should be complied with.  Accordingly, I will be opposing this amendment.<\/p>  <p>  In the time I have left, I will try to address some of the points raised, in particular those raised by Deputies Eoin &Oacute; Broin and Cian O'Callaghan.  It is certainly the case, and I had hoped that the committee session yesterday would have reassured the Deputies, that the MPA process and the maritime area planning are interconnected pieces of work and that significant work has already been undertaken.  While the legislation is being drafted, it will probably be mid-year next year before we see a legalised definition of MPAs in an Irish context.  As Mr. Richard Cronin and Dr. Oliver &Oacute; Cadhla pointed out yesterday, significant work has been undertaken around the features we want to protect, looking at migratory species and a lot of the other interconnected elements of that, on which incredible work has been done.  The resources we are putting in are quite significant at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  We talked about interim measures.  We could certainly see significant progression on the 10% target that we missed for 2020 being achieved towards the end of 2022 and into 2023.  There is a good alignment of what we are trying to achieve.  Certainly, we will have to present to COP15 in Kunming next year and, again, we will be able to update all of these elements around our biodiversity targets.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Collins raised issues with regard to fisheries.  There was significant consultation, particularly on the MPAs, and we travelled coastal areas and met with fisher communities.  They all want the same thing.  Everybody wants marine protected areas and everybody wants a good regulatory environment to support this.  I think we are making significant progress.  I hope that, following yesterday&rsquo;s meeting, Deputies will be reassured that the processes are in tandem with each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100043#WW00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1638373920,"counter":417,"content":"<p>To be clear, nobody is talking about ripping up the marine planning framework.  There are many aspects of the marine planning framework which are very good, so it is important the Minister of State understands that we are not opposed to it or asking to rewrite it, and we would just like the review to happen earlier.  While the Minister of State is correct that the Government does have to comply with the various articles of various EU directives, there is a long history of weak, poor or non-compliance with said directives, which is, of course, why we are so often in front of the European Court of Justice and found in breach of similar articles.  Therefore, the value of citing those particular articles is to strengthen the need for compliance.<\/p> <p> I want to focus in the minute remaining to me on the lag between the marine protected areas legislation, with its crucial role in protecting marine biodiversity, and this Bill.  Deputy Matthews was being a little unfair in some of what he said.  It would have been helpful if he had remained in the Chamber because I fully agree with most of his contribution.  The really concerning point from what we heard yesterday is that we are not going to have formal, legally protected marine protected areas until 2023, 2024 and 2025 because the legislation will not be in place until 2023.  That is the clear import of the briefing yesterday by the Minister of State's officials.  Nobody was in any way suggesting the officials have not been working exceptionally hard, like the officials who have been working on this incredibly complex and technical legislation.  There is a volume of work happening behind the scenes that we have always acknowledged.

I asked one of the officials yesterday whether we are behind the curve on marine protected areas.  He had to say \"Yes\" and that the situation we are in is not ideal.  That is a blunt admission of the problem we face.  Only a tiny amount of our enormous maritime area, which is precious, is protected, because successive governments - not this one, in particular, but previous governments - have failed to protect it.  We are in a situation where we know corporate interests are lobbying explicitly, saying they do not want a plan-led approach to the development of our marine areas.  That is what the Irish Wind Energy Association said.  It does not want such a approach but, instead, a developer-led approach.<\/p>  <p>  Those same corporate interests have been given special status under the national marine planning framework.  That is a concern.  We want to know what protection there is in that respect.  We do not think they should have special status, to put it bluntly, given the agenda we know they have.  They do not want plan-led development.  They see the EU directives and proper planning and development as a block to their ability to make profit from our marine environment.  While they might say this is all being done in the name of climate action, it is worth repeating that the most important carbon sink, bar none, is the sea.

It does not make any sense to do something to tackle climate change that will potentially damage that role.<\/p>  <p>  It is disappointing that the Minister of State suggested that we are calling for the national marine planning framework to be ripped up.

I do not take the view that a parallel process is happening here.  Clearly, what is happening is that we are seeing the planning framework, which is needed, being put in place first and the marine protected areas being put in place after that.  It is not a parallel process.  I appreciate work is happening on both processes in parallel but the fact we are concluding this Bill shortly means its provisions will come into operation first, potentially several years ahead of marine protected areas being put in place in full.

The challenge is that they are not strong, particularly as they do not have to take into account to the same extent the ecosystems approach, which is crucial both to the maritime special planning directive and the marine protected areas legislation.  What would be reassuring is, while the good work is under way on the marine protected areas legislation and the subsequent designation, that there would be other interim measures or protections, particularly in respect of the seven locations where the legacy projects are to be advanced and clearly need to be advanced over the next year to two years, that could move us somewhere from where we would otherwise be, which is the EIA requirements and so forth under existing planning legislation and this Bill, to the stronger position of the marine protected areas.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State will not accept the amendment so I do not want to waste his time, but I am trying to press him to say that there have be additional interim measures.

That is the basic thrust of what we are trying to do.  In doing that the Members are making very sound points and sincere arguments.  I wish to make one point and a heartfelt plea with regard to smaller fishermen and inshore fishermen.  They are the people along both sides of what I call the Kenmare river and what some people call Kenmare Bay.<\/p> <p>All around our coast, we have small people who traditionally back over the years, like their fathers and grandfathers before them, had a boat.  Over the years it has evolved and they might have got smaller.  For some of them their enterprise might have got bigger and they adjusted it to suit their household.  However, they are under severe threat from pair trawling, something the Minister of State knows about.  It devastates a fishing habitat area.  It is a practice that must be questioned.  I can see the point of view of the people who own the boats and carry out pair trawling.  I know some of them and have debated the matter with them.  While I appreciate it is their livelihood, for all intents and purposes they are vacuuming up everything that is in the water, mixing it and making pulp out of it.  Expensive valuable fish get mixed up with mackerel and it is mushed up into pulp.  There is no individualisation or grading of the fish or anything like that.<\/p> <p> The traditional fishermen who might have gone out and fished for salmon or other fish are finding that all of a sudden the whole place has been vacuumed up, sucked up and mushed up, and they are left with nothing.  The Ceann Comhairle would pull me up if I were not talking to the subject at hand.  We are talking about the protection of a habitat and making sure it is there for the future.  If the breeding fish and everything else are taken out of the water, the place is left devoid of any life.  If someone comes along and sucks everything out, it is a very slow process for it to come back in again.  It goes against the grain of everything.  It is like going into a farmer's yard and taking the bull out of the herd.  If the bull is gone, there will be nothing after a certain length of time.  It is the same thing with breeding areas for fish and our habitats as we call them.  I just want to make that point.<\/p> <p> I do not want to take up too much time and interfere with other people.  I want to put that point on the record.  We need to look at that practice.  I am talking about a specific area.  I could talk about other parts of the coastline in County Kerry that I know most about.  I am giving the example of the Kenmare river.  How does it make sense when a big trawler pair trawls, hoovers up everything from one side to the other and takes everything out of the middle?  Absolutely nothing is left for the small traditional fisherman and his or her part-time living is gone.  We cannot stand over that.<\/p> <p> I very much respect that if I met one of the people who owns those trawlers, they would say, \"What about me?\"  I can see where they are coming from, but the practice of pair trawling is fundamentally questionable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100046#ZZ00400","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638376320,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I will first address some of the issues before I give a comment specific to the amendment.  We can all agree with Deputy Michael Healy-Rae that that type of activity is completely unsustainable.  When we travelled around the coastal areas of the country, the last place we entered was Portmagee.  We are very clear that the fishers in particular want marine protection for their own activities.  That is not to say that no activities may take place in marine protected areas.  It is just setting about the objectives and the types of features we want to protect within protected areas, which will include heritage fishing and traditional fishing.  We want to ensure that type of activity is protected within the marine environment.  We were always clear that this is not just about the marine.  It is about people in coastal communities.  The points the Deputy made are critical to what we are trying to achieve with marine protected areas.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan spoke about sensitivity mapping.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, we started from behind the curve relative to other countries, but we are rapidly catching up and we are putting significant resources into this area.  I am confident that we will have the legislative part of it, hopefully towards the first half of 2022, and that will give us the legislative context for marine protected areas, which is critically important.<\/p>  <p>  I stress that this is not an either-or situation.  We are trying to achieve the best for marine protection and to have an active marine environment - a blue economy - while protecting blue carbon, seagrasses and all the other features we also want to protect in the marine.  As I said previously, there is already within the planning system a requirement for appropriate assessments and SEAs in all developments.<\/p>  <p>  This amendment again conflates the MSP directive with the marine strategy framework directive and seeks to upend the implementation of one over the other.  Both will need to be provided for on the Statute Book and we are acting on that.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding marine protected areas, the progress to deliver the commitments contained in the programme for Government have been significant and encouraging.  Following on from the independent expert advisory group report published in January of this year and in tandem with the review of the analysis of submissions received through the subsequent public consultation process from February to July, we have commenced work on developing a general scheme of new MPA legislation.  The development of this legislation is expected to continue into 2022.  Officials from our Department provided a progress update on marine protected areas to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  The substance of this amendment is about protection of the marine environment and it requires that nothing happens in the maritime area until interim measures are put in place to protect potential MPAs.  I am not sure that the Deputies fully appreciate the impact of this amendment on local coastal communities.  I have previously said that this Bill is for all maritime users.  This amendment would have significant and severe consequences on local fisheries, ports, harbours, tourist facilities, local boat clubs and persons who privately own parts of the current foreshore.  None of these would be expanded, amended or improved until the work referred to in this amendment was completed.<\/p>  <p>  Existing rights under Part 15 of the Planning and Development Act would be lost.  Where is the justification for such severe action?  Where is the timeline for these measures?  How will the public know when they can start to interact with their maritime area again?  There is an overreach here that impacts on all maritime users.  As the Deputy put it on Committee Stage, the net has been cast far too wide.<\/p>  <p>  There is no definition of exactly what these interim measures are or how they would interact with the relevant provisions in either the MAC assessment criteria or the criteria coastal planning authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to when assessing planning applications.  There is no indication as to how they would relate to the maritime licensing system being proposed, which is separate from both the MAC and planning parts.  This is extremely important from a legislative point of view.  How would it work?

We should have some additional level of interim protections for those specific geographic locations by, for example, ensuring that the sensitivity mapping was accelerated for those areas or when the map legislation is in place that those areas are considered first.

However, the wording of the amendment does not deal in specifics, although I understand the Deputy's point from his comments.  He spoke about relevant projects but the wording would place unsureness in the planning system for everything we want to do both in the near shore and offshore.  This could have an effect on recreation and tourism.<\/p>  <p>  I fully understand and accept where the Deputy is coming from regarding interim measures but the amendment has not been drafted in a way that would create sureness in a system.  It would, in contrast, bring unsureness to the system and it might create further difficulties for environmental protection.  If we go for planning consent and we have undefined interim measures in place, it could create further confusion, which might result in actions we do not want.  We are trying to put in place a fit-for-purpose planning regime that caters for the protection of a fragile environment and gives sureness for those who wish to develop in the maritime area.  We are not just talking about the offshore renewable industry in this respect but recreational development, including piers, marinas and all of that fantastic coastal recreation opportunity we have around the country.  It will also include fishers.<\/p>  <p>  We must be careful in writing legislation as we are making the law.  It is not a policy document that would allow us to go further and describe interim measures.  I have learned a valuable lesson about drafting amendments, which is that we must draft amendments in a specific way so they can be legally enforceable without creating further confusion.  They should create sureness in the planning system rather than more confusion.  We want a sure planning system.<\/p>  <p>  We know we will develop the offshore area and the potential that exists not just in the seven relevant projects but in our programme for Government, which provides for 30 GW of offshore floating development.  That will happen off the west coast at some point as well.  The technology is not quite there yet but I can see over the next five to ten years this technology improving so we can harness the fantastic wind speed we have out there.  We have some of the best wind speeds in Europe.  When writing the legislation, we want to provide sureness for such development rather than include measures that may create uncertainty, confusion and perhaps bring decisions in the planning process before the courts because \"interim measure\" has not been defined, for example.  We have not even defined what is a \"marine protected area\".  These must be clearly defined, along with the intention of creating the areas, how we will manage and monitor them and how we will make changes as necessary when power moves on.<\/p>  <p>  We want to have good environmental protection across the board and any development, whether on land or at sea, in certain sensitive areas and all these maritime areas, will require an environmental impact assessment.  That will provide data to ensure we can protect the marine environment.  We have heard that we are short much scientific data and much of the detail we need for those environments.  That is so we can be sure the protections we are putting in place are suitable for what is in the environment, which is critical.  We know why we create special areas of conservation or special protected areas under EU directives and the wildlife Acts.  It is because of the habitats and species that exist in them.

He has not addressed the substantial point.  It seems there is agreement that there will be an interregnum in which we will not have done what we should for marine protected areas with respect to these relevant projects.  What is the answer to the question?  What happens if we discover later that they should have been designated as protected areas?  We are asking for interim measures to be put in place quickly.<\/p>  <p>  If this happened and we assessed whether sites should be protected, consents could be issued afterwards.  There is an existing regime for foreshore licences and all the rest of it.  I do not buy the argument that nothing else can happen.  In any case, we are asking for this to be done quickly.

The purpose of this amendment is to be clear that the public participation statement should be prepared at the initiation of the review of the national marine planning framework, NMPF, or the marine spatial plans rather than at that publication of a draft revised plan emanating from that review.  The references to subsections (2)(a) and (3)(a) of section 17 are to be deleted and replaced with by references to the initiation of the reviews at subsections (2) or (3) of section 17.<\/p> <p> In effect, the competent authority must provide for public participation from the earliest stage and it must be ongoing throughout the review and development of maritime spatial plans.  This amendment is proposed on foot of a commitment made by the Minister of State at Committee Stage to review the timing of the publication of the public participation statement.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 17 clarifies this for DMAPs and provides that the public participation statement is published by the competent authority as soon as possible after the approval of the DMAP proposal.  This amendment places consideration of the public participation process at the earliest possible stage and will ensure that public participation will be ongoing throughout the developments of DMAPs.  Involving the public at this early stage will be crucial to influencing and shaping the development of plans.  The amendment arises from a commitment given by the Minister of State at Committee Stage to review this issue.<\/p> <p> These are further amendments that I am pleased to say arose from collaborative discussions on Committee Stage.  It is evident that we need to ensure and clarify that public participation on marine spatial plans and designated maritime area plans should occur at the earliest possible stage in preparation of these plans.

It would upset and interfere with the intention of the DMAP concept.  I accordance with section 20 of the Bill, designated maritime area plans may be prepared in respect of specified activities for one or more designated geographical or sectoral areas, or for both.  The procedures as set out in the Bill are sufficiently flexible to enable the development of regional, local or sectoral plans by a designated competent authority, subject to the oversight of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Oireachtas approval.  DMAPs will be prepared in the context of the existing NMPF and are required to specify the objectives of the NMPF it seeks to attain.<\/p>  <p>  The DMAP concept differs from the national maritime spatial plan which provides and overall framework for the entire maritime area, incorporating ecological, economic and social priorities.  The NMPF provides an holistic overarching policy position on MSP in Ireland and is the State's primary response to commitments under the MSP directive.  DMAPs should not duplicate this but should operate within the general framework and enhance it by responding to more specific maritime planning needs, be they sectoral or localised.  It is therefore not appropriate to apply all the requirements of an national marine plan to a sectoral or geographically specific plan as to do so would undermine the purpose and functionality of a DMAP.  However, in accordance with section 20(4) of the Bill, it is the Minister's responsibility in reviewing a DMAP proposal to consider whether or not it satisfies the requirements of the MSP directive and, again, when reviewing the draft DMAP.<\/p>  <p>  The overarching objective of this amendment to comply with certain provisions is provided for by reference to the NMPF in sections 21, 22 and 28, and the MSP directive in sections 20, 23, 24 and 28.  In addition, the requirements referred to in section 17(1) will already flow through the NMPF and MSP in any event, but may not be applicable to every DMAP proposed.  Where they are relevant, they will be adhered to.<\/p>  <p>  In short, this amendment as proposed would undermine the flexibility required for the DMAP concept and is not actually necessary, and, as such, I will not be accepting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100049#CCC01400","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638377520,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1638377520,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 17:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 35, lines 14 and 15, to delete &ldquo;complying with section 22&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the relevant proposal has been approved under section 21(4)(a)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100049#CCC01600","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638377520,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1638377520,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 18:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 37, to delete lines 16 to 23 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(3) Where the Minister ascertains an inconsistency referred to in subsection (2), he or she shall&mdash; <blockquote> \t(a) make a recommendation in writing to the competent authority (D) to amend the draft DMAP to address the inconsistency, or<br \/><br \/>(b) in relation only to an inconsistency in respect of paragraphs (b) to (e) of subsection (2) give notice in writing to the competent authority (D) of the inconsistency and in that notice state that the draft DMAP does not need to be amended to avoid or mitigate the inconsistency,<br \/><br \/>as the Minister thinks fit in all the circumstances of the case, and shall state their reasons in full for such a decision.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>Section 24(3) of the Bill allows the Minister to okay a designated marine area plan that is, potentially, inconsistent with the MSP directive.

I will go in reverse order.  We do not believe that liquefied natural gas, LNG, infrastructure of any description should get maritime area consents because we are supposed to be tackling climate change.  We know we must reduce fossil fuel use, and it runs counter to that requirement to entertain the possibility of building new infrastructure to bring liquefied natural gas into this country.  We still rely on natural gas, obviously, but to build new infrastructure to import LNG would run counter to the stated commitment of the Government, and indeed of all parties, to reduce fossil fuel use and to combat climate change.  Therefore, we think such proposals should simply not be considered for maritime area consents.<\/p><p>Similarly, anything to do with the extraction of fossil fuels should not be considered for maritime consents.  One of the issues that concerned my community in recent years was the move by Providence Resources to try to drill for oil and gas close to the shore, on the Kish Bank, which is only 6 km to 10 km offshore.  There were huge concerns about that potential development on many levels.  In addition to local environmental and community concerns, there was also the major issue of the need to keep fossil fuels in the ground.  In that regard, we should not in any way be facilitating further exploration for or extraction of fossil fuels which damage the environment.  We do not believe that any such developments should be considered for maritime area consents.<\/p><p>Finally, and perhaps more controversially, but we believe this is in line with the practice in rest of Europe, we are proposing not to consider major industrial offshore wind developments closer to the shore than 12 nautical miles, the traditional foreshore distance, on the grounds that the undoubted general pattern across Europe is to move these big industrial wind farms off to a reasonable distance from the coast.  One document I saw from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy in Germany stated the average distance for a major industrial development of wind farms in Germany is about 53 km.  I also read a document produced by the Crown Estate, the body which represents the British Crown.  It was an interesting publication about the development of offshore wind in the UK and the plans there in this regard.  The base assumption there, in respect of looking at the costs of developing offshore wind farms, was that they would be developed 60 km offshore.  That was the Crown Estate central scenario for looking at costs.<\/p><p>It is interesting information when we consider the relevant projects we are worried about getting in under the wire of the marine protected areas.  I refer to those areas that should be there and where there are plans for developments, for example, on the Kish Bank in my area and for the Codling Wind Park project further down the Wicklow coast, that are only 6 km to 10 km offshore.  Such projects would have a huge impact on those areas.  We are talking about objects that are significantly higher than the two Poolbeg chimney stacks, and approximately 60 or 70 of these enormous things will be located in close proximity to the shore.  They will impact on fishermen and on a sensitive landscape and seascape that is important on many levels for the community and for Dublin Bay generally as a tourist amenity and precious marine environment.  We should be following best practice in Europe, which is to push that scale of industrial development further out to sea to ensure it does not have those negative impacts.<\/p><p>I say that as someone who believes that we must urgently develop offshore renewable resources.  We must, though, have a buffer zone in place that is similar to the sorts of distances that are now becoming the norm across Europe.  I am sure the Minister of State will say that developments are allowed closer to shore in other parts of Europe, but the general pattern is they are being pushed further out to sea.  As I said, the document produced by the Crown Estate in Britain used a distance of 60 km as its base assumption, which is roughly ten times further out than the sort of thing being entertained right along our east coast.  Therefore, what we are seeking in this sense is a win-win situation.  We need offshore wind developments, but we must also protect sensitive coastal environments and the communities, the stakeholders and the people who make a living in those areas.  We must also protect the marine biology and biodiversity of those nearshore sites.  That is the logic of this amendment.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say in response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100051#EEE01700","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1638378720,"counter":534,"content":"<p>This amendment effectively seeks to restrict significantly the scope of activities that can be considered for a maritime area consent, MAC, in a specific zone and, in so doing, to control development in the maritime area.  It is important to remember a MAC is merely a right to occupy a part of the maritime area, conditional on securing other necessary approvals.  It is not a permission to undertake works, development or activities provided for under the Planning Acts or in licensing, and it is not a development control tool.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed amendment would unduly limit the potential of the maritime area to deliver renewable energy and, in so doing, limit the State&rsquo;s ability to meet our climate action targets.<\/p> <p>The planning process is the appropriate place to determine the suitability of development in accordance with the objectives of the NMPF.  This goes for wind farms, minerals exploration and installations for the storage of gasses or minerals.<\/p> <p> This amendment, it must be said, is singular in its intent but far-reaching in its impact.  It treats all parts of the maritime area as one singular, homogenous entity and has little or no regard for local marine geomorphological conditions.  The impacts of this amendment on the west coast, in particular, are of great concern given the changes in ocean depth beyond 12 nautical miles in parts.  I am not convinced that any consideration has been given to the impact of this proposal on our renewable energy targets. <\/p> <p> The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is carrying out a review of the security of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply, which is focusing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050.  This review will consider how the Government&rsquo;s increased ambition in renewable energy and the development of new indigenous clean energy sources will reduce fossil energy use.  Can the Deputy assure this House that this proposal will not negatively affect our ambitions in this regard? <\/p> <p> On mining and mineral exploration, Chapter 17 of the NMPF points out that future exploration and mining for scheduled minerals in the marine area is not anticipated at this point and that any potential activity in this area will depend on future exploration and mining technologies and national policy on mineral exploration and mining.  Indeed, the Government&rsquo;s draft policy statement on mineral exploration and mining, published in July of this year, proposes that mineral exploration and mining activity should not take place offshore or on the Irish seabed until such time as sufficient data are available to assess adequately the impacts of any such potential mining activity.  This is not an immediate concern.<\/p> <p> The NMPF also notes the security of energy supply cannot be examined in isolation from sustainability.  It also states natural gas storage installations and activities could have potential adverse ecological and environmental impacts, which would need to be identified, analysed and mitigated against as part of the planning and development management stages of marine planning. In short, natural gas storage may be looked at in the round in the future during proper policy development, but we will not curtail options in this Bill.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the concerns raised by the Deputies in this amendment.  However, I do not consider that primary legislation should be used to control future development.  The legislation provides for a robust planning system, which will assess development in accordance with Government policy and ensure the environment is adequately protected.  We use evidence to inform policy, and the policies inform the decision.  Development control in primary legislation is simply not appropriate, particularly where it is aimed at frustrating the attainment of our energy security and climate action objectives.

It begs the point.  While I realise the Minister of State said that, in the context of the NMPF, there was public consultation, this was all new to those at the public meeting held in my area, the Save Our Seafront meeting.  There are still many people who have not been reached regarding significant changes, plans and objectives for the development of the marine area and how these may affect them.  We still have a way to go in terms of the level of engagement with the public if they are to understand fully the issues at stake and which we are discussing here.  That is not to diss the engagement the officials have had but we have a long way to go yet.<\/p>  <p>  The public needs to know about the Real Map of Ireland and the sheer size of Ireland&rsquo;s marine area.  It is enormous.  The size is multiples of that of the land of this country.  Therefore, we have a huge resource.  That means we have a large area in which to develop offshore wind energy generation.  Consequently, I just do not accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s suggestion that our having a buffer zone involving a required minimum distance from the coast precludes us from developing offshore wind energy generation.  I have not heard a convincing response, if any, from the Government or Minister of State as to why, increasingly, the rest of Europe is pushing industrial offshore wind facilities much greater distances out.  Judging from the Crown document to which I referred, the central scenario in respect of cost involved a distance of 60 km.  In other words, the authors did not see any major difference between 60 km and closer in terms of the cost of development.  There is no major cost implication to pushing the industrial wind farms a bit further out so as to have a win&ndash;win situation.

The Irish seabed drops off quite significantly.  It would be useful if the Minister of State put on the record of the House his considerations regarding Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s amendment.  Much of the time, I find myself going two thirds of the way with Deputy Boyd Barrett.  That is probably illustrative of how broad the left spectrum is.  I agree with him on some fronts but not on all.  With two thirds of the points he makes, and two thirds of the content of his amendment, the Labour Party and I would agree, especially regarding mineral extraction.  The Deputy&rsquo;s view on liquid natural gas is very much <i>ad idem<\/i>with the Labour Party&rsquo;s policy, but I have concerns about imposing the kinds of constraints he is seeking to introduce on planning for turbines.  It seems to me that even the reference to five turbines or 5 MW is quite random.  I am not quite sure what the justification is.  When I was watching the debate on the monitor in my office earlier, I heard the Deputy say it is an effort to try to restrict industrial turbine operations, as I believe he described them, but I do not understand that.  If we restricted them and accepted the merits of the amendment in the context of the restrictions concerning wind turbines, it would be practically impossible for us to meet our renewable energy targets.  We certainly could not support that.  It would be useful if the Minister of State could talk us through the nature of the Irish seabed and the kind of infrastructure we need to introduce there if we are to meet our renewable energy targets for wind energy.<\/p><p>My understanding is the bases of the kinds of turbines in question have to be 50 m to 60 m below the surface.  The nature of the seabed in the Irish Sea limits us.  As I understand it, we do not have the required technology yet to introduce the kinds of floating turbine platforms envisaged elsewhere.  Therefore, it would be unwise to restrict ourselves in the way Deputy Boyd Barrett is proposing.  Clearly, he has concerns about the impact of some planned projects off the coast of his constituency.  It is fair to say there are concerns in my constituency over certain planned projects, but while taking account of some genuine concerns that might be expressed, for example, by those involved in the fishing industry, whose points on turbines I hope can be addressed, we must take a comprehensive and holistic view of renewable energy infrastructure.

As Deputies, we have made our position on that clear.  LNG requires storage and infrastructure.  People have concerns about fracked gas being imported.  We are against the whole concept of fracking and the extraction of gas that way.  Then we consider putting in an LNG storage facility, where we would import gas from other countries facing all the consequences that fracking brings.

Future exploration and mining for scheduled minerals in our marine waters is not anticipated at this point in time.  Concerns have been raised regarding the lack of research and data available to inform a comprehensive understanding of the potential impact of mining in the marine space.  Discussion at EU level has referenced the need to better understand the effects of deep seabed mining (i.e. mining in areas of the seabed beyond national jurisdiction) on the marine environment, biodiversity and human activities.  It has been proposed that in advance of deep seabed mining taking place, it is important to ensure that the risks are fully understood and that the technologies and operational practices are able to demonstrate no serious harm to the environment, in line with the precautionary principle. Given the limited scientific knowledge currently available, it is proposed that mineral exploration and mining activity does not take place offshore or on the Irish seabed until such time as sufficient data is available to adequately assess the impacts of any such potential mining activity. <\/blockquote>  <p>Deputy Gould mentioned fracked gas.

I consider myself somebody who keeps an eye on things, who has read into things and who knows a bit, and I do not know the answer to a lot of these questions.  I do not know why they have floating wind off the coast of Scotland, for example, yet the Minister of State is telling us it is not really practical.

We are concerned about that.  As I said on our earlier amendment, if one does not have a MAC, one cannot do anything.  One thing leads on to another.  The Government and the officials will say that a MAC only gives a right to occupy.  It is, however, also a first step on the road, without which one cannot do anything else that comes afterwards.  We are dealing with new legislation and we are in new territory.  As one thing can lead onto another, we are not convinced that the assertion that a MAC does not have an environmental impact is necessarily going to be the case.  I am not saying that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is being disingenuous but we are in new territory.  We are setting up a process where we do not quite know how it is going to play out.  Therefore, potentially, MACs will have a significant impact and people may wish to challenge the granting of a MAC and take judicial reviews against the granting of a MAC.  If they do, they will not get the protection that one would get under the Aarhus Convention for things that are deemed to have an environmental impact, because this Bill does not consider the MAC as having an environmental impact.  One would not get those protections and could be screwed, to use a colloquialism, for costs and discouraged from doing it.  The Aarhus Convention gives some protection when a person takes a judicial review on the grounds of environmental impact.  The amendments we are putting in try to ensure that people are protected against major costs when they seek a judicial review against a decision to grant a maritime area consent, MAC.<\/p><p>Will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle please remind me of the amendments we are discussing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100055#JJJ00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1638381120,"counter":576,"content":"<p>We are discussing amendments Nos. 42, 44 and 49 to 51 , inclusive, together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100055#JJJ00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1638381120,"counter":577,"content":"<p>Trying to keep up with this is difficult, but it is important.

That access to justice is important.  I do not really buy the narrative that we often hear, especially from the developers on land, that the big problem is all of the people who object.

This is about trying to not have the chilling effect of costs potentially being unloaded on people who seek justice, particularly when, most of the time, they will be dealing with big corporations or big commercial interests that have plenty of money, plenty of legal wherewithal and so on.  What we are trying to do is ensure they have that right of recourse.  As I said, we do not accept the Bill's position on the MAC, or the right to occupy, even if it does not allow for development.  We think it could have displacement effects on that particular area and, therefore, have environmental impacts.

We have just supported three amendments in the Finance Bill and there will be many other sections that, as the Minister knows but refuses to acknowledge, we will support through the passage of the Bill today and tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>It does not suit the Government's narrative because the reality is it has done diddly-squat about supporting our front-line workers with bonuses.  It took it six months even to get to a point where it does not have a memorandum going to the Cabinet.  The Minister cannot even give a commitment today, when we are dealing with the final Stages of the Finance Bill, on whether those bonus payments will be subject to tax.<\/p> <p> This amendment deals with another issue in the context of the pandemic.  It relates to the cross-Border workers and I raised it with the Minister on Committee Stage.  It should be noted that cross-Border workers face the prospect of working from home in the context of continued public health advice, both North and South, possibly into 2022, with no clarity on the future of the scheme and its operation.  The Minister, like me and any other Member of the House, cannot predict how long the guidance will be in place or whether it will be reintroduced later in the year.  The pandemic does not follow the pattern we may want it to follow.  One cannot predict the future path of this virus, what restrictions will be needed or what guidance will be offered in any part of the island.  Therefore, certainty is required for cross-Border workers who, without action, will face a financial penalty in just over six weeks as they will not be able to avail of the relief.  I raised this on Committee Stage and it is a serious and genuine issue.  I urge the Minister to act quickly and decisively to extend the Covid-19 waiver for cross-Border workers.<\/p> <p> The issue of cross-Border workers was raised during the debates on last year's Finance Bill, specifically in the context of people who reside in the State but who work in the North and avail of the domestic tax relief.  It was discussed again earlier last month on Committee Stage of this Bill.  The trans-border workers' relief is for people who are resident in the State who travel weekly or daily to work in another country or part of this island which is another jurisdiction and who pay tax in that other country.  The tax relief is not normally available for Irish residents who work from home in the State, but in light of the unprecedented circumstances due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting public health restrictions to limit movement, for the tax years of 2020 and 2021 the Revenue Commissioners confirmed that concessional treatment for the relief would apply whereby if employees were required to work from home in the State during Covid-19, such days working at home would not preclude the individual from being entitled to claim this relief provided all other conditions for the relief were met.  That is due to expire in six weeks.  It is likely the guidance will apply in January, thus ensuring these individuals who are asked for all our sakes to work from home will not be able to avail of the relief.<\/p> <p> The relief effectively removes the earnings from a qualifying foreign employment from the liability to Irish tax where foreign tax has been paid on those earnings and such tax is not refundable, in simple terms.  The effect of the measure means that individuals who qualify for the relief will not pay any Irish tax on their employment income.  Irish tax will only arise where the individual has income other than income from a qualifying foreign employment.  In fairness, the Minister said the operation of the trans-border workers' relief would be examined as part of the tax strategy group papers, and that happened earlier this year.  The group considered all the relevant matters, including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers and the established principles of international tax.  The paper concluded that \"it appears impracticable from a legal perspective, in terms of taxing rights, as well as challenging from a policy perspective when having regard to the interests of the wider body of taxpayers encompassing all Irish resident employees and employers, to place the concessional treatment on a statutory footing\".  The tax strategy group reached this conclusion based on the issue of taxing rights, equity and competitiveness.<\/p> <p> There are issues raised in the paper that are warranted and require due consideration, but there are other issues that fail to be addressed.  Section 6 of the paper considered social insurance and noted that social insurance rates in the North are higher than those in the South.  However, the example in section 3.2, which considered equity, failed to take account of employee social insurance contributions when comparing the effective tax rates paid in both jurisdictions.  I believe this is a flaw that undermined the comparison and I would welcome a comment from the Minister on that.<\/p> <p> The proposal of the Cross-Border Workers Coalition was to limit the number of days cross-Border workers could work from the State to 183 days while still being able to claim the relief.  It is proposed that other controls could be introduced, such as limiting the scope of those in non-effective roles and the consideration of a salary threshold.  A number of proposals have been made.  Given this is the case and given what should be the importance of developing the all-Ireland economy and the move to remote working, I believe this warrants and requires further examination of this relief.  Its extension is also warranted given the prospect of continuing health guidance, as I mentioned, with regard to remote working in the months ahead.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment and to go back to the drawing board and re-examine this issue which is affecting cross-Border workers, families and businesses.  It is necessary that the Minister extend the relief in the context of Covid-19 and undertake work with my colleague, the Minister of Finance, Mr. Conor Murphy, in the context of the North-South Ministerial Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100058#MMM02000","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638383220,"counter":615,"content":"<p>In the amendment the Deputy is requesting a comprehensive report on the trans-border workers' relief.  I acknowledge Deputy Doherty has been raising this issue since the Covid pandemic changed work patterns and work flows on this island.  This issue was discussed during the debates on last year's Finance Bill, when I undertook that the relief would be examined as part of the work of the tax strategy group, TSG, for 2021.  This commitment was fulfilled and it was examined in a TSG paper.  The Deputy also raised the issue of the relief on Committee Stage and, in particular, the Revenue Commissioners' temporary concession for the years 2020 and 2021 that was introduced in light of the exceptional and unprecedented circumstances arising from the pandemic.  The concession provides that employees will still be entitled to claim trans-border workers' relief where they might be required to work from home in the State due to restrictions, provided all other conditions of the relief are met.<\/p>  <p>  As matters stand, this concession is due to lapse at the end of the year.  The Deputy has asked if the concession would be extended further due to the recent public health advice recommending that everyone should work from home unless it is necessary to attend a workplace in person.  The Revenue Commissioners have been reviewing this matter and, having regard to the current circumstances, I can confirm that the Revenue Commissioners will continue to adopt a pragmatic and flexible approach by allowing for a further extension of the temporary concession.  This extension will apply for the period of time in 2022 during which the public health advice recommends everyone should work from home unless it is necessary to attend the workplace in person.  The Revenue Commissioners will issue further guidance on this extension in due course.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, with regard to the Deputy's request for a further report on the trans-border workers' relief, a comprehensive examination of the issue was undertaken by the tax strategy group.  This encompassed very detailed consideration of all relevant matters, including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers and the established principles of international tax.  Ordinarily, to avail of the relief, the duties of employment must be performed wholly outside the State and in a country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement.  The relief was not designed to apply to remote working scenarios, and when examining whether the temporary concession should be placed on a statutory footing, the review identified a number of significant concerns from a policy perspective having regard to the interest of the wider body of taxpayers encompassing Irish-resident employers and employees.<\/p>  <p>  The review noted that if the temporary concession regarding trans-border workers' relief was placed on a statutory footing, it would allow residents in the State to avail of the relief while working in the State and pay no tax to the Exchequer in respect of the foreign employment income.  Where employment duties are carried out in the State, Ireland has a taxing right over that income.  Not to tax that income would be asking the State to give up a taxing right it rightfully has under the Irish tax code.  It is not clear why Ireland would not exercise those taxing rights and it is also unclear how another jurisdiction would then have taxing rights over income earned in the State in respect of duties carried out in the State.<\/p>  <p>  The review identified issues relating to equity for Irish taxpayers.  Currently, there may be different tax liabilities and different effective tax rates between those Irish residents who can avail of the relief compared with those who cannot avail of the relief.  However, there is a key distinguishing factor in that the employment duties are exercised outside the State for a non-resident employer.  The move to increased levels of remote working, including blended working arrangements, within the State weakens that critical distinction.<\/p> <p>If trans-border workers' relief were to be relaxed to allow for work carried out in the State to qualify for the relief, there would no longer be a distinguishing factor between Irish residents as both sets of residents would be exercising their employment duties in the State.<\/p> <p> In such circumstances some, those with Irish-resident employers, would be liable to tax at the Irish tax rate - income tax and USC - and the potentially higher effective tax rate, while others, those with non-resident employers, would be liable to tax at the tax rates in the other jurisdiction and a potentially lower effective tax rate.  This would give rise to a question as to how Irish income tax rules could apply the different tax treatment for Irish income tax to an Irish resident solely because of the location of his or her employer as opposed to the location where that resident carries out his or her employment duties, as is the current position.  From the perspective of all resident employees in the State, it would raise issues of equity and fairness that are fundamental features of our income tax system.  It is unclear how this would be sustainable and acceptable from the perspective of all Irish-resident taxpayers.<\/p> <p> The review also found that the competitive position of Irish-based employers or Irish-based activities could potentially be undermined.  This is particularly the case where salaries would be subject to lower rates of tax.  That may have implications for Irish-based employers' cost base and their ability to attract and retain employees from the talent pool.<\/p> <p> On Committee Stage, Deputy Doherty suggested that if the temporary concession were not extended, individuals would be double taxed if they are working at home.  It is unclear how this would be the case.  Ireland has an extensive network of double taxation agreements, including with the United Kingdom, which have the effect of relieving double taxation on the same income source.  If an individual does not qualify for trans-border workers' relief, he or she may be entitled to relief from double taxation under the terms of the relevant double taxation agreement.  Thus, a double taxation charge would not arise for cross-Border workers.<\/p> <p> It is important to note that Ireland is somewhat unique in having such a relief in its domestic tax code.  There is no comparable measure in the UK tax code nor in many countries in mainland Europe that share land borders.  This issue was reviewed in depth in recent months, including in the report we have discussed.  I have also confirmed that, providing that all the conditions for the relief are met, Revenue's temporary concession will be further extended into 2022 for the period while the public health advice recommends working from home.  Revenue will issue further advice on this extension in due course.<\/p> <p> Therefore, in the absence of a new or compelling change in circumstances, a further review is not necessary now, which is why I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100059#NNN00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638383820,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I welcome Revenue's pragmatic approach on the extension of this waiver allowing those individuals to avail of this relief during the time of public health restrictions, which may go into next year.

All the statistics indicate the Border region is one of the most neglected and poorest with the lowest median income.  The problem here is the practicalities for a company in, for example, Derry or Strabane with employees literally from across the bridge who can currently avail of this relief.  That is fine.  That means they are not taxed in the State because they work in Strabane.  However, the problem is, if they work from home, it is extremely messy.  That is the way with some people's work patterns and I am not talking about working from home 365 days a year.  We need to introduce a pilot scheme to provide a set number of days when individuals are allowed to work from home in the context of the island of Ireland.  I am not talking about people who fly to London, Manchester, Glasgow or elsewhere for their work.  This would benefit the Border region and especially employers in the region.

I will continue to monitor the issue.  I believe we will get to a point where Covid is no longer the presence it is in our country and on our island as it is now.  When we reach that point, I believe there will be a change in work practices and in how and where people work.  The broader change is under way, not just on this issue but on the mobility of workers, where they work, the work they do and where and how they pay tax that will pose questions for the tax regimes in open economies like ours where people have considerable mobility.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue, through the decision it is has made, deals with this matter while the public health guidance is in place.  While I will not accept the amendment, I have twice met the group involved in this proposal and I will continue to monitor the matter.  I accept it raises issues for those who are affected by it.

The Minister referred to the principle that somebody who is resident here is taxed here, but that is not the case with the trans-border workers' relief.  That is the whole point here.  People who are resident here in this State and who work full time across the Border are taxed there because they can avail of this relief.  I make this point in the context of Covid which has challenged everybody and the way our work patterns are moving.  If an individual is working from home, they are not able to avail of this relief even for a handful of days.

As we emerge from the pandemic, it is clearer than ever before that we need to be more agile.  We need to be a more responsive State.  A stronger social safety net must be provided for those who need it.  We need a health service that works and a public childcare option for parents that is genuinely affordable.  This cannot be done unless we are willing to make the necessary investments and look at the sources of revenue for that necessary expenditure.<\/p><p>We know the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will examine these options, as the Economic and Social Research Institute has done.  However, if we look at the programme for Government, we can see that basically all tax-raising measures are excluded unless they are behavioural-type measures suggested by the Government and we know the purpose of those measures is not to raise taxes, but to change behaviour.  Therefore, the additional resources will not be generated.  This amendment seeks to introduce a levy of 3% on incomes above &euro;140,000.  It would be an additional 3% on the portion of an individual income above &euro;140,000.  The amendment also seeks to taper the tax credits on incomes above &euro;100,000.  On incomes between &euro;100,000 and &euro;140,000, tax credit would be tapered out.  I am mindful that the Labour Party across the water introduced a measure like this many years ago in Britain that it is still being maintained, even by the Conservative Party.  Tax credits play an important role in our taxation system.  They are intended to support those on low, middle and modest incomes.  When people reach &euro;100,000 in individual income, it is fair that they do not lose all their tax credits overnight at that threshold, but that they start to lose them as they earn above that amount.<\/p><p>These two measures combined would bring in more than &euro;400 million.  That is money that could be invested in the areas I outlined in terms of a stronger social safety net, better childcare and reduced fees for children's services, or indeed in making our health system fit for purpose.  I commend amendments Nos. 7 and 8.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100062#QQQ00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1638385020,"counter":623,"content":"<p>In speaking to this amendment, I am always concerned and worried about what I consider to be an additional wealth tax.

Deputy Doherty's amendments refer to reports on the tapering out of income tax credits on certain incomes and the introduction of a levy on high incomes and new income tax rates across particular income ranges.  I will make the point that in order to fund all of the improved public services and the social security net Deputy Doherty refers to, we need an economy that is growing.  In order to have an economy that is growing, we need to have a competitive environment here in Ireland in which jobs are created and kept.  The competitiveness of our personal tax code matters in that regard.  That is the key reason I will not be accepting the amendments Deputy Doherty is putting forward which propose that these reports be prepared.<\/p>  <p>  Let us examine the impact of the Deputy's proposals on the marginal tax rates.  Were the personal tax credit of &euro;1,650 to be tapered out at a rate of 5% per &euro;1,000, the marginal tax rate at those income levels at which the tapering would take place would be just over 60%.  Once that tapering has happened, an income of more than &euro;120,000 would revert to a marginal rate of 52%.  I believe that taxation of &euro;60,000 on an income, albeit a high income, would make it more difficult to attract jobs into Ireland.  We want to get consultants back to Ireland to work in our hospitals.  I look at how much they are paid.  A marginal tax rate of 60% would be an impediment to our efforts to get consultants back and to bring to Ireland the jobs and decision makers in companies who are critical to the growth and retention of foreign direct investment in Ireland.  That is the main reason I am opposed to the policy Deputy Doherty is seeking to advance through his proposed reports.  <\/p>  <p>  While I accept that there would be a potential gain in revenue from the measures being proposed, this gain would be threatened and lost over time as a result of the effect the measures would have on the competitiveness of our tax code and on the kind of incentives we need to ensure that those who can make a valuable contribution to our economy and public services, who I accept are paid at a high level, do not face marginal tax rates that high.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's point, I would never attempt to put him under my thumb, although I do disagree with him.  I assure the Deputy that the Government does not have an agenda to extract money from or target the ESB.  I accept that what we are doing has an impact on the price of energy and contributes to it.  The Deputy mentioned diesel.  We are making changes to taxation to try to change behaviour over time and, while this behaviour is changing, to bring in revenue that we can, in turn, invest in getting our country, our economy and our environment ready to deal with the consequences of climate changes.  We can also use this revenue to fund our efforts to use less carbon, thereby reducing harm to our environment.  I hope and expect that the rest of the world will do the same.  That is why we are making changes in respect of carbon taxation.  Some 70% of the change we have seen in the price of a litre of diesel during the year has had nothing to do with taxation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100063#RRR00500","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1638385320,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I do not know if it was an error on the part of the Minister but the amendment speaks to tapering out the tax credits on incomes between &euro;100,000 and &euro;140,000 at a rate of 2.5% for each &euro;1,000.  The Minister, in giving his figures, mentioned 5%.  Anyway, that is not the biggest issue.  I am not surprised that the Minister has decided to vote against this amendment.  Budgets are all about decisions and political choices.  You cannot do X unless you have Y.  You cannot make investments unless you have resources.  The Government will argue that certain things will happen if we raise taxes to a certain effective rate.  Let us talk about that.  The Minister talked about an income of &euro;120,000.  The effective rate this year is 40.7%.  Under these proposals, that would increase to 41.8%.  The levy of 3% of individual earnings above &euro;100,000 means &euro;300 for every &euro;1,000 a person earns above &euro;140,000.  I believe that is fair.  However, that money cannot go into a black hole.  We need to have a proper social contract involving investment in public services, a proper safety net and so on.  The effective tax rate for an individual on &euro;120,000 was higher in 2014 than it would be under these proposals.  There is no evidence to suggest that these types of effective tax rates would impact on the economy but they would bring in the resources required to invest.<\/p>  <p>  I will tender a question to the Minister.  The Government has ruled out every single type of tax revenue increase.  The Minister has talked about abolishing the USC.  Was that what was printed on the placard he and his party leader, Deputy Varadkar, held at one stage?  There are many photographs of that, taken just before an election campaign.  It was then to be merged with PRSI.

I believe that it is not just about the average level of taxation but also about the marginal level of taxation.

They will remain the same.  The impact would be on the effective rate.  I mentioned to the Minister that this, combined with the other measure, would bring the effective rate below where it was in 2014.  Tapering out the tax credits, therefore, would not impact on the marginal rate of taxation, which brings in &euro;232 million.<\/p>  <p>  I asked the Minister where he is going to get the revenue from, and he outlined that it will come from the 97% of the population who earn below &euro;100,000 in individual income.  Regardless of income, people will be liable to pay the local property tax, LPT.  Similarly, regardless of how poor people may be - they may not even be in employment - they must pay the carbon tax if they are filling their car with petrol or diesel or trying to keep their homes and children warm.  The Minister is saying that he is willing to get the revenue for all these proposed initiatives from that 97% of the population.  He does not even want us to talk to him about looking at the 3% of people who have individual incomes of more than &euro;100,000.<\/p>  <p>  They are going to be protected by this Minister, just as he brings in measures to protect the really wealthy in Irish society.  Measures such as the special assignee relief programme, SARP, allow individuals coming into the State to write off &euro;111,000 of their tax liabilities.  Nobody else can get that relief.  It is not possible for a butcher, a painter, a decorator or a hairdresser to get that rate.  The Minister, however, brings in measures, such as SARP, that are only available to the wealthiest in society.  It applies to people earning up to &euro;1 million, and includes the ability to write off private tuition fees for children and to fly home to one's parent country once a year.  Those are the types of favours or policy measures that are brought in to support those at the higher end of incomes.  By God, though, local property taxes and carbon taxes will come from those on the lower incomes and flow to this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100064#SSS00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"vote","time":1638385920,"counter":633,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 45; N\u00edl, 76; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies P\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn and Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh; N\u00edl, Deputies Jack Chambers and Brendan Griffin.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100064#SSS00300","aye":["1555","1698","1522","1625","1613","1452","1525","1451","1495","1461","1501","1585","1571","1615","1488","1462","1476","1470","1579","1560","1453","1506","1620","1610","1607","1604","1463","1497","1489","1621","1550","1507","1468","1498","1485","1547","1509","1514","1567","1564","1491","1504","1513","1469","1627"],"nay":["1587","1573","1618","1523","1614","1611","1602","1482","1483","1517","1480","1475","1493","1570","1591","1454","1519","1481","1601","1623","1558","1574","1584","1505","1562","1597","1589","1590","1582","1576","1581","1552","1580","1487","1586","1566","1559","1450","1619","1572","1583","1594","1609","1472","1471","1626","1568","1459","1496","1548","1455","1456","1511","1578","1512","1561","1563","1553","1516","1492","1593","1598","1477","1545","1521","1617","1575","1510","1484","1500","1616","1556","1557","1479","1515","1474"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1638386520,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 20, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Report on income levy on high incomes <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>16.<\/b>The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the introduction of a high-income levy on high incomes in excess of &euro;140,000.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100065#TTT00100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638386520,"counter":635,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1638386820,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 9:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 20, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:   \t<b>&quot;Report on income tax relief <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>16.<\/b>The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on an income tax relief equivalent in value to 8.3 per cent of annual rent to all private rental tenants not already in receipt of any State subsidy, examining the social and economic impact of this measure in the context of high levels of rent and other policy levers such as a ban on rent increases.&quot;.   <\/blockquote>  <p>This amendment deals with the issue of skyrocketing rents right across the State.  This is no longer unique to our capital city or other cities where there is acute housing pressure; it is now felt in the most remote regions because of the lack of curtailment in respect of the escalating rents that so many individuals are facing.  In our party we have raised this issue consistently with the Government.  It has fallen on deaf ears.  The Government has continued to take the side of landlords on this issue and has left renters at the mercy of ever-increasing prices.  Ludicrously, legislation was passed through this House by the Government, including the Minister opposite who signed off on it at the Cabinet, that allowed rents to be pegged to inflation.  This meant a rent increase of 5.1% could happen last month.  That is the rate of inflation.  It meant that the average Dublin city rent, which currently stands at &euro;2,032 and with which the Minister will be more familiar than I am because he lives in Dublin city, was legally eligible to be increased by &euro;104 per month, or &euro;1,248 per year.<\/p><p>The penny has still not dropped with the Government because, after having been shamed and embarrassed into addressing the situation in which, owing to its incompetence, even Eoghan Murphy&rsquo;s flawed rent pressure zone cap of 4% has been exceeded, it has pegged rents to inflation with new legislation.  The cap is a maximum of 2%.  When rents are sky high, you do not legislate to push them a little higher; what you do is look for faoiseamh, relief, for ordinary people right across the State.  There are 300,000 people renting privately across the State.  The amendment calls for a rental tax credit up to a maximum of &euro;1,500, which is the equivalent of putting one month&rsquo;s rent back into the renter&rsquo;s pocket.  It is about real relief for individuals.  It will work only if we introduce a rent freeze over the same period.<\/p><p>I am conscious that we did have a rent tax credit.  The Minister may try to suggest it is left field and that we could not do something like this here.  A rent tax credit operated in this State up until 31 December 2017.  It was recommended for abolition by the Commission on Taxation in 2009 because it was being absorbed into the rental prices that landlords were charging.  That was why a rent freeze must accompany the credit.  Before the credit was recommended for abolition &mdash; it was fully abolished only at the end of 2017 &mdash; a married couple, both aged 55 or over, were able to get a rent tax credit of &euro;1,600, which is more than what we are suggesting in this amendment.  Therefore, this is not left field; it is common sense.  It is what a Government would do if it had the interest of tenants rather than the interest of landlords at heart.<\/p><p>I have mentioned the crazy price people are being charged in Dublin city: &euro;2,032, possibly going up this month by &euro;104, which is legally allowed owing to the incompetence of the Government.  What is happening in other parts?  Seventeen counties have had double-digit rent inflation under the Government at a time when rents were escalating anyway.  Rents are soaring outside the Dublin area.  They have increased by over 20% in Mayo.  That is just mind-boggling.  Put yourself in the shoes of a family who might be struggling with the cost of living.  This year their rental bill is 20% more than it was last year.  In Leitrim the increase is over 20% and in Roscommon it is 20%.  What is the Government doing?  It is legislating to require that rent can be put up by only 2% more.  Putting up already-high rents is putting more pressure on affected families.  The Government has completely and utterly failed to have the interests of renters at heart.  It has continually taken the side of landlords.  Our pleas, which we have made time and again, have fallen on deaf ears.<\/p><p>I do not know what rents will have to be charged, by landlords or institutional investors, which charge the highest rents in the State, before the Government realises there is a serious problem.  Not only do we need to stop rent increases; we also need to give relief to renters.  People who are younger than me, including those who are starting out in life and possibly thinking about starting a family, are asking how the hell it can be done in Dublin.  What is happening is crazy.<\/p><p>The amendment would introduce what we used to have until it was finally phased out in 2017.  It would do so in a way that works because we would introduce a rent freeze.  This is what a Government should do.  This is what I would do if I were sitting in the benches opposite because I know the choices I would make would put renters first, not landlords.  The average rent in this city is over &euro;2,000.  The rent increases we are seeing in many counties, including mine, are in double digits and in some cases exceed 20% per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100066#UUU00100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1638386820,"counter":637,"content":"<p>Like I always do in the interest of doing my business properly in this D&aacute;il, I want to declare what could be perceived as a personal interest in this matter.  However, as I always say, I believe this prepares me better for being balanced and seeing every side of this issue, which is so important.  It has rightly been stated that the pressure on people, particularly young families, because of the ever-increasing cost of rent is frightening.  Any type of relief or assistance that can be given to those families should be given, and be seen to be given, to make a genuine difference for them.  It is no surprise anymore to hear of rent of &euro;1,500, &euro;1,700, &euro;2,000 or more per month.  It is a frightening amount of money to have to pay just to live in a rented house.  However, the one thing we cannot get away from and which we must always remember, in the interest of looking at both sides of the coin, is that the Government in power is taking in over 50% of the rent received by the owner of the property in tax.  The Minister should not forget that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty rightly referred to &euro;2,500.  The Minister should not forget that the Government is taking &euro;1,250 of that every month. The person collecting the rent, paying the mortgage and property tax for the property, paying for the maintenance and updating of the property, keeping to all the regulations and doing his or her business right is giving half of the rent to the Government in tax.  The Minister should not forget it.  I always want to drive that home because, even if we are talking about a more normal rent, say a rent of &euro;800 or &euro;900 per month, the Government is taking half of that also.  The Minister should not forget that.  It is a very important point.<\/p>  <p>  We have to work imaginatively.  The main way to bring down the ever-increasing cost of rent is by increasing the housing supply in the market.  I am aware that is not what the amendment is about but, at the end of the day, it is the answer to the problem we have.  It is a matter of local authorities providing more local houses and of the builders we always had &mdash; the traditional builders, not big companies &mdash; building more houses.  I am talking about the kind of man we all had in every village and town: a medium- or small-time builder who might build five or ten houses every year and sell them on the open market for what I would call reasonable money.  He or she made a profit, kept local people in business and had subcontractors working for him or her.  It was a great system but, sadly, such people are gone.  The reason they are gone is that it is no longer profitable, viable or sensible for a person to buy a piece of ground, get it zoned if it is not already zoned and build five or ten houses on it. <\/p> <p>If you take the cost of the material, the cost of the labour, the VAT, the other tax and every other charge out of that, it does not make any sense for that builder to produce those ten houses and then to try to sell them at an affordable rate.  I am not talking about profiteering.  I am talking about a good, respectable builder selling them off to young or middle-aged couples who want to start out on their own in the property market and buy an affordable house.<br\/><br\/>When I was growing up, it was an awful sum of money, but the average house cost &pound;30,000.  Whether you worked in the local co-op or whether you were a garda or a teacher, the average house the length and breadth of the country, when I was a teenager, cost &pound;30,000.  In our heads we thought it was an unimaginable amount of money.  If you think about it <i>pro rata<\/i>, however, and given what the garda's, teacher's or council or local authority worker's pay was at that time, it made sense to buy a house for &pound;30,000.  However, when you see the prices being quoted today and what property is fetching, it does not make sense for a person to buy.  Killingly enough, though, it does not make sense for a person to build to sell either.  That is the ironic thing.  Deputy Doherty knows - I am sorry to mention him all the time - that an awful lot of what Sinn F&eacute;in says I understand.  I just want to get us all in the same frame of mind.  It makes no sense in Ireland today to build a house to sell it.  Therefore, the people who want to buy a house cannot do so because the houses are not there.  When sufficient supply is not there, the supply that is there is extraordinarily expensive.  It is a real conundrum and it is like a pressure cooker at the moment.  It is getting worse and worse.<br\/><br\/>I am listening 100% to nothing but well-intentioned people standing up here and making proposals because they are just trying to help with the situation, but I do not see it helping.  A number of different things have gone wrong in Ireland.  In the past 24 months we have had a new problem, of which I know the Minister and every other Deputy is aware, and that is the cost of material.  I could frighten the House with statistics and percentages for the prices of different pieces of timber and steel because I know acutely how much they have gone up by.  It is no exaggeration to say that &euro;5,000 worth of timber last year costs &euro;11,200 today.  It costs &euro;6,200 more 12 months later to buy the exact same box of timber.  That is crazy.  From doors to steel girders, the price of everything has gone up enormously.  What is that doing?  It is ensuring, again, that that small builder I am talking about who used to go and build his few houses does not see the sense in doing so because when he goes to the market to advertise those houses, he will have to charge exorbitant amounts that the young couple cannot afford.<br\/><br\/>We really have a problem in front of us.  I am not fighting with the Minister about it.  I am only standing here saying we must come together, all of us, to try to do something that will help.  If there are imaginative ways of giving tax relief to renters to try to bring down the amount of money they are parting with every month, of course we should do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100066#UUU00200","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638387420,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I will make a brief point and ask the Minister a question.  We support the amendment.  Renters have been hammered from pillar to post in recent years.  I will not go back over all the points.  They have been debated here many times.  There is a clear need, in our opinion, for, at the very minimum, a national rent freeze.  Many renters would say we need to go further than that and find a way to reduce the cost of rent by way of legislation.  The Government does not agree with us on that.  The Government is putting forward legislation which would cap rent increases at 2% or the rate of inflation, whichever is the lower at the time.  That is off the mark.  It misses what needs to be done.<\/p>  <p>  The other day I asked the Taoiseach a question he was unable to answer.  He said we would come back to it, so maybe we can revisit it this evening.  I asked him about the report that appeared on a national newspaper's website the other morning which said that the rent cap would be set at 2% but that if a landlord had not raised the rent on a property in the previous year or the year before that, he or she would have the right under this legislation to increase the rent by a multiple of 2%.  The Taoiseach said he could neither confirm nor deny that and that we would come back to the issue.  Is the Minister in a position to give clarity on this?  I have seen no denials of that report from Government sources, and the legislation would seem to me to indicate that that is the case, in other words, that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has left a giant loophole through which many landlords and their legal representatives will be able to drive a cart and horse when the 2% proposal itself was not adequate in the first place.  Maybe I am getting it wrong.  Maybe the Minister will be able to clarify the matter.  I ask him to do so.  What is the position on that?<\/p>  <p>  I support the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100067#VVV00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1638387420,"counter":640,"content":"<p>As the Minister well knows, people of all ages are struggling to pay their rent.  I regularly have people come to me - friends, family, neighbours etc. - who are struggling or unable to pay their rents.  These are people my age who may be looking to start a family and who have to move back to the family home because they simply cannot pay their rent or, if they can, they certainly are not able to save for a mortgage to be able to move out of their rented, shared, overcrowded accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is not only my age group that is suffering like this.  I am becoming increasingly aware of older people hitting their pension age or already in their pension age who find it increasingly difficult to pay their rent, who are increasingly concerned their rent will increase and that they will no longer be able to pay it and who do not know what alternative they will have if that happens.  These people will have either to move in with their children or to go looking for alternative accommodation, knowing that in the likes of Galway city, where I am from, that accommodation will be very hard found and, if it is found, will be at an extremely high price.  Galway city has extortionate rents, which is not often mentioned when a lot of the conversation is about Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  However, this is no longer only a city-based issue.  We have seen increasingly along our coastal regions that people over the lockdowns, when they were able to work from home, moved back home or moved to more rural areas and to areas along the coastlines.  We have seen huge increases in that regard.  I have seen increasingly people come to me saying they can no longer rent in the area they have long lived in in rural or coastal communities because these increases are just continuing and they are no longer able to afford them.  At this stage the rental crisis is affecting so many different age groups, people and communities.<\/p>  <p>  What people now need, and what they have needed for a very long time and can wait for no longer, is urgent action by the Government in this regard.  What we clearly need is a ban on rent increases.  We have been saying that for a very long time, and the Government really needs to act in that regard.  Reference was made earlier to the legislation that pegged rent increases to inflation.  The Minister himself has often said he was aware inflation would rise.  It is just unfortunate the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, did not seem to realise that would happen.  That was clearly a massive mistake by the Government.  The reality is these kinds of mistakes hurt people and make their lives more difficult.<\/p>  <p>  This amendment seeks just a report.  I do not see any reason the Government cannot accept it.  The report would examine the social and economic impact of these measures.  We know that what has been happening up to now is not working so we need the Government to do something urgently that will work to protect and help renters.  The Government could certainly look at doing a report to help renters, who are struggling so much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100067#VVV00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1638388020,"counter":641,"content":"<p>I am absolutely aware of the huge challenge that many tenants face at the moment.  I meet them in my own constituency of Dublin Central.  I meet people who are very concerned about the level of rent they are paying currently.  They are worried they will not be able to pay their rent in the future, or that renting has undermined their ability to save for a mortgage.  They are worried about whether they will still have accommodation or a place to rent and call home in a few years' time.  I experience all of those pressures.  I see the anxiety and the worry in the eyes of renters and tenants who come to me concerned about their future.<\/p>  <p>  The long-term answer to how we make progress on these issues, and the way in which we do it, is by building more homes.  That is the answer to it.  I was struck by a phrase that Deputy Doherty used.  It is one I have heard him use before.  He talked about me prioritising the interests of landlords over tenants.  Deputy Doherty and Sinn F&eacute;in want to turn the word \"landlord\" into a term of abuse.  It is a pejorative term for Deputy Doherty.  Every time he stands up and uses the word \"landlord\", it is a form of political attack.  The only reason why I and this Government are taking the measures that we are in relation to landlords is to get more rental accommodation built.  That is the only reason why.  That is not prioritising the interests of one group over another; it is putting in place the plans that will lead to an increase in rental accommodation.  By having more homes, houses and apartments available to rent, it will provide a way in which we can get rents down and make them affordable.  That is the truth.  What we hear, day after day in this D&aacute;il, is Sinn F&eacute;in using the phrase \"landlord\" as a term of political attack.  What we and I want to do is to support policies that will lead to more rental accommodation being available.<\/p>  <p>  A perfect example of this is how Sinn F&eacute;in voted on the Finance Bill on Committee Stage, in relation to the extension of section 97A, which is all about providing a form of tax relief to landlords to make rental accommodation available to those who need or want to rent homes.  Sinn F&eacute;in voted against that.  It is a measure that, in the last two years for which information is available, brought 3,200 more properties back into rental supply.  Sinn F&eacute;in voted against that.  What does Deputy Doherty say to the tenants who are living in those properties, which are now available for rent through a tax measure, the continuation of which Sinn F&eacute;in opposed while at the same time saying it was standing up for the rights of tenants?  The reason why we have measures in place that look to try to increase the availability of rental accommodation is so we can bring rents down and make more rental accommodation available so that rents will fall and that rental accommodation will become more affordable.<\/p>  <p>  What Sinn F&eacute;in is doing is saying that it wants to fix the problem of high prices and rents by ultimately putting in place a lower level of supply.  That is what its policies will do.  It will lead to lower levels of rental accommodation available and a lower supply of new homes and apartments that are available to rent.  That is what will happen.  Looking at the policies of the Government, they support rental accommodation and support tenants through all of the measures that we have in place, including HAP and other payments that are there to support tenants who need additional support to pay the rent.  Without that support, they would face even more difficulties regarding their future.  In addition to all of that, what we are doing as a Government is directly building homes.  That is what we are doing for next year.  There will be 9,000 directly built social homes in our country to help bring forward the overall housing mix that we need to make progress on the rental challenges that we have and all of the other challenges that we have in relation to the availability of homes in our country.  The Government will also bring forward and deliver 2,000 new cost rental homes.<\/p>  <p>  Our answer to how we can bring down the price of rent and make rents more affordable to tenants, who I know are currently facing such challenges, is to build more homes to increase rental accommodation.  Rent caps and the measures that Sinn F&eacute;in is bringing forward will lead to less supply.  Less supply will mean that the challenges we face at the moment will only grow more intense, will only grow more difficult and are a recipe for the kind of affordability issues that we acknowledge are there for many, but that we are trying to overcome, to beat and to reduce over time.  The policies that Sinn F&eacute;in is putting forward are a recipe for them getting worse.  That is why I do not support the Report Stage amendment that has been brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in and why I certainly do not believe that the policies that it is bringing forward will make any difference to those who need help and those who need to see their rents fall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100068#WWW00100","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1638388020,"counter":642,"content":"<p>The Minister can accuse me of whatever he wants and can say what my policies or those of my party may or may not do.

I absolutely believe our policies will be of benefit to ordinary people who are struggling to pay the rents, who are struggling in overcrowded conditions because they cannot pay their rent, and who are struggling living at home with their parents.  The Minister might say he hears all of this in his own clinics, and I am sure he hears about these realities in his own clinics because this is the reality for so many people.  The Minister would do well to listen to what these people have to say and ensure his Government enacts policies to help these people.

I put the question back to the Minister, however.  What can we do to make it possible for us to build more homes in Ireland?  When I say \"We\", I mean us, our local authorities and our small builders.  I must say once again that we have lost those people.  I want to see us being able to win them back.  Those builders might be too tired to go taking on that role again because it is not an easy life and being a small or medium-sized builder is not an easy thing for any person to do, but we have to make it attractive for them to do so, or perhaps it will be their sons and daughters.  I remind the Minister they were a source of employment and business locally.  They kept local hardware stores going, with local hardware merchants, timber yards and steel yards, and we want to try to get all of that going again.<\/p>  <p>  It is nearly gone to the stage where if you were driving the car and you saw a gap after being burst into a field with somebody building a house, you would nearly stop and take a picture of it to send to your friends saying, \"Look who is building a house.\"  My goodness, if you saw a builder going building five or ten houses, you would definitely take a picture of that and send it around saying, \"Look who started building, isn't it great\", or, \"How are they managing it at all?\"  Ten or 20 years ago you would take no notice.  I do not want a situation like during the boom when if you stood in the one spot for too long, somebody could build a house on top of you, because we were gone crazy that time.  We want to see measured building and the homes being sold at an affordable rate.  The Minister is the Minister for Finance and I am once again putting it back to him.  What can the Government do to make it profitable and sensible for the person to build them, for the local authority to build them, and for the person to be able to ultimately purchase?  Ideally, we want to see people getting local authority houses or getting a tenancy for those, or getting the right buy them in the future, or young people being able, after a period of time, to buy their own house and getting going on the road for themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100069#XXX00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1638388620,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I do not know the answer to the specific question Deputy Barry put to me this evening.

I will see if I can find the information and I will certainly share it with Deputy Barry if I can.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Healy-Rae's comments about how we can sustainably build homes, we can sustainably build homes by the State playing its role in the next year by investing &euro;4.1 billion in directly building homes ourselves, or by paying for the infrastructure that will allow the private sector to build homes.  Inside that very simple description there is a huge number of very complex things that we need to do quicker and better than we are doing at the moment.  I accept what Deputy Healy-Rae has said, that we are not building homes at the pace, at the speed, and in the locations we need to.  I am well aware of the huge concern and anxiety that so many have to endure because of that.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Doherty's contribution, I stand absolutely over everything I have said with regard to Sinn F&eacute;in a moment ago.

My record is that I have had the privilege of being in government, representing the people and serving the people as a member of Cabinet.  I began my time as a member of the Cabinet in the aftermath of a housing crash that saw so few homes being built, that saw social housing output on the floor, and saw such misery after the last housing crash our country had to endure.  With regard to where we are now, housing output was on the verge of recovery before the pandemic.  I accept it is not recovering at the speed that was acceptable to enough people.  In the aftermath of the pandemic, I believe we are seeing 6,000 homes being delivered for social purposes and we are seeing housing output recover.  I accept that is not happening quickly enough for many, but I equally contend that the policies Sinn F&eacute;in puts forward are a recipe for fewer homes being built.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100069#XXX00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1638388620,"counter":648,"content":"<p>The Minister has been there for ten years.

The record is the Government brought forward legislation, which the Minister signed off in Cabinet, that allowed landlords to increase monthly rents in this city by another &euro;100 on top of the &euro;2,000 per month they already charge.  That is the Minister's record.  The record is the Government has sold this city and surrendered it to institutional investors who charge the highest rents in the State, who do not pay a penny in corporation tax on them, and who are exempt from capital gains tax when they sell those assets in the future.

He said there are very sharp limits on what the Government can do in this regard.  In the end, as we all know, it did not subsidise the tests whatsoever.  The Minister said to the interviewer: &quot;We have limited funds at our disposal.  If we go further than I am indicating here on your radio show, it will come out of the budget for paying nurses.&quot;  It is not the first time we have heard this kind of argument.  There are scarce resources, which means one deserving group cannot have its demands satisfied because another deserving group will lose out.  Of course, this argument ignores the fact there are very large amounts of wealth in this society.  It is in the hands of a very small minority, whom the Government refuses to go after.<\/p> <p>This is a good example of that.  We are talking about a tax break for foreign executives who earn anything between &euro;75,000 and &euro;1 million per annum.  Of course, if we give a tax break to foreign executives, or any such privileged group, other people will pay for it.  How much will the taxpayer pay?  We are not quite sure because we do not have the up to date figures.  We know that in 2016 this tax break for foreign executives cost &euro;18.1 million.  We know that for 2018, the last year for which we have figures, the figure more than doubled to &euro;42.4 million.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Health goes on the radio to say we cannot subsidise antigen tests without taking money from nurses and a thousand other similar types of arguments are used by Ministers day in day out, but the reality is that foreign executives in this country have a tax break paid for by taxpayers to the tune of &euro;40 million, and rising.  We would love to put forward a proposal that the tax break be abolished, but we do not have the power to do that.

The scheme currently has a sunset date of 31 December 2022.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated on Committee Stage, there is an essential context around SARP.  The context is that it is part of our foreign direct investment policy which allows our country to be competitive and attract certain senior decision makers here to particular companies.  This is fundamental to the creation and retention of other jobs.  If we get rid of the scheme, it makes what we offer uncompetitive versus the offerings from competitor jurisdictions, for example, France, Portugal, the Netherlands and Italy, to name but a few.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's enterprise policy is based on export led growth.  FDI has been and continues to be an integral part of Ireland's economic development.  The existence of an incentive like SARP is an acknowledgement that we are competing on a global basis for highly skilled and mobile executives.  Competition for this talent is intense, in particular the type of skills required to facilitate the development and expansion of businesses in Ireland.  The existence of similar and, indeed, more attractive special assignee type tax reliefs creates a market failure that could not be addressed but for the continued existence of SARP.<\/p>  <p>  On budget day, the annual Revenue report on SARP for 2019 was published.  It found a significant reversal in the overall cost of the scheme in 2019 to &euro;38.2 million, compared to 2018 when the cost was &euro;42.4 million.  The cost is &euro;4.2 million lower than the figures quoted by Deputy Barry.  This is attributable, at least in part, to my decision to introduce a salary cap of &euro;1 million on the amount of a person's income that can benefit from the scheme in the Finance Act 2018.  The change applies from 1 January 2019 for new entrants and from 1 January 2024 for existing recipients.<\/p>  <p>  The aggregate number of jobs that were reported as created and retained as a result of the scheme has increased since 2018.  There were 379 additional employees, compared to 226 in 2018, and the number of employees retained was 483 compared to 348 in 2018.  This combined total of 862 SARP related jobs in 2019 represents a cost of &euro;44,000 per job created or retained, a decrease in cost per job compared to 2018 when there were 584 jobs at an average cost of &euro;73,000.  This represents a decrease in cost of over 39%.<\/p>  <p>  The benefits of SARP, apart from enhancing our international competitiveness, are detailed clearly in the Indecon report.  They include the following: increased employment and retention of staff within SARP companies, associated additional investment, additional corporate tax receipts, additional PAYE receipts and research and development spillover activity.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, I commissioned an independent review of the scheme.  The report of the review confirmed to me the strong policy rationale for the continued relevance of SARP to the Irish economy.  The report is available on the website of the Department of Finance.  The review highlights the following data regarding companies that availed of SARP for 2017: they paid &euro;2.5 billion in corporate tax, employed over 155,000 individuals and paid over &euro;1.9 billion in PAYE taxes.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the concerns of Deputies, I recognise that there is, of course, a balance to be struck between the principle of equity within our tax system and the need to compete internationally for highly skilled and mobile personnel.  In this regard, and in order to seek to ensure that the appropriate balance is maintained, the issue is kept under regular review through detailed examinations of the type carried out by Indecon.  As the scheme sunsets next year, there will be a further opportunity for review.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100072#AAAA00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1638390120,"counter":666,"content":"<p>We can boil down the argument of the Minister to there being one law for the rich and one law for the rest.  That is actually what SARP amounts to.  People who earn more than &euro;70,000 - quite a few of these people earn millions of euro a year - get a special and very substantial tax break on their enormous earnings which ordinary workers do not get.  Such people also get tax relief on sending their kids to private schools.  We are doing this because if we did not these people would not come here.<\/p>  <p>  We will throw tax justice out of the window because of our fear, or blackmail, if we like, on the part of people who say they will not come to our country and bring investment along with them unless Ireland gives them a special tax deal which no other ordinary worker will get.  We have to give into that and, essentially, have a different tax code and special tax deals for these super rich executives.<\/p>  <p>  What about all the nurses who leave because they cannot afford to live here?  Where is the special tax break for them, given that we do not have enough of them?  What about all of the other allied health professionals, including doctors, who leave because their earnings are not enough to put a roof over their heads due to sky high rents?  People on very high salaries are contributing to this because we build accommodation for very wealthy, rather than ordinary, people.<\/p>  <p>  If we want to put this in terms of competition, we are losing out on a lot of the skills we desperately need because people feel it is not worth their while to stay here.  We get high flying executives who are, let us be honest, greedy enough that, on top of their extraordinary salaries, they want additional tax relief, while a lot of our people whom we have put public money into educating and training are leaving.  There are no special deals for them to keep them here.  It is gross tax inequity at every level and it is literally the embodiment of there being one tax law for the super rich and one law for the rest of us.<\/p> <p>It is obnoxious.

We had discussions about cross-Border workers and the Minister spoke about equity and fairness among taxpayers.  Many people would ask a question about that in respect of the SARP policy being pursued by the Government.  It has been said previously by me, Deputy Boyd Barrett and others, and this is probably a reflection on us in the Opposition, that if people knew this tax measure existed, there would be uproar.  This is a special tax rate that only people who are earning over &euro;75,000 and with incomes up to &euro;1 million can avail of.  It is not available to anybody else, regardless of the contribution a person makes to society.  Whether one is a nurse, a teacher, a street cleaner or somebody who works in the local authority, it is not available to such workers.  It is not available unless somebody is one of these special people in the eyes of the Minister for Finance.  The person must be foreign, must come into this country and must have an income above &euro;75,000.  If he or she has an income of up to &euro;1 million, the Minister for Finance will cut his or her tax bill by &euro;111,000.  He will also give him or her &euro;5,000 for private education for the person's children and allow the person to write off the payment for his or her flights home against his or her tax bill.<\/p>  <p>  As has been mentioned, 50 millionaires availed of this in 2019 - 50 people who had incomes of between &euro;1 million and &euro;3 million.  That means each one of the 50 got a tax write-off of &euro;111,000.  The butcher, hairdresser, nurse, teacher and street cleaner all must pay tax at the marginal rate of 40%, but, by God, if you are one of these lucky 1,574 people, the Minister for Finance has brought forward a sweetheart deal that will allow you, up to a maximum, to reduce your tax liability by &euro;111,000.  This has no place in a State that believes there should be equality of treatment for taxpayers.  There are many people who feel hard-pressed by taxation.  We need taxation to pay for services and everything else, but they get no relief when it comes to these special measures.  The SARP is absolutely outdated.  Looking at the projections for the cost from 2018 to 2028, it is going to cost the State half a billion euro.  That is half a billion euro in a ten-year period only for individuals with incomes above &euro;75,000, only for people with incomes up to &euro;1 million and only for these very special people in the eyes of this Minister, who can also avail of other special conditions as a result.  It is appalling and should not be there.<\/p>  <p>  There are multinationals in this State that we want to retain.  There is no doubt about that.  We have argued in terms of the Minister's role in trying to secure the 12.5% rate.  That was impossible in the negotiations.  There was a mountain to climb in that regard in the context of those who came under the OECD.  We want to retain those investments, but I must make something clear.  If a company feels that a so-called key person in its employment needs to have a higher take-home pay, the company must pay the person more.  Do not ask for the tax that is paid by the butcher, the nurse, the teacher or the doctor to allow that person to have a reduced tax liability.

In order to ensure we have the resources and money we need to deliver for the needs they have and that I want to see met, a small economy of our scale located where it is must be open and competitive.  Being open and competitive are the cornerstones of how we have built over decades an economy in which we see rising living standards.

They are a recipe for losing jobs, losing investment and losing the type of multinational investment that I believe is critical to the success of our country.  Why do I say that?  Consider what is available in other countries.  This is what other countries are doing; it is the scheme that France, Malta, the Netherlands, Italy and Portugal is offering.  Deputies Doherty, Boyd Barrett and Barry would be happy to see the jobs that I want to see kept in Ireland moved to those countries.  That is the consequence of the policies they are proposing.<\/p>  <p>  I heard Deputy Doherty use the phrase \"special people\" and his tone and language dripped with contempt for them.  The people we are referring to here earn far more than I or any Member of this House does, but they play a role in the creation of jobs, income and investment that, in turn, ensure more resources are available to help the butcher, the teacher and the street cleaner.  It is those people I have in mind when I make the case for the retention of this scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100073#BBBB00500","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1638390720,"counter":672,"content":"<p>The Minister has taken out his big, bad wolf script again about how terrible things would be if Sinn F&eacute;in's policies were accepted.

I will tell him this - the butchers and teachers I know are not thankful that the Minister is cutting the tax rates of those millionaires and thinking that it is for their benefit.  They know exactly what is at stake here.  Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins appeared before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and said that the special assignee relief programme beneficiaries would have an average income of at least &euro;313,000.  That would put them in the top 0.5% of earnings distribution.  He said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhile there are economic benefits to schemes such as this, one could make similar arguments for many other jobs and roles, do earners at this level of income need a tax reduction?  On the grounds of fairness, the scheme is hard to justify. Simply, there are better uses for these resources. <\/blockquote>  <p>I agree 100%.<\/p> <p>It is unfair and a bad use of resources.  Many people in other jobs and roles in society that the Minister does not view, in his words, as special could do with similar supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100073#BBBB01200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638391320,"counter":680,"content":"<p>We tabled this amendment because we believe in tax justice.  We believe in an equitable distribution of wealth and income which we are a very long way from.  The Minister says we would not get these people whom we need and we would not be competitive given the tax breaks that these incredibly well-paid executives can get elsewhere and therefore we need to do the same.  I do not know the chronology of which of the countries the Minister mentioned introduced these tax reliefs first.  However, I certainly believe we have helped spearhead where others have followed a certain model which is to attract investment on the basis of cutting taxes on the profits of corporations and now on the income of high-flying executives.  To my mind that is a race to the bottom and somebody pays for it.<\/p>  <p>  The distribution of wealth around the world is ever-more concentrated in the hands of the CEOs and top executives of a relatively small number of corporations.  I am talking about staggering wealth in the billions and tens of billions of euro.  It is beyond comprehension and it gathers apace.  It is because of the notion that unless we make them pay little or no tax, whether it is on their income or on their profits, we cannot have a viable economy and therefore we must do it.  From the point of view of ordinary people that is a zero-sum game where we will lose.  The 99% of ordinary people, the butcher, the baker, the nurse, the street cleaner and pretty much everybody, are losing out and ultimately will lose out by that approach which I fundamentally reject.<\/p>  <p>  In all sincerity, I ask the Minister to think about all the really special people.  He can say these people are special people, have special skills or whatever it is.  However, to my mind the student nurses, 70% of whom say they will leave the country after they are qualified, are just as special.  The construction workers who go to Australia when we need them are just as special and they are not getting these kinds of breaks.  It is fundamentally unfair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100074#CCCC00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"vote","time":1638391620,"counter":681,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 46; N\u00edl, 66; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Mick Barry; N\u00edl, Deputies Jack Chambers and Brendan Griffin.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120100075#DDDD00100","aye":["1555","1698","1522","1478","1625","1613","1452","1525","1451","1495","1461","1501","1585","1571","1615","1488","1462","1476","1470","1579","1560","1506","1580","1487","1620","1610","1607","1604","1463","1497","1489","1621","1507","1498","1551","1485","1547","1509","1514","1567","1564","1491","1504","1513","1469","1627"],"nay":["1587","1573","1618","1523","1614","1611","1602","1482","1483","1517","1480","1475","1493","1570","1591","1454","1519","1481","1601","1623","1558","1584","1505","1562","1589","1590","1582","1581","1624","1552","1586","1559","1450","1619","1572","1583","1594","1609","1472","1471","1459","1548","1455","1511","1578","1512","1563","1553","1516","1492","1593","1598","1477","1545","1521","1617","1575","1510","1484","1500","1616","1556","1557","1479","1515","1474"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638391620,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"}]
