I will begin with a very general but also fundamental remark.  Members understand best that the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union presents unique and significant challenges for the island of Ireland.  They will also know very well that the United Kingdom not only decided to leave the European Union but also the Single Market and the customs union.  We have been working very hard to find all the solutions to the problems which these decisions have brought about.<\/p> <p>  The solution that we found to address these challenges is the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It is the only way to protect the Good Friday-Belfast Agreement in all its dimensions, preserving peace, stability and preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland while preserving the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union.  The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, that is, the entire island of Ireland, has been the core of the discussions on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom and it remains the centrepiece of the new relationship of the Union with the United Kingdom as a third country.  This was clearly the most difficult part of all the Brexit negotiations, especially on the withdrawal agreement and only the complete unity of all EU member states and the European Union actually guaranteed the success in concluding the withdrawal agreement and developing the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  I assure the committee that the full, faithful and effective implementation of the protocol is of paramount importance to the Union and it constitutes a top priority for EU-UK relations. <\/p> <p>  There can be no doubt that the Union is and remains fully committed to the protocol and its full and faithful implementation.<\/p><p>Nothing, including the events two weeks ago, can put into question our commitment and determination to make this one solution work.  When we speak about Article 16, particularly with regard to 29 January, I would like to be very clear.  The bottom line is that mistakes were made in the process leading up to the decision and we deeply regret this.  However, in the end, in a matter of three hours we got it right.  Article 16 was never activated.  I reassure the committee that the Commission has learned its lesson and it will do its utmost to protect peace in Northern Ireland, as it has done throughout the entire Brexit process.  I am sure committee members will ask me how can I prove or guarantee this.  The best proof is our track record of unwavering political, economic and financial support for the peace process since the Belfast Agreement was signed and agreed upon.  There is also how we conducted the entire Brexit negotiation process.  I would like to underscore the fact that Ireland and Northern Ireland were not only on our minds all the time but also in our hearts.  Therefore, I believe we achieved a very good result.<\/p><p> We should also look forward, and this is what our discussion should also be about.  We need to make sure that mistakes are not repeated.  To this end, the European Commission has set up a clearing house where all of the issues with an impact on the UK, Ireland and Northern Ireland will be assessed and evaluated.<\/p><p> There is also the commitment that I will continue permanent contact with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and representatives of Ireland.  Together with Mr. Michael Gove, we decided to establish a hotline so we can be in frequent touch and, hopefully, deal with problems when they are still at a technical level so they do not reach a political dimension.  I realise the relationship between the EU and UK and proper implementation of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland require day-to-day care.<\/p><p> I also want to highlight that my priority is still the same as it was throughout the last year, which is that the protocol must work well on the ground.  As committee members know, I received a letter from Mr. Michael Gove a couple of weeks ago in which he presented a high number of requests for additional flexibilities.  Here again, I want to stress that our commitment to the protocol is unwavering but we must also understand that implementation of the protocol is a shared responsibility and it must always be a two-way street.  Therefore, we also have to recognise the fact that we knew from the beginning that the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, customs union and Single Market is a massive operation and it is not possible to prevent all of the disruption.  We do our best, and we are working on it, to minimise the negative impact on the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland but it was quite obvious from the beginning that there will be teething problems.  I believe we can resolve them if we work very well together.<\/p><p> This was my response to various proposals coming from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr. Gove.  I wanted to underline that before any discussion of additional extended flexibilities took place we also needed to make sure that the UK does its part.  We would like to see more information on how border crossings are being built and when they will be finally operational.  As we still do not have real-time access to the IT systems, it is very difficult for us to judge whether the trusted trader scheme, which the United Kingdom has insisted upon, works or not and how many businesses actually benefit from it.  Because we do not have access to the IT system, we still do not know whether the simplified export health certificate is being used and how complicated it is. Therefore, I decided, together with Mr. Gove, that we will have direct outreach to Northern Irish business leaders and Northern Irish civic society representatives.  These meetings will take place on Thursday.  I am very glad the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was kind enough to organise a meeting with a Brexit stakeholders group by the end of this week.  We want to listen and learn and work on solutions.  I also would also like to make clear that for overall success, we need close co-operation with the UK.<\/p><p> I will now make some points on what we agreed with Mr. Gove at our last meeting in person.  We adopted the joint statement and I am very happy about it.  It went in a very constructive way.  We have been very open and frank with each other, as we always are, but we agreed first and foremost to reiterate full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and proper implementation of the protocol.  We also made clear that we would spare no effort to implement the solutions mutually agreed on 17 December because they form the foundation of our co-operation.  We also agreed that we would intensify the work of the specialised committee on the protocol in order to address all outstanding issues, with the shared objective of finding workable solutions on the ground.  Therefore, the meetings, which we planned for the end of this week, will be very important for Mr. Gove, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and for me.  We also want to have the joint committee, which is the proper body to address all of these issues, meet no later than 24 February.  As I speak, our expert teams are talking.  I hope we will have a specialised committee on the protocol doing its work by the end of this week so we can be well prepared for the discussion of the joint committee next week.<\/p><p> I know the committee has limited time for introductory remarks.  I will stop here because I know the Chair and committee members will have questions and comments.  I am, of course, very eager to hear them.  I hope this will be one of a series of meetings we will have where we can discuss issues linked to Brexit, the implementation of the protocol and the later stage of what I hope will be successful implementation.  I thank members for their invitation and for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Vice-President &Scaron;efovi.

Commissioner &Scaron;efovi is very welcome to the meeting this morning.  We appreciate his time with us today.  I listened very carefully to his opening comments and I fully appreciate and accept that he understands the importance of the Northern Ireland protocol.  He referred to it as a centrepiece of the Brexit negotiations.  He accepts and understands that a mistake was made on behalf of the Commission and that that mistake was colossal and had huge political implications for the island of Ireland, North and South.  We hear the Commissioner on that point.  What we are still trying to figure out, and what we are very keen to hear from him this morning, are the events that led to the Commissioner making that decision.  Did he make it alone?  Did he consult with his Commission colleagues, with the President or other Commissioners?  When did he inform the other Commissioners of his intention to invoke Article 16?  This is the crucial piece of information we require from him this morning.<\/p> <p>  To move on from this point, the Commissioner referred to the joint partnership council and its work in implementing the Brexit deal for the foreseeable future.  Concerns are being raised in Northern Ireland and I want to make the point strongly that the election lines have now been drawn in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>We now know the key issue on which the Assembly election in Northern Ireland will be fought, namely, the question of whether one is for the protocol or against the protocol.  That will be a key factor in the next election.  While I think that would have happened in any event, the Commission's seeking to invoke Article 16 has certainly brought that issue into clear focus.  The concerns that have been raised concern trade in Northern Ireland and the clear problems there in importing goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.  I believe - I acknowledge Mr. &Scaron;efovi himself has said this - that those issues are fixable, that they are teething problems, but we would like to hear from him this morning what the Commission and the European Union will do to address those concerns and difficulties that we can address and fix.  Can he assure us this morning that he will make addressing those trade issues for Northern Ireland a key priority?<\/p><p> Does the Commissioner believe that a member state should be consulted in advance of invoking Article 16?  Does he think Ireland should have been consulted before the Commission made that decision?<\/p><p> My final point is that we now have an impending vote on the consent mechanism in the Northern Ireland protocol.  I want to know, from Mr. &Scaron;efovi's perspective and the Commission's perspective, what the Commission will do to ensure that that vote is successful and in favour of maintaining the protocol.  As we have all said, getting agreement on that point was the most difficult part of the negotiations.  Without the protocol there is nothing else to avoid a border on the island of Ireland.  That is all that is on the table.  If it is removed, there is nothing left.  We therefore need to do everything we can to address that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#B00300","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Chambers for her questions.  I was noting them down so I hope I will not skip any of them.<\/p> <p>  We did not take the decision.  Article 16 was never triggered.  To describe a little to the Senator the situation on that fateful Friday, the primary objective of the day's work was to make sure that Europe was getting its fair share of vaccines.  We are the major producer of the vaccines and we had a feeling we were not always getting our fair share from the production, which takes place in the European Union.  We felt we had this very important agreement signed, we had invested a lot in the vaccine development and we simply did not have enough transparency as to where these vaccines were going.  That was the idea behind the export authorisation scheme and, therefore, this was the thrust of the proposal which was on the table.  As I said, the mistake was made but once we realised it on the political level, and there had been immediate contacts with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, as well as with the UK, we corrected it before it had been activated, before it was adopted, within three hours.  We made a mistake, we acknowledged it and we corrected it.  Therefore, this also has to be viewed in this context and, as I pleaded in my opening remarks, on the grounds of our track record.  We have always been very loyal in the EU with Ireland and Northern Ireland in supporting the peace process and stability.  Looking at the withdrawal agreement negotiations, I hope I am not exaggerating when I say 70% or 80% of the time was devoted just to find a solution in the form of the Northern Irish protocol.  In addition, it is now the key point upon which the future relationship with the UK and with Northern Ireland will be based.  We made the mistake but I ask the committee to take it into the perspective of how close the relations between the EU and all EU member states that supported this very complex decision have become and how strong the support Ireland and Northern Ireland always got from the EU is.<\/p> <p>  Coming to the other issues concerning trade and, as Senator Chambers rightly pointed out, the issues linked with the daily lives of the citizens in Ireland and Northern Ireland, here we did our utmost to the extent possible to limit or minimise the disruption or negative consequences of the UK leaving not only the EU but also, as I said, the Single Market and the customs union.  It seems to have come as a surprise to many that the UK, as of 1 January, is a third country.  Different suggestions we have made throughout the negotiation - remaining part of the Single Market and remaining part of the customs union - have been rejected, so we had to find a new solution based on the United Kingdom's wish to have a relationship as between sovereign equals.  Therefore, we are now in a much more complex relationship.<\/p> <p>  If the Chairman will allow me one additional point, we look, unfortunately, at the protocol very often as an obstacle and a problem.  I am 100% convinced, being part of these negotiations, that the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is the only solution to resolve to the best possible level the problems on the island of Ireland linked with the peace, stability and the avoidance of a hard border.  I hope our next session with the committee will allow us to focus on the future and on the fact that, as I see it, this protocol is an opportunity for Northern Ireland business leaders to benefit from the fact that they are part of the Single Market and at the same time, of course, part of the UK internal market.  I think that represents a lot of opportunities.  Now, however, we are at the early stage, where the adaptation of economic life is needed, certain rules are just kicking in and we see that it is administratively extremely challenging.  We are fully aware of that and, therefore, when we had this very intense negotiation with the UK in December, we fully understood that it is not that easy to change or develop the IT database from one day into another.  Therefore, we had full understanding of the export health certificates and even some additional experience because we realised that they need time to adapt.  This is the time to adapt because they insisted on a particular state of our co-operation and on a particular model.  Therefore, it is the joint responsibility of the UK and the EU to make the protocol work and to be very pragmatic.  I am solution-driven and can promise the committee I will do my utmost to look for a workable solution on the ground which will be good for the people but which, at the same time, will of course protect the integrity of the Single Market and be supported by the member states and the European Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I will now pass to Deputy Richmond.

I will not add to the Chairman's remarks or to those of Senator Chambers other than to say I agree fully.  Interestingly, the Commissioner said in his remarks that he would like to look to the future.  Part of that - and this was alluded to by Senator Chambers - is the possibility, when it comes to Article 16 and a potential future triggering, of an early warning system for the member state most affected, namely, Ireland.<\/p><p>Senator Chambers asked the Commission Vice-President if he would commit that a member state would be made aware.  However, for clarity, can the Commission Vice-President guarantee that an early warning system is being prepared?  We have heard reference to it from the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney.  That is crucially important.  Everyone makes mistakes but, as the Chairman stated, it is how one learns from those mistakes that is important.<\/p><p> The Commission Vice-President mentioned the need at the next meeting of the joint implementation committee for the United Kingdom to follow up on its responsibilities.  I welcome that and fully agree with him.  However, would he agree that, in future, it would be opportune if the European Commission and the United Kingdom agreed a set timetable of meetings between him and Michael Gove, as well as set meetings of the committee itself?  This is so these meetings are not, as is sometimes portrayed in media outlets, watershed moments where everything is hyped up, the drama is increased and people are waiting on tenterhooks.  If we knew that every month the Commission Vice-President and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, were to meet, be it virtually or in person, that would be really important.<\/p><p> Senator Chambers alluded to the situation in Northern Ireland.  I accept fundamentally the Commission Vice-President's responsibility as a member of the European Commission is to the European Union and to us as parliamentarians of a member state.  However, the Northern Irish protocol directly impacts on Northern Ireland.  Would the Commission Vice-President commit, as Senator Chambers said, to engaging to point out the positive benefits of the protocol in Northern Ireland?  It would be really useful, as he is appearing here this morning, and we are very grateful for his presence, if he met with the executive committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I appreciate that it is Michael Gove's remit, but there is a huge opportunity for the European Commission and the European Union to play a very proactive role.  It is something that would be welcomed.  Many people who have concerns about the protocol, or are flat-out against it, have said they feel that their voices are not being listened to in Dublin, Brussels and elsewhere.  However, if we provide them with the opportunity to have their voices heard, even though strictly it should be provided by Michael Gove, that could go a long way to de-escalating much of the tension relating to the protocol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#C00400","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Vice-President, I am reverting to Irish because I made a mistake earlier in calling you President.

It is very kind of him.  I thank him for his question and the subsequent questions from the committee.  First and foremost, I would like to say that all channels are open.  After that Friday, I was ready to have immediate meetings with First Minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill.  At the same time, having fully realised how sensitive and political all these issues had become, I consulted with Chancellor Michael Gove to make sure that we would have a proper meeting organised.  I clearly underlined my availability at any time.  In the end, the suggestion from the Chancellor was that we should meet on Wednesday, which was a couple of days later.  I was hoping for an earlier meeting to discuss all these pertinent and very sensitive matters, but we had a very open and frank discussion about which I am sure the committee is very well informed.<\/p> <p>  I can tell the committee that since then, if I am not mistaken, I was in the European Parliament seven times explaining our action and proposing the way forward.  I met three times with the ambassadors of all the member states and this issue has also been discussed with the ministers for foreign affairs.  I am in almost daily contact with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, for whom I have very high respect.  What I can promise the committee is that any mechanism we establish will be based on this horizontal overview of the clearing house within the Commission, where not only our Irish partners but also the political level of the Commission will get the early warning about potentially difficult issues.  We are communicating with our Irish partners on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>  The outreach suggested by the honourable member was also my suggestion to Chancellor Gove when we discussed these issues over the phone for the first time.  It is very important to hear from Northern Irish business leaders and civic society how they see the protocol, to convince them that we are absolutely convinced this is the best way forward and to listen to what they see as the key issues.  It is then our joint responsibility, along with Michael Gove, to be very honest with them about what we can fix or repair which would still be in line with EU legislation and the fact the UK has left the Single Market, the customs union and the EU.  If there are practical, pragmatic possibilities on how to solve the problem, I am sure we will find them.<\/p> <p>  However, it is also important to get support from Ireland to make it clear to our UK partners that it is a two-way street.  There has to be engagement and delivery from their side.  They knew very well that 1 January was coming.  We proposed an extension of the transitional period which was not accepted.  Therefore, we are now in the difficult implementation period where the border crossing points are not fully operational and we still do not have access to the IT customs system, which makes it very difficult for us to carry out all the necessary checks and controls.  However, I am extremely thankful for the good co-operation on the ground between our experts on customs phytosanitary controls and their Northern Irish counterparts.  The inter-human, professional relationships are very good.  They are learning from each other and they are working together.  I am glad that we found a way to resolve the security and safety issues so they can carry out their duties because they are very important for the future of our relationship.<\/p> <p>  I am also ready to engage with the Irish Brexit stakeholder group.  I think it will happen this week.  As I said, we will be meeting the civic society and business leaders of Northern Ireland this Thursday.  As regards the Northern Ireland Executive, I am open to all the meetings but am trying to follow good order in organising things and respecting all the internal arrangements of the UK.  Therefore, the counterpart for the EU and for me is Michael Gove.  If he engages in organising such a direct exchange with the Northern Ireland Executive, I will be there for sure.  I am ready to listen, to explain what we can do together and look for the best solution for the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>It is good to talk to the Commission Vice-President again.

Once the issues are properly identified, they will be brought to the attention of the political level.<\/p> <p>  We have regular meetings with member states.  There are expert meetings of an EU-UK Brexit working party.  I am in the European Parliament on a biweekly basis, in briefings and discussing the issues with the UK co-ordination group.  This now an almost regular item on the agenda of ministers for European affairs and will continue as such.<\/p> <p>  What are the shortcomings I pointed out to Michael Gove in our conversation and my response to his prior communication?  The first thing which is very important for the integrity of the Single Market is the border control posts.  I have to say they are not yet fully operational.  Official controls at the border control posts, BCPs, are not performed in compliance with the withdrawal agreement protocol and European Union rules.  We see few identity checks and a limited number of physical checks, other than on live animals, fish and plants.  We agreed on certain packaging labels, including UK health certificate declarations and so forth, which, again, is not done as we agreed.<\/p> <p>  It is very important for everyone involved in trade to work on making customs clearance and operations as smooth as possible.  We need fully operational border control posts, BCPs, but also access to IT systems as agreed and as the UK unilaterally declared it would do in December.  We still do not have access to real time operations in IT systems.  The most important ones for us are import clearance systems, CDS, which would help us to better assess how the trusted trader scheme or simplified health certificates are being used.<\/p> <p>  The trusted trader scheme was one of the key asks of the UK in our November and December discussions because it believes it will be possible to guarantee supermarkets in Northern Ireland are fully supplied through this scheme.  We agreed to that but we do not know how much this scheme is used.  We agreed on a simplified version of the health certificates but we do not know how this flexibility is being used, due to non-access to IT systems.<\/p> <p>  We have been creative when it comes to exports from Northern Ireland to Great Britain.  We agreed we would use the ferry documents but they had to contain the equivalent information, which the export declaration would usually have.  This is also not happening.  I could go on and on about parcels, mail and so on.<\/p><p>This is also an odd happening.  I can go on and on about the parcels, the mail and so on.  There are many things that we agreed we would do.  We did our utmost on our side.  Now we also need the response from the UK authorities so we can really assess how these flexibilities are working.  Have they been sufficient?  What is the problem on the ground and how can we find the solution?<\/p><p> Concerning the ongoing dialogue, as I said, it is quite clear that the EU-UK-Ireland-Northern Ireland relationship requires day-to-day care.  We must all be focused on it and we need to do our best.  An important part of that is having frank and open communication.  I am ready to be part of such discussions.  I have already mentioned several times the meetings and discussions we will have this week.  If there is an invitation to the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, of course, I would be very happy to participate and provide the necessary answers.  That is the response to Deputy Howlin's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Commission Vice-President.  Like all my colleagues I acknowledge the record of the Commission in supporting Ireland since the Brexit vote.  Indeed in 2017 Mr.  Barnier spoke in this Chamber and addressed a joint session of the D&aacute;il and Seanad which is a rare honour.  It was a recognition of his role and also the importance of the matter.  In his remarks the Vice-President said that Northern Ireland was on the mind and in the hearts of the Commission during the negotiations.  While that is true, it was not so on 29 January.  I know he does not want to engage in that and does not want to engage in what he sees as a blame game.  Our job here is parliamentary scrutiny of our relationship with the European Union institutions.  We would be remiss in our job if we did not pursue what happened in the days leading up to 29 January.  I am concerned that he has not engaged with my colleagues who have previously asked about those issues.  It is part of our job to try to get there.<\/p> <p>  The Vice-President said Article 16 was never activated.  With complete respect I say he is splitting hairs because the signal was given that it would be activated.  Were it not for the intervention of the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, it probably would have been activated.  However, giving the signal was enough to do the damage my colleagues have mentioned.  Who inserted the signal into the documentation?<\/p> <p>  We are led to understand that notification was given to Commissioners and their cabinets half an hour before it became public.  Will the Vice-President confirm if that is true?  Was notification given to individual commissioners or their cabinets before it was published?  Was it the Vice-President or the president who was involved in inserting the original signalling of the article in the document?  The export process was signalled for a number of days.  Therefore, presumably the intention to trigger Article 16 was being discussed beforehand.  It is our job to try to understand that so that it does not happen again.  That brings me to my second question.<\/p> <p>  I accept the Vice-President has very strong personal relationships with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and other officials.  However, particularly in politics, people move on, as we know.  Article 16 will still be there and the protocol will still be there.  I welcome the Vice-President's reiteration of support for the protocol.  We need a permanent mechanism that will withstand the changes in personnel and will withstand the changes in relationships between the Commission and a potential future government.  Senator Chambers and other colleagues have put it to the Vice-President that there should be a formal mechanism involving the Irish Government, and dare I say it the Northern Ireland Executive, such that when Article 16 is to be discussed, and it is to be hoped it will never be triggered again, the Commission cannot do so on its own and cannot even signal that it will be done without the co-operation and consent of the Irish Government and by consultation with the Northern Ireland Executive.  I ask the Vice-President to give us his thoughts on a more permanent solution that is not based solely on personal relationships, which are important but transient.  If we are to avoid the damage that has occurred on our island as a consequence of what happened on 29 January, we need a permanent reaction.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that we acknowledge the support.  However, the committee's job is parliamentary scrutiny of the work of the Vice-President and of the Commission.  We have a responsibility to our colleagues in both Houses of the Oireachtas and the people we represent to get to the detail of what happened on 29 January and on the days leading to that date so that the committee can make recommendations to ensure it does not happen again.  It is not a blame game; we are doing our job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#F00200","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for pointing out how sensitive this issue is, and I acknowledge that.  I think I repeated myself several times and I can do it here.  What happened in that week was that we had been under enormous pressure to ensure the European Union gets its fair share of vaccines.  I will put it into perspective, and I ask the Deputy not to take me wrong here.  When it came to the latest crisis triggered by Covid-19, within just a few months we adopted more than 1,000 legal acts.  Therefore, it might happen that mistakes are committed in this way.  This was the case also on that Friday.<\/p> <p>  In the draft which was presented where purely the vaccination element was covered, an administrative mistake was made.  I want to make it 100% clear that this article was never activated.  There was immediate communication between the Taoiseach, the President, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and me.  I fully respect the committee's right to scrutiny and that it is doing its job.  I understand that and therefore I am participating in this discussion and doing my best to explain to the committee the state of mind and how the decisions were taken on that date.<\/p> <p>  I also want to reaffirm once again, as I did on that occasion, that the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland remains unaffected by the European measures to ensure transparency of vaccine exports.  These measures will never entail a hard border on the island of Ireland.  In addition, this has been acknowledged several times today by me and by the President of the European Commission in the European Parliament and on multiple other occasions.<\/p> <p>  At this stage what is important is to ensure that we avoid anything like this happening in the future.  Therefore, we are setting up the new mechanism within the Commission.  I can absolutely promise the committee that we will respect fully all the elements linked with Article 16.  I agree with the Deputy; we also hope that we would never trigger it.  For that to happen, there are very precise ways how to do it, what the consultation time should be and how it should be discussed.  Of course, Ireland will always be consulted on this issue especially if there are sensitivities concerning the Northern Ireland protocol.<\/p><p>If asked, the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs would confirm that we have absolutely open channels of communication.  Ireland's permanent representatives in Brussels are fully informed about what we do.  We are working together to get out of the current situation and to ensure the protocol is properly implemented.<\/p><p> Speaking of scrutiny, I will be very happy to meet the committee again at a time it finds convenient to outline how we have learned from the mistakes, how we are implementing the protocol and how we are dealing with many challenges.  The change is fundamental.  The transition that is needed is massive and the number of issues for which we need to look for solutions is enormous.  It is a also a matter of having a standing relationship between the Irish Parliament, the Commission and me.  I would also be very happy to facilitate interaction with the Commissioners who are leading on certain files and areas that are important to the implementation of the trade and co-operation agreement.  I would very much like to underscore our willingness to have permanent engagement, to ensure we understand each other well, and to have the lines of communication always open in order to discuss any matter the Irish Parliament or the Irish feel is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank Vice-President &Scaron;efovi.  I welcome him warmly.  His presence is very much appreciated.<\/p> <p>  Everyone agrees that the decision by the European Commission to invoke Article 16 as part of the vaccine export authorisation scheme was a huge error of judgment.  It would not have happened had the Commission taken the time to consult any of its Irish colleagues.  I listened to Mr. &Scaron;efovi's comments to the effect that mistakes were made.  Regrets have been stated and apologies have been offered.  I commend Mr. &Scaron;efovi on attending today.  It speaks volumes about the commitment of the EU to the Irish protocol and its protection.  It is imperative that the Commission examine the decision-making process to ensure what happened does not happen again.  This meeting is an integral part of that process.  While Mr. &Scaron;efovi outlined some of the measures that will be put in place and touched on the clearing house mechanism to ensure that what happened will not recur, it is unfortunate that he did not answer the key questions that a number of my colleagues have put to him.  The questions concern learning from the mistake and the matter of who made the decision to invoke Article 16.  Mr. &Scaron;efovi outlined the rationale as to why it was considered, but the critical part has not been addressed.  I look forward to our ongoing engagement on the structures that will be put in place, such as the clearing house mechanism, and I hope we will have Mr. &Scaron;efovi before us again to scrutinise these measures.<\/p> <p>  It is unfortunate, but all too predictable, that forces have seized on the error of judgment for local political purposes in the North.  The DUP has always been opposed to the Good Friday Agreement.  This is part of the reason for its support of Brexit and its opposition to the protocol.  It is also the reason for the opposition to the protocol, for wider strategic purposes, of the British Government.  It is crucial that action be taken to de-escalate the situation as it stands.  It is time for calm heads to prevail.  We need to stabilise the circumstances in the North and to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is protected.  The experience of the Irish when dealing with the British has been that they are fundamentally untrustworthy.  It is their practice to reach an agreement and immediately ignore key parts of it.  Examples are the non-implementation of the citizenship provisions of the Good Friday agreement, the language Act section of the St. Andrews Agreement and the legacy proposals of the Stormont House Agreement.<\/p> <p>There is a tendency to start negotiating the dilution of agreements immediately.  Therefore, I urge vigilance in the implementation of all agreements, including the withdrawal and trade and co-operation agreements.<\/p> <p>  Not all issues in Ireland have been resolved.  Some of these have been discussed here this morning.  The all-Ireland economy is still being damaged by the removal of the free movement of EU nationals, limits to cross-Border services and, indeed, divergence on labour standards and workers' rights.  Given the likelihood of an Irish unity referendum in the coming years, it is important that the EU be prepared for it.  Part of this involves keeping the North as close as possible in regulatory terms.  This will make it easier to bring the North back into the EU if there is a successful referendum on unity, as I believe will be the case.  The EU needs to work with the anti-Brexit parties in the Northern Executive.  In this regard, there is a particularly significant role for Ms Michelle O'Neill, the joint First Minister, who is from the largest anti-Brexit party.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of proposals that I would like to put to Mr. &Scaron;efovi for his consideration.  I would appreciate his comments on them.  The first concerns the granting of MEP observer status to representatives from the North of Ireland.  Representatives could also participate in the European Committee of the Regions.  We should consider MLAs in this regard.  I propose representation at the European Economic and Social Committee.  Representatives could include employers and representatives of trade unions and other bodies from civil society.  Allowing Executive Ministers to participate in Council of Ministers meetings as part of the Irish delegation could be considered.  I would appreciate Mr. &Scaron;efovi's views on those proposals.  What are his views on allowing civil servants from the North of Ireland to participate in relevant Council working groups and on the creation of an office for representatives from the Northern Assembly in Brussels?  These are key areas that need to be considered.  I would appreciate Mr. &Scaron;efovi's views on them.  I  thank him again for engaging with us this morning.  I look forward to hearing his views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#G00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I thank Mr. Brady for all the questions.  I wish to highlight that we have obviously been doing our utmost to de-escalate or calm down the situation.  The tone of my letter really shows that we have been doing our utmost to be constructive in responding to the communication from Mr. Gove.  We have demonstrated we are working on some of the issues that are pertinent to the all-Ireland economy, such as the issue of steel, and many other elements.  We will continue to do so.  I was very pleased that in our meeting with Mr. Gove, we agreed on the joint statement.  De-escalation, stabilisation and the reiteration of our utmost commitment to the proper implementation of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland were clearly underscored.<\/p><p>We are very much focusing on all outstanding issues on the table with a view to finding a solution to them.  Of course, the solution will have to be in accordance with the agreements we have signed, with EU law and with the understanding we agreed upon already in December.<\/p><p> We are all for any step forward to calm the situation, de-escalate it and show a constructive spirit.  We are also ready to engage with business leaders and civic society in Northern Ireland, to listen to them carefully and to present this transformation as a possible business opportunity, given the fact that Northern Ireland is part of the Single Market and part of the internal United Kingdom market.  Northern Ireland actually operates in two markets.  I believe that for business leaders, this is a major opportunity.  Yet, I understand that until we get to the opportunity part we have to make it through all the adjustments and adaptation to the new reality that was brought about by the UK leaving the customs union and the Single Market.<\/p><p> As I said, I am open to any consultations and communications.  However, in all our contacts we have to respect the constitutional arrangements, how we signed the agreements and the treaty signed between the EU and the UK.  This involves our counterparts for the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and, as recently announced, the partnership council for overseeing the implementation of the trade and co-operation agreement, including the UK's Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr. Gove.

It shows the interest that the European Commission has in dealing with this issue.  I welcome what he says.<\/p> <p>  We all accept that Brexit was going to be a disaster that needed to be mitigated, and the Irish protocol was a major part of that.  I accept the support of the European Commission in ensuring that no hard border will be re-erected on the island of Ireland and its support for the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  I note that Mr. &Scaron;efovi does not want to go into the individual acts which led to the mistake around the threat to trigger Article 16.  If this body is not going to be given that information, that is one thing.  I would like to get clarity from Mr. &Scaron;efovi that the European Commission will absolutely investigate and break down how that happened, because we all get the absolute seriousness of it.  We need to look into exactly what the mechanisms are to ensure it does not happen again.  I welcome the comments of Mr. &Scaron;efovi about a horizontal overview and a clearing house.  I assume that would also involve checks with Dublin and Belfast.  Can Mr. &Scaron;efovi give any indication of how this would work?  If not, can Mr. &Scaron;efovi come back to this committee and others?  I believe it is vital that this information is put out.  To a degree it might lessen some of the concerns that exist.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to get some information on the interaction of Mr. &Scaron;efovi with Michael Gove.  Obviously, the British Government has threatened several things at different times.  I welcome what Mr. &Scaron;efovi says in respect of his conversations with Michael Gove.  They have been useful in respect of support for the Irish protocol and the fact that it is part of an international agreement that is not going anywhere.  What has Michael Gove said in respect of Mr. &Scaron;efovi asking questions about the real-time access to customs databases and the issue the European Commission has with border control posts?  This fits in with what the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Transport say to the effect that one major issue still is the lack of preparations in Britain.  This extends to the lack of preparations by British firms and that is impacting on this situation.  In fairness, Mr. &Scaron;efovi spoke about 24 February being a major date.  What does he expect at that point?  Will we have dealt with a considerable amount of any modifications or leeway that are necessary in respect of the movement of freight and other issues?  These are all issues that we want to see dealt with.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that Mr. &Scaron;efovi is open to ongoing dialogue with stakeholders and dealing with modifications.  Political unionism has made its decisions on how it will play its hand in the next election.  To a degree, it is operating a playbook it used in the 1980s and the 1880s, and that is unfortunate.  If the European Commission wants to sell the Irish protocol to businessmen and farmers from a unionist and nationalist background, it may need to aim above political unionism.  I would welcome any interaction with the necessary stakeholders.  I am seeking some clarity from Mr. &Scaron;efovi that he will engage with some groupings in Ireland who have been engaged in campaigning against Brexit and for mitigations.  I would like to think that Border Communities Against Brexit is one of these organisations.  If not, it should be considered in that regard.  I would welcome any information that could be given in respect of what Deputy Brady has asked about Northern representation.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been clear.  The argument that Irish unity is the only solution to dealing long-term with the issues of the British Border in Ireland is being understood and believed by far more people now.<\/p> <p>  If we finally get to a better time, post pandemic and post vaccinations, I would like to think we could invite Mr. &Scaron;efovi to visit the Border region.  Obviously, the most important part of the region is where County Louth, my constituency, touches the Border.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#H00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>My thanks to the Deputy for the invitation.  I hope that, Covid permitting, progress on the protocol will allow us to have that visit as soon as possible.  Of course, it would be an occasion to come again to the committee.  I would prefer to do it in person rather than via my computer.  My thanks to the Deputy for the invite.<\/p> <p>  One of the questions concerned the mechanism.  As I said, we want to ensure that we learn from the past and, therefore, we want to introduce a horizontal oversight mechanism, including the clearing house and the central role on the level of services that is played by the Secretariat General.  This will ensure that it will have proper assessment of the situation and that the proposals for political decisions are properly done and assessed.<\/p> <p>  Another question concerned the work of the joint committee or specialist committee.  Before we arrived at any decision of course we discussed it in great detail with member states.  I can tell the committee that Ireland is one of the most vocal, active and engaged member states.  We talk to our Irish friends and partners frequently at expert level, at ambassadorial level and at the top level of political representatives, including the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.<\/p><p>This will continue in the future and the high quality relationship the Commission has with Ireland prevented us from making that mistake graver because, as I said, we never activated Article 16 thanks to the intense interaction which took place between the Irish top-level representatives and the European Commission.<\/p><p> Concerning the border crossing points and IT systems, we agreed with Chancellor Gove - and this should be the topic for the next joint committee - that we will get the proper overview of where the UK is with the implementation of the protocol and the commitments and engagements agreed upon in our meeting in December.  For example, for border crossing points we agreed a so-called open book approach, which has worked well since last summer.  This approach means that UK authorities have been transparent about how construction works are continuing, the roadmap to completion of the works and when the border crossing points would be fully operational.  We aim to achieve that in the summer of this year.<\/p><p> We agreed it would be good to have the same approach when it comes to the IT customs systems.  We understand it is a massive undertaking to adjust the database to this new kind of relationship and we would like to hear - and this is also, I understand, a commitment from Michael Gove - what stage we are at in terms of making IT access available to the European Commission and the European Union and what are the major problems.  There are issues with the migration of the IT system, which we understand.  When will these things happen, what are the problems and when and how they will be fixed?  This is the information I hope we will get and hear from our British partners and counterparts.  That is the best way to proceed on all issues listed in both of our letters.  Currently, our experts working in the specialised committees are frequently in touch and we hope to have more clarity on these issues, which will open the possibility of moving closer to full implementation and the resolution of other problems that are popping up.  These problems are natural in such a massive relationship as that we are building and forming into a new shape and which was triggered by the UK leaving the European Union.<\/p><p> On different stakeholders, when we have a joint committee session it is the norm and there have always been interventions from the First Minister of Northern Ireland, Madame Foster, and the deputy First Minister, Madame O'Neill.  It is the standing practice that both representatives intervene in our deliberations.  Often, representatives of Ireland intervene in these discussions and we usually have the presence of most EU member states in such discussions.  That is a good practice which we will definitely continue with so the voice of Northern Ireland is properly heard when we discuss issues in the joint committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for his time this morning.  We all appreciate how much time he is giving us.  He will be blue in the face by the time the session is over from being asked the same question over and over.  It is because we are genuinely frustrated at not getting the response we expected.  The announcement made on 29 January was, for us, probably far greater than a mistake.  I believe the only reason it was rowed back upon was because of the enormous response and backlash it received.  It is obvious to all of us that it was a decision that was made emotionally.  The Commission was peeved - I use that phrase but it was probably far stronger than that - at what it perceived to be a fast one with regard to the supply of vaccines in the European Union versus the United Kingdom.  It was an emotion-based response but it was also a rookie response.  It is difficult to understand as none of us associate the word \"rookie\" with the European Commission.  None of us associates a disassociation from what invoking Article 16 would have done to the island of Ireland versus the painstaking determination of the negotiations of the previous four years to ensure that exactly that did not ever happen to the island of Ireland, its people, its economy and, most importantly, our peace.  Until we understand how that rookie mistake came about, it is difficult for us to appreciate and accept the new protocols the Commissioner has described so eloquently today and his assurance that it will never happen again.<\/p> <p>  A number of my colleagues are still to speak and I fear the Commissioner will be asked the same question by every one of us.  We need to understand how that mistake happened rather than mincing words as to whether the article was invoked or not.

We are all well aware that the only reason it was pulled back from was the massive backlash that came from that statement.  I do not know if there is something stopping the Commissioner or he is protecting someone in the office or the Commission, but it is important for every member of this committee and every citizen on the island of Ireland to understand how that happened so we can be assured it will never happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#J00200","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the question.

Would part of the clearing house process, communications or overview involve consultation with the Irish Commissioner and his or her office?<br\/><br\/>The problems the protocol is causing for businesses and civic society in Northern Ireland have been exaggerated for political reasons among certain political parties.  There have been post-Brexit administrative delays and problems with supply chains, as well as increased transportation costs.  Northern Irish supermarkets have experienced shortages of time-sensitive goods such as fresh produce and chilled meats.  Other issues have arisen with, for example, the movement of seed potatoes and family pets.  Is the Commissioner confident that practical and sensible modifications can be brought forward for the operation and the implementation of the protocol, having regard to the issues I have just outlined?  Can there be an extension to the grace period?<br\/><br\/>A recent article in the <i>Sunday Telegraph<\/i>reported that Michael Gove is considering an alternative mutual enforcement plan to the protocol that would remove the border from the Irish Sea and restore the land border in Ireland, which would require the UK and the EU to apply checks at the same level as each other.  Obviously this is unacceptable to us in Ireland.  I assume it is unacceptable to the European Commission as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#J00400","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>We are fully aware that the protocol will be voted on in four years' time.  I hope that we will not need four years to resolve these practical issues.  I was hoping we would have resolved them in December.  That was the point of our super intense negotiations during which we were discussing the grace period for meat exports, health certificates, special authorisation processes for medicines and so forth.  At that time what I understood from our UK partners was that the grace period was very much welcomed by the UK Government.<\/p> <p>  At that time also, it told us that the unilateral declarations were sufficient to do the necessary adaptations.  We also have to be honest.  The decision to leave EU, Single Market and customs union entails dramatic transformation of our mutual relationship.  I thank the Deputy for those kind words about the intensity and the length of the negotiations on the protocol.  We were looking to square the circle and I think we succeeded for the sake of all-island prosperity, stability and peace.  It was not easy to do but we found the solutions.<\/p> <p>  I am glad that in our joint statement that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, clearly reiterated his full support for the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  There are clear obligations on both of us.  I assure the Deputy that on the EU's behalf that we will do our utmost.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, it is also quite clear that certain adaptations will be needed in economic life and distribution chains.  The UK decided to become a third country as of 1 January.  This is demonstrated in all the complications we are discussing today.  We are there to solve the problems and look for all possible solutions.  We signed agreements into EU law.  Our UK counterparts know EU law very well because they have been members of the Single Market for 47 years.  They know very well our flexibilities and possibilities.  We are ready to work with them.  Regarding the protocol, it will be seen as an opportunity for Northern Ireland and Ireland to actually benefit from the unique solution we found in it.<\/p> <p>  On the concrete issues of supply chains and the shortages in Northern Irish supermarkets, we knew that this might happen.  We were discussing, therefore, discussing this with our UK counterparts over the past year to be ready for 1 January.  We offered an extension of the transition period to have more time for this transformation.  In the end, the decision was taken about 1 January, this grace period and being ready.  That is the situation where we are right now.  I will listen with great care and attention to the business leaders and civic society representatives of Northern Ireland as to how it is on the ground and what we can do to ensure the protocol is seen for what it really is, namely, a solution for peace, prosperity, as well as the positive and prosperous future of Northern Ireland and the whole island of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  That is our common task and we will be able to do this both ways.  The UK is committed to adapt, adjust and accept its new relationship.  It is crafted because of its insistence on being two sovereign equals and having it enshrined in the agreement.  We must also respect and deliver on our commitments, which have been clearly written when we were discussing how to implement the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  It is important and crucial for EU member states to hear and assess how the flexibilities, which we already agreed with the UK, are used before discussion about any further extensions.  These are concrete issues, which are now discussed by our colleagues under the umbrella of specialised committee.  I hope we will have an in-depth discussion on all of these issues next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice-President for attending the committee and I appreciate his generosity of time this morning.<\/p> <p>  I believe it is important that we extol for Northern Ireland the virtues, the benefits and the potential of the new-found arrangement in which finds itself.  It is a living arrangement.<\/p><p>Northern Ireland, in a sense, should be at the consultative table, at the very top, to express concerns and flag issues for Northern Ireland.  That is not possible at the moment.  Notwithstanding the constitutional sensitivities, would the EU explore with the UK, respecting the Constitution, giving Northern Ireland a voice in the heart of Europe?  Obviously, that would have to be done amicably.  The Vice-President might then report back to this member state because, if it is not a runner, that will certainly shape the minds of people in the Republic of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I anticipate we would be very generous.  We would have to look at constitutional change to allow a voice for Northern Ireland at formal committee meetings here and in the two Houses.  That is something the EU will deal with and will have to face down the line.  I want to have that exhausted first.  What generosity is there between ourselves and the UK, recognising the international Good Friday Agreement and Northern Ireland's new position, to put Northern Ireland front and centre?  Northern Ireland's voice is not being heard properly at the moment.<br\/><br\/>I do not want to repeat what fellow Senators and Deputies have said this morning but I fully concur with it.  I want to approach it from a different angle, almost from an interest in history, if very modern history.  A spectacular own goal was scored by the EU but it could have been so much worse, to try to be optimistic about this.  I have never seen on the island of Ireland such spontaneous unison, although people might be coming from different constituencies.  We did not have that unanimous acclamation at the time of the Good Friday Agreement, when the DUP opposed it.  Every single voice abhorred what happened but mistakes happen, even of this magnitude.  The ground has been well covered.  We have to look positively at the fact people drew back from the brink.  The<i>Titanic<\/i>did not hit the iceberg.  It is never too late.<br\/><br\/>On a question that has not been covered yet, could the Vice-President put on record who I should thank, as a parliamentarian, for averting going into the abyss?  I would like to shake that person's hand, although it might not be possible in Covid times.  Is it the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or both, or the Irish Government?  If the Taoiseach did this, and he was vigilant and was not asleep at the wheel while we were riding into the abyss, it is the greatest single day of a living Taoiseach in protecting peace in this country since Bertie Ahern&rsquo;s clinching of the Good Friday Agreement.  I would like to know who I should thank.  I do not believe it is the EU bureaucrats.

I assure him that when it comes to contact on Northern Ireland, at the expert level we are in frequent contact with them, and on everything that concerns the implementation of the protocol, we are discussing that with the experts.  We are in touch with the Executive.  When, for example, that video conference was scheduled, we were in concrete and very intense contact with the Northern Ireland Executive.  We very much appreciate, as I said, the great co-operation we have on the ground with the Northern Irish partners and with the Northern Irish police.  There are collegial and very friendly relations and a good atmosphere there between our customs and phytosanitary people and their Northern Irish counterparts.  There is really a lot going on.  The feeling, when I was talking to our people who are working in Northern Ireland, was very positive.  It was a mutual learning process, with strong working relationships, with people looking into ways to improve the performance, very often under very difficult circumstances.  Therefore, we very much appreciate all the close co-operation on the safety and security of our personnel there.  Again, that has been done directly with the Northern Irish representatives and we are very thankful for that.<\/p> <p>  The Northern Irish representatives are also part of all of our specialised bodies, and I am talking about specialised committees that are there taking part in the discussion.  As I said, they are also always intervening in our discussions on the joint committee, where the First Minister and Deputy First Minister always intervene and listen with great attention and great care, working together on finding appropriate answers.<\/p> <p>  On whom to thank, I can tell the Senator that in those fateful three hours, all of our phones were buzzing and ringing constantly.  I know the Taoiseach and also the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, were in frequent contact with all of us and there was intense discussion between the Taoiseach and President Ursula von der Leyen.  My very good friend, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, would confirm that we spoke at least five times, not only that afternoon and that evening, but also on the Saturday on Sunday and, I would say, every single day until we had that video conference with both representatives of the Northern Ireland Executive.  It was very good that a mistake was spotted so quickly and, as I said, within three hours, we corrected it.<\/p> <p>  My plea here, and I know I am repeating myself, is to look at this against the backdrop of what the EU and the Commission were always trying to do for Ireland and Northern Ireland, all the support for peace, all the support for different projects, how proud we were when we could inaugurate that bridge between two communities, built by EU financial support, and we named it PEACE because that was very important for all of us.  There is unwavering commitment for the success of PEACE, for the success of the withdrawal agreement and for proper implementation of the protocol.  Of course, we do it with the single objective of stability, peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland.  I know it is an enormous task but, here, we would like to work as closely as possible with Ireland, with Northern Ireland and also with our UK counterparts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Good morning to the Vice-President.

I do not think the process was followed correctly to invoke that article.<\/p> <p>  Although nobody has asked about this issue this morning, I am going to ask about it.  What mistakes have been made with regard to the procurement of vaccines?  We have the third largest buying power in the world.

As members are aware, I was appointed at the beginning of January to represent the EU in the partnership council, which is a body that was constituted under the trade and co-operation agreement.  A couple of days ago, Michael Gove was appointed to represent the UK in the partnership council.  We will have to constitute the partnership council as soon as possible and then the next step would be to set up a network of 19 specialised committees which would cover all the different aspects of the huge trade and co-operation relationship we have, and I believe we will develop with the United Kingdom in these new circumstances of the UK being a third country.<\/p><p> I am sure members already heard that one of the first tasks of the partnership council will also be to look at the ratification of the trade and co-operation agreement.  In the end the Council supported the position of some member states that we would need more time for a conclusion of the ratification process because of the need to have appropriate authentic linguistic versions finalised so they could give their approval for the ratification.  We are still waiting and working very closely with the European Parliament on the consent role.  All that should be completed by the end of April when there will not only be provisional but full entry into force of the new trade and co-operation agreement between the EU and the UK.<\/p><p> If members will allow me to mentally picture the situation if the EU did not proceed with unanimity, unity and solidarity, we can ask what would be the situation on the vaccine market, how strong the big member states would be and what it would mean for the smaller and medium sized member states.  We had just a small glimpse of that in the spring of last year when we suddenly discovered we had big problems with procuring health material and protective gear for health professionals.  Therefore, I think it was the right decision, and I am glad that we have huge support for that approach from all member states to act with unity and solidarity and to have a joint approach to acquiring the necessary vaccines and also to invest well in advance in the most promising companies.  As members can see, our assessment was the correct one because all the vaccines that are currently on the market were also supported financially by the European Union to develop them and to accelerate production.<\/p><p> What was perhaps not properly assessed at the time &ndash; this is not only the problem of the European Commission but also the companies with which we signed the advance purchase agreements &ndash; is that sometimes they were too optimistic about how they could scale up the production of the vaccines.  One executive of a pharmaceutical company said that last year the company produced 100,000 vaccines and now it needs to produce 1 billion.  This is a huge scale-up and it very often entails industrial adjustments to the production facilities.  What we learned is useful for the steps we will take in the future because we now have the transparency we need.  We know how many vaccines are manufactured in the EU and where they are going.  The pharmaceutical companies are now making sure that if there is any shortfall or if they are not able to supply the quantities of the vaccines they promised, the shortfall in supply is fairly distributed among those with whom they have contracts.  That is very important, as is the fact that there is a ramp-up in supplies.  We expect that in the second quarter the vaccine supply for the European market will be sufficient to meet our agreed goal of having 70% of the adult population vaccinated by the end of the summer.<\/p><p> I accept that we must be aware of the new variants, be they the British or the South African ones.  We are also looking at how we can accelerate the authorisation process for the necessary boost of the vaccines or an adjustment to the vaccines that already exist.  We have to look at this from the perspective that 26 million vaccines have already been delivered to member states.  If I remember correctly, something like 17 million people have already been vaccinated, at least with the first dose.  When one assesses the rate of the vaccination roll-out, European member states are among the top 50 countries in the world.  I am from Slovakia and I am sure that if we did not proceed as one with a unified approach, strong negotiation and the pressure we brought by being the biggest trading bloc, my country would not be among the top 50 because it would be extremely difficult to negotiate such a complex agreement with big pharmaceutical companies.  That is a little related to another topic, but I very much appreciate the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021021600002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>We are very grateful for Mr. &Scaron;efovi's time this morning and his participation in the meeting.

It is very significant to have him with us today, albeit virtually, in our national Parliament.  We are very grateful for that.<\/p> <p>  Without going back over old ground, the committee does not want to enter a blame-game scenario, nor do we want heads to roll.  What we are specifically looking for is accountability, transparency and consequences.  I know Mr. &Scaron;efovi has emphasised time and again that Article 16 was not fully triggered.  It is a matter of language, however.  I assume a group of individuals, rather than one person, compiled a draft report of such significant impact and that those individuals knew the potential repercussions.  Senator Martin suggested that the iceberg was avoided, but a bit of damage was still done to the wing and we are still living with those consequences.  It is very important that the individuals involved in preparing the draft report know about the consequences and are spoken to at length about them.

As I have told the committee, I am from Slovakia.  I will never forget what Ireland did for my country.  I still remember today, how warmly Slovakia was welcomed as a new member state.   In the good old times, there was a big party in the main square in Cork.  There was beer and a great atmosphere.  We all felt so proud when our flag was presented, for the first time, at Dublin Castle, as one of the flags of the new EU member states.  I remember it well personally, as do the other member states, because on that day we became new members of the European Union.  I thank Ireland for the atmosphere, hospitality and the graciousness it showed us that day.  I am making this point at the end of the discussion today because I wanted to focus, in my answers, on the questions asked by the committee members, and to respect the scrutiny and accountability which the members of this committee, as parliamentarians, Senators, and Members of the D&aacute;il undertake on a daily basis.

I very much respect that.<\/p> <p>  The members have asked about the timetable for the introduction of the new systems in the European Commission.  As I said, we are introducing this clearing house, which is already happening right now.  It was decided that under the Secretariat General, we will have horizontal oversight of all the measures taken concerning the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  I can assure members that this implies even more focus on all issues related to the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It was also agreed that Commissioners with the highest stake in this new EU-UK relationship will meet at least once a month to take stock of where we are heading and to provide important updates, to make sure that we have political ownership and oversight of the development of this most important relationship.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about my colleague, Mairead McGuinness.

The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  If, however, they are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings that a witness physically present would.

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.

I might start by posing a question.  Would any Government today consider bringing a Bill to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that would allow lending organisations to charge rates of 187% APR on small loans to often vulnerable people?  Of course not.  It would be ethically and morally wrong for such rates to be charged to a borrower by any lending organisation.  There would be an uprising if banks or credit unions were to charge such rates, but that is what is happening today with home collection moneylenders.  If it is deemed wrong to introduce a Bill that would allow these rates to be charged, it is just as wrong to permit such rates to continue to be charged.  Our ask of the committee is for it to address this issue by introducing legislation that would impose a maximum interest rate for small personal loans by licensed home collection moneylending organisations and a prohibition on fees and charges.  We must stress that our goal is not to put moneylending organisations out of business; rather, it is to ensure that borrowers can have access to small personal loans at a reasonable cost.<\/p> <p>  I will now explain what very high interest rates mean for home collection moneylending borrowers.  A typical loan is &euro;500 and a typical period is six months.  In the course of a year, a borrower could take out two six-month loans of &euro;500 each, which would cost &euro;300 in interest.  That is &euro;300 to have &euro;500 made available to the borrower over 12 months.  The equivalent interest cost from a credit union would be &euro;30.<\/p><p>Comparing &euro;300 with &euro;30, it is a multiplier of ten.<\/p><p> Why are these organisations issued with a licence each year with permission to charge these very high rates?  It is because of the business model that the home collection moneylenders operate or, in other words, how they conduct their business.  Repayments are weekly and are collected by agents at or often in the borrower's home.  This is an intrusive, public and, importantly, a very expensive way of collecting repayments.  For the business to be profitable, it requires extremely high interest rates to generate sufficient income to offset the very high labour costs.  In spite of the very high cost and the dependency it creates, it is recognised that the model generates high satisfaction rates due to its convenience and reasonably assured credit.<\/p><p> Why is such a business model still operating in 2021?  I am old enough to remember my mother making cash payments in a working class area of Dublin on Friday evenings to the insurance agent, the milkman and the bread man.  Now that it is 2021 and we are living in an era of electronic payments, it is anachronistic that this method of repayment still exists.  Of course, it is a mechanism that works to the advantage of the moneylenders.  They have few marketing costs and get to know their borrowers intimately.  They often perpetuate their presence through each generation in the family.  It is important to note that they have no incentive to take a less costly approach to repayment collection or to manage credit risk differently so long as they are allowed to charge very high interest rates.<\/p><p> If a cap on interest rates were introduced, the moneylenders would have to change their business model to remain viable.  Intriguingly, they have had to do this already in 2020 and 2021 during the three lockdown periods, when they could not collect from borrowers' homes.  The written submission we provided to the committee does not suggest the level at which the interest rate cap should be set.  The territory of interest rates can be very complex, with annual percentage rate, APR, simple interest, compound interest, amortisation, etc.  It is important that any cap can be easily understood and facilitate comparability.  Some EU countries have adopted a cap based on a multiple of a market rate.  This concept, which is based on a simple interest calculation, could give a sound basis for a cap and would be easily understood.  The key question then would be the size of the multiplier, a number which, in my view, should be significantly less than the multiplier of ten I to which I referred earlier.<\/p><p> As already stated, we are not seeking to eliminate this source of credit.  We propose that the ultimate cap should be publicly declared and then introduced on a step-down basis over several years.  This will provide the time for all those impacted, and borrowers in particular, to adjust.  It will also provide time to manage the known implementation risks and any additional issues which inevitably arise in a change such as this.  In conclusion, we strongly believe that the Government owes it to some of its most vulnerable people to address this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021021600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Whelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to present on the Bill.  This opening statement was prepared by Dr. Noreen Byrne, who is also participating in the meeting, and I.  Our report on interest rate restrictions included a range of recommendations, one of which calls for the introduction of a restriction on interest rates and charges for moneylending loans.<br\/><br\/>As of 4 February, the Central Bank registry shows that there are 36 moneylenders currently licensed in Ireland.  Most of these are doorstep lenders who traditionally collect payments in person from borrowers at their homes or other locations.  Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions, there is evidence to suggest that this model has changed somewhat, allowing repayments to be made by phone or online rather than in person.  The highest rate currently being charged by licensed moneylenders is 187% APR.  This does not include collection charges, which can raise the APR to 287%.  The typical moneylending customers are seen to be those who can least afford the high interest costs relative to available borrowing alternatives.  The reasons people continue to borrow from moneylenders are multifaceted and often reduce the sensitivity of the borrower to the cost of the loan.  These may include family tradition, convenience, direct marketing, poor credit history and habit.  The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, credit unions and others are reporting &quot;client creep&quot; into groups of consumers on higher incomes who are struggling to cope financially, particularly since the previous financial crisis.<br\/><br\/>In Europe, there has been a clear trend towards the use of interest rate restrictions as a policy tool, with 21 EU member states now having some form of interest rate cap on high-cost credit.  The recommendations in our report call on the Government, in the interests of fairness to the most vulnerable in Irish society, to prohibit the currently allowed usurious rates of interest which licensed moneylenders are permitted to charge.  To be effective, an interest rate restriction would have to be coupled with restrictions on other fees and charges and a limit on the total cost of credit.  In our recommendations, we also advocate a redoubling of efforts to promote financial inclusion and education initiatives to support consumers in making better financial choices, especially where household resources are limited.<br\/><br\/>The amendment to section 9 of the Consumer Credit Act seeks to impose a maximum APR of 36% chargeable on loans issued by licensed moneylenders.  We agree with the need to impose an interest rate cap, supporting fair and reasonably priced credit for all, subject to the implementation of accompanying measures already outlined.  The main argument that is often put forward against the imposition of an interest rate cap for licensed moneylenders is the fear that a reduction in the availability of credit will fuel illegal moneylending.  The reported evidence for this appears to be weak.  Recent research we have conducted with social housing residents, which is due to be launched later this year, demonstrates that those on low incomes employ a wide range of coping strategies when they run out of money.  The New Economics Foundation in the UK has pointed out that a focus on reducing debt dependency is needed.  This can be achieved by reducing the cost of credit.  Every &euro;1 subsequently not paid in loan interest can then be used to build household savings and, in turn, household resilience, while reducing the need for future credit.<br\/><br\/>We recommend that, following agreement on the ultimate target cap, an incremental introduction of interest rate restrictions take place to allow for a phasing out of high interest rates over an agreed period.  This will facilitate the adjustment of all parties, the implementation of other supportive policy or legislative measures and fine-tuning in light of developments on the ground until the final target is reached.  It is important that the first move be the introduction of an interim rate in order to develop momentum.  If that is not done, the <i>status quo<\/i>will remain.  It is envisaged that this first interim rate restriction will prompt a re-examination of the moneylending business model.<br\/><br\/>Other considerations may include a tiered approach, allowing for somewhat higher rates on smaller loans over a shorter duration.  This recognises the costs associated with the administration of smaller loans and might serve to mitigate against any fears that consumers would move to illegal moneylenders in the absence of a tailored and widespread alternative in the shorter term or until such time as reliable alternatives are fully enabled, widely available and highly accessible.  It may also act to disincentivise an increasing loan duration or a larger loan which might go beyond the capacity of the borrower.<br\/><br\/>Consideration should be given to the introduction of a requirement for consumers who wish to continue to avail of repayment collections in person to opt-in for this service.  This would enable consumers to make more informed and conscious decisions about the cost of a loan that is collected in person versus a loan not collected in person.<br\/><br\/>Finally, there should be reflection on the potential of the US community reinvestment approach, which requires financial institutions to make a financial contribution in the geographical area in which they operate and to demonstrate that they meet the credit needs of those on low or moderate incomes.  A financial contribution from the banking sector could be used to resource a widespread preventative debt or systematic financial education service in addition to the curative debt advice service offered by MABS.<br\/><br\/>Steps need to be taken now to develop a phased implementation plan with a final target in mind and to demonstrate the will to finally change this unfair system that depletes the wealth of our most vulnerable communities and keeps many trapped in persistent indebtedness.  We will be happy to engage in a process that seeks to move this forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021021600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Olive McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>We are having technical difficulties with the camera for the witnesses.

I welcome Mr. Whelan and Ms Corcoran from the Social Finance Foundation and Dr. McCarthy and Dr. Byrne.  As the sponsor of this legislation, I thank my colleagues in the committee.  They have prioritised this legislative measure despite the many pressing matters we must deal with and the restricted amount of time the committee has.  Obviously, that follows up on the unanimous support the measure received on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It is also my intention to make a submission as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny, if that is permitted, because it is something that probably chimes with our witnesses.  I believe we need to consider a more nuanced approach in terms of a tiered stepping down of the interest rate.  There are other issues I wish to address as well on foot of the engagement I have had with different sectors since I introduced the Bill in 2018.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the moral question of high interest rates, we know that what is permitted at this point in time is 187%.  Indeed, that could increase if the Central Bank wishes because there is no restriction on it in terms of the allowing of additional costs.  However, when the collection charges are included, it can increase to 288% for moneylenders that are currently operating in the Irish market.  In its opening statement, Social Finance Foundation says that it is a moral issue, first and foremost, and the question posed was how we would respond if the Government produced legislation that allowed a bank to charge these rates.  It is obvious that we would not accept legislation of that nature and, therefore, we should not accept the current practice.  Will the witnesses illustrate the financial implications of these high rates for borrowers and families?  Is it the case that these are predominantly families who have low incomes and that the borrowers are predominantly female?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021021600002#C00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Does Ms Corcoran wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021021600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Whelan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to attend the meeting today.  Regarding the implications of this, let us take the very simple level of a &euro;500 loan.  If it is a credit union loan over a six-month period, the interest a credit union would charge, even at the highest rate, would be around &euro;16.  For a typical moneylender rate of 187% APR on a &euro;500 loan, the interest is &euro;150.  A person pays back &euro;650.  We are looking at a differential of ten times, as Mr. Whelan mentioned in his opening statement.  That is a massive amount of interest.  A person is paying &euro;150 for the availability of &euro;500.  Typically, when we speak to borrowers from moneylenders we see people who would borrow &euro;500 perhaps twice in a single year.  That means somebody is paying &euro;300 for the availability of &euro;500 over a 12-month period.  That is a large amount of money.<\/p> <p>  Over the years, in terms of how we have looked at this and working with credit unions to introduce the \"It Makes Sense\" loan and the personal micro credit initiative in broader terms, we have run a number of focus groups and surveys.  Yes, one would typically see a female, often with children and usually in rented accommodation.  That would be the typical profile, but also, and Dr. McCarthy mentioned it in her opening statement, we are seeing this creep into other areas and other sections of society.  In more recent completed surveys we have seen that not only does one see moneylender borrowers in the C, D and E socioeconomic category, one also sees them in the A, B and C1 category.  This is not something that is only prevalent in certain areas.  It is far more widespread.  We often find that where we would have thought initially that perhaps the proportion of people on social welfare would be far higher, it is not.  From what we can see, the disproportionate number of people who borrow from moneylenders are employed and working, so this is not only in one section of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021021600002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Corcoran"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Corcoran.

I understand it was commissioned and funded by the Central Bank and the Social Finance Foundation.  One of the recommendations in the report is that the Government adopt a policy that prohibits ultra-high rates of interest, in the interests of fairness and the most vulnerable in society, through the introduction of a restriction on interest rates and charges.  That was in 2018.  Do they describe the current levels of interest that are permitted to be charged by moneylenders as ultra high?  Do they believe they are?

I will answer the second question first.  In July 2019, the Department of Finance issued a public consultation on interest rates for high-cost credit.  We responded to that consultation document.  There has been discussion on one of the recommendations of the report which would have originally also arisen from the credit union advisory committee.  I should state that I am a current member of that committee.  This arose from the 2016 report of the credit union advisory committee, which was before my time on that committee.  That looked to support credit unions in increasing the maximum rate of interest they could charge to 2% per month on the reducing balance, as opposed to the current 1% per month on the reducing balance.  I understand that received approval at Cabinet level at some point, but I am not sure where it is in the process at present.  However, things have been slow.  We are still awaiting a report from the public consultation that was completed in July 2019.  I understand that a draft report is available or is currently being examined.<\/p> <p>  As regards the rates, according to the registry in the Central Bank we still have moneylenders here that are charging the maximum rate at 187%.  Compare that with the alternatives to which most of the rest of us in this room have access.  This morning, I saw that my local credit union is offering a special rate of 4.99% APR.  There is just no comparison between that and 187%; it is a huge contrast.  It seems grossly unfair that anybody in my community would have to pay 187% when the local credit union is available at 4.99%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021021600002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Olive McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I agree.  That is the subject of this legislation.  To follow up on that, Dr. McCarthy and Dr. Byrne wrote in their report that global interest rate restrictions have become more prevalent in both developed and developing countries in recent years.  They state that in Europe there has been a clear trend towards the use of interest rate restrictions as a policy tool to control the high cost of credit.  The report goes on to say that, to date, 21 out of 28 EU member states now have some form of interest rate cap on credit.  It says that Ireland is now in the minority of countries in Europe that has no formalised interest rate restriction on high-cost credit and points out that the only cap we have is on credit unions at 12%.  I agree with the report's recommendation and I will appeal to the Minister for Finance to use this legislation to do both, that is, reduce the interest rates that can be charged by moneylenders while, at the same time, marginally increasing the cap for credit unions.<\/p> <p>  According to the report, other countries introduced a cap because they saw ultra-high interest rates as unjust.  Germany says they lack moral legitimacy and Spain deemed them excessive.  Finland reported it as unconscionable.  However, in Ireland it appears to be fair game.<\/p><p>With interest rate caps elsewhere in Europe being legislated for or dealt with, what has been the international experience as a result?

If we look at the example in the UK, however, the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, has been extremely active in this area.  It introduced this cap on payday lending and not so much on home collection credit, and in the area of payday lending we are looking at interest rates in the thousands of per cent.  The FCA has undertaken that initiative while also having a systematic approach to measuring the impacts and also reviewing the impact of the restriction every two to three years.<br\/><br\/>The website of the FCA is a really useful one for anyone listening today to look to get detailed information.  The FCA also has a very proactive approach to measuring the impacts experienced, as well as conducting the aforementioned systematic and ongoing review of that interest rate restriction.  There is a very interesting report on the FCA website from 2017, which surveyed high-interest rate customers.  It looked at about 1,500 such customers who had been using such high-cost credit, and asked those people what they did now without access to such loans.  Of the respondents, only two had turned to illegal moneylenders.  The report found therefore that the rate at which people turned to illegal moneylending as a result of interest rate restrictions to be quite low in the UK.<br\/><br\/>I reiterate what I said in my opening statement concerning the argument about people turning to illegal moneylending avenues being seen as an unintended consequence of an interest rate restriction.  To my mind, that argument has caused a bit of paralysis in the Irish context.  We keep going back to that argument and using it as a reason to not make any changes and to just stick with the <i>status quo<\/i>here.  The provision of legal high-cost lending is seen here as the lesser of two evils <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>illegal moneylending.  We have often just decided that it is better to leave the <i>status quo<\/i>as it and to not do any damage in this area.  <br\/><br\/>Of course, that perspective is complicated by what the definition of &quot;illegal moneylending&quot; is, and it could be anything from a friend or a neighbour giving someone a loan of some money, right up to a scene from Hollywood movies involving with illegal moneylenders and people coming to front doors with baseball bats.  What is also interesting from our perspective, however, is that we did some research with social housing residents in 2020.  What was really noticeable was that we cannot just assume that because people have reduced or no access to legal moneylending that their default action will be to go to illegal moneylenders.  People on low to moderate incomes are enormously resilient and can find all sorts of ways to meet their needs when necessary.  <br\/><br\/>I am on the board of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and that organisation would also say that people are extraordinarily resilient and will find alternative ways of dealing with their situations.  In a way, therefore, I think we should try to move on from this argument about illegal moneylending.  It is important, however, if we do introduce an interest rate restriction here that we also put in place a method of systematically reviewing the impacts of any such measure, as has been done in the UK by the FCA.  Perhaps such a review could be undertaken every year or two to ensure that any unintended consequences can be managed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021021600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Olive McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McCarthy.  I welcome that research, especially the research which was done in Ireland.  It is interesting following the two debates, while there were different restrictions in respect of payday lending, that the same types of argument were put forward regarding illegal moneylending.  I refer to the scare factor, and the impact that it might have had in the debate in the UK, but it did not play out that way ultimately.  Although people have access to credit union lending, we know that what is important in this context is ease of access, such as in situations where someone calls to people's doors to offer a loan or the ability to roll over an existing loan.  It is that ease of access that then causes people to use these channels and end up paying &euro;300 for a &euro;500 loan over 12 months, compared to &euro;30 for the same loan amount in the credit union.<\/p> <p>  On that point, and I direct this question to Mr. Whelan or Ms Corcoran, and regarding the changes taking place within moneylending operations as a result of the lockdown, what are we seeing as a result of moneylenders not being able to call to people's doors to collect money?  I refer to the online payment methods now being facilitated in this context.  The argument that used to be made concerning the reason for the high cost of such credit centred on the labour cost involved, and that was why costs needed to be that high.  Are we now seeing any changes happening in this regard, in Ireland or Britain, or in both, as a result of this current situation?  Does this situation now create an opportunity for us to begin a reduction of that first tier of the interest rates charged?  In the witnesses' view, should we announce the ultimate point to which we believe the interest rates being charged should be brought down and then step that change to the desired level over several years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021021600002#D00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I will take that question.  I am conscious that my video may not working, but there is nothing I can do on this side because I do have it switched on.  I will keep going anyway.  From informal discussions and soundings we have taken, we understand that during the periods of lockdown the moneylenders have contacted their customers.  As Ms Corcoran said earlier, the majority of those people concerned have bank accounts.  They have made their payments to the agents by quoting their bank account numbers, and those agents would then have a process where they could raise a debit on the bank accounts concerned.  We have also heard that meetings are taking place in locations other than homes, and in other cases we presume that the money owed may be being stored up until such time as the lockdown ends.<\/p> <p>  What is probably even more relevant in this regard, though, is the business of Provident Financial Group, PFG, in the UK.  It is a public limited company, PLC, listed on the FTSE100.  In its third quarter trading statement, the company reported that the proportion of collections in respect of home credit via remote methods was over 80%.  Back in 2019, Provident had announced that it was moving from manual collection of repayments via agents knocking on doors to electronic payments instead.  In a year or two, therefore, it looks like that company has managed to get 80% of its customers to pay electronically.  Provident also reported that the benefit to the company from that changeover was a reduction in costs of &euro;13 million.  The concept of moving to electronic operations and managing the credit risks that arise from not knocking on doors therefore looks to be something that the moneylenders have done successfully in the UK, and I see no reason it cannot be done here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021021600002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses from the Social Finance Foundation and UCC for appearing before us.  I found their submissions very helpful.  I also commend Deputy Doherty on introducing this important legislation, and I hope we can enact it promptly.  That is of course the responsibility of the Oireachtas and of the Government.  The area of financial services is one that requires vigorous regulation, and it is surprising that we as a country have allowed a situation to develop where people can be subject to an annual percentage rate, APR, of interest as high as 187%.  What makes this situation particularly concerning, as the witnesses have indicated to us, is that to a great extent it is low-income borrowers who are impacted in this context.<\/p> <p>  I have a question that perhaps Dr. McCarthy and Dr. Byrne may be able to help me with.  There are obviously reasons low-income borrowers go to moneylenders rather than the credit unions.  Mr. Whelan gave us the example whereby if people borrowed from a credit union they would only be paying an interest amount of &euro;30, but would have to pay up to &euro;300 for the same amount of borrowing if they go to a moneylender.  What is the reason for that happening?<\/p><p>What can we do to encourage people to go to credit unions as opposed to moneylenders?  Is it simply a question of ease of access?

Another point is that there is a tradition of using them.  People's parents would have used a moneylender in the past and now the next generation is doing the same.  Another aspect that makes it difficult to drive a change is that people have good relationships with the moneylenders.  It is usually not, as Dr. McCarthy pointed out, a baseball bat scenario.  The moneylenders are almost seen as family friends.  In addition, there is an aspect of keeping the agent in employment.  There is a bit of that going on as well.  These people are sitting in the borrower's sitting room or kitchen and the borrower knows them very well.<\/p> <p>  In regard to costs, including labour costs, one of the things on which the moneylender does not have a cost is marketing.  Moneylenders are in the family context and can prompt people and so on.  Marketing their services is a cost they do not have.  There are lots of issues involved.  Research we did some time ago involved talking to a credit union manager who had put a lot of work into getting people to switch to the credit union.  His building was across the road from a housing estate and he could see the moneylender heading back in there.  The moneylender had been moved out of the estate by the credit union offering services but people ended up, where they had funeral costs or whatever, going back to the moneylender and back into that relationship.  If we can change the context, as Ms Corcoran and Mr. Whelan noted in their submissions, then the model will change somewhat and it will be possible to transition people to a different way of operating.<\/p> <p>  Another important point is that the focus in terms of moneylending has always been on the individual.  Instead, the focus needs to be on the household and the community and looking at the where the drain of wealth out of a community is happening.  When the focus is only on the individual, we get into a scenario of people saying they are satisfied and it is a convenient service and all of that.  We end up in a place where we may ask who we are to tell someone from whom they should borrow.  If we can encourage individuals to think in a community context and to consider that moneylending leads to a massive drain of wealth out of the community, that can shift the conversation somewhat.  There may not be enough research done on this particular aspect.  We have done a few small bits but only on a geographical basis.  We tried to do that in the context of the social housing research we talked about earlier.<\/p> <p>  It is a difficult issue to tackle.  The transition idea is useful in terms of encouraging people to operate in a different way.  It is very convenient that somebody comes to the borrower's house and that person can buy a washing machine and things like that for the borrower.  That is the other point in terms of a drain of wealth.  If the moneylender is providing a washing machine, for example, it is probably purchased elsewhere, which means none of the money is staying locally.  It is all drained out of the community and there is no savings elements either.  Things need to shift towards a community wealth-building kind of conversation and space.  That encourages individuals to think differently and it encourages policymakers and everybody else to think differently as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021021600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Noreen Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>We have been running the It Makes Sense loan product scheme locally with credit unions since late 2015.  We have found that to make it attractive and to move people from a very ingrained moneylending model is very difficult.  For that particular loan product, we organised a repayment method through the household budget scheme, which made the repayments very attractive, allowed for savings and allowed the credit unions to work with people who might have a default history or just were not used to dealing with the credit union.  Those people had the support to come into the local credit union, build up that track record and move on to standard lending.  We have some amazing examples of how that has worked really well.<\/p> <p>  However, we also found as part of this initiative that it was not enough.  That is why we called for the cap on moneylending rates.  It is not enough to have a really good and attractive option.  That looks fine on paper and makes sense for some people but, for others, it does not.  It is not necessarily intuitive that somebody would go to a credit union even if the loan it is offering is at a lower rate than that offered by a moneylender.  We have also found over the years that the people who typically borrow from home-collection moneylenders deal with finances on a week-to-week basis.  It is not a case of their standing back and saying that a loan is costing them X amount more per year.  It is a question of asking whether they can afford something in a particular week.  It might be an extra fiver and they will make a decision there and then as to whether it is worth it to know they have that line of credit and that they can repay it.  Those are the things we are trying to break down as part of this effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021021600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Corcoran"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>It sounds from what the witnesses are saying that moneylenders appear to be very attuned to the needs of certain people in communities and to know when they may need money.

They tend to work in cycles.  In the first half of the year it is probably about communion and summer holidays whereas in the latter part of the year it is more about Christmas.<\/p> <p>  Although we are loath to generalise, the research on borrowers also tends to indicate that many have a weekly focus on expenditure.  When we say that during the course of a year they spend &euro;300 on interest and this could have been reduced significantly if the loan was with the credit union, they do not tend to see it that way.  They tend to see the expense as being &euro;5 per week extra and they say that is nothing or they can live with it.

When repaying a credit union loan, for example, part of the repayment includes a contribution to savings so the borrower is building up resilience.  When the loan is repaid, there would be a lump sum in savings that would support the borrower in not having to borrow again or slow down the rate of borrowing.  With the moneylending model there are no savings built in so at the end of repaying the moneylending loan, the borrower is not in a better position because he or she has not engaged in any savings through the repayment.  It is an important characteristic difference between more conventional finance and moneylending.<\/p> <p>  Of course, if a borrower is paying above the odds for a moneylending loan, this reduces a person's capacity to save anyway.  That is how a person can end up getting trapped in a cycle because the reduced capacity to save means there is no opportunity to build up any kind of resilience over the course of the loan to ensure the borrower does not have to borrow again as quickly or at all.

If a person gets into difficulty in the first place with a certain level of repayments, he or she will not be in a much better position with an increased level of repayment.

It is tempting to say that anything lower than what is currently charged is surely a step in the right direction, but that would not be enough and it is important to set an ultimate rate.  In our submission to the public consultation conducted by the Department of Finance, we suggested an interim rate of approximately 42%.  We looked at the credit union sector in the UK, which is now allowed to charge up to 42% to cater for that market, but the situation in the UK is different from here.  We are certainly looking at a much lower rate than is currently in place, and 36% or lower would be appropriate.  What is currently charged is extremely high.  My local credit union offers 4.99%.

In the report, we set out that the EU has confirmed that the process of Irish reunification would be considered a matter of public international law, comparable to German reunification.  Ireland is a member state of the European Union.  In the eventuality of reunification, the borders of the State would change but there would be no need for a treaty amendment or approval by any of the institutions.<\/p> <p>  We have also set out some of the issues with which the European institutions could assist both the Irish and British Governments.

We make the argument that there should be no requirement that those citizens take up the option of Irish citizenship.<\/p> <p>  Another matter addressed in the report is the consequences for a united Ireland in the context of economic and monetary union.

We have looked at possible changes in representation.<\/p> <p>  All of these are set out as suggestions at this point.  Some of the recommendations have made their way into the withdrawal agreement.

Like Ms Gildernew, I was in Brussels for the launch of the report, and much has happened since then.  Both Brexit and Covid have reshaped how people view the concept of a shared island and that has accelerated the debate and discussion on Irish unity, while also introducing a fresh urgency in regard to the need to plan and prepare.  The document refers to the need for prudent and responsible planning and to the role of the Irish Government in that regard.  I understand that Professor Harvey attended the launch of the shared island unit.  While that is to be welcomed, the Taoiseach stated on that occasion that a referendum would not be on his agenda for the next five years and referred to it as divisive.  Many referendums are, by their nature, divisive but that does not negate the need to plan and prepare.<\/p> <p>  I would like to get our guests' views on the shared island unit.  How could it facilitate the discussion on preparing for a referendum and could it also be used post referendum?

My question relates to the broader role of the institutions, some of which were key players in the formation and creation of the Good Friday Agreement while others are part of the outworking of the agreement itself.  In the interim as we journey towards constitutional change, what role can the institutions, such as here in the Oireachtas, play to give voice to unionist and other traditions?  Seanad by-elections are due to be held soon, and while I am not asking our guests to comment on the finer details of that issue, it affords us a unique opportunity via the Seanad to amplify unionist and other voices here.  I am keen to hear our guests' views on the importance of the institutions acting in that respect in the here and now.<\/p> <p>  One of the other key institutions that was mentioned, not just in respect of the development of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement but which has also been vocal and active in the ongoing discussion on constitutional change, is the US Congress.  I am keen to hear our guests' views on what unique role the US could play in assisting and developing those conversations and the work towards constitutional change.  The Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union recently heard from Congressman Richard Neal, the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means and the co-chairman of the Friends of Ireland caucus on Capitol Hill, and it was a very valuable contribution.  In referring to the broader institutions, Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett might comment on what they consider to be the key role for the US.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#C00400","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I will work my way through the various questions before handing over to Mr. Bassett.  On the question about the stage we are at, we are obviously further on than we were in 2019.  As everyone will know, this conversation is gaining momentum every week.  More and more initiatives are coming on board, and I have mentioned some of the civic and academic ones, with major universities now engaging in some of this preparatory work.  I started by saying I think the island is on a trajectory towards these referendums taking place in the decade ahead but there is a need for more preparatory and planning work to take place.<\/p> <p>  As for the lessons learned from Brexit, where do we start?  Two issues stand out.  In the report and throughout the work we have done, we have placed an emphasis on responsible management and planning and preparing for constitutional change on the island, and that is not coincidental.  We have looked at what happened with Brexit and we do not want that to happen on this island.  We have placed enormous stress on advanced planning so that people will know what they are voting for or against when these referendums that we believe are coming take place.  That is why the planning and preparation needs to start now.  We have also emphasised the role of civic engagement.  It is notable, for example, that Ireland's Future has placed an all-island citizens' assembly at the heart of its proposals.  We do not need a top-down process; while we do need extensive Government involvement, we need to hear from people.  Too much of the discussion on the island at the moment is based on assumptions of what people think people think, rather than engaging with wider civil society.  We would very much like there to be extensive civic engagement.<\/p> <p>  On the questions about the Irish Government, I am disappointed to see the shared island concept being used and pitted against the idea of a united Ireland.  For me, a united Ireland is a shared island.  There is no either-or; these are not separate conversations.  The shared island concept is intrinsically linked to the notion of Irish reunification.  It is a new way of sharing the island.  I would really like the shared island unit and the Irish Government to take a much more proactive leadership role in this discussion.  It is at the core of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am aware of the argument about countering divisiveness but this should not be a divisive discussion.  This is absolutely mainstream within the Good Friday Agreement and if one respects the agreement in all its parts, one has to respect the right of the people of this island to determine their own future.  There is nothing divisive about that.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the institutions, it is notable that recent work, such as the recent discussion document published by Ireland's Future, has highlighted the role of legislatures throughout these islands in informing the debate.  Too often we go straight to talking about governments but legislatures, such as the Oireachtas and the Westminster Parliament, all have roles in carrying out the necessary planning and preparatory work.<\/p><p>Ireland's Future raised a basic question recently, which was to ask every institution on this island if they are prepared.  I ask this committee that today.  Is it prepared?  Is it ready?  Has the homework been done?<\/p><p> The committee will be delighted to hear two final points.  One is engagement, invitation and being welcoming and embracing.  We need to hear the diversity of voices that exist in the North of this island in the Oireachtas.  That includes unionist voices and an increasingly diverse range of voices here that are not heard.  The committee should welcome and invite people to come and speak.  It is fed up of listening to people like me so it should invite somebody else to come to talk to it and engage.  That is a way to extend a welcome to people from all communities in the North.<\/p><p> Regarding the US, we have deliberately focused on the international picture in much of our work.  We have talked about the EU but the US also has an important role in providing support in a number of ways.  There is now a supportive President in the White House.  We enjoy bipartisan congressional support from the US for some of the issues that we are talking about today.  It is important that bipartisan support continues into the future.  We have seen the US Congress support the Good Friday Agreement, including the right to self-determination.  It is important that friends in the US reiterate their support for the right of the people on this island to determine their own future and that should be a mainstream conversation.<\/p><p> What tangible international support will be available to an island that is undergoing constitutional change?  We could nudge that conversation towards asking what tangible support the US Administration will give both before and after the referendums that we are talking about today.  I hope that that conversation will become much more concrete in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#D00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett.  We are kicking off what will be a lively debate.  It is good to get a perspective on this and kick off the conversation.  I note that there is correspondence from Ian Paisley that will probably be dealt with later.  I listened intently to the presentation by the witnesses.  I would like to get their perspective on a few matters.  For me, the Good Friday Agreement was hard-fought and took a lot to get over the line.  Many people see it in the context of those few weeks.  Much work went on behind the scenes over many years.  Why has the report not considered the impact of the US Congress and Presidency?  The Good Friday Agreement is a model that has worked for us on this island previously.  Why do the witnesses now think that we should work this through the EU?  What dialogue have they had with unionist communities and politicians and what are their impressions of the report?<\/p> <p>  Professor Harvey referred to the shared island unit.  I find that hard to take from an academic because some of the presentation sounds like it is only a matter of having the referendum and then we are away.  Let us not be that simplistic and let us remember how hard this was fought and won previously.  It is not as simple as having a referendum.  Much more dialogue needs to be held with unionist politicians.  Without them being on board, I do not see this happening.  My fear is that if there is a referendum tomorrow, it would not be won on either side of the Border.  There is much work to be done.  Reports like this and the language used in them make it much more difficult to achieve the objective that we are talking about.  I feel that we are putting the cart before the horse.  We have not had the necessary dialogue to bring unionists with us and create trust.  The idea of the shared island unit is to create that trust and start working with them.<\/p> <p>  We were at the beginning of a process and the Northern Ireland protocol came along.  As we know from meetings last week, relationships are at a delicate stage.  This is a delicate process.  I do not agree at all that it is comparable to Germany.  Those are my views.  I am interested in hearing other people's views.  I would love if it was that simple but it is not.  The majority of us, in our hearts and souls, know that.  We are here having a discussion and there are no unionists at our meeting.  There is much to do before we get to the stages that the witnesses are talking about.<\/p> <p>  The US is paramount in all this.  It was the key element in the Good Friday Agreement.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile mentioned that Richard Neal was presenting to us in the Seanad Chamber.  I mentioned to him that day that it is my opinion that, with the involvement of the US Congress, a similar agreement to the Good Friday Agreement will be needed to get to a shared future.  The more that we talk up a united Ireland, the less chance that we have of getting unionists to the table.  I do not like to think of what the future will hold in that scenario.  Peace has been hard-won on this island and I would not want to take steps back before we go forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#D00300","speaker":"1633"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute.  The Good Friday Agreement represents a dramatic change in my life as a person from a Border constituency.  I never thought I would see it or to be able to speak to the committee about a united Ireland.  This conversation needs to be had in a sensitive manner.  We are on the hill of change.  We can all stay on that hill together and battle against the winds and the elements, or we can fall down like Humpty Dumpty and go back 30 years to where we were.  We do not want to go back.  Too many lives have been lost and destroyed.<\/p><p>Too much trust has been broken again and again to go back to those things.  The report is very interesting but the discussion about it being very like East and West Germany being put back together again is a bit too simplistic.  To me we are one island.  We have been one island since we left the Continent, probably 1 million years ago, but we are two jurisdictions.  I would love to be able to say we would have a border poll in the morning but what would be the price of a border poll in the next two years?  Is it that we will have a united Ireland but we will have left a whole pile of our population behind?  We did that in the 1920s and we do not want to repeat it.  We had a civil war over leaving people behind in the 1920s and we do not want to do it again.  We have to learn from our past and from our mistakes.<\/p><p> An awful lot of jurisdictional change would need to be done.  We are speaking here about the work the Oireachtas has to do, but what about the work the British Government or Northern Executive might have to do?  Where do we converge?  Back in the day as a student, I did a thesis on how north Louth, south Armagh and south Down could come together.  It was a very aspirational thesis on economic integration.  We can only go so far unless someone starts converging, even on the likes of bin charges, electricity or rates.  In five years' time, where will all of these come in?  A body of work needs to be done very much from the Executive side just as much as it needs to come from the Oireachtas.

It was one in a series of reports that looked at issues such as the possibility of special designated status for Northern Ireland.  Another report looked at what rights were available in EU law.  This is the reason the report took the shape that it did.  It was also intended to answer the question on what the status of a united Ireland would be in the European Union.  During the Scottish independence referendum, the status of an independent Scotland in the European Union was an argument used by the Barroso Commission and the UK Government against a \"Yes\" vote.  One of the purposes of this report was to give as clear an answer as possible that EU law recognises the right to self-determination.  A united Ireland would be a member state of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  An analogy is drawn with German unification in 1989 and 1990 for a number of reasons.  There are also very important distinctions.  The report tries to show how EU law approached that question.  Even back in 1957, when Germany joined the then European Economic Community, it included a declaration that German unification was a possibility.  As a matter of EU law, trade between East and West Germany was a matter of German domestic law.  We can see a parallel now with the common travel area and the provisions of the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol.  There was also a constitutional duty on the West German Government to work towards unity.  We see this echoed in our Constitution.  There was a clear constitutional path to unity in the German constitution.  This is replicated in the Good Friday Agreement.  It is a centrepiece of the Irish Constitution.  It is a centrepiece of the Northern Ireland Act, which is part of the UK constitutional framework.  It is recognised in international law in the British-Irish Agreement.  It is now part of the bridge between the UK and European Union.  It is in the withdrawal agreement.<\/p> <p>  There are other similarities in the citizenship provisions.  Residents in East Germany could avail of West German citizenship and did so.  There are some similarities with the availability of Irish citizenship for residents of Northern Ireland.  The other parallel was that West Germany was a member state of the European Union in 1989 and 1990.  Very early on, first the European Parliament and then the Commission took the view it was an exercise in self-determination and that a reunified Germany would be a good thing for Germany and for the European Union.  Many of the institutions used the phrase with regard to German unification that it occurred \"under a European roof\".  There was assistance from the Commission.  There was political support in the Parliament and the Council, which was chaired by Charles Haughey.  There was a clear endorsement of the position in international law that this was not the creation of a new state but a changing border in an existing member state.  We say this is similar to what would happen in the eventuality of Irish reunification.  There are important differences but they should not be insurmountable.  We state West Germany and East Germany were more different at that time than North and South are now.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the self-determination provision, the votes and referendums for a united Ireland are absolutely fundamental to the Good Friday Agreement.  This right of self-determination is not an ornament but an instrument.  The expectation is that it will be exercised at some time.  It is not rhetoric like the pursuit of happiness in the US declaration.  Preparatory work does have to be put in before the votes.  People voting in both jurisdictions are entitled to honest, credible and ambitious answers on issues such as healthcare, currency, employment and the administration of justice.  This preparatory work should be taking place now.  The Irish Government is particularly important in leading this type of work.  It is also true that the Oireachtas and the institutions in the North can assist.<\/p> <p>  With regard to some of the important work that could be undertaken, we imagine that in a united Ireland there would be an immediate continuation of Northern Ireland institutions and law subject to the Constitution.  The other matter would be that the Irish Constitution may have to be updated and possibly amended to take account of all of the obligations of the sovereign power which are set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  A piece of work that could be done in either institution would be an audit of what aspects of Northern Ireland law may have to change and an audit of Irish law, including what provisions of the Constitution, if any, would not be consistent with the duties of equality, parity of esteem and citizenship that would come with a united Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Bassett"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bassett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#F00100","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Before we move on, Chairman, I asked a question about engagement with unionist politicians.

First, in terms of the work that Mr. Bassett and I are doing, we recognise the complexity of the issues involved.  At no point have we ever suggested that any of this is easy; it is complex.  That is why we are calling for responsible planning and preparation and for that to involve civic society, but also to be government-led and resourced.  It is precisely because we know this is complicated that we need the advanced planning first.  I cannot reiterate that enough.  The homework needs to be done in advance.  Nobody is calling for a border poll next Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  People are calling for advance planning.<\/p> <p>  Second, when talking about the Good Friday Agreement we have to respect the right of unionists and loyalists in Northern Ireland to engage and participate in the conversation and, also, to engage and participate in the conversation about the maintenance of the union as well.  We need to respect both of those things.  There will be members of the unionist community here who are happy at a civic level to engage in either private or public conversations about the future of this island or these islands.  There will be people within the unionist-loyalist communities who would prefer to focus on the maintenance of the current union.  We have to respect that.  <\/p> <p>  We have to also acknowledge that the report we have produced is an independent, academic, legal report.  We have tried to frame the legal and policy space for inclusive conversations to emerge and develop.  One of the interesting things that we have noticed in the past while is the civic dialogue that is emerging and voices from within civic unionism that are increasingly participating in this debate.  For example, I was struck by an event organised last week by Ireland's Future where people from a unionist background were participating in a civic conversation about the future of this island.  It was marvellous to see that.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of going forward and Senator Blaney's point, there needs to be clarity from the Irish Government, this committee and the Oireachtas that unionists are welcome in the south of this island.  There is often a lot of talk about the North.  We started by emphasising the need for welcome and invitation, including to this committee.  That is work in progress.  We have to respect the different elements that I have outlined.<\/p> <p>  Senator Blaney also raised a question about the shared island unit.  I welcome the establishment of that unit, but I would like it to be more ambitious and to be properly resourced and facilitated to co-ordinate and do the type of work that we are talking about, with an emphasis as well on leadership and co-ordination.  Members will have noted, as we have, a proliferation of projects.  There is a lot of work being done now, but more work is needed.  At some point, there will need to be co-ordination of some of those projects to avoid duplication of effort in terms of some of the things we have talked about and are proposing.  I would like to see the shared island unit being more ambitious.  I would also like it to be properly resourced to take on a leadership role and a co-ordinating role in terms of some of the work that will be done.  <\/p> <p>  To reiterate the point I was trying to make, I do not see the united Ireland discussion and the shared island conversation as separate.  They are part of the conversation about how we are going to share this island in the future.  As we said at the start, all of this is about obligations and commitments that are already there which, as stated by Mr. Bassett, are not merely decorative and ornamental and at some point will be operationalised.  We would like everybody to get ready.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>We have approximately one hour remaining and I want to use the time fairly as best I can.

I thank our guests for their engagement with the committee today.  Unionist members and all MLAs and MPs from all parties are welcome to be on this committee.  We wish they would participate, but I can imagine it is difficult for them when the conversation, as it is today, is dominated by an inevitability of a unity referendum.  It was mentioned that no date has been set but the witnesses are already on record as suggesting 2023 as a possible year for such a referendum.  That is very close.  I do not believe we are anywhere near ready for that.  I note that today that date has been mitigated to within ten years.  These are presuppositions that I do not believe are there.  I do not agree that the comparison between Germany and Ireland is valid, historically, constitutionally or in terms of identity.  I reject that part of the report.  I do not think it is the same thing.  In Germany, there was not a large group of people on one side who have a distinctly different identity and a different constitutional preference.  There is not the same work on identity and humanity over other constitutionalities that would need to be done here as in the case of Germany.  I reiterate the point made by Senator Blaney in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I find the report lacking in its concern in regard to not just the identity and political concerns of unionists but the rights-based concerns, despite that it focuses a great deal on that issue.  In regard to the constitutional structures that may be appropriate or relevant, either at an Irish constitutional level or recognising those rights-based concerns from an ECHR perspective, while pages 66 to 69 acknowledge it, I believe the entire report needs to be infused with this idea rather than the inevitability of the constitutional structure changing.  There is a supposition in the report that we must think about unity now and that because lots of people are talking about it means everybody is engaged in it.  I do not believe that is so politically.  As Senator Blaney said, to do so may be significantly counterproductive to those who would want an Irish unity referendum soon.  What are the consequences of having that referendum in 2023 or 2028 and people not participating in it and the turnout being low?  I appreciate and fully understand the constitutional and legal rules that are there, but what are the political ramifications of this?  What is the legitimacy of any such referendum?  What are the consequences of having such a referendum in those circumstances and losing?  What are the legal, political and social consequences of those things?<\/p> <p>  We do not have sufficient engagement with unionists at the moment.  To be honest, I think it is a bit premature.

My worst nightmare is that we would have a border poll and we would lose.<\/p><p>My worst nightmare is that we would not have an inclusive island based on the visions of people like John Hume, Seamus Mallon and Austin Currie and that would alienate people.  I do not want to be in a situation where the shoe is on the other foot in terms of how our community would have felt in the 1960s and 1970s.  My worst nightmare would be a return to how things were in terms of losses of life and violence.<\/p><p> I do not believe people should apologise for being cautious about any of this.  One of my questions is about where Professor Harvey sees reconciliation in all of this.  I feel we have scratched the surface of the work that needs to be done regarding reconciliation.  Much of the time it is talked about but it does not feel like the biggest priority all the time, and to me it should be.  I would like to hear Professor Harvey's views about that.  I was interested in what he had to say about the terminology around the border poll and the language of the border poll.  I know he wrote this report in 2019.  I would like to hear how he feels about that now.<\/p><p> Professor Harvey has had a lot of engagement about the British Government and how a referendum would be triggered.  Perhaps he could give an overview of where he is with that.  There is a need here to separate out the electioneering around a united Ireland and then, at the same time, the preparatory questions and seeking of clarity on issues.  It is difficult to do that, however, without moving down the road of people starting to electioneer.  We already saw that in our previous general election.  There was no sense that a border poll would be in five, ten or 20 years; it was let us have a border poll now.  How does Professor Harvey make that distinction?<\/p><p> My message is that I do not believe it is wrong for people to be cautious whenever there is so much at stake.  Much work has gone into all of this.  I certainly feel that reconciliation must be at the core of everything we do.  The report was written in 2019.  I know Professor Harvey has engaged with many people.  How does he find the level of engagement from unionists in general, not just when talking about diversity and inclusiveness, but in actually having that engagement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#F00800","speaker":"1648","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I have three or four key questions, which I will get through quickly.  I remember when I was on Louth County Council in early 2017, approximately six to ten months after the Brexit referendum happened, that Sinn F&eacute;in had a motion calling for a border poll.  One of the points I made back then, which I still believe now, is that we are far better off having a border poll when we know we are going to win it rather than taking the risk of losing it narrowly or of there not being a huge turnout and the narrative of it being questioned.<\/p> <p>  What do Mr. Bassett or Professor Harvey need to see in Northern Irish or Irish society to know there is a very good chance of a border poll actually being successful?  What barometers are they are looking for to know there would be a credible chance?  I accept that many people are talking about and discussing it.  What key barometers are the witnesses looking out for to know whether a border poll would have a good chance of being successful?<\/p> <p>  One of the points mentioned in the report was about voting rights.  The witnesses said that we need a much more generous and inclusive franchise on both sides of the Border for this referendum when it comes along.  In Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett's views, what is a generous franchise?  South of the Border, for example, is that opening it up to non-Irish citizens who currently cannot vote in referendums?  Would it even mean opening it up to Irish citizens living abroad?  Perhaps the witnesses would expand on how wide they see that franchise of who could and could not vote in the referendum.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Bassett said that if a united Ireland was successful, we would have to have a continuation of the institutions on either side of the Border until we get an idea of what does and does not work.  How long would he envisage that happening?  What does he see in terms of an amalgamation of two parliaments on this island?  What does that look like?  When does that happen after a unity referendum has possibly passed?<\/p> <p>  I wish to back up what Senator Blaney and my colleagues, Senator Currie and Deputy Carroll MacNeill, said.  While I am not afraid to take on this debate and I do not mean to say that we are going too far ahead, because it is really important to have these conversations now and, as everyone agrees, to plan for this now, I would be fearful that we are leaving the unionist community in Northern Ireland behind where, with some of the dialogue and rhetoric they are seeing on this side of the Border, they are under the impression that a referendum might happen in the next year or two years.  What more are we doing to make sure those concerns are looked after and that we make this as least divisive as possible when the time comes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#G00500","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Put a unionist in the Seanad, John, would be a great start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#G00600","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Well you are voting for one, are you not?

We would both like to take some of those questions and make sure we both have a chance to respond, if that is okay.<\/p> <p>  The starting point is that this is the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Where we started in the report and in our opening statement is that this is central to that agreement.  I have been quite concerned both about the attempt to try to differentiate this out from the agreement but also the language that often follows it.  This is absolutely at the core of the constitutional provisions of the agreement.<\/p> <p>  In framing that as well, we have to mention the Brexit context.  Many committee members will know that this part of the island is now outside the European Union.  The provisions of the Good Friday Agreement offer people here across all communities an opportunity to return to the European Union.  It seems to me that it would be frankly bizarre if we were not having this conversation in the context of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  Brexit has also noticeably, tangibly and dramatically changed the nature of that conversation here.  Many of the arguments one would have traditionally heard around this are falling away and being replaced by new arguments and new people engaging in the conversation.  We must mention the Brexit context.<\/p> <p>  In terms of consequences and thinking about what happens before and after, what we have tried to do in our work is answer some - not all - of the questions, but to guide everything we do by urging this committee and others to do the preparatory and planning work in a responsible way so the referendums are managed in a way that addresses the concerns quite rightly raised by the committee and so that we also think in advance about the consequences and what happens next.  We do not want to be in the position that emerged around Brexit and we have tried to make that as clear as we possibly can.<\/p><p>We need to know, for example, what people will actually be voting for.  There is a lack of clarity around that and that must be addressed.  I do not see any contradiction between the concept of reconciliation and responsible planning for the referendums that are anticipated in the agreement.  In fact, the responsible approach to reconciliation on the island would be one that proactively has concrete and practical things to say about the referendums that are anticipated.  The irresponsible thing to do, and what would impede the process of reconciliation, is to pretend that these provisions of the agreement are not there.<\/p><p> One of the remarkable things about the provisions is the role of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in triggering the process.  Mr. Bassett and I have done quite a lot of work around that.  It motivated me to write a letter to the Secretary of State about his role and I am waiting for a slightly more detailed response to that.  It is something that we need to hear more about.  It is remarkable that fundamental constitutional change on the island of Ireland could potentially be triggered by a Secretary of State in London on a basis on which we do not have sufficient information.  That motivated my letter and I know others have also been trying to get a response.  It would be helpful if this committee could follow up on this matter after the meeting to see if it is able to get more help in answering those questions.  The committee might have more luck on this than I have had.  <\/p><p> On voting rights, on which Mr. Bassett will wish to speak, we have in our work suggested inclusive franchise.  We looked at what happened and is happening beyond the 2014 referendum in Scotland, such as the emergence of voting rights for those 16 years and over.  That is clearly an emerging trend and something we have suggested and recommended.  There is also a principled reason for that, particularly for the younger generation which will have to live with the consequences of all this.  It is important that they have a say in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions.  It is very helpful to get informed criticism and feedback on this report.  It was written in October 2019 and it should really be a starting place for looking at these issues.  As Professor Harvey said, one of the possible triggers for unity referendums would be the consideration of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that there is a pro-unity majority in the jurisdiction.  Last year, an important decision was made by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal on the circumstances in which the discretion to call that vote exists and also the circumstances in which the duty to call that vote would arise.  The court was very definite that the Secretary of State must approach that question on the basis of relevant evidence, in an honest manner and consistent with the duty of the UK Government to act with rigorous impartiality.  It is not to be approached in the way that we might see the current UK Government approach the Scottish referendum, which is one that could be characterised as \"This is a problem; how will it be defeated?\".  The UK Government's obligation is to give effect to the wishes of the Irish people.  A relevant consideration for that is that Irish unity is a route back to membership of the European Union.  That is something that the Secretary of State should be considering.  The European Union is good for Northern Ireland and support for it remains high.  There is little chance of UK reaccession under Article 49.  The more plausible route at this stage appears to be Irish reunification and that is something the Secretary of State must take into consideration.  If a decision to hold a referendum was reached by the Secretary of State, to be consistent with the Good Friday Agreement it would have to be matched by a concurrent vote or referendum in the Republic of Ireland.  It would be better if the Irish Government and State were ready for that.<\/p> <p>  On voting rights, the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Act provide a choice to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on who will make up the franchise.  There are two obvious choices.  The first is the Westminster voting lists, which are Irish, British, and qualifying Commonwealth citizens.  The other, the more generous one which we hope would be used, is the assembly and European Parliament lists, which include EU citizens.  In the Republic, if the vote on unity is to take the form of a constitutional amendment, that is, a change to the text of the Constitution, that is currently a restrictive list, one that is limited to Irish citizens resident in the State and registered as referendum electors.  There is the possibility of a distinction between the franchises in both jurisdictions which is unfortunate.  It is particularly unfortunate that British citizens resident in the Republic of Ireland could be excluded from that vote in the South.  That is where we are at the moment so these are the issues that should be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Reconciliation and unionist engagement with this issue are very important but they are not absolute prerequisites in the Good Friday Agreement to the triggering of these referendums.  The only legitimate basis for the partition of Ireland at this time is an assumption that the majority of people in the North support that constitutional option.  That is the centrepiece of the Good Friday Agreement.  If someone supports consent, we would say that person should also support the right for that consent to be tested - that is the right of self-determination, to use the language of the agreement, without external impediment.  If there is a majority in both jurisdictions for unity, the obligation of the Governments is to work towards that.  <\/p> <p>  I agree that there are very big differences between Irish reunification and German reunification.  What the report tried to do was to set out the similarities in the legal and constitutional frameworks.  It is correct that they would be seen, in terms of EU law at least, as comparable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Bassett"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Harvey and Mr. Barrett for their responses.

I have some technical questions arising from their submission and then I may ask a question arising from the Ireland's Future document.  Professor Harvey has put a lot of effort into trying to get a comprehensive answer from the Secretary of State on what he thinks might trigger a vote.<\/p><p>It will not surprise him to learn that I do not believe we are that point either.  The words that always come to mind are those of John Hume on Magilligan Strand when he said, \"You may govern us, but you do not have our consent\".  In the century of partition, as we think about the impact that had on Northern nationalists, that is why the issue is at the front of many people's minds.  I acknowledge that things are moving very quickly and that the context has been changed, and I agree with Professor Harvey that it is prudent to explore the issues.  I wish to follow up on Senator McGahon's question about what he thinks are the signals the Secretary of State should be considering.  I appreciate that there are both legal and political interpretations of that.<\/p><p> The second question is about external impediment.  Professor Harvey referred to one argument that was made, and it was one made by my colleague, the former Member of Parliament, Mark Durkan, about EU membership not requiring Article 49.  He had framed the issue of EU membership as a potential external impediment.  How broadly does Professor Harvey think external impediment should be defined, and does he have views resulting from that about the participation of the UK Government and what form that might take?  In addition, what are his thoughts about the benefits of trying to transition this conversation away from a win-lose, \"Yes\"-\"No\" border poll and making it a conversation about two positive campaigns for two equally legitimate aspirations, as the Good Friday Agreement defines the constitutional aspirations in Northern Ireland?  How do we make it a conversation defined by the principles and precepts of the Good Friday Agreement and not the type of binary win-lose conversation that we know is making some people anxious, rightly or wrongly?<\/p><p> I have another quick question.  The impact of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement is obvious, and Professor Harvey knows that the Supreme Court took a very narrow view of what came under the principle of consent in the Miller case.  His Queen's University colleague, Professor Chris Cotton, criticised that judgment for taking a blunt view, and I agree.  Are there other aspects of the agreement that have a mainstream understanding or interpretation, but which Professor Harvey believes might be vulnerable to a different legal interpretation if somebody were to challenge it?  I appreciate that might be a somewhat specific question.<\/p><p> My last question is for Professor Harvey wearing his Ireland's Future hat.  What does he envisage and advocate as regards the relationship between Britain and a theoretical new Ireland?  How does he propose to enhance what is currently strand 3 and the east-west relationship?  What does he see as the continuing role, or not, of the UK Government in the early years of a new Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hanna","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I will try to work my way through all the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I thought I would get my money's worth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hanna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  One of the first questions was about the role of the Secretary of State.  It is important to point out two matters.  One is that the Secretary of State has a discretion to do this at any time.  That is sometimes neglected.  The other element of it, which Ms Hanna refers to as the duty on the Secretary of State, is when there is a duty to trigger this.  The McCord judgment gives the Secretary of State a considerable amount of flexibility.  There are other things in that judgment as well.  In other words, the Secretary of State is not legally compelled to spell out a policy in an answer to one of my letters or in answer to a question.  However, just because one is not legally compelled to do something does not mean it is not a good idea to provide further clarification as a matter of political judgment.  There is nothing in the McCord judgment that would rule out the Secretary of State providing more clarity about the evidence that is taken into account and how that system currently works in the Northern Ireland Office - how often that assessment is reviewed, what types of evidence are weighed in the balance and how often Brandon Lewis refreshes his knowledge of that evidential base.<\/p> <p>  As regards the evidential base, it is everything that people have already spoken about in terms of credible and reliable polling.  There is also electoral evidence.  In the context of post Brexit and the strong Remain constituency here, there is scope for a legitimate range of views on where we currently are in respect of that question appearing likely.  Ultimately, the reliable credible evidence that is available would trigger that duty, but let me just turn that around slightly.  First, we need to be ready in this conversation.  What we do not want is the Secretary of State triggering this in the next couple of weeks.  It is much better to focus the conversation on being prepared on this island first.  I wish to make a suggestion.  I believe that when we are ready on this island and when, for example, the Irish Government steps into this debate and signals it is ready, I believe, and I may be wrong, that the Secretary of State in London will not stand in the way of this process going forward.  That is probably where we need to anchor the debate at present.  Yes, we will eventually get more clarity from the Secretary of State about the type of evidence he is using, but ultimately I would prefer to prioritise getting ready on this island.  My feeling is that when we are ready on this island the British Government will trigger this process, although I might be wrong.<\/p> <p>  Regarding external impediment, spelling out in a supportive and helpful way the consequences of both the process and outcome is not an impediment to the right to self-determination for people of this island.  There is nothing in that which would prevent the European Union or the US from being very clear about the type of support that would be available to a reunified Ireland within the European Union, primarily for some of the reasons that Mr. Bassett stated.  Member states and institutions of the European Union are affected by this decision.  This would be a constitutional change happening in an EU member state.  The EU has an interest in the outcome.  In fact, we recommend in our report that the Commission and the European Parliament should already be engaged in that type of preparatory work, to think about the consequences.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the debate, everything we have done in our work is to try to suggest that we make this conversation as boring, technical and undramatic as is humanly possible.  That might sound bizarre, but Ms Hanna will notice that we have not used the term \"border poll\" today, for example.  We have tried to focus on the fact that we are talking about concurrent referenda on the island of Ireland in which we hope the sides in this debate will focus on what the agreement is ultimately about, which is persuasion about different constitutional options.  I would prefer people to concentrate at present on building a credible and persuasive case to persuade people here and all people on the island about what the future might look like.  I emphasise that the agreement provisions on this are about persuasion and convincing people of the merits of respective cases.  At present, however, not enough work has been done.  If people were to turn up on doorsteps, when we are ever allowed to turn up on doorsteps again, what would people be saying on either side of the argument now?  Does anybody have the type of document the Scottish Government had when it approached the 2014 independence referendum?  I would prefer if the focus was there.<\/p> <p>  There are two final matters, and one is the technical point in the Miller judgment.<\/p><p>I have been surprised at the way consent has been used inaccurately in some of the conversations concerning the Brexit discussions.  The principle of consent, as used in the Good Friday Agreement for these purposes, is ultimately a debate about constitutional change and Irish reunification.  It is in that context that we are talking about consent here.  <\/p><p> The question about legal proceedings and courts has been raised.  I do not need to tell anyone here about what can happen once things enter a courtroom.  Mr. Bassett could perhaps comment more on this aspect as he is a barrister, but while we may feel we have a convincing and persuasive argument as to what the provisions of the agreement mean, there can be unintended consequences of litigation.  A judge or a set of judges may take a different view.  I think it is as clear as it can be, however, that the headline principle of consent refers to the debate we are having this morning on reunification.<\/p><p> I will give another example in respect of litigation.  Regarding the McCourt case, in writing to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and in taking the case itself, one outcome of that would be a judge, the Judiciary or the Secretary of State setting the bar at a very high level.  Sometimes we get the answer we might not want from some of these interventions, and that is as true of politicians as it is of members of the Judiciary in respect of litigation concerning the Good Friday Agreement.  Some parts of the agreement are not written in a way that is similar to an Act of the Parliament at Westminster but are instead open to elements of constructive ambiguity or perhaps destructive ambiguity which might be the better way of putting it.<\/p><p> Although much of the focus of our report and the discussion today has been about how we share this island, we are going to be sharing these islands in future.  The agreement will frame the conversation we have before and after these referendums.  At the centre of our work is the need for strong, robust and good institutional relationships around these islands.  It is a good point whether we might be able to do more in the context of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council or to add to their institutional architecture to ensure the relationships around these islands are good and prosper in future.<\/p><p> Part of the argument for constitutional change that people often forget or sometimes neglect is that those involved in advocating for constitutional change think relationships will be better at the far end of all this and that the system and the relationships we have now are not working.  Many of those advocating change and constitutional change feel committed to working for that change because they feel we can do better across these islands.  Holding Scotland in a constitutional arrangement which it does to want to be a part of, for example, does not seem to be the wisest thing to do from the perspective of good strong relationships across these islands in the longer term.  I am thankful for the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>It might be helpful at the outset if I recap the Alliance Party position on these discussions.  As people will appreciate, the party is not defined around the constitutional question.  We have some elected representatives, members and supporters who take a pro-union perspective and some who already take a pro-united Ireland perspective, while most of our people would probably have an open mind regarding the future and be prepared to listen to debates on this topic.  Having said that, we are conscious that many debates are happening, not just on the future of the island of Ireland but also regarding the future of the UK.  We are willing to take part in any rational constructive discussion on a without prejudice basis.  In that regard, I am pleased to take part in this session and in similar exercises.  I also stress that the Alliance Party recognises the mechanisms contained within the Good Friday Agreement for decision-making, including the thresholds that have been accepted, albeit they can be fleshed out in much greater detail, as Professor Harvey and others advocate.<br\/><br\/>I will make a few other points before I address the specific question.  It is important to stress that the emphasis now must be on dialogue and issues regarding precisely what the questions would be in any referendums, if they were ever to occur.  That matter is still to crystallise.  It is the same with issues regarding the trigger points for any referendums being called.  They also need to crystallise, if at a later point.  The emphasis must be on discussions and conversations happening to see where consensus can be built.  There must also be a teasing out of several of the practical issues which we must address and to challenge ourselves concerning many aspects of those issues.<br\/><br\/>If we were ever to see a referendum called, it would also be crucially important that it would be one that would have a prospect of success.  A situation where Northern Ireland were to end up in a succession of referendums on this issue would be incredibly difficult for our politics.  We therefore see a referendum being very much the end point of a process.  There is no guarantee that a referendum would be called, but at the same time, if it were to be called, it would have to be a process which would move and proceed with some degree of smoothness while recognising the great differences of opinion in Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the example of German reunification, I wish to stress that happened very swiftly following the fall of the Berlin Wall, in less than 12 months.  The process of reunification in that context was eased, however, by what was then the West German government taking a major decision to bear considerable financial and economic costs, which may not be an option on this island at this stage.  Obviously, the differentials that existed between West and East Germany are nothing close to the differences between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland today.  However, there was almost unanimous support across both parts of Germany for reunification, which will obviously not be the situation in the context of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>My question for Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett in the context of having recognised the principle of consent and that being a binary choice is whether they nonetheless also recognise, at least academically and theoretically, that there are other models we can talk about.  I refer to being able to talk about different models within what would essentially be a single Irish state.  However, are there other models, even <i>sui generis<\/i>types of considerations, of some form of shared sovereignty that could be explored as alternatives?  What would be the views of Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett on that aspect, especially if those concepts were potentially likely to generate a much greater sense of consensus?<br\/><br\/>In the same vein, to what extent is it useful, without prejudice to any wider political or constitutional change, that we in the short run fully exploit what are still untapped opportunities for practical economic, social and environmental co-operation on the island?  I am struck that we have had the North-South structures of the Good Friday Agreement for more than 20 years now.  Whenever I sat on the North-South Ministerial Council, it struck me that it was a perfunctory-type process and it was not really being used to its full advantage.  On a practical level, therefore, by building on the shared island unit, among other initiatives, to what extent is there scope to focus in the short term on building up those aspects of practical co-operation of which I spoke?  That could be an end in itself or it could ease some of the wider political and constitutional questions that people want to pursue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>The Good Friday Agreement recognises two possibilities, namely, that Northern Ireland is going to be part of a reunified Ireland or it is going to continue to be a constituent and integral part of the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>If there is to be another proposal involving re-partition or joint authority, that would require agreement between the Governments and the support of the political parties.<\/p><p> On identifying the questions that need to be posed in both jurisdictions, in the North we imagine that the question would have to give effect to the promise of reunification in the Good Friday Agreement.

In the Republic we would expect the question to be ultimately identified in the Attorney General's office, approved by the Cabinet and then the Oireachtas.  Hopefully, it could be contained in one question in much the same way that the provision of the Irish Constitution giving a higher status to EU law was achieved.  That would prevent incompatible or conflicting provisions of the Constitution.<\/p><p> It should be remembered that the Assembly elections in Northern Ireland which are on the horizon are possibly shaping up as a referendum on the withdrawal agreement and, in particular, the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol.  There is the possibility of exiting from some of the provisions which have prevented a hard border so Northern Ireland's membership of aspects of the internal market and the free movement of goods is not set in stone.  It is to be renewed.  In that context, where there is an express recognition of the democratic consent for the continuation of those provisions, the more obvious question is whether Northern Ireland would like to return to the European Union as part of a united Ireland.  That is also relevant to the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Bassett","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I will follow up briefly with some responses.  First, what we have tried to do in much of our work is to outline the existing framework in terms of the agreement and existing law and policy and to frame our responses in relation to that.  It is notable that Ireland's Future has placed an all-in citizens' assembly at the heart of its proposals.  Too much of this debate is based on assumptions about what people want, including about what people might want to continue into the future.  Those assumptions need to be tested by the groundbreaking idea of asking people and having engagement with citizens about what they want for the future.  The question is likely to be closely aligned, as in much of this, to the Good Friday Agreement language but the role of a citizens' assembly, as has been done in the past, in clarifying preferences around different options would be remarkably helpful at this time.  A citizens' assembly is a vehicle whereby experts would come and give presentations, in which a range of options would be laid out and we would all have a clearer idea of what people on this island want to see in the future.  Some of the assumptions we are making in this conversation need to be tested by speaking to people on the island.  I think that is a significant proposal.<\/p> <p>  The final point Dr. Farry made is a great one.  Let me be clear: we do not co-operate practically enough on this island at present.  The shared island unit and others have a massive role in ensuring that practical co-operation on this island is stepped up.  Institutions on this island at the moment do not engage or talk to each other anywhere near as much as they need to.  The sort of support that is promised in the programme for Government in the South, New Decade, New Approach, needs to be realised to build basic infrastructure and create well-being projects for everyone across the island.  We are talking about the future but the shared island concept is hardwired into the here and now as well as the future and we could do much better here and now in improving practical co-operation in anticipation of where we might be going next.  The Irish Government has a significant responsibility to be much more forthcoming in relation to this debate.  It needs to, in some senses, catch up with civic society and the leadership that is being shown across civic society on this island and join the conversation in a practical way.  I thank Dr. Farry for the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I want to identify which parties have not spoken.

I will echo a couple of things.  Senator Currie said we have only scratched the surface in relation to reconciliation and I feel that is true in respect of almost everything we have been discussing around this topic.  I would be interested in hearing more - perhaps with the Ireland's Future hat on, as was said - in relation to the conversation with unionists and loyalists about the future that they see.  When we tried to have a joint meeting recently with the Assembly, some unionist voices refused to join the committee simply because we were there.  That is not a very helpful approach - let us put it nicely that way.  It is not a helpful approach to these fundamental issues.  What is being done?  What can be done?<\/p><p>I share the speaker's call for the shared island unit to be more ambitious and to have and lead these conversations and the outreach to a community that does not want to engage with these conversations one way or another.  That is really important.<\/p><p> We must acknowledge that the Irish Government and State needs to do more.  Are we living up to our commitment to support the shared institutions?  Many members here have spoken about the North-South Ministerial Council being simply perfunctory and not meaningful.  Has the Irish State lived up to its commitments regarding reconciliation under the Stormont House Agreement?  It has not done so at all.  What does that say about the Irish State's view of the shared island and both communities?<\/p><p> There has been much talk about a complete return to violence but we must give some credit and realise that we are a different island from what we were in 1968 and 1969.  Part of this comes from the rights-based perspective and international human rights instruments that we must put front and centre as part of any conversation.  Surely these will provide a shared language of how to best make decisions.<\/p><p> I am also conscious that this is an incredibly complex matter and reducing it to a binary choice of \"Yes\" or \"No\" is not only difficult but potentially dangerous.  All we have to do is look at the campaign and rhetoric around Brexit to see how taking a complex matter and distilling it into \"Yes\" or \"No\" can cause problems.  This suggests the importance of the conversations beforehand and building a clear picture of what that \"Yes\" or \"No\" would be about.  There is also the possibility of exploring multiple choice voting or other novel ideas.  If the witnesses have an opinion on that, I would love to hear it.<\/p><p> Ultimately, there will be much more uncertainty.  There are matters that do not give a damn about a line on a map that will affect everybody and I keep talking about climate change in that regard.  It is just one challenge we are facing, no matter what community or side of the line we are from.  We must also be really cognisant that the union that many are loyal to is starting to crack.  A border poll held next week versus one held the other side of a Scottish independence referendum that succeeds would be a very different prospect.  I do not know to what extent a Welsh independence referendum is on the agenda but there is growing talk about it one way or another.  There is much uncertainty and if we are not trying to at least have those conversations, we will really struggle in the face of that complexity and uncertainty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021021600002#L00900","speaker":"1570","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I have tried to be fair to everybody and I gave every party free rein in the questions.

That is very much guided by the Good Friday Agreement, the protection of human rights and equality and the fostering of mutual respect between all views and traditions that share this island.<\/p> <p>  We know Brexit has dramatically changed the social and political dynamic on this island and that is what we must talk about.  We have heard quite recently Mr. Bertie Ahern saying there will be a border poll within the next five to ten years.  We must prepare for that and bring in people from all backgrounds.  Ireland's Future is an organisation that is being driven by civic society and it held a wonderful webinar called \"A New Ireland: A Warm House for All\".  The panel comprised unionist voices and we heard that unionists want to have this conversation in civic society and are open to it.

Specifically relevant to the Bill, the Housing Agency has established an affordable housing unit to assist and support the Department with the implementation of the affordable purchase and cost rental measures outlined.<\/p> <p>  In the Bill there are two major measures.  One is the range of affordable home purchase measures and, second, there are the measures for cost rental homes.  I will take the affordable home purchase measures first.  It is very important for us all to understand that the key elements of supporting home ownership, as set out, are the shared equity arrangements.  That is fundamental.  This supports households to purchase a home in a fair and equitable way.  It is an effective way of the State investing in affordable home purchase and that equity investment, when it is repaid, can be used to provide support to future households purchasing an affordable home.  It is, essentially, a sustainable measure that will support both current and future generations, which is a very important principle.  The measures, as we have seen in the Affordable Housing Bill, that amends the 2009 Act, is the local authority shared equity scheme, and delivery under this scheme can be by local authorities, approved housing bodies, the Land Development Agency and others.  There is also provision for a national affordable purchase shared equity scheme using the open market.<\/p> <p>  In terms of cost rental homes, a key element of achieving affordable housing in many countries is the delivery of a cost rental sector.  Over time that sector builds up so it can provide housing that is affordable for a wide range of households.  Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands are some of the countries that have built up very effective cost rental sectors.<\/p> <p>  Cost rental aims to help households with moderate incomes access affordable and secure rental homes.  It is a model of delivery where the provider supplies accommodation and charges rent that is sufficient to cover construction and financing costs of the housing, and the ongoing management and maintenance costs.  So the costs are based on the cost of provision.  That aspect is very important and over time it becomes even more affordable.<\/p> <p>  Currently, the Housing Agency is assisting the Department with the introduction of a new cost rental equity loan scheme delivered by approved housing bodies.  Initially, there are 390 homes to be delivered.  This is in addition to 50 cost rental homes that are to be delivered in the next number of months in Stepaside on the Enniskerry Road in Dublin.  This is along with 105 social rental homes.  It is a collaboration between D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Housing Agency, the Respond and Tuath Housing Associations, and the Housing Finance Agency.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, the overall aim has to be to make housing affordable for everyone of all incomes.  We are pleased to support the committee and elaborate on any points raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#B00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor and invite Dr. O'Toole to make his opening statement for the ESRI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#B01000","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee.  I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Rachel Slaymaker.  We are delighted to have the opportunity to have an input into considerations around the Bill.  To do so, we will report our recent research studies that may help the committee's discussions in terms of an evidence base for interventions to address housing affordability.<\/p> <p>  All of this information must be contextualised by the fast moving economic developments relating to the Covid-19 pandemic and its ability to impact both the demand and supply sides of the affordability equation.  Two years ago we presented research to the joint committee on which households faced housing affordability challenges in Ireland.  We found that affordability pressures were primary among low to middle income private renters, especially those in urban areas.  In an updated study, that was published in 2020, we separated the rental market into two groups, those in receipt of State housing supports such as housing assistance payment, HAP, or local authority tenants, and those private renters without supports.  The latter group accounted for approximately 47% of the rental market and was the main focus of our research.  We found that even though this group's gross income was higher than the rental sector overall they face significant affordability pressures.  Indeed, one in four of these households was paying more than 30% of their net income on rent while almost one in three, or nearly 70,000 households, did not have sufficient income remaining after housing costs to cover a minimum standard of living expenditure before the pandemic.  Given that these renters were more likely to be employed in those sectors most impacted by Covid-19, it is likely that the economic fallout from the pandemic will exacerbate existing affordability challenges.<\/p> <p>  So if renting is so expensive then why have not more renters become homeowners in recent years?  Since 2011, the share of homeowners in Ireland has dropped due to many co-determining factors such as tighter credit conditions on the part of banks and the new macro prudential rules, labour market developments, high house prices and a limited housing supply.  Of these, the supply channel is likely the most important.  The number of housing completions in recent years is well below he estimates of structural demand.  Estimates by the ESRI and other commentators put the structural housing demand levels at between 30,000 and 35,000 units per annum, which is well above the current level of housing supply.  The disruption of the pandemic will only widen this gap between supply and structural demand.<\/p> <p>  In evaluating the efficacy of policies that target the demand side, so the borrower purchasing power such as shared equity loans or other instruments, it is critical to understand the extent to which households face credit constraints.  In a recent research paper we find the existence of both equity constraints, which is an insufficient deposit, and income constraint, which is insufficient loan size to income, in the Irish market among those renting households who wish to purchase a property.  The bulk income and equity constraints are evident and suggest that separate policies covering loan availability and deposit supports can be of merit.<\/p> <p>  At present, there are already interventions in the market that aim to address equity constraints with the help-to-buy scheme and income constraints through the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  A shared equity loan instrument for lowering the required loan amount would also act to alleviate both income and deposit constraints.<\/p><p>Its benefit in theory would be to facilitate credit access for some constrained households.  However, the targeting of any credit market intervention is critical.  If the credit access supports are provided to those households which would have otherwise been able to finance the transaction, then the economic benefit is lessened.  For example, a review of the help-to-buy scheme data suggests that many households with large deposits have received support under the scheme.  It is likely these households were not constrained and would have been able to complete the transaction anyway.<\/p><p> Furthermore, and most important, this static approach does not take into consideration the fact that housing supply is so constrained in Ireland and that increasing purchasing power for households through a loosening of credit constraints will likely lead to higher house prices.  Such rises in house prices are likely to exacerbate affordability problems down the line.  These dynamics may or may not be observable in actual price data which will be affected by a multitude of other factors, coupled with scale of the intervention, but they are likely to occur.<\/p><p> Our research suggests there will be a considerable number of households in Ireland which will not be able to become homeowners and who will face high rental costs.  For these households, as well as those who do not wish to become homeowners, the introduction of non-market priced rental tenure in cost rental is very welcome.  Many countries have successfully incorporated longer term rental options into their markets which provide long-term, stable rents for tenants and this has been absent in Ireland on a broad scale.  In the context of the current Bill, the definition of cost rental would appear to be set to cover middle income households, a group our research certainly shows face considerable affordability pressures.  Indeed, as a supply-side intervention which will lead to the introduction of new units to rent, it cannot come quickly enough.  The success of this intervention over the medium term should be gauged by three metrics, namely, the number of units, the pricing and the eligibility criteria.  To have a meaningful impact on overall housing supply, the number of units provided would need to expand rapidly over the coming years.  On the price side, the initial level may reflect construction costs and ensuring that developments can be provided as efficiently as possible to minimise the subsequent rent levels is important.  Regarding ongoing price inflation, maintenance costs for property upkeep can often exceed the broad consumer price inflation.  How these costs are passed through to tenants is important to ensure continued investment in upkeep, maintenance and quality, but also to ensure affordability.<\/p><p> Affordability challenges in the housing market are a critical and long-standing issue for Ireland.  Addressing these challenges is difficult as increasing housing supply is problematic in the short run.  Considerable care must be given to interventions on the demand side given the supply concerns.  Credit market supports such as the shared equity scheme and other interventions may lower credit constraints by facilitating home purchase for buyers who otherwise would have been unable to enter the market.  However, on balance, with the current supply shortages it is likely these benefits will be outweighed by inflationary pressures.  The most successful interventions over the medium to longer term will be those that operate through the supply side not the demand side of the market.  Cost rental schemes are a very welcome addition to the market and their expansion over time will help to build a broader rental sector.  We thank the committee for its time and look forward to answering any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#B01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Toole and invite Dr. O'Connell to make the opening statement for NESC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#C00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to speak on the National Economic and Social Council's work on affordable housing.

The first part of my statement will focus on NESC's role in housing.<\/p> <p>  NESC has produced eight reports on housing since 2004.  Aspects of housing affordability have featured in every one of those reports.  In our most recent report, Housing Policy: Actions to Deliver Change, NESC restated its consistent and long-standing position on housing and land-use policy, namely, that Ireland must bring about a fundamental change in its system of urban development, land management and housing provision.  It must evolve from a speculative and highly cyclical system to a permanently affordable, stable and more sustainable system of housing.  Pursuing that objective, our most recent report focused on two related issues, the supply gap and the affordability gap.  The report detailed the steps NESC considered necessary to bridge the two gaps by way of institutional adjustments, more effective use of existing policy and innovation to enhance the policy options available to the State.<\/p> <p>  With the Chairman's permission, I will ask Mr. Noel Cahill, who has worked on this area, to walk the committee through the three different aspects of that report and attempt to focus on the emphasis on cost rental in NESC's work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Larry O'Connell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>That recent NESC report on housing outlined the institutional changes which would ensure that key public actors have a strong developmental mandate and the capacity to drive sustainable urban development, including the provision of affordable housing.  These actions include establishing the Land Development Agency, LDA, on a statutory footing as a matter of urgency.  The second part of the report called for more effective application of existing measures to ensure more affordable housing happens in the near term.  These actions include, first, the establishment of a national cost rental programme at scale, with access to land on favourable terms, low cost finance, and conditions to ensure that homes remain subject to public ownership and that the rents are affordable; second, the tailoring of the application of Part V to make it more effective by increasing the proportion which must be affordable, but tailored on a county-by-county basis; third, the introduction, across the various funding streams, such as the serviced sites fund, of separate funding streams focused on developments which are high impact in terms of the number of affordable houses provided and the achievement of compact development; fourth, the examination of differences between the compulsory purchase regimes under different legislation and their respective usage, with a view to identifying the most effective and efficient regime; and, finally, the outlining of a programme of flagship projects to demonstrate how a system-wide approach can deliver tangible results.<\/p> <p>  In the third part of the report, the council recommended that time be devoted to finding new solutions or ways of working around long-standing challenges.  These areas include tackling the off-balance sheet issue for cost rental, examining how the State could acquire land in designated development areas at existing use value plus some premium, review and reform of the vacant site levy if it persists in being ineffective and considering further actions to reduce vacancy and the under use of existing property.  On affordability, the council has argued the goal should be permanent affordability.  The leasing of public land is a mechanism that can be used to reduce costs and improve affordability in the short term while preserving the value of the subsidy for future buyers and improving long-run stability in the housing market.  With this approach, the land could be provided without an upfront charge while the public landowner would retain long-term ownership of the land.  Others, including owner occupiers, could then own dwellings on the land.<\/p> <p>  Of particular relevance to our discussion today is the recommendation by the council to develop a national cost rental programme at scale.  The council first highlighted the need for Irish policy to consider cost rental in a 2004 report.  The different elements needed include land, low cost finance, a regulatory structure and organisations.  The new cost rental equity loan, in conjunction with long-term low interest loans from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, is a way of achieving reasonably low cost finance for cost rental.  The proposed legislation will be a basis for regulating a cost rental sector.  It is our understanding that the loan is initially being used for acquisitions of properties.  Over time, if we are to substantially add to the housing stock in a way that is not dependent on the development cycle, it would be desirable to create new cost rental developments on public land.  If cost rental, affordable purchase and social housing developments can be combined on large sites, this would facilitate having larger developments than would otherwise be possible.<\/p> <p>  The focus of the actions proposed by NESC on housing is on bridging the supply gap by actively managing land for the public good and bridging the affordability gap by engineering in permanent affordability.<\/p> <p>  We are happy to assist the committee in its discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cahill"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Connell and Mr. Cahill.<\/p><p>I ask that speakers would identify themselves clearly as this will help the Debates Office to record the meeting, and I ask members to confirm that they are within the confines of Leinster House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#C00500","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

It is particularly fitting that we are here now putting a legislative base on a cost rental model.<\/p> <p>  I believe there is broad agreement among the three submissions and among the committee that the cost rental model is really important.  I believe, however, that when we all agree, that is often when we need to be more critical.

I imagine that this is one of the principal areas where supply will be increased.  It is also one of the principal focuses of the Bill.

On the type of work we have done historically, a number of our papers have looked at credit access for households and at the degree to which households are credit constrained.  These would be households that are or are not able to make transactions based on the level of leverage.  If a household is credit constrained, it is not able to make that transaction without having more leverage.  The balance of our submission was to attempt to provide some understanding from our existing research on the various economic channels that may occur with the development of a scheme, in the context of the broader range of schemes available in the market.  Where schemes are supply side in nature, they would not necessarily provide additional borrower purchasing power, which I believe is a key issue from our research.  We are very clear that the supply-side constraints in Ireland are the most binding constraints and the most difficult to deal with because it takes a long time for any supply measures to come on line.  Certainly, the development of any schemes that would facilitate additional supply would be very welcome from our side.  This is just to give a little insight into that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I welcome that.  I believe that the local authority-led shared equity scheme is a huge positive.  It sometimes gets lost because of the shared equity loan.  It would also be the cornerstone to building public housing on public land, which is a significant departure for the new Government.  It is a really important measure.  There has been some focus on the shared equity scheme, but would Dr. O'Toole accept the Department's argument that regional caps, to limit it to new builds, and it being a short-term measure for one year or two to stimulate the reluctance of the current market could actually act to stimulate it?  If it was kept with all of those limits of regional caps, new builds and short-term, could it have a positive impact on the market?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#D00600","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>When one is trying to consider any credit market interventions, a number of aspects are especially important.  It is even more complicated when doing credit market interventions in the housing market because a multitude of factors affect house prices, including the labour market channels, credit access, and supply constraints.  There are a range of factors that impact the degree to which any particular credit-based measure would pass through to price pressures or to borrower purchasing power.  In a sense, the tailoring and calibration of these schemes is very important.  Naturally, any inflationary pressures can be reduced if the schemes are tailored to have the minimum need.  For example, this would be ensuring that the calibration of the scheme goes to those borrowers who are most in need, such as to the household that is credit constrained and needs that extra credit to be able to make that transaction happen.  In the alternative counterfactual scenario that transaction would not happen.  The effective use of calibration parameters can be used to mitigate those channels.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, the scale of the intervention is critically important, as we said in the opening statement.  For example, how much of the intervention happens in what timeframe is very important.  The shorter the timeframe and the larger the intervention that is necessary, and when one considers the economic channels behind that, it would add more demand side pressure in a shorter space of time.  The longer the timeframe and the degree to which the intervention is spread out over time would limit the inflationary pressures.  When we consider these types of instruments we do so in a manner that takes all of the factors that would affect the housing market, which are multitude and co-determining.  If we hold all of these other factors constant on an all-new change to credit market access, that is naturally where we talk about the channels that would be happening in the market with regard to demand and supply side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I confirm to the Chairman that I am in Leinster House.  Due to the limited time I will go straight into questions.  I have three questions, one for each of our guests.<\/p> <p>  With respect to Dr. O'Toole's concerns that the shared equity loan for private purchases would push up house prices, I presume it is his view that the bigger that fund the greater the risk of inflation.  We know, for example, that the Government is currently in negotiations with the banks to increase the fund from &euro;75 million to &euro;150 million, with &euro;75 million of banking funding.  Is there a concern that the more funds that are available the greater the risk of house price inflation?  On Dr. O'Toole's concerns around targeting, I presume that, given the Government is talking about combining the shared equity loan with help-to-buy, there are no income limits on access and the upper limit for house price purchases in Dublin is about &euro;400,000, this would further exacerbate his concerns that there is an inadequate level of targeting.<\/p> <p>  I have a specific question for Mr. O'Connor on the shared equity loan and the interest that will be charged.  The Government has said, obviously, that it wants an entry-level interest rate from year six at 1.5% and then increasing.  We hear from some media reports that the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland would like a higher entry-level interest rate.  Is there a level of risk to the buyer that if the interest rate calculation is too onerous, the buyer could end up with a far greater level of debt, as was the case with the last shared ownership scheme?  The Housing Agency did for a report on this for then Minister of State, Jan O'Sullivan.  Will Mr. O'Connor elaborate on that potential risk to the buyer from the interest rate?<\/p> <p>  My last question is for Dr. Larry O&rsquo;Connell.  Deputy McAuliffe is absolutely right that there are three parts to this Bill and many of us, like the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, have long advocated for cost rental and for affordable, local authority-led delivery.  Given that we are only going to get 530 such units this year, confirmed to us by the Department officials last week, 700 such units are only guaranteed for the pipeline next year, and then 1,500, is that at the scale the NESC has consistently recommended and, if not, what is the level of scale?<\/p><p>Are we talking about thousands or tens of thousands of such directly delivered units rather than the hundreds the Government has made provision for over the next three years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#D00800","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to indicate to whom the first question was directed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#E00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The first question was to Dr. O'Toole, the second to Mr. John O'Connor and the third to Dr. Larry O'Connell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#E00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I ask the witnesses to respond in that order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#E00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>The are two components to the Deputy's question, first, the level of the scheme and, second, the targeting and coupling of the scheme with the further supports that are available in the market.  It is important to say that the research we have done historically shows that these types of credit-based interventions are with merit.  They can get to households that otherwise would not have been able to make the transaction and, therefore, these types of instruments can be very meritocratic in that context.  In terms of their impact on the inflationary channel, there are a number of aspects to the intervention that would, for example, exacerbate or lower the degree to which that price inflation may materialise.  The larger the intervention, the shorter the timeframe in which that intervention takes place.  The number of recipients of that intervention is also important.  For example, if it is spread among a large number of users of the scheme and all of those users have more purchasing power, that can have an impact as well as the general level.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the targeting of the measures, the targeting is important in the context of the constraints households face.  For example, is it that they have an insufficient deposit such that they are down payment constrained?  In that context, an equity-type scheme is more important.  If it is the case that their loan to income ratio is constrained, that would be much more an income constraint, which the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme would deal with.  The targeting is important in the context of, in particular, the parts of the income distribution that would be impacted by any particular intervention.  Work we did previously on the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme showed that it was really good at getting to applicants who were at the lower end of the income distribution but underserved by the broader commercial market.  That is a case of trying to tailor for a gap in the market.  The tailoring of this measure is important.  To ensure the maximum economic additionality from the intervention, it is critical that it goes to those households which otherwise would not have been able to make the transaction.  That is complicated to get at, but there are a number of ways to do it.  For example, there should be a screening of the borrower's attempts to secure credit through the normal channels and an interrogation of the financial circumstances of the borrower.  It is important the income and savings picture of the borrower is well known in the context of the scheme to ensure that it goes to those households with the greatest need.  That will boost the economic additionality from a scheme like this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>There is only one minute remaining for this slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#E00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>On the second question, to put it in context, delivery under the shared equity scheme will be by the local authorities and others.

I welcome Mr. O'Connor, Dr. O'Toole , Dr. O'Connell, Mr. Cahill and their colleagues to this meeting.  My first question is in regard to Dr. O'Toole's concluding remark in his opening statement that credit market supports such as the shared equity scheme and other interventions may indeed lower credit constraints by facilitating home purchase for buyers who otherwise would have been unable to enter the market.  In my book, that is a positive.  We all know constituents and other people who are paying exceptionally high rents and whose incomes are such that they cannot get a sufficient mortgage but, if they could, their repayments would be substantially lower than the rents they are paying.  These are the people that we are trying to cater for in the affordable housing Bill.  It is important to say that.<\/p> <p>  I put it to Dr. O'Toole that, as mentioned earlier by Deputy McAuliffe, he has ignored a significant part of the Bill, namely, the provision of affordable purchase homes on local authority lands.  That is ultimately a large supply measure that will impact the provision of homes.  I take it from Dr. O'Toole's thesis that he disagrees fundamentally with the Department's contribution to the committee last week by Mr. Barry Quinlan and Mr. Robert Nicholson that, according to the UK National Audit Office, which is the equivalent of our Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the equity-based scheme in the UK had led to a 14.5% increase in supply and a 1% increase on a like-for-like basis in house prices.  Dr. O'Toole says that supply is important.  I put it to him that this is a supply-based measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#E00900","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions, to which I will try to give a couple of responses.  On the first point, I agree that these types of credit market interventions can be very positive.  Where one succeeds in providing credit market interventions to those households which otherwise would have been unable to make that transaction, that is a very positive thing.  Where there are critical gaps in the market that can be identified as gaps which these instruments can help to address, it is important to be able to facilitate that.  For example, in our review of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme we clearly stated that there was a clear gap in the market that that particular intervention was able to address and that there was a lot of merit in that particular instrument in doing that.  I completely agree that the ability to use these interventions to intervene in the market is an important policy lever to have.  As I mentioned earlier, in terms of the focus of our submission, we were trying to provide some insight to the committee that was useful by drawing on the research that we had done.

I thank the witnesses for attending.  I raised a similar point last week because the first point I heard in the statements about numbers related to Dublin.  I am interested to learn about the supply in Limerick.  There is more to this country than Dublin.  The statistics relating to Limerick are the ones I am most interested in.  I am in construction myself.  I am based in a rural setting.  I welcome the cost-rental management system and the shared equity loan scheme.  The biggest problem we have in Limerick is supply and demand and we have a major problem with infrastructure.  Everyone is entitled to their culture in terms of where they are from and where they are living, and to represent that.  In the context of developing Limerick as a whole, industry is based in the city or along the Shannon Estuary and infrastructure is at its lowest in the east of the county.  How can we provide housing for people in villages and small towns where there is no industry?  People want to return home to live in the area they are from, but there is no infrastructure there.  We have forgotten about infrastructure other than in highly populated areas.<\/p> <p>  People who have been in rental accommodation as council tenants for 20, 30 or 40 years are not allowed to buy their own house once they reach pension age.  When those people pass on, they want to leave their house to their family members so they can stay in the area where they grew up.  From an infrastructural point of view, Kilfinnane recently got 21 houses, but only 15 of them could go on the main sewerage system.  Six houses on a housing estate had to have their own private sewerage system because of a lack of infrastructure.  There are 123 people on the housing list for more than ten years and there are no sewage facilities.  Those people have all been turned down for planning.  Askeaton has been waiting for a sewerage system for 30 years.  Raw sewage is going into the Shannon.  We can talk about supplying houses everywhere, but we cannot supply them if we do not have the infrastructure in key areas where people want to live.  This goes back to the local authorities and their failure to invest in towns and villages.  Housing cannot just go to people in highly populated areas.<\/p> <p>  Infrastructure is not only about sewerage; it is about bus services and connectivity.  Once one leaves a highly populated area such as Limerick city, all the infrastructure falls away.  Infrastructure only seems to follow industry.  All of the county needs to be represented.  I was part of the Limerick 2030 group when I was elected as a Deputy.  My brother-in-law, John, is on the board.  It is doing fantastic work.  It started in the city and now it is moving out to the county to try to do exactly what I am talking about.  The group is trying to get infrastructure in the places I have spoken about where there is no infrastructure so people can live in the entire county and not just in one section of it.<\/p> <p>  I would welcome a response first to the question on infrastructure and how to provide housing for people on housing lists where there is no infrastructure.  My second question is about people in rental accommodation for many years who cannot purchase their houses once they reach pension age.

Based on the witnesses' research and expertise, what annual target should the State work towards to deliver enough cost rental units to drive rents down?<\/p> <p>  On permanent affordability, in the presentation by Dr. O'Toole and Dr. Slaymaker, they emphasised the importance of permanent affordability.  I completely agree with affordable purchase and rent, as it is very much at the centre of Green Party housing policy.  Do the provisions set out in this Bill in its entirety, including cost rental equity loan, CREL, putting cost rental on a statutory basis, the affordable purchase of homes provided by the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the affordable purchase schemes, offer permanent affordability in the long term?

It is critically important.  On the delivery numbers, a few thousand units per year would be needed.  A very significant stock of housing needs to be built up.  One thing that is really important in respect of cost rental is seeing it as a long-term measure.  When it has been successful in other countries, it has taken decades for that stock of affordable rental and cost rental housing to be built up.  It is critical.  When it is built up on scale, the rents can be reduced significantly over time, so it is most important.<\/p> <p>  Another important point is that in most countries, cost rental is seen as being very similar to home ownership.  It is a home that is affordable.  I will tell the committee a secret that is not often understood.  In Vienna, for example, people have the right to buy.  Everyone in cost rental housing can actually buy their home, but they choose not to, because it is affordable, and it is seen as a home.  In respect of any organisation providing cost rental homes, whether they are approved housing bodies, local authorities or the Land Development Agency, the rent must be based on the cost of provision, so that any surpluses or limited profits that are made are actually used to keep down the rents.  We have been working very closely with the Department, and one thing that is most important is to keep the rents down and to make cost rental seem like a long-term home for households.  It must be seen that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Does NESC or the ESRI have an opinion on the numbers that must be delivered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#G00500","speaker":"1574"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>It is difficult to specify a number, but I will give the committee an idea.  Some 20% of the housing stock in Denmark is cost rental.  If that model is applied, we will get a very high number.  The limited profit sector in Austria delivers 23% of all new construction in the residential market.  Again, that model will produce a very high number if it is applied.  Property Industry Ireland did a piece of research that it showed to us.  The figures are worth checking, but they provided an indication.  The research looked at the number of people on incomes of more than &euro;50,000 but under &euro;90,000 and produced a figure of 400,000.  All of that supports Mr. O'Connor's point.  The scale of this is in the thousands, not the hundreds.  Going back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, I can see that figures of 400, 500 or 1,500 seem low.  However, the issue for Government is first that it has to prove the concept.  I can see that.  Mr. O'Connor has made the point that we must look at some of the regulations and what it would count in costs.  We have to look at how we put limits on returns for investors.  There is some work to do.  My feeling is, once we have proven the concept, the demand will be there to deliver at a much higher level than our current ambition.  I can see the tension between trying to test the concept and roll out the demand.  The international evidence suggests it is a very attractive concept.<\/p> <p>  The other point on cost rental, and I believe the Housing Agency has figures on this, is that it delivers an immediate impact.  In the models we looked at, there could be rents 20% below what the market is at.  By the end of 2030, rents could be 40% below what the market is at.  Therefore, there is a long-term benefit to cost rental.  We will see then how the equity begins to be used to supply more housing.  There is also an immediate short-term impact, and that is where we will see the scale of demand for this, if we can do it.<\/p> <p>  On proving the concept, the current cost rental model is bringing costs down because it has low finance. There are other levers with which to bring the cost down.  We need to begin to look at them in respect of using the land, for example.  As we use these other levers, we can bring the cost down further again.  That, equally, will boost the demand.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Larry O'Connell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I agree with both of the previous contributors that the scale of this, in the medium term, will be in the thousands.

The report also suggested that nearly two-thirds of the buyers who availed of the help-to-buy scheme could have bought without it.  Almost one-third could have bought exactly the same property without the scheme.

We would view it as desirable if the approach was one of permanent affordability, but this is an attempt to support permanent affordability in the private sector to a degree.

The ESRI's report identifies the pinch point for people in the rental sector.  The State supports 53% of renters financially to secure housing and the ESRI identifies the 47% who are not in any way financially supported by the State as being trapped in unaffordability from a rental perspective and locked out of homeownership.  It was concerning to read that the ESRI identifies as potentially inflationary an intervention to help these people to access affordable housing.  The ESRI's report states that the loosening of the credit constraints by a shared equity scheme would likely lead to higher house prices.

A multitude a factors affect the housing market.  The Senator mentioned some of them on the supply side.  There are a range of developments in terms of the labour market, including households' incomes and employments.  All of these factors affect the overall level of house prices and house price inflation.  When we consider a policy like this ex ante, that is, it has not happened yet, we try to think through the potential risks and the potential channels through which it might operate.

I welcome Mr. O'Connor's welcome for the local authority-led affordable purchase scheme and the shared equity scheme. In respect of Dr. O'Connell's and Mr. Cahill's presentation and reviews of their eight reports, they recommended everything from the established of the LDA, cost rental, the expansion of Part V, the expansion of the site services fund, CPO powers and a flagship project.  I am inclined to agree with everything they said and all of the other research on this.  While we might not agree on everything, I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Broin would agree with me when I suggest that Dublin Mid-West be looked as a key location for such a flagship project.<\/p><p>My first question for the ESRI relates to the criticism of the UK scheme.  One of the major parts of criticism was that it was open to all earners and that 60% of those who availed of the scheme did not actually need that support.  I know that is of concern to the witnesses from the ESRI and Senator Moynihan, who also raised it.  Do the witnesses from the ESRI accept that we have learned from the UK experience and that, under this Bill, someone will only be eligible for affordable housing if he or she cannot buy without that support and that as Mr. O'Connor said, this, in itself, is a control mechanism?<\/p><p>My second question concerns the supply constraints.  As both Dr. Slaymaker and Dr. O'Toole said, supply is the most critical part and is probably the hardest one to get right.  They described it as the most difficult to rectify and something that will take the longest time to materialise.  The two shared equity schemes in conjunction with the LDA, and it is quite that they look at it in conjunction with the LDA, which is also going through the Oireachtas, are aimed at becoming a catalyst for supply in the near future.  The witnesses from the ESRI outlined how key rectifying supply issues is in terms of delivering affordability.  Do they agree that when looked at in conjunction, the two different shared equity schemes and the LDA will together kick-start supply?  If those three mechanisms become that catalyst in supply, will that will offset any potential impact on inflation?<\/p><p>Following on from the points raised by Deputy McAuliffe and Senators Cummins and Fitzpatrick regarding not looking at the local authority scheme, I know the witnesses said they do not have much research on this side of things.  Can they use this opportunity to acknowledge that their opening statement only deals with two of the three elements of the Bill and, therefore, could be misleading if it is read as a commentary on the Bill in its entirety?  We saw that on the front page of today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  If the witnesses are willing to take this time, could they put on the record of the Oireachtas their views on the full Bill, particularly the full Bill when it is looked at in conjunction with the LDA?  Do the witnesses accept that the Bill provides for people who cannot buy without support?  Do they agree that, taken in conjunction with the LDA, this will kick-start supply?  Does that alleviate any concerns in respect of potential inflation?  My third question concerns that holistic view of the Bill.  Could the witnesses start with the third one in case we run out of time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#L00400","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her comments.  As I mentioned earlier, in respect of the evidence we are putting forward today or, certainly, the research we are trying to draw on, we felt we had elements that could help with the Bill where that drew on our existing research.  Where there are supply side elements in this, and this is a broad Bill, they are most welcome.  Focusing on and understanding those supply side challenges are critically important.  As we said on a number of occasions, any measures to increase the supply of housing are what we need so the range of measures in the Bill to do that are very welcome.<br\/><br\/>In respect of the eligibility criteria, learning from the UK scheme and the impact of any increase in supply on prices, as I mentioned, when we do this type of assessment <i>ex ante<\/i>, it is very difficult to say what exactly will happen to house prices given the range and multitude of factors that affect house prices.  It is important at the start to think about the benefits and merits of schemes like this.  It is also important to think about the risks.  Outlining and considering these are as important as anything else.  When a scheme like this takes place or the intervention occurs, one is able to say afterwards what happened if one has sufficient data and a good identification strategy to do that.  I mentioned two things in my opening statement.  The eligibility criteria, the targeting and the prioritisation are very important.  Ensuring these households are unable to get the credit in the market - they have demonstrated that they have attempted to borrow on the market and that has been deemed to be insufficient for the housing purchase they would like to make - is a very important screening criterion for this scheme.  That is critical.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the overall magnitude, naturally the UK is a very different market.  The dynamics at play in the UK are very different and the context in Ireland is very different.  The level of supply and balances is not the same here.  The macroeconomic context and labour market shocks are different here, which matters for understanding how much of the various different pressures will pass through this scheme.  It is not to say that what happened in the UK will exactly happen here.  That is not the case.  However, it involves thinking about what evidence we have in terms of the mechanisms and channels through which these type of interventions operate in terms of understanding the benefits to help facilitate home ownership for households that otherwise would be unable to able to avail of it-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1613433600,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Sorry, we are just out of time.

Yes, the heading is &quot;ESRI claims shared equity schemes risk driving up prices&quot; but Dr. O'Toole is right to come in and bring a dose of reality to the situation.  I acknowledge his work in this area and I acknowledge the ESRI as being a very competent, able, fair and transparent organisation.  I do not believe Dr. O'Toole set out to upset people but I believe he has given us a dose of reality.  The article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>this morning is a wake-up call for many people in this debate about affordability.  Dr. O'Toole is right to talk about analysing and assessing <i>ex ante<\/i>the process relating to risk, merits and benefits.  He has done a good job and has done good service to this committee.  I acknowledge that because he has made an important contribution that I consider to be a commonsense injection of reality.<\/p><p>I have a few questions about the Housing Agency.  I welcome Mr. O'Connor and congratulate him on the 50 cost-rental homes in Stepaside and the follow-on 105 social houses in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  This is a welcome development from which we will learn.  It was very much a learning curve and we have all learned things about that.  I do not want to go into that.  I would touch on some things mentioned by Mr. O'Connor in his commentary, such as the serviced sites fund and the land aggregation scheme, which is one of the greatest scandals in this country in terms of how these lands were purchased, the exorbitant prices paid for them and the fact that they were offered back to the Department on a land aggregation scheme basis, the Department rejected many of these and they are still on the books of the Housing Agency and local authorities.  There is enormous potential in time and there is more out there in the context of a longer-term focus.<\/p><p> A final issue is the LDA.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the serviced sites fund, the land aggregation scheme and the LDA and how that can feed into their plans and vision in terms of affordability.<\/p><p> I have a question for Mr. Cahill.  I was interested in his proposal regarding a vacant sale order, something I had not heard about.  We do not have time to discuss it today, but if he did more work on this issue, the committee would be interested in it.  I would certainly be interested in hearing more about it.  Perhaps he could send the committee some details on that.  It is an imaginative and progressive scheme with potential.  I would like to hear if there is any additional information on that, and he might share it with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#L00900","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>The serviced sites fund would be critically important for the delivery by local authorities, approved housing bodies and the LDA of affordable purchase housing and cost rental housing.  On the purchase side it is one way of reducing the cost for the purchaser, along with the use of land.  That would involve the continued and perhaps more flexible use of the serviced sites fund, which is currently primarily focused on infrastructure.  If local authorities are given more flexibility in its use, which the Department and Minister are considering, that will be important.  Its use in the future will be very important.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to the LDA.  Delivery on State and local authority lands, supported by the LDA, will be very important.  It ties into the land aggregation scheme.  Lands which were purchased by local authorities are now being fed into the LDA.  There are three specific sites that between them will deliver around 1,500 homes.<\/p> <p>  The price paid by local authorities was the price of land at the time.  The important thing now is that we utilise land and start delivering on scale on those lands.  The major advantage of the LDA is that it is able to deliver on big developments and can deliver mixed-use developments.

I refer to the ESRI conclusions that, given current supply shortages, it is likely that benefits will be outweighed by inflationary pressures.  I read with interest the report on mortgage credit access and State intervention.  It concludes by stating that:<\/p> <blockquote> \t[P]ublic policy mechanisms to subsidise rents, such as affordability or cost rental measures, are viewed as tenure end-points for recipient households, however such measures may provide a platform by which recipient households accumulate a deposit and become home-owners.  Exploring the dynamics of affordability and tenure choice could provide useful insights for the calibration of housing affordability and related policy interventions. <\/blockquote> <p>Coming back to the point made by Deputy Higgins, the wider context needs to be analysed.  This includes the LDA, the focus on improving supply, the interventions which focus on improving access to affordable housing and credit and existing schemes.  The interplay of all that will assist in easing demand and increasing supply.  I am interested in hearing the comments from the ESRI  on that.  I acknowledge the wider circumstance in the context of the statements today and how they have been represented in the media.  I would like Mr. O'Connell to expand on his comments that we need to focus on supply as a solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021021600002#M00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613433600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>The wider context is critically important in understanding the economics around these types of interventions.  As I have mentioned, the housing market has many co-determining factors, such as the level of credit market access with supported schemes and broader lending activity by the general banking sector and the demand side, labour market and supply channels.  Ultimately, the overall impact on inflation would be a combination of all of these factors.  They all co-determine the degree to which house prices will move up or down over the coming years.<br\/><br\/>It is important for us to understand their varying impacts over time.  It is very difficult to stand here today <i>ex ante<\/i>and say what the impact of any one scheme would be before it has taken place.  In a sense, we need to think about the benefits and risks.  As I said in the statement and discussion today, where there are interventions to provide credit constrained households with the finance to make transactions, those policies certainly have merit.  There is a role for them where they can be clearly identified to help with the deposit or income channel.  Our research is clear on that.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the risks with these policies, in general with any intervention on the credit market side where there are rises in purchasing power and supply is limited in the short run, the tendency is to have upward pressure on the demand side.  That can be offset by changing other components on the supply side, and that may alter the market.  It involves a combination of factors that all affect each other.
