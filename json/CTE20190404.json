Agreed.  Nothing specific arises that will not come up in the course of our discussions on our work programme.<\/p><p> The first items of correspondence are Nos. 2081A and 2085A, which comprise the opening statement from the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, and a briefing note from Ms Catherine Smith, corporate secretariat, for today's meeting.  We note and publish that.<\/p><p> The next items are from Accounting Officers or Ministers following on from previous meetings of this committee.  We held over No. 2073B from Dr. Deirdre Keyes, chief executive of Kildare-Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, at our meeting last week.  The documentation is dated 21 March and provides a response to information requested by the committee, including notes on independent valuations, meetings of the board held in hotels, leasing of property by the ETB which it previously owned, and details of a rent-free period for the Bray civic centre.  Dr. Keyes also refers to a review of all of the ETB's leases and the difficulties it has faced so far in collating that documentation.  We noted and published the item the previous day and agreed that we might hold it over to allow people to consider it further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I have not actually looked at it yet and------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#B00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>We can hold it over again.

We have noted and published it, but we need to discuss it.  We will make a point of discussing it and make sure, when the documentation is going out, that members are aware that it will be up for discussion the next day.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 2078B from Ms Maria Browne, Chief State Solicitor, dated 29 March, providing a breakdown of outstanding lottery grant cases for the year ending 2018, as requested by the committee.  Ms Browne states that the correct terminology is &quot;outstanding files&quot; as opposed to outstanding cases.  We are being corrected on our terminology.  There were 174 files outstanding at the end of 2018.  We will note and publish that.  When the Office of the Chief State Solicitor appeared before the committee we asked a question about the number of files it had on voluntary organisations which had made applications for national lottery funds, and were all experiencing some delay.  Ms Browne has outlined the details on that.  There are quite a few still outstanding.  Some of the cases have been dealt with from the Chief State Solicitor's point of view, but third-party solicitors have not yet provided confirmation.  The documentation is there.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 2080B from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, providing information requested by the committee concerning Courts Service statistics.  It appears that neither the Department nor the Courts Service are able to provide the number of non-legally aided persons appearing before the courts.  We will note and publish this.  We had been given details on legal aid cases and we had asked if, as the total number of cases is known, whether we could work out how many non-legally aided cases there were.  The Department has said that it cannot do that.  The letter says:<\/p><blockquote>Legal Aid certs granted can refer to a single offence or a category of offences.  A defendant appearing before the courts could be granted a number of Legal Aid Certs for offences in the one case or could have a number of Legal Aid Certs referring to different cases before the courts.<\/blockquote> <p>That is not corrected.  The letter goes on to say:<\/p><blockquote>As indicated previously, legal aid is granted by the courts in the majority of indictable offences dealt with in the Circuit, Central and Special Criminal Courts.  The Courts Service advises that this would refer to at least 95% of these cases.<\/blockquote> <p>In the District Court it advises that approximately 70% of defendants get free legal aid and says that the main reason for that is that cases dealt with there include minor road traffic offences such as speeding, tax certificates or national car test, NCT, certificates not being displayed.  That is as much information as the Department has.  We will note and publish that.<\/p><p>The next category is category C, which is correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.  There are three items, being Nos. 1872C, 1876C and 1886C, which we will discuss in private session.  They relate to the University of Limerick.  We will have a short private session before we sit in public session with our witnesses.<\/p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 2072C from an individual, dated 25 March.  The individual raises a number of matters around the governance of KWETB and its failure to respond to questions raised.  The correspondence also raises questions about evidence given by witnesses from KWETB to this committee.  Do members want to discuss this?  We could get the permission of the person who wrote to us to forward the correspondence to the Department where the matters relating to the KWETB are being examined and seek to have a response put before the committee.  I propose writing to the chair of KWETB for a collated response to the specific matters in the evidence referred to by the correspondent.  Do members want to do that or will we hold it over for consideration with other KWETB correspondence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#B00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>We should hold it over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#B01000","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>It is all the same topic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#B01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Are we discussing No. 2072C?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#B01200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#B01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>It is not necessarily all the same topic.

It is not a requirement for those organisations that they have a board meeting before they appear here to instruct or suggest to the Accounting Officer or the chairman of the board how he or she should conduct himself or herself before this committee.  We would not be happy if that was the case, because it could be interpreted in all sorts of ways.  I do not necessarily agree that there should have been a board meeting specifically to discuss appearances before this committee.

Our target is for the end of this month.  I reiterate what the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment stated because the people did not fully grasp it . There was a debate in the D&aacute;il last week with the Minister on the issue, where he stated the Department was dealing with one tender and that he would bring a proposal to the Government in the near future.  That was picked up by the public and many people interpreted it as suggesting there would be a decision on the contracts.  The Secretary General, however, made it clear at the committee last week that the only proposal that would be made to the Government in the near future would be to appoint Brendan McCourt, or not, as the preferred bidder.  When the preferred bidder status is given, the Government remains under no contractual obligation.  It is not a contract for rural broadband.  It gives the Government certainty in order that it can then negotiate its infrastructural agreements with Eir and other bodies.  It now has some certainty to finalise the detailed costs.<\/p> <p>  When that is all put together, after whatever period of time, the Government can consider signing a contract, or otherwise.  There have been cases in the past where preferred bidders have been approved by the Cabinet, circumstances change, and ultimately the contract is never signed at a loss and cost to the preferred bidder because there are no contractual obligations.  The proposal to the Government is not to sign the national broadband plan contract but rather only to appoint the preferred bidder.  While it is a significant step along the way, it is not the entire process.  I am sure people understood that from the debate that emanated from the D&aacute;il last week, but the debate on the issue at the committee's meeting was more specific.  I am putting it on the record because the Deputy has raised the issue, and it might clarify the matter for the public.  Our target is the end of this month, which is only a few weeks away. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#D03000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>If the decision is made to appoint the preferred bidder, the level of detail that will be provided is not known at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#D03100","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Our report will have to include clear signposts and signals in respect of the tendering process that has been ongoing since the end of December 2017, to ensure value for money in public expenditure.

On 16 May we will resume dealing with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's financial statements.  We expect to have considered the PwC report in advance of that meeting.  We will meet the Courts Service on 23 May and on 30 May we will meet with representatives of the Department of Finance to deal with a special report from the Comptroller and Auditor General on EU transactions.  We will meet with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on 13 June.  These are provisional arrangements.  The following week, the annual report of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, will be published.  That will deal with an awful lot of issues on behalf of the State.  The HSE financial statements should be available in advance of 26 June.  We will try to deal with those before we go break for the summer.  After that, we have a scheduled meeting with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  We want to do that before the break as well.  That body's annual report will be out around the end of June.  It is just as well to have sight of its annual report before meeting with its representatives.  I thought we might have done it earlier, but the annual report will be out at the end of June.  The Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission will be at that meeting.<\/p> <p>  These are provisional items.  We can come back and address others.

This includes the Irish Probation Service, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, the Reception and Integration Agency, the State pathology service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  An overview of the main funded services and agencies is given in a summary diagram which I have attached to this opening statement.<\/p> <p>  The policy and oversight remit of the Department has changed somewhat since the beginning of 2017.  This is reflected in the appropriation account.  Responsibility for the Charities Regulatory Authority transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Rural and Community Development in July 2017.  In accordance with standard Government accounting procedures, the voted expenditure related to the authority for all of 2017 is reflected in the appropriation account of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Votes of the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2018.<\/p> <p>  The 2017 appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of almost &euro;423 million in the year, spread across five spending programmes.  I have indicated those in the figure that is now on the screen.  The programmes are organised in line with statements of strategic objectives.  Note 3 of the appropriation account provides a breakdown of the programme spending under subheads that indicate the instruments used by the Department to achieve those objectives.  On the receipts side, appropriations-in-aid of the Vote totalled just over &euro;66 million in 2017.  Almost three quarters of this related to a range of fees charged in respect of immigration registration, nationality and citizenship certification and visa issuance.  The net expenditure on the Vote was approximately &euro;22 million less than was provided for in the 2017 Estimate.<\/p> <p>  In my report on the appropriation account, I drew attention to a material level of non-compliance with EU and national procurement rules in respect of contracts operated by the Department in 2017.  Further detail in this regard is disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. O'Driscoll to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#H00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554364800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The Department's Vote is one of six Votes which currently makes up the justice Vote group.  The justice and equality Vote, which we are examining today, accounts for 18% of gross expenditure in the overall Vote group; the Garda Vote accounts for 64% of gross expenditure; prisons and courts are 13% and 5% of gross expenditure, respectively, with the remaining Votes for the Policing Authority and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission accounting for less than 1%.  However, our focus today is on Vote 24, the justice and equality Vote.<\/p> <p>  The Department's Vote covers a wide remit, encompassing both the administrative divisions of the Department and a broad range of offices and agencies across the justice sector.  In all, there are approximately 60 individual subheads reflected across five expenditure programmes which are set out in the briefing material and which support the Department&rsquo;s overall vision of a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland.  The remit of the Department is broad and diverse and includes subheads relating to commissions and special inquiries, civil and criminal legal aid, immigration and asylum accommodation, the Probation Service, equality, integration and disability, and a range of other services, including offices and agencies such as the Data Protection Commission, the Criminal Assets Bureau, forensic science and State pathology laboratories, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and so forth.<\/p> <p>  As there is no specific chapter relating to the justice and equality Vote in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2017, I propose to focus briefly on a few areas within the Vote where there has been developments in the last couple of years.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware that the Department is undergoing a major transformation programme at present.<\/p><p>This arises from the Government's acceptance of the final report of the effectiveness and renewal group, ERG, in June 2018, following significant political and public debate.  This programme aims to develop a future operating model that embraces the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, which enhances organisational agility and responsiveness and places the Department of Justice and Equality at the forefront of developments in the Irish Civil Service.<\/p><p> I am pleased to say that significant progress is being made.  The Department has now been realigned under two executive pillars each headed up by a deputy secretary, with Ms Oonagh Buckley heading up the civil justice and equality pillar and Ms Oonagh McPhillips, who is with me today, heading up the criminal justice pillar.  The two executive pillars will be supported by a central corporate pillar.  A new corporate governance structure reflecting this realignment came into operation from January 2019.  The second phase involves the Department designing and implementing a new operating model and organisational structure in the two executive pillars based on five core functions, namely, policy, operations, transparency, governance and legislation.  <\/p><p> The transformation programme is being overseen by a programme board chaired by myself and including the Secretary General to the Government, the Secretary General of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Vote assistant secretary for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which will ensure that the programme is conducted in accordance with good governance principles, that it is delivered on time, within budget and that the design solutions are appropriate.  In addition, the ERG continues to provide its input and produces quarterly progress reports, which are published on the Department website.  <\/p><p> The Department has completed the high-level design of the new operating model and structure and has now moved to detailed design.  The programme is due for completion by early October this year.  Funding for this programme has been provided in the justice and equality Vote in 2019.   <\/p><p> There is also a very significant policing reform programme ongoing in relation to the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The Department is facilitating and supporting this programme including the provision of funding to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist with certain work under the programme.   <\/p><p> I would also like to mention the Data Protection Commission, DPC, which has received significant additional funding in recent years to build the organisation's capacity and capability in preparation for the DPC's enhanced regulatory powers and more prominent international role under the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  These increased resources have facilitated the recruitment of additional staff, including legal, technical, audit and investigations specialists, as well as policy and administrative staff.  The budget allocation of the organisation increased from &euro;1.9 million in 2014 to &euro;7.2 million in 2017 and has increased further to &euro;15.2 million in 2019.  This resource level will enable the DPC to continue to build the organisation's knowledge and capability in the performance of its expanded statutory role as an EU-wide regulator and lead supervisory authority for the large multinational technology companies, many of which have their European headquarters in Ireland.  <\/p><p> Committee members will be well aware of the pressures in our accommodation system for asylum seekers.  The Department is currently managing a total of 6,497 international protection applicants, including 5,980 residing in our accommodation centres with a further 517 applicants in emergency hotel accommodation.  At the end of 2016, the Department was accommodating 4,425.  However, by the end of 2017, the number had risen to 5,096 persons, an increase of 15%, and, at the end of 2018, there were 6,106 persons in accommodation.  The increasing numbers to be accommodated is a significant part of the challenge facing the asylum system.  A process to support residents moving into mainstream housing is being finalised through the establishment of a dedicated unit working with centre managers, NGOs, and local authorities.  <\/p><p> Another expanding area in the Department is the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, which has grown considerably in scale and scope since it was established in 2005.  INIS now comprises approximately one third of all staff in the Department of Justice and Equality, processing over 250,000 applications a year.  The role of INIS has expanded over recent years to include areas such as border management at Dublin Airport, immigration registrations in the Dublin metropolitan area and the newly-established Irish passenger information unit.  INIS has put a service improvement plan in place for the period 2018 to 2020 which, while ambitious in scope, is also realistic.  The actions can be delivered within the timeframes set out and a strong programme board has been established to make sure that is the case.  Some early reforms have included the introduction of plain language in all INIS application forms, the launch of INIS Online, a new customer portal that will allow all applications and payments to be submitted online by the end of March 2020, and the establishment of a change management unit within INIS to drive innovation and best practice in project and change management.  <\/p><p> It is clear to all of us working in the Department that the demands we face in the immigration area are likely to continue to grow over the coming years.  Meeting those demands requires that we seek to deliver our services in different ways, and to increase our efficiency, while also improving customer experiences.  These objectives are entirely compatible with the overall departmental transformation programme.  <\/p><p> The year under examination, 2017, was of course an important year in the development of a strategic approach to equality.  Four major equality strategies were launched that year: the national strategy for women and girls, the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, the national disability inclusion strategy and the migrant integration strategy.  These represent a whole-of-Government approach to addressing the needs of diverse groups and to ensuring their equal participation in Irish society.  Each strategy was developed and is being implemented with the involvement of the groups that each is designed to serve.  This was also the year in which the Irish State formally recognised Travellers as an ethnic minority.  This landmark recognition is a key step forward in fostering a society which respects and celebrates diverse identities.  In that context, my Department is currently developing a national LGBTI strategy, which will be published later this year.  <\/p><p> I note that Brexit has been a significant area of work since the UK referendum and this remains the case.  The Department of Justice and Equality shares this agenda with all other Departments and is working within the highly co-ordinated whole-of-Government structures led by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions that members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>The Department even has an ERG.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#J00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554364800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>We have an ERG.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>That is an unfortunate acronym.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#J00400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>We will now take our speakers in the following sequence: Deputy Connolly has 20 minutes and Deputy Farrell is the designated second speaker.

I know the clerk will be concerned about this but it is in the interests of using our time most efficiently.  Neither the witnesses nor the committee is in a position to have the delegation before us as regularly as all of us might like.  I will put some points on record with respect to the Irish Prison Service.  Following our meeting on 17 January, I was accused on the public airwaves by the Prison Officers Association, POA, of seeking to shut down the mess committees.  I am also informed that briefings are being held by the POA in prisons throughout the country, with members being told not to communicate with Deputies and that I in particular was seeking to shut down mess committees.  It is totally incorrect to say there was any move to shut down facilities available to hard-working prison officers for hot meals and I would be to the fore in opposing same.  That is not to confuse my wish for the appropriate procedures to be in place.  I thought it peculiar that the Prison Officers Association would take to the national airwaves or provide a briefing in this way when in the same meeting I was highlighting issues of critical importance, such as sexual harassment, career blocking and illegal surveillance of that association's members.  Nevertheless, it is what the association chose to do.  I am on the side of the ordinary prison officer but, in line with our constitutional responsibility in here, I am also on the side of appropriate procedures and protection for staff and so on.<\/p><p> As a result of the meeting of 17 January relating to the prison service and subsequent research, I am concerned there may be a parallel investigative, judicial and enforcement system in operation across and within individual prisons when it comes to alleged wrongdoing by prison staff.  Therefore I have a number of questions for the Secretary General, although I fully appreciate that he does not have the Irish Prison Service team with him today.  I accept fully that he may not be in a position to answer questions and if he is not, we can move on and perhaps he can revert to us, preferably in writing.

I said I would seek legal advice on same and I have.  The contents of this documentation are a matter of major concern for me.  I do not want the clerk to panic at this stage and nobody is going to be named here.

The documentation gives detailed accounts of movements of a person or persons in areas outside a prison environment with dates, times, addresses and vehicle registration numbers.

Owing to the challenges being faced by the Department, my fear is that it will become a long-term solution.  From January to March, the cost was &euro;3.4 million.  As the Secretary General rightly said, there is a housing crisis.  In identifying suitable accommodation will the hotel aspect become like the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme when suddenly the cost will spiral out of control?  We have the perfect storm with the housing crisis being compounded by the challenges facing the Department in identifying suitable properties such that hotels are becoming a solution when people present.  Only God knows to what the cost could rise by the end of the year.  In meeting the challenges encountered by the Department on a daily basis I am afraid that using hotel accommodation has become an option.  Is my assessment correct?

We have moved to a situation whereby already more than 50% of people in accommodation centres can do their own cooking.  We are trying to move to a point where everyone will be in that position.  This has, rightly, been a sensitive issue.  People want to have that independence of action.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to make one point though.  What is acceptable for accommodation for someone for a short time is different to what is acceptable for someone for accommodation for a long period.  Numerous issues intersect here.  One relates to standards in the facilities.  As has already been pointed out, they are being substantially enhanced.  Under the new tender arrangements, the standards are higher again.  All involve cooking facilities and so on.<\/p> <p>  The second point relates to the question the speed with which applications are processed.  We go through the International Protection Office, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and so on.  We are also trying to address that.  In other words, we are trying to get faster movement through the system so that people do not end up staying in the facilities for a long time.  There has been significant improvement in this in recent years, but there is a great deal more to be done.  We want to get to a point where people spend a relatively short time &ndash; I am referring to periods of months rather than years &ndash; in these facilities while they are waiting for a first decision and perhaps appeal to the tribunal.

Of course we assume everybody would prefer to move onto normal housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#U02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I will stop Mr. O'Driscoll there.  When officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and RIA were before the committee two years ago - Mr. O'Driscoll's predecessor was here - I put it on the record that what Mr. O'Driscoll has described has not been my experience across the board.  I have had experience of having to visit reception centres in the past.  Things have changed, thankfully.  They are private entities which are run privately.  Some of them have different rules.  When I was a member of Waterford City and County Council a number of years ago, I was invited by the residents to visit one of these centres.  When I turned up, I was refused entry.

A number of organisations, including non-governmental organisations, were invited in to assist and support people who were living in these centres.  As Mr. O'Driscoll has spoken about rights, I should mention that people have a right to vote in local elections.  I was refused permission to canvass even though everyone has a right to canvass Mr. O'Driscoll or anybody else in this room or elsewhere.  The people living in this centre were not allowed to be canvassed.  On the basis of being refused permission to canvass, I subsequently wrote to the residents.  The letters I sent to each of them were posted directly to the reception centre.  Those letters were opened and put in the bin by the manager of the centre.  To me, that does not suggest that their rights are the same as those of anybody else.  Although things have changed since then, I do not believe the individual freedoms associated with living in one's own home, whether it is through social housing or private housing, are afforded to people who live in reception centres.  I do not accept that all the freedoms enjoyed by Mr. O'Driscoll and me are being enjoyed at this point in time by people in direct provision centres.  Notwithstanding the change that has allowed some people to work, there are still some people who are not allowed to work.  People cannot work up to nine months.  Mr. O'Driscoll has to accept that there are freedoms which are denied.  I am not saying that things have not changed.  I accept fully that they have.  I am conscious of the positive changes that have happened.

I was speaking in the present tense.  We are very conscious that in the past, a number of Deputies raised the issue of being able to canvass people, meet residents and so on.  I think a lot of progress has been made on that.  If there are any issues that arise from time to time, I ask people to notify us in order that we can sort them out.  People make mistakes.  My understanding now is that people have the right to canvass.  In fairness, I have been in a few centres.  In one centre I visited, I could not see that there should be any problem in canvassers accessing the place in a perfectly normal way.  In another centre, it was more difficult to say exactly which space was the private communal space, to which one would not realistically expect canvassers to have access, and which space was the public space.  Distinguishing those things is not always absolutely crystal clear.  As I have said, people can make mistakes.<\/p> <p>  I will explain what I think about all of those things and why I reacted to what the Deputy said.  I was not reacting to the Deputy's comment, in particular.  From time to time, there is public comment which grossly exaggerates the constraints under which people operate.  I accept that they are operating under constraints.  The Deputy is quite right to say they do not have the right to work for the first nine months.  That is a right enjoyed by the Deputy and me.  That is absolutely true.  In many cases, these people are coming from difficult circumstances and are probably finding it difficult to navigate our services as they access them for the first time.  We try to assist them in that.  They have rights in that space which we try to vindicate.  The broader point I wanted to make was a simple one.  I want to make it clear that people have freedoms here and that some of the commentary out there is a bit unfair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#V00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I accept that.

We have international obligations to asylum seekers.  We have had the Mahon report, an Ombudsman's report and so on; therefore, the changes have been wrought from the system.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Mr. O'Driscoll's openness and honesty and the straightness of all of his companions.  It is very helpful.  I would not like to send a message that the system is overwhelmed.  I looked back at the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter and noted that in 2015 there were 4,696 people in the system.  Today there are 6,106.  I do not believe these are overwhelming figures.  One has to take out the 700-plus people with status.  Really there has not been a massive jump.  What has happened is that there is a housing crisis and alternatives were never considered.  Repeatedly, before this committee, in terms of achieving value for money, alternatives were never considered.  To touch on what the Chairman said, there is a belief those concerned are lucky to get what they get.  I appreciate the witnesses' openness and honesty and I am returning it.  I would not like the aforesaid message to be sent.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of quick questions.  Mr. Justice Murray produced a report at some stage.  I remember reading it and did not bring it with me.  There were references in it to serious issues related to a directive and data privacy.  What happened as a result of it?  The EU directive was no longer valid and had been withdrawn.  If the witnesses do not know the answer, I do not mind.  I remember reading the report and being shocked at the findings of Mr. Justice Murray.  Legislation was to be enacted, but I do not believe it ever was.<\/p> <p>  The more specific question is about the integration fund, which is a very positive fund.  When I read the annual report or one of the reports, I note that it is stated there is &euro;50 million in the fund.  I refer to the asylum, migration and integration fund which is mentioned on page 22.  There are credits, which is extraordinary.  There is an estimated provision of &euro;1.5 million and the outturn was lower.  These are just the specifics.

I will get to the content of the other meeting in a moment or two.  The question on the mess committee stands and I hope Mr. O'Driscoll will get back to us on it.<\/p> <p>  The email that I referred to, which was sent to governors on 28 January, stated that mess committee staff were advised to engage professional financial advice regarding the tax status of committees and the financial books that were to be kept.  On the question of independence, it seems to be a Pontius Pilate move in that we seem to be taking control of an awful lot of things in terms of expenditure, light, heat and various other things.  I am totally for the appropriate availability of food, meals and everything in the Prison Service but governors are on the committee so I do not see the level of independence or any separation.  The line suggests the Prison Service is oblivious to tax status and the financial books.<\/p> <p>  In Mr. O'Driscoll's response to me, which he said was very detailed, he sent a list of balances when we had asked for audited accounts.  He pointed out that the balances may not all be profit but he did not answer the question of who audits or when it is audited and we are still oblivious to that.  He did, however, send us the procedure but nobody doubts that procedures are in place for how cash could be managed.  I respectfully suggest that it is the Department which has not tested some of the issues I brought up at the last meeting.  The Department has taken people's word for things but that may not be enough.  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to note that as well.<\/p> <p>  The email goes on to ask governors if they are aware of any misuse of Prison Service materials.  We would love to think everybody was above reproach but these questions are arising.  I am not saying governors are involved but they could be and we do not know.  If there are practices that are wrong, what do we expect governors to say other than that there is nothing to see here?  Would the Department consider asking the Comptroller and Auditor General, or an appropriate arms-length body such as the Department's own internal audit unit, which the procedure states can do spot checks, to carry out a forensic audit of all mess committees going back to their establishment, including interviews with all relevant personnel?  I would prefer the Comptroller and Auditor General to do it.  Mr. O'Driscoll said he is not answering and I understand why but I ask him to take it on board.<\/p> <p>  Is the Department or is the Irish Prison Service aware of an alleged amount, in the region of &euro;20,000 or &euro;25,000, being taken from the tuck shop or tuck shop account in a Dublin prison to fund a trip for a group to a sporting-related event in the United States between 2010 and 2013?  It is a serious allegation which has come up umpteen times.  Given the existence of such allegations, would the Department ask the Comptroller and Auditor General or another appropriate arms-length body to carry out a forensic audit of all tuck shops over the past ten years, including holding interviews with all relevant personnel?<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#AA03000","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":779,"content":"<p>I want to clarify something for the public record and for everybody watching.

I mentioned vehicles at the last meeting, and in his reply on 7 February, Mr. O'Driscoll indicated that all vehicles are accounted for and that all assets have been verified by local management as being on-site.  What if certain members of local management endorsed the absence, loan or alternative use of prison assets?  We are taking people at their word.  That is fine.  Please God, all of these people are people of the highest integrity.  However, ringing someone to ask whether he or she was speeding on a road and accepting his or her answer does not amount to an investigation.  It seems to me that there is a crisis of confidence among hard-working prison staff at all levels about being able to call out wrongdoing in the culture that currently exists.  What are we doing about it?  Why, if there is a robust system in place, are people coming forward in other ways to other people in various forums, including to Members of the Oireachtas and members of various committees, this one included?  Is all the information coming up in research vexatious, fantasies concocted by disgruntled staff with an axe to grind, or are some or all of these matters true?  Are we prepared to check?  Surely prudence demands that all matters are independently investigated.<\/p> <p>  I put it to Mr. O'Driscoll that, contrary to his claims against me, he has not tested the information I have put to him but, rather, has simply asked a question and accepted an answer, assuming therefore that an answer to my question was correct instead of carrying out an independent investigation in the interests of the taxpayer and of the health and safety and well-being and a healthy working environment and culture for prison staff?  Is the Department of Justice and Equality open to the recommendation I am making now, that is, the establishment of a GSOC-style inspectorate, separate from the Irish Prison Service headquarters in Longford, with statutory powers to provide prison staff with the support and protection they require, and the confidence to which they are entitled?  They should be above reproach and unable to be infected by any culture that may exist among a small number of staff at various levels.  The Department is only aware of information provided by headquarters in Longford, and is dependent on that information.  It appears from my research that the Longford headquarters is only aware of and only as good as the information provided to it by individual prisons.  It seems that some or all individual prisons operate as islands on a number of issues.  My research has led me to question the existence of a parallel investigative judicial and enforcement system across our prison services.  I hope those questions will be noted and answered.<\/p> <p>  I would appreciate it if the Chairman could provide for me, in writing, the Standing Order which allows for the validity or worth of my utterances to be adjudicated upon by other members of the committee.  I look forward to receiving that, and information on the Act that determines that.  I have been very careful.  I have taken legal advice and chosen my words very carefully today.  I have not identified anyone and I have focused on processes and procedures that are absolutely relevant to the expenditure of the State and Department of Justice and Equality.  I question the Chairman's competence to tell the Secretary General that he does not have to answer my questions and can, in effect, disregard the questions that I, in trying to use my time efficiently, have put to him.  I accepted this morning, in advance of this meeting, that he could answer the questions after this meeting in consultation with the experts involved in the Prison Service.  I would appreciate a written response to that from the Chairman, and I thank him for staying on.  We are missing votes as a result, but I believe these matters are of the utmost importance, and prudence demands they require investigation and actual testing, rather than the sort of testing we have seen in the past.<\/p> <p>  I thank all of the witnesses for coming here today, and continue to extend to the Secretary General every good wish in his new role.  I hope he will understand my questioning in the spirit in which it was intended.  I am only interested in protecting the taxpayers and ordinary prison officers in their place of work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019040400002#BB00400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1554364800,"counter":790,"content":"<p>To reiterate my position, as Chairman I respect the right of all members to speak openly and freely in this committee, as they are allowed to do in the Chamber.

T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;iste go bhfuil gceisteanna a thog&aacute;il tar &eacute;is mo r&aacute;iteas.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted to have the opportunity to be here.  Thank you, Chairman, for your invitation to the meeting this morning to talk about the peace process in Colombia.  In October 2015 I was appointed by the High Representative, Vice President Federica Mogherini, as the EU special envoy for the peace process in Colombia.  My role was to accompany the concluding stages of the peace negotiations between the Government of Colombia and FARC, which were then taking place in Havana, Cuba, and thereafter to accompany the implementation of the peace agreement on behalf of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, a peace agreement was concluded in August 2016 to end the 52 year long FARC conflict in which almost 250,000 people had been killed, 40,000 were still missing and 6 million people had been displaced from their homes.  The agreement was defeated in a national plebiscite on 2 October 2016 by a very small margin, 49.8% voted \"Yes\" and 50.2% voted \"No\".  It was then renegotiated and approved by the country's Parliament in December 2016, and all of that was subsequently upheld by the constitutional court following a number of court challenges.  Implementation of the agreement commenced on 1 January 2017.<\/p> <p>  The agreement, which took four years to negotiate, is very comprehensive.  It has more than 300 pages and is divided into six chapters which correspond to the six-point agenda of the peace talks themselves.  Chapter 6 concerns implementation and sets out the joint Government of Colombia-FARC bodies which were to be established and details the accompanying roles which were allocated to the international community.  The European Union was asked to assist with rural development, the re-incorporation of former combatants and support for a special investigations unit in the prosecutor&rsquo;s office.  Chapter 6 is being substantially implemented and, significantly, President Duque, following his inauguration last August, has appointed the relevant Ministers to the implementation bodies.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 3 deals with the end of conflict, including the laying down of arms by FARC and the re-incorporation of its members.  A tripartite mechanism headed by the UN and including the Colombian defence forces and FARC oversaw the disarmament process which was completed by mid-July 2017.  FARC reconstituted itself as a political party in September 2017 and contested its first elections in 2018.  The process of re-incorporation of former combatants is continuing, although progress has been slow.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 2 addresses political participation.  FARC was allocated five seats in both the Senate and the Congress for two electoral terms.  Two of the FARC Senators were unable, however, to take their seats but the other representatives are now playing an active role in both Houses.  A provision to provide 16 additional seats for areas of the country which had been badly affected by the conflict could not however be implemented because it marginally failed to secure the required parliamentary majority for its legislation.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 5 concerns victims and provides for a system of reparation and for the transitional justice system which is aimed at truth, reconciliation and accountability.  The transitional justice institutions, that is, the truth commission, the missing persons unit, the special jurisdiction for peace known as the JEP and the victims unit have been established and are functioning.  The JEP has begun hearings relating to kidnappings by FARC and large numbers of former state actors have also submitted to it, but the JEP itself has been subject to political criticism and the international community, including the European Union, has expressed strong support for its work and for its independence.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 4 deals with the illegal drugs trade.  At the centre of the agreement is a commitment to voluntary crop substitution.  So far, approximately 70,000 coca growers have signed up for the substitution programme but implementation has been slow for several reasons, including intimidation and attacks on social and local leaders who are promoting the programme.  Meanwhile, the size of the coca crop has grown.  Some estimates suggest that it is now three times as big as it was at the beginning of the decade.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 1 concerns integrated rural development.  This chapter has a 15-year time horizon for implementation.  The previous Santos Government had commenced a process of local development planning based on wide local consultation.  It is known as the PDETs.  It is hoped that the new Duque Government will take this process forward in the new national development plan.  The main purpose of the EU trust fund for Colombia is to support rural development, which will require significant resources and land reform.  As part of the EU's commitment to support the provision of infrastructure and marginalised areas of the country, the European Investment Bank has indicated its willingness to make up to &euro;400 million available in loan financing.<\/p> <p>  As we know from our own experience on this island, the implementation of a peace agreement can be even more difficult than its negotiation in the first place.  The Colombian peace process has faced several setbacks and continues to face challenges at many levels, but it is succeeding and it is being implemented.  There had been fears that the election of President Ivan Duque, the candidate of former President Uribe's Centro Democratico, which had led the opposition to the peace agreement in the plebiscite, would put the process at risk but President Duque has committed to implementing the agreement, albeit with some announced changes.  Since his election I have met with him on several occasions and both I and the EU delegation in Bogota have a good working relationship with his Government.<\/p> <p>  The main challenges to the peace process now are, first, no peace agreement has yet been made with the ELN.  Former President Santos had commenced peace talks with it in Quito and those were later moved to Havana.  The ELN declared a ceasefire in September 2017 to coincide with the visit of Pope Francis but it did not continue it after January 2018.  The ELN talks were somewhat on hold through the elections in 2018 and in the early months of the Duque Presidency, but they have now been ended following a large ELN bomb at a police academy in Bogota in January this year which killed 60 people.<\/p> <p>  Second, although the FARC conflict is over, violence continues in the territories.  Since the beginning of 2017 more than 300 social leaders and human rights defenders have been killed by armed gangs, many of them associated with the drugs trade and the illegal economies.<\/p> <p>  Third, the deteriorating situation in Venezuela presents a further risk to peace in Colombia.  So far, 1.5 million Venezuelans have moved across the border into Colombia.  Colombia has a 2,000 km border with Venezuela and is therefore very exposed to the humanitarian crisis in that country and to any instability which might arise from Venezuela.  To all of that must be added the pressures of inequality, social and regional, possible tensions from eradication of the coca crop and a more polarised political environment which can lead to possible social unrest.  The necessity therefore to consolidate and build on the progress made in the peace process is even greater.<\/p> <p>  The UN Security Council receives a report every three months from its mission in Colombia.  The international community is united in support of the Colombian peace process.  The European Union has increased its financial commitment and repeated its political support.  The Irish Government has been a strong and consistent supporter of the peace process and that support has been given added impetus recently through the opening for the first time of an Irish embassy in Bogota under the leadership of Ambassador Alison Milton and Colombia has opened an embassy in Dublin under Ambassador Patricia Cortes.<\/p> <p>  I thank the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for their continued support for my work, including the secondment of an Irish diplomat to the EU delegation in Bogota to work with me and also for being among the very first EU member states to join the EU trust fund.<\/p><p>For my part, I have recently been appointed EU Special Representative for Human Rights.  Mindful, however, of the need to maintain continued support for the Colombian peace process, especially at this time, the High Representative, Federica Mogherini, has asked me also to continue my work on the Colombian peace process until she can replace me in that role.  I will therefore travel to Bogota again next week to co-chair the human rights dialogue between the EU and Colombia and to provide an update on the EU&rsquo;s continuing support.  This is a complex process, and this short presentation can scarcely capture all aspects of it in detail.  I look forward, therefore, to responding to members&rsquo; questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019040400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Gilmore","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554368400,"counter":813,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gilmore for his very comprehensive and concise outline of the very complex situation in Colombia.

I see he will be able to continue his work on the Colombian aspect, which of course ties in with his new human rights role.  We know that human rights are a major issue in Colombia.  I was reminded that in 2012 a number of us Deputies and Senators signed a letter expressing our support for the peace process and a commitment to dialogue and compromise as being vital to ensure lasting peace while also acknowledging Cuba&rsquo;s role in the matter.<\/p> <p>  I recently read a report from Justice for Colombia.  It made the point that its worst fears about the new Government have not been realised.  Nevertheless, President Duque is going ahead with these six objections.  He says that this is constitutional and that it will not threaten the peace process.  I would like to hear Mr. Gilmore&rsquo;s view on this and the general feeling about these objections.  While they might be constitutional, are they in fact undermining the peace process?  There are concerns about the attempts to change the remit of the JEP, taking out investigation and prosecution of members of the security forces and their holding to account for the war crimes and the human rights violations.  There is a danger that this might not balance with the needs of the victims.  Again, are the international community and the EU being strong enough in supporting what was agreed in that peace process?  There is also the issue of new magistrates and that a process is now in place which could leave them more open to political influence.  I looked through the summary of the final agreement.  Obviously, land is central to the conflict, as I think it was in the first place.  We know what the Government is trying to do about land reform with these 16 special regions, but I do not think much progress is being made on that.  Is it a question of finance or political will that it is not coming about?<\/p> <p>  The situation regarding coca and crop substitution is very disturbing.  It is not being promoted and encouraged as it should be.  I have probably missed something, but what seems to be missing from all this is the attractiveness of Colombia to multinationals because of its resources.  While these multinationals are coming in, we know there will be displacement, we know that villages are being wiped out and we know that their civil society leaders, their local leaders, the indigenous tribes, are being displaced and that their lives are really under threat.  Is this featuring at all in the negotiations that are ongoing?  I refer to the area of rural reform.<\/p> <p>  My last point &ndash; I may come back in later &ndash; concerns political participation.  It was very disturbing to read that two members of the FARC who had seats in Parliament &ndash; Jes&uacute;s Santrich, who I think is still in prison, and Mr. M&aacute;rquez &ndash; are unable to take their seats.  Why is more not being done about this to ensure that what was agreed has been followed through on?  We know from the Good Friday Agreement that a sustaining, lasting peace with justice is very difficult.  As Mr. Gilmore said, it is one thing to sign the agreement; it is another thing to look at its implementation.  Many mistakes were made with the Good Friday Agreement, particularly regarding legacy, and we are seeing this now because it was not really addressed.  We see it with the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and we saw it with Bloody Sunday.  We could give a list of examples of issues remaining because legacy matters were not addressed.  I would like to hear Mr. Gilmore&rsquo;s views on this also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019040400002#C00300","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554368400,"counter":815,"content":"<p>Regarding my role, the High Representative&rsquo;s request was that I would continue with my work on Colombia while doing my work as Special Representative for Human Rights.  There is, as Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan said, an overlap in this regard.  As it happens, the human rights dialogue with Colombia is due around now.  We will have that formula on Monday morning.  The consultations with civil society are taking place today and tomorrow and we will have a report on that on Monday morning when I am there.  The new Government has committed to implementing the agreement and, as the Deputy said, Justice for Colombia has commented on that, which is very positive.  I travelled with President Duque on his invitation to one of the FARC reintegration or reincorporation areas, met with former combatants and saw President Duque address them and commit to implementing the terms of the agreement.  Regarding the six objections to which the Deputy referred, there is a law required to underpin the work of the transitional justice system of the JEP, the special jurisdiction that has been established.  This required the signature of the President, and he sent it back to the Congress with six proposed changes.  That is being considered by the Congress at present.  The Congress referred it to the constitutional court, which has sent it back to the Congress, saying the Congress must complete its work on it, and it has been given a deadline for that work.  That consideration is under way and, as in any parliamentary process, there is a lot of vigorous debate about the merits of the proposed changes, so we will have to see how that goes.  The President has said he will accept what the Congress decides, so it is now a matter for the Congress to address that.<\/p> <p>  The second issue relating to the JEP is whether or not it applies to former state actors.  A campaign is under way to have a separate process for state actors.  This issue is also being considered by the constitutional court and a decision is to be made.  In the meantime, as I said in my earlier statement, a very large number of former army officers and former police officers, something like 2,500 former members of the security services, have already submitted to the JEP, which is a very encouraging sign.<\/p> <p>  Land issues will take time, and there are issues relating to resources.  As I said, there is a 15-year time horizon for dealing with rural development.  It is not progressing very quickly, I must say, but it is an area where the European Union has been asked to provide accompaniment.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the coca situation, 70,000 have offered for voluntary substitution.  The Government says it is committed to paying the compensation to be paid to them, which is good.  The extent to which the voluntary crop substitution programme will progress after that remains to be seen.  I will make a general point, however.  The coca problem and the cocaine trade, in my view, cannot be solved purely at the supply end, and it is unreasonable and unrealistic of countries outside of Colombia to think it can be.  It must also be addressed from the demand side.  In the recent security discussions, the security dialogue between the EU and Colombia, we have discussed this issue and are doing some initial work on co-operation with Colombia as to how the demand side might also contribute to dealing with the coca situation.<\/p><p>On the issue of multinationals, the human rights challenges on the ground and the displacement of people in the various territories has more to do with the illegal economy than it has to do with the legal economy.  It has to do with the drugs trade and the battle that is going on for control of that trade, and also with illegal mining.  They are the biggest contributors to that.<\/p><p> I referred to two Senators not taking their seats.  Senator Jesus Santrich is in custody following an extradition request from the United States for an alleged offence that was committed.  It is alleged it was committed after the peace agreement started to be implemented.  The question as to whether that was the case or not is also being addressed by the JEP.  I understand that a decision on the case is due in the near future.  Ivan Marquez left Bogota and decided not to take up his seat in the Congress.<\/p><p> In response to the point about legacy issues, I think the Colombian peace agreement is better on legacy issues and on the needs of victims than the Good Friday Agreement.  Victims were made part of the negotiation process.  Representatives of victims were brought to the table and there is an entire chapter of the Colombian agreement on victims.  The Colombian agreement attempted to deal with the issue of victims in the main agreement and to deal with it upfront.  To some extent, in the case of the Northern Ireland agreement it was something left to be dealt with afterwards.  It remains to be seen how this will work out in practice but certainly from what I have seen of both agreements I think the Colombian approach was better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019040400002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Gilmore","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554368400,"counter":817,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Gilmore back to the Oireachtas.

Do they support the incumbent President Maduro or the aspirant President, Juan Guaido, and how does that impact the ongoing peace process?<\/p> <p>  I noted the reference in Mr. Gilmore's statement to the fact that production of the coca crop is now at an all-time high.  I think he referred to a ten-year high despite the fact that the peace process is now under way.  That is a major impediment.  Is the peace process failing?  Is it fair to say that the peace process is not dealing with the issue?  I accept what Mr. Gilmore has just said about the demand side.<\/p> <p>  Learning from our own peace process, namely, the Good Friday Agreement, and also the peace process in South Africa, there has been some debate in this country following on from the success of the truth and reconciliation commission in South Africa, is a similar process part of the peace process in Colombia?  I would welcome a comment from Mr. Gilmore in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We are all struck by the scale of the process and the considerable undertaking involved.  The population in Colombia has grown by almost 8 million people in a ten-year period.  It is a big country and a big economy.  I am mindful of the fact that Mr. Gilmore is in and out of the country and he is working with the Government.  In his view, how strong, open and transparent is the current democratic system in Colombia in terms of dealing with the scale of the problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019040400002#D00200","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554368400,"counter":818,"content":"<p>It is well known publicly that the President Duque and his Government do not support Mr. Maduro and have identified with Mr. Guaido and expressed support for him.  The Venezuelan situation has a big impact on Colombia at a number of levels.  The first is the significant numbers of migrants from Venezuela into Colombia.  It is estimated that some 3 million Venezuelans have left Venezuela and approximately half of those have gone into Colombia.  To put that in perspective, that is more than the total number of migrants who came into Europe at the height of what was referred to us the migration crisis for Europe.<\/p> <p>  The humanitarian situation in Venezuela is of concern.  There are shortages of food and medicines and there are energy problems.  That has an impact on Colombia because of the extent of its border with its neighbour.  The situation in Venezuela is now a major priority for the Colombian Government.<\/p> <p>  I do not agree that the peace process is failing.  The peace process is succeeding.  I accept there are problems with it.  There are problems with the implementation of any peace agreement.  It is more than 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement here and there are still implementation problems.<\/p> <p>  There was some speculation at the time of the peace agreement that the increase in the coca crop was related to an expectation that there would be compensation as part of the peace agreement.  I do not think that explains the extent of the growth of the coca crop.  What explains the growth of the coca crop is largely increased demand and that increased demand is largely coming from North America and from Europe, but also there is increased demand now in South America, including in Colombia itself.<\/p> <p>  The truth and reconciliation provisions both in relation to the peace agreements in Northern Ireland and South Africa are very strong.  A truth commission was established so that people who committed crimes and atrocities during the conflict would go there and tell the truth, and in particular give information to families about what happened to their family members.  Many people are still missing and people want to know the truth about what happened at different points.  That approach is working.<\/p> <p>  There is also the jurisdiction for peace.  The fundamental idea behind it is that under the jurisdiction for peace if somebody who has committed a crime during the conflict goes before the jurisdiction for peace and tells the truth, he or she can be sentenced to deprivation of liberty but not in a conventional prison, it is more in a community setting.  The sentences can be quite long, for example eight years or up to 12 years in some instances.  If they do not go before the jurisdiction for peace they are then liable to be prosecuted in the normal way by the judicial system and incur the prison sentences that are associated with that.<\/p> <p>  In response to how strong and transparent Colombian democracy is, one of the things that we need to remember about Colombia is that it is one of the oldest democracies in the world.  We are celebrating our 100th anniversary of independence and the establishment of the State.  They are celebrating 200 years of almost continuous democracy since 1819.  There was a four-year interruption in the mid 1950s but democracy was restored.  They are very proud of their democracy.  The system is based on a government, an executive president, Congress and the separation of powers.  They take great pride in it and it is a strong democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019040400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Gilmore"},{"type":"speech","time":1554368400,"counter":819,"content":"<p>Mr. Gilmore is very welcome.  I thank him for the worthwhile and valuable presentation.  It is good to hear the update and presented in such a concise manner.  I congratulate him also on his recent appointment, which I was delighted to see, and on the most important work he has done within Colombia on the peace process on behalf of the EU.  We are all conscious that this is a highly complex process given the scale of the country and the scale of the issues faced.  I was struck by the numbers he quoted to us in terms of 250,000 people killed, and 6 million people displaced.  In that context we can clearly only touch on aspects but it is very useful to get an update.<\/p><p>Will Mr. Gilmore develop the topic of the discussion thus far in respect of the challenges to the peace process?  Will he speak a little more about some of those challenges?  He mentioned the situation in Venezuela, which is clearly having a very destabilising effect.  I spoke recently to friends who have just come back from Colombia and who said the situation in Venezuela is very visibly impacting the economy and society in Colombia.  Clearly, the numbers of refugees coming into Colombia from Venezuela is a huge issue.  How does Mr. Gilmore see this working out?  There does not seem to be any sign of improvement there.  That is my first point.<\/p><p> My second point relates to the issues Deputies Niall Collins and Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan touched on, that is, the growth in the coca crop.  The first thing I had wondered when reading about this is where the proceeds are going.  This was always an issue when it came to support of the FARC but, presumably, the proceeds are now going into organised crime more specifically and less into paramilitary activity.  Perhaps Mr. Gilmore could develop this point.  I am interested to hear his comments about demand.  I absolutely agree with him that this issue cannot be tackled within the borders of Colombia alone.  That is true of all issues surrounding drugs.  How does one go about tackling demand?  Clearly, there have been huge changes in drugs policy in North America, particularly in respect of cannabis.  Is something similar required on coca and cocaine?  Is that where we might see some resolution of this issue?  Allied to that, Mr. Gilmore&rsquo;s presentation referred very strongly to the work of the EU and of the UN, but where is the US in all this not only as the biggest market for illegal coca, the product of the trade, but also as a huge player in the region?  What impact does Trump and Trump&rsquo;s policy have on the peace process?  Can Mr. Gilmore say anything about this?  He mentioned another challenge being the lack of a ceasefire from the ELN and the recent dreadful bomb in January of this year.  Is there any hope for progress on this?<\/p><p> I refer to the more general context and the political buy-in for the peace process.  Clearly, as Mr. Gilmore said, there is a more polarised political environment, which itself presents a challenge.  Where is the big political sticking point in Colombia?  Again, this is hard to see from the outside.  Is it because, as Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan said, the treatment of victims has been a strength of the process?  From reading about the process, I understand there are very robust institutions that are built into the agreement.  What is the big political objection?  I know that Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan has highlighted some of the issues that have been raised, but given that the EU and the UN have been so strongly adhering to the process, and given the amount of buy-in there has been from the outside, what is the sticking point internally and how is it best addressed?<\/p><p> I imagine it is hard for Mr. Gilmore to see beyond what he has been doing in Colombia, but can he say what the priorities of his new role are?  This is perhaps a little beyond our scope today but, as a foreign affairs committee, we will presumably be looking forward to engaging with Mr. Gilmore in his new EU role.  Can he say at this point what he sees as the key priorities in such a difficult political environment within the EU currently?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019040400002#D00400","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554368400,"counter":821,"content":"<p>Clearly, as I said earlier, the situation in Venezuela is having an impact.  I do not have a role in respect of Venezuela but I can say to the Senator that the European Union has established an international contact group with a number of Latin American countries which is working to try to achieve a political solution to the situation in Venezuela.<\/p> <p>  The difficulties are in the detail.  The JEP, the transitional justice system, is working and is independent.  Its independence has been challenged politically.  There has been a lot of political comment about the JEP, but I have met the president of the JEP, Patricia Linares, a number of times.  She has done a fantastic job and her people are doing a fantastic job, but they are being subjected to a lot of political criticism.  This is part of the political narrative in the country, but they are continuing to work.  There are difficulties.  Senator Bacik asked where the sticking points are.  The implementation of the agreement requires a lot of resources, so one issue is resources.  The land reform will require restitution or reparation for victims, which requires a lot of resourcing.  I refer to the institutions, the operation of the JEP and the transitional justice system.  The JEP has 800 staff.  It requires a lot of resources and is now seeking to operate regionally, so there are big resourcing issues.<\/p> <p>  Senator Bacik also asked me about my new role.  I would be happy to talk with the committee at some stage again about this.  I am very honoured to have been appointed as the Special Representative for Human Rights.  It is a very challenging time for human rights internationally.  Civil society space is being shrunk in many countries and there is a rise in authoritarianism.  There have been many attempts even to redefine the concept of human rights on the part of some in the international community and, unfortunately, a withdrawal by some from human rights institutions.  I am quite happy to come back to the committee at some stage if it wishes and talk about this.  My role is in human rights in the external  and foreign policy of the European Union.  I do not have a role in respect of human rights internally in the Union.  Obviously, however, I must be mindful of the human rights situation internally in the promotion of the human rights values and policy of the European Union in its external action and foreign policy work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019040400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Gilmore"},{"type":"speech","time":1554368400,"counter":822,"content":"<p>Mr. Gilmore mentioned civil society.  My question is about his experience of civil society within Colombia, particularly the civil society of the indigenous communities.  Does he have much engagement with them?  It was good to hear what he said about learning from the Colombian peace agreement in terms of legacy matters and Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gilmore mentioned illegal mining, but we know there is legal mining going on and that it is creating problems not only because of displacement, but also particularly regarding workers&rsquo; rights, wages and conditions, etc.  I think there is a fear that this is getting lost because the big picture is the peace agreement, yet this is going on within Colombia at the same time.  We have only recently got our own business and human rights policy here, with a committee set up under a chairperson.<\/p><p>It is something that I had been pursuing for a while and looking at trade agreements.  There is an example in more recent ones about binding conditions for workers.  Would that come into Mr. Gilmore's new role?  I know there is the possibility of a binding treaty that the UN is working on.  We talk about human rights, but within that there also have to be workers&rsquo; rights.  It is part of the human rights picture.  I do not know that it should be separate.<\/p><p> My last question is about extradition.  Mr. Santrich is in jail a year in April.  I understand also that he is blind.  I was reading a speech that President Duque made about extradition, and it certainly was alarming in terms of a request for extradition being received and us not really going into the details of it.  There is the possibility of abuse within that system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019040400002#E00300","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554368400,"counter":824,"content":"<p>The issues that Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan raises will be very much part of my agenda on Monday when I co-chair the EU-Colombia human rights dialogue.  As part of my visits to Colombia, I regularly meet civil society organisations, including indigenous people, Afro-Colombians, trade unions, churches, and broad spectrum human rights bodies.  I do that as part of my work on Colombia.  Specifically relating to the human rights dialogue next week, my colleagues in the European Union delegation and from the External Action Service will be conducting consultations today and tomorrow with civil society organisations in advance of the human rights dialogue on Monday.  On Monday morning, before the commencement of the formal human rights dialogue, I will meet the representatives of civil society organisations to hear directly from them the issues they wish the dialogue to address.  The dialogue will address issues such as the Deputy raised, including the human rights and labour rights provisions in the trade agreement between the EU and Colombia.  That would be very much on our agenda.  That is part of the overlap.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the extradition of Mr. Santrich, that issue is being considered by the JEP.  While there are a number of issues being considered, the central issue, as I understand it, that is being considered is about when the alleged offence was committed, and they are addressing that at the moment.  I do not want to comment on the case because it is before what is essentially a court and we have to respect the independence of it.  There were concerns, however, about the conditions in which Mr. Santrich was being held and he went on hunger strike for a time.  I visited him in detention during that hunger strike period and talked to him.  I am very pleased that he subsequently ended the hunger strike, not because of my discussion with him, because I know others had discussions with him as well, but I think this has enabled the JEP to consider his case.  My understanding is that a decision on it is imminent.  It is like any court in that we must wait for its judgment.

First, part of the agreement was that there would be a commitment by FARC to discontinue its involvement in the drugs trade, and second, it said that it would co-operate with the Government in bringing an end to the illegal drugs trade.  Separately, FARC agreed that, insofar as it had proceeds, an inventory would be done of what assets it had accumulated and that those assets would be used in the reparation of victims.  That would become part of the pool to be used for the reparation of victims.<\/p> <p>  The proceeds of the illegal drugs trade are going into criminal hands.  The Government of Colombia has a very robust policy to try to end the drugs trade.  The difficulty is with the growing end because it is a case of who is growing the crop.  The people who are growing the crop are in the main small landowners and small farmers for whom this is a profitable crop.  There is a degree of what might be called peer pressure at one level but also raw intimidation from those who are controlling the drugs trade, which makes the shift to substitution very difficult.<\/p> <p>  One approach that is being advocated is the forced eradication of the crop.  The difficulty with that is that very often it puts the security services of the state into conflict and into very difficult situations with local communities, giving rise to social unrest.  For example, there was an incident in Tumaco on the Pacific coast a little over a year ago where unarmed people who had been protesting were killed.  That is very difficult and it is difficult to see how the drugs problem can be solved solely at the level of those who are growing the crop.<\/p> <p>  President Santos used to talk about the necessity for a wider international approach.  I believe there is a shared responsibility, certainly in countries, communities and environments where there is a big market for cocaine.  It is something we have to talk about because there is a direct link between the consumption of cocaine and people getting killed in remote areas of Colombia and other countries.  Colombia is one of the biggest producers of cocaine and there is a direct link.  There are people being killed because they are in favour of crop substitution and they are being intimidated.  Many of the social leaders who have been targeted are people who have been trying to give leadership in local community situations where there is very little presence of the state, who have been trying to organise crop substitution, and who have been intimidated or worse.  That is what is happening on the ground, and since the commencement of the implementation of the peace agreement, more than 300 social and local community leaders and human rights defenders have been killed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019040400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Gilmore"},{"type":"speech","time":1554368400,"counter":827,"content":"<p>Is the answer then to move towards a different policy in the market countries such as the US, in Europe and Ireland, where there is a market for cocaine?

Mr. Noel Anderson of the Licensed Vintners Association is in the Gallery.<\/p> <p>  Since we last presented to the committee in May 2018, the situation for our members had worsened considerably.  In particular, small businesses are now closing on a weekly basis and members right across the spectrum are reporting savage increases in liability insurance renewals.  My colleagues will give members evidence in this respect.  The crisis is spreading to a broader range of SME sectors, as illustrated by our more recent members, including Nursing Homes Ireland, the Irish Travel Agents Association, the Association of Irish Showmen's Guild which represents circuses and fairs around the country, and Retail Excellence.  The crisis is existential in many of those sectors.  Businesses across the leisure, childcare and hospitality areas are threatened and one could add many community, charity, sporting and arts organisations to the list.  There is increasing alarm among members regarding the slow pace of key reforms and it is clear to us that the dead hand of vested interests and a lack of sufficient political will are grinding the response to the crisis to a halt.<\/p> <p>  My colleagues will gladly share their specific experiences with members but right now I intend to cut to the chase and focus on analysis and solutions.  When we last presented to the committee we submitted ten asks, practical measures that would help reform this dysfunctional area quickly.  We further communicated these asks to the cost of insurance working group, CIWG, and to the Ministers involved.  While we acknowledge the amendment of section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which now obliges claimants to inform defendants of a potential claim within one month, progress on other key reforms remains frustratingly slow.  It is illuminating to note in this regard that when a similar crisis arose in 2002, the major reforms were in place within two and a half years.  Following on the publication of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report in April 2002 the two key responses, namely, the establishment of the PIAB and the commencement of the Civil Liability and Courts Act, were implemented by July 2004 and September 2004, respectively.  By contrast, the cost of insurance working group report was published in January 2017 but, over two years later, the key reforms remain uncompleted.  Indeed, of the 68 recommendations made in this committee's report on the rising cost of motor insurance from November 2016, our analysis suggests that only 17 have been actioned.  Of the CIWG recommendations, ongoing delays in the establishment of a long promised Garda insurance fraud unit and the recalibration of the book of quantum are prolonging and amplifying the crisis.<\/p> <p>  On the CIWG recommendations, I will start with the recommendation to establish a Garda insurance fraud unit.  Insurance fraud is a crime with profound consequences up to and including the loss of livelihood and valuable public facilities.  Additionally, it criminalises the very process of making a personal injury claim, tarnishing all claimants with the same brush and deterring genuine claimants from seeking redress.<\/p><p>An oft-repeated quote from a member of the public at an alliance meeting last year is as follows.<\/p><blockquote>If I had a need for big money and I had a choice between robbing a bank and faking an injury, I'd pick the fake injury every day.  More money and no consequences if I'm found out.<\/blockquote><p>It is absolutely clear from the experience of our members that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not currently equipped to deal with this issue.  A specialised unit to deal with insurance fraud has been a key element of the cost of insurance working group strategy since the start and a key recommendation of the Personal Injuries Commission.  We are bewildered by how long it has taken to establish the same unit, with issues such as political support, a year-long Insurance Ireland cost-benefit analysis and sources of funding wheeled out to justify the delays.  It must be established without further delay if the scourge of fraudulent and exaggerated claims is to be meaningfully addressed.  Incidentally, on this point, I welcome the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 yesterday evening that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is investigating some medical practitioners and legal firms in this regard.  However, these are one-off investigations and do not constitute a full strategic response to the issue.<br\/><br\/>I refer to recalibration of the book of quantum.  As documented in the Personal Injuries Commission reports, the general damages awarded for minor injuries in Ireland bear no relation to those made in other countries, which makes Ireland a very attractive place to sustain a minor injury.  This applies not just to whiplash injuries, as covered in detail in the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC, reports, but also to all minor, fully recovered soft tissue injuries.  Additionally, there is no consistency between awards for identical injuries between the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the courts, or from judge to judge, which makes it very attractive in personal injury cases to reject a Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, offer and head for the courts, safe in the knowledge that with the right judge, the rewards from the court or by direct settlement with the insurer may be substantially better.<br\/><br\/>It is now abundantly clear that the book of quantum and the current process of its drafting are no longer fit for purpose.  However, there has been much debate in recent months about the best approach to address this.  We are fearful that the net result of all this debate will be no action and no change, a situation forced by vested interests making hundreds of millions in income from the <i>status quo<\/i>.  This will have catastrophic results for our members as they cannot sustain current premium levels, never mind the additional increases in insurance premiums that may arise if quantum for minor injuries is not addressed.  What makes the delay in doing so all the more frustrating is that awards are already capped in this country at the top end of the scale by the Court of Appeal in Nolan <i>v<\/i>. Wirenski, which has also clarified the principle of proportionality in Shannon <i>v<\/i>. O'Sullivan.  The framework and principles for a recalibration are, therefore, already in place.  We ask that the book of quantum is calibrated to reflect international norms and norms already established by the Court of Appeal as a matter of urgency.  On this point, we welcome the passage of Committee Stage of the Judicial Council Bill in the Seanad on Tuesday night.  However, as it has taken more than a year to get to this stage, we fear that without political will, the Bill will die a slow death.<br\/><br\/>I refer to a schedule of forecast reductions.  If anything, the situation regarding transparency in this systemically important industry has worsened since we last presented to the committee.  As well as the blue book, which gave comprehensive data oversight of the insurance industry, we have learned that the Central Bank has abandoned publication of the comprehensive data on policyholder demographics and cost trends provided by the private motor insurance statistics report.  For example, analysing trends in insurance costs for young drivers is no longer possible.  This approach to the reports, which offered key consumer protection insights, can only be described as data vandalism.  Data from the national claims information database for the years 2009 to 2018 are due from the Central Bank in the second half of this year.  Initially, it is expected that the data regarding motor insurance will be very limited.  However, neither the national claims information database nor the Central Statistics Office, CSO, has any concrete plans to issue any data on liability insurance costs.  Reports on possible plans from both are due by the end of 2019.  In this data vacuum both Ms Murray and Mr. Monks are willing to share definitive data on their sectors.  From a broader perspective, policyholders cannot plan or be protected if there is no data to measure what is happening or what can be expected to happen.  We ask, therefore, that the Department of Finance produce a schedule of forecast reductions for reforms using the 2002 Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, schedule as a model, which I have attached in appendix 3 to my written submission.  It is abundantly clear to us at this stage that lawyers and insurance companies will do anything to stop real reform, working tirelessly to slow reforms and blaming each other to deflect from their own responsibilities.  This is why it is imperative that political will drives this agenda.  Otherwise, we will be here again in a year's time providing a similar update.<br\/><br\/>This concludes our formal presentation.  As an alliance, we are intensely aware of how urgent this issue is for our members and their employees and volunteers.  We hope the committee can help us in getting meaningful action quickly and we are happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Boland.

Our cost of insurance continues to rise.  ISME's latest cost of insurance survey results for quarter 4 of 2018 are shown in the first appendix to our paper.  The results show that 81% of members report increased public liability insurance.  Recent statements about moderating insurance costs refer to private motor insurance only.  No one has reliable statistics on liability or other commercial insurances as the CSO does not measure them.  The continued rise in insurance costs is the outcome of a failure to make meaningful change in three areas: reducing quantum, to which there is no constitutional impediment; reforming our legal system; and reforming the insurance system itself.  The issue goes far beyond the simple cost of insurance to SMEs, although this issue is already causing many businesses to fail.  The issue of the cost of insurance is now hollowing out Irish society, restricting the conduct of sport, play and charitable activity, attracting criminal activity and encouraging the advancement of manufactured grievances.  It is harming the physical and moral health of citizens.  We are getting to the point where suing someone for the most minor of inconveniences is now socially acceptable across all educational and class strata.<\/p> <p>  While there has been a large amount of activity by the cost of insurance working group, it has not addressed the core issues, which we address in our presentation.  The cost of insurance working group has committed the cardinal sin of confusing performance, by which we mean doing lots of things, with effectiveness, which is doing the right things.  What we are left with is a veneer of progress and the complete absence of material reform.  What we need is quantum to be reduced; the legal profession to engage honestly with a reform process; moral hazard for plaintiffs in our courts; a perjury statute and an amended Defamation Act; a just, answerable Judiciary committed to continuous professional development; meaningful action on the detection and punishment of fraudulent claims; and transparent, granular data on a well-regulated insurance industry.<\/p> <p>  While it would be easy in these circumstances to call for the head of the responsible Minister of State, we believe this would achieve nothing other than political theatre.  We need a Cabinet Minister to take over the lead on this issue personally, and the nature of the reforms required suggests that this should be the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We appreciate that the committee has pressing issues such as Brexit and housing to attend to but we have suffered a lost decade on this issue.  People are losing their jobs and businesses now because of legislative inaction.  Members alone are the people who can fix this, and we ask them to do so now.<\/p> <p>  I am accompanied by our former chair, who will be able to give the committee real-world examples and figures brought to his attention by members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":854,"content":"<p>As Mr. McDonnell said, I am a former chair of ISME, a position I held in the period from 2015 until 2017.  Knowing what we know, liability insurance began to ramp up from 2014-15, so I had many people approaching me at that time.  I will share with the committee a couple of stories to illustrate this.  The first story is illustrated on page 10 of our written submission and concerns an ISME member in the south west, a medium-sized manufacturer with a substantial multi-risk policy in six figures.  The policy was with what I would call a multinational enterprise, MNE, a broker or an international brokerage firm.  The policy was underwritten, so broker A was underwritten by underwriter B, both of which were multinationals.<\/p><p>At recent renewal, the member received off the record advice that underwriter B had paid broker A and a number of other major brokers a substantial commission to direct all their clients to underwriter B.  Broker A would shortly advise the ISME member that the only underwriter who would accept his business for 2018 would be underwriter B and a 30% increase would apply.  There would then be only one underwriter bidding for the business at a 30% premium.  However, if the ISME member approached broker C, he could renew the book with underwriter B for the same price as before.  Broker A duly quoted the premium plus 30% a few days later and the ISME member severed his relationship with broker A.  The ISME member will not identify himself or the broker underwriter for fear of commercial retribution.  I do not need to explain the implications of this to anybody here as they should be clear.<\/p><p> The second story is also in the submission.  An ISME member in the east has tracked a policy for six years with respect to premiums, claims, losses, etc.  The underwriter has made a surplus of &euro;430,000 over these six years before reinsurance costs and overheads.  This surplus of &euro;430,000 represents an effective gross profit of 91%.  The ISME member has had four claims over this six-year period, with a total value of &euro;45,000.  The premium income is &euro;430,000 while the claim total over six years has been &euro;45,000.  I would love to see how the risk was priced over the six years as it effectively amounted to price gouging.  Again, the ISME member will not identify himself for fear of commercial retribution.  When there is only one underwriter bidding for the business, if the bidding party withdraws, the company will be left uninsured.<\/p><p> All brokers should be obliged to provide a five-year claims history at renewal.  The insurance industry would say this adds to cost and it cannot be done but it is done anyway.  The information must be produced for an actuary to be able to price the risk.  Somebody may say this cannot be produced but it is already produced and there is no cost.  At least with this approach, the client would be in a position to make a business decision by seeing the premiums and claims over a five-year period and deciding if it is an acceptable level of risk and price.<\/p><p> These are just two stories about members of the organisation but there are many others.  The common thread seems to be that there is only one underwriter bidding for the business.  Is that by accident or design?  I do not know.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Coghlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":856,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests from ISME and the Alliance for Insurance Reform.

I run Huckleberry's Den in Navan, County Meath, and I also represent 60 businesses which have all come together to form an organisation called Play Activity and Leisure Ireland, PALI.  We had to form that organisation with a common goal to lobby for fair insurance for our members.  We are all in the leisure sector and we include play centres, trampoline parks, pet farms, bowling alleys, karting tracks and basically facilities where families can have fun.  It is something that Ireland definitely does not want to lose.<\/p> <p>  We cannot get fair insurance and in many cases we cannot get any insurance.  Our premiums have risen by between 379% and more than 500% in the past five years.  My insurance has risen by 1,040% in the past six years.  Incredibly, our premiums far outweigh our claims.  As an organisation, we have paid &euro;5 million over the past five years in premiums.  We have had claims and reserves of just over &euro;1 million.  In the past five years, only &euro;200,000 of that &euro;5 million has been paid in claims in our sector.

The reserve on this is &euro;23,000, despite the child not suffering any injury.  This is the only reason I cannot get insurance.<\/p> <p>  I have the only play centre in Navan and the other play centre closed six weeks ago.

I really do not want to close in 25 days.  My own case is horrific but it is not unusual.  Centres across the length and breadth of the country are being told they are lucky to even get insurance.

That we cannot beggars belief.  It is trickling into other industries.

I asked whether it was not included in the membership fee and he said this is the first year in which insurance money has to be collected and that his business is down to its last insurer.  He said the business now has to charge everyone coming in for insurance.  If this is occurring in gymnastics organisations, what about other organisations?  Soccer clubs are ringing me asking whether they can join in with me.  What kind of society are we showing our children if we cannot even send them out to play a bit of hurling or football or do gymnastics without worrying whether the organisers will go out of business because of insurance costs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Linda Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":867,"content":"<p>All this brings home the point that insurance is now centre stage in sporting, business and civic life, and part of our cultural identity as a people.

If the Bill becomes law and we get guidelines, will it change the direction in which we are currently going in terms of awards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#F00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":868,"content":"<p>The play centres, and Ms Murray in particular, have been incredibly brave in going public on this because it is very upsetting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":869,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#F00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":870,"content":"<p>It is a very vulnerable time for those concerned.  As I emphasised in the report, there is fear of alienating the only broker or underwriter now available or of bringing additional claims, reflecting poorly on oneself, personally or from a business point of view.  I can guarantee members that behind the play centres is a queue of sectors that are very close to being in the same circumstances.  I could list festivals, convenience stores, leisure centres, the entire adventure tourism industry, circuses and street artists.  Nightlife in Ireland is being severely affected by this issue.  Charitable groups are also affected.<\/p> <p>  On the point about the roadmap, it is abundantly clear that there has been enough analysis.  There have been two exceptional reports, namely the cost of insurance working group report and the Personal Injuries Commission report.  Both were kick-started by the report this committee produced at the end of 2016.  That is enough analysis at this stage.  We are well aware of what needs to be done.  The problem we have concerns the pace of the action and the apparent lack of political reform.  When there was a similar crisis in 2002&ndash;2003, there seemed to be political will to get work done.  The establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board involved incredibly complex work but it was done in less than two years.  The Judicial Council Bill was introduced to the Oireachtas in 2017 and it is still slowly working its way through the Seanad, from where it must proceed to the D&aacute;il.  That suggests to us that the political will does not exist to resolve this.  We find this extraordinary in the sense that this issue is solvable and the pathway exists.  The Government and Oireachtas have many issues that are very difficult to resolve, including housing, healthcare, Brexit and all the other issues that are major distractions, but the issue of insurance is solvable.  The pathway exists but the bit that is missing comprises the momentum and political will to get it sorted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":871,"content":"<p>Does the Judicial Council Bill represent the right direction?

The Deputy is absolutely right to point that out.  We have already seen in the latest update on the report of the cost of insurance working group that there is not going to be a database.  We have said that in view of Mr. Nicholas Kearns' final report, it is absolutely clear that there needs to be a claim-by-claim database.  We have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Darcy, to reconsider the decision because we believe it is wrong.<br\/><br\/>It is a greater cause of anger if one believes that a claim is fraudulent but the final outcome actually does not matter.  The only difference is that one is getting sued by someone who knows they do not have an injury but one is still going to pay regardless of whether the claim is legitimate.  The reason we have made quantum the number one concern relates to Mr. Kearns' point in his summation.  Like Hansel and Gretel, Mr. Kearns did a fantastic job dropping the breadcrumbs for Members of the Oireachtas to follow in terms of required outcomes.  He stated that the quantum is unjustifiably and inexplicably large and that it is leading to all sorts of other consequences.  It is resulting in higher premiums but it is also attracting criminality.  Mr. Kearns is saying that we do not have any mechanism to deal with this.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is saying that he cannot tell the Garda what to do.  We have suggested this is a particular area of white-collar crime in which there is no enforcement whatsoever, and that the courts do not enforce anything against those concerned.  To an extent, it does not matter whether an organisation such as a play centre operator is getting sued by a fraudulent claimant or a legitimate claimant; since there is &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 of quantum, there will be somebody there.  We have described it as a honey pot that is attracting all these people in.  The level just has to be reduced.<br\/><br\/>Collectively, Members of the Oireachtas have been informed that there is a problem with capping damages.  The very first recommendation Mr. Kearns made in his Personal Injuries Commission report, which went back to the Department, involved capping damages by means of legislation.  We have shown, in documentation sourced through freedom of information provisions by Mark Tighe in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>, that it was immediately nobbled by the lawyers and taken out.  Mr. Kearns very clearly left the same recommendation in.  He has just said he believes the judicial council is the way to go or the way to achieve the same thing.  There is a possibility that a judicial council could sit down and decide to maintain damages at the same level, or 60% or 70% thereof.  That would not be a solution.  In our view, this is a public policy matter, not a matter for court procedure or judges.  Respectfully, we suggest it is the members' job to cap damages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I commend Ms Murray and the other business owners who have spoken out.

I have been in the leisure sector for 11 years.  It has never even been brought up.  In the past, one went to one's broker and was told that leisure centres do not get insurance in Ireland, so I have always sourced my insurance across the water.  The insurance company in the UK told me that Ireland is seen as a loss-making nation when it comes to insurance and that the cost of claims is far higher than is the case in the UK.  It stated that it has no interest in insuring play centres in Ireland, particularly those with a claim or two against them.  The premiums of centres without claims against them are increasing by 100% or 200% to cope with any potential claims on the business.  I have noticed what seems to be a cycle, with insurance companies from the UK coming in every three or four years and then leaving.  We have never had a range of insurance companies from which to choose.  The companies see us as loss-making.  However, the figures for our group show that we are not loss-making.  I have been told that the insurance companies are afraid of what could happen, given the type of awards that are made.<\/p> <p>  When I began looking into this matter a few months ago, I thought the biggest reason for the difficulty sourcing insurance was claims and that our insurance premiums probably matched or came near to the level of claims.  When I discovered that there is a significant disparity between the two, I asked why we cannot get insurance if there is so much money to be made on us as an industry.  I was told it is because of the fear of what can happen as a result of the type of awards that are made.  It is the fear of claims for broken bones, such as a broken arm or finger.  It is not catastrophic injuries, it is the fear of claims for broken bones.  Most of the injuries suffered on our premises are soft tissue injuries such as bruises or a split lip.  Those are the injuries for which &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000 is being awarded; it is not, in many cases, injuries such as a broken arm.  The insurance companies are afraid that eight companies within the group scheme being sued for broken arms could result in &euro;200,000 or &euro;250,000 of payouts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Linda Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":880,"content":"<p>Ms Murray gave figures in regard to the level of payouts over the past five years, where &euro;5 million has been paid in and &euro;1 million has been paid out or reserved, which shows that there is significant profitability in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#G00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":881,"content":"<p>That is 100% the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Linda Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":882,"content":"<p>The level of payouts and awards has not dramatically increased over the past five years.

However, as a sector, we do not have a huge number of such claims and there does not seem to have been a significant increase in them, yet our premiums are increasing by 300% and some centres cannot get insurance.  There is no transparency in how this is calculated.  When my insurance premium increased from &euro;8,000 to &euro;16,000, I asked what was the reason for the increase.  The broker told me that was just the way it was.  I had no claims in that year, but my premium increased from &euro;8,000 to &euro;16,500.  When one questions the increase, one is told that there is one underwriter offering insurance and it is the only option.

One pays it over the year and prays that one will not have a claim during that time.

There is a real and sharp impact on businesses and jobs and the resulting issue of employees who have lost their jobs being able to keep a roof over their heads.  In a situation where that type of monopoly exists or the State does not provide insurance to a certain sector, has the alliance engaged with Insurance Ireland and has Insurance Ireland given a legitimate reason for not addressing the matter?  If somebody does not get motor insurance from a company, Insurance Ireland has a scheme whereby somebody who has been refused a quote for motor insurance will be provided with a quote.

Our perspective on this is evolving because we did not start as an alliance that could analyse this crisis in detail.  We started and remained an alliance that represents members regarding the crisis they are experiencing.  We have engaged and developed a much broader perspective in the past while.  I go back to one of the Deputy's original comments on this.  Historically, we have had very high levels of awards and claims in this country.  These are serious issues that have fed into this crisis and need to be addressed.  Arising from our engagement with the insurance industry, we have not received any data that would justify the spike in premiums we have seen in recent years.  I am conscious that this is the finance committee and that we are representing businesses.  While we have data on motor insurance, we do not have any data to explain what is happening.  I will ask Mr. Gerry Monks to give an insight from the perspective of family grocery stores.  From January 2014 to December 2016, we saw a 70% spike in motor insurance premiums.  We did not see a spike in claims or awards that would justify that increase.  There is no clarity in this area.  As Ms Murray stated, insurers are again recording very healthy profits across the sector.  We do not have clarity on this either but our understanding is that management fees transferred back to parent companies remain an issue.  As we do not have a blue book, we cannot prove that.  The extent to which insurance companies reserve for potential losses has increased dramatically in recent years, prompted by the Central Bank.  Again, our understanding is that the companies are over-reserving at this stage, which means these reserves are ploughed back into profitability.   We are faced on one side with an interest group, the lawyers, that has historically done very well out of this sector and, on the other side, insurers, which over any ten-year period always make a profit.  We are the jam in the middle.  We have not got clear answers and we do not have the data to explain the position, which is certainly part of the problem.  I will let Mr. Monks introduce himself.  He has put together some data on another sector to show that this is not a very specific issue for one sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":891,"content":"<p>I am account director with JDM Insurance Services.  I have been looking after retailers - typically shops and convenience stores - across the country for more than 20 years in my 43-year career in insurance.  These are commercial businesses but they are also families.  When I looked at an analysis of the level of increase for the purposes of this exercise, I deliberately wanted to make sure I was not picking out cases with claims so I whittled it down to a certain number.  I came up with a figure of 73% over a five-year period for the average increase applied to these businesses.  Of the 29 selected cases, 15 were claim-free.  I took out extraordinary figures to try to make it read realistically.  Insurance in Ireland is broken.  The very simple fact is we seem to somehow tolerate levels of payment for minor injuries and all other classes of injury that are multiples of those in other countries such as our nearest neighbour.  The UK has a population that is more than ten times the size of our population, yet we pay out approximately four times more than is paid out in the UK.  The figures do not add up and the system does not work.  We do not have the numbers to justify it.  The reserving being placed by insurers has increased in accordance with Central Bank best practice and nobody will argue with that.  Claims do not come and go inside a matter of weeks or months.  They take years.  A claim can be outstanding for four years and in the meantime, the policyholder - the family - will be faced with an increased bill because the outstanding or reserved claim will be treated as a claim paid.  Even if the claim is ultimately not paid and the only costs incurred by the insurer are its investigation costs, the premium increase will have taken place.  It is history now.  The insurers do not have the wherewithal to go back and pay what they owe to Joe Bloggs back from four years ago.  They look at the end of every year and balance out what they need to make sure they do not go into the red because if they do, the Central Bank will close them down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Monks"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":892,"content":"<p>I will ask a number of questions together because I am conscious that many other members wish to contribute.  I hear what Mr. Monks is saying and I agree with him on some of the exaggerated awards that are being paid.  While that issue needs to be addressed, I do not believe the insurance sector will reduce premiums accordingly.  I do not trust the industry in which I believe a cartel is operating.  Ms Murray's example of &euro;5 million in premiums and &euro;1 million in reserves shows that price gouging is taking place.<\/p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. Boland spoke about the commitment by insurers to reduce prices in parallel with reforms.  FBD told the agricultural sector that prices would fall if it undertook additional safety measures, installed cameras and so forth.  Rather than falling, insurance premiums have increased dramatically resulting in the closure of some rural marts, which constitute the fabric of many rural communities.  Before any further reforms are undertaken at this level, do we need a commitment from insurers, similar to the one given in 2002, that if businesses take certain steps, insurance premiums will reduce by a certain percentage?  This was set out in a table agreed at that point in time.<\/p> <p>  There has been much talk about fraudulent claims.  The insurance industry told us these claims result in a &euro;50 increase in all motor insurance premiums.  We can imagine that the cost is significant and not just in motor insurance but in other areas of insurance.  Many people do not claim from their insurance even when the claim is legitimate.  I think the model is broken.  If a tree fell on my car - one fell across the road from my house and my car ran into it just a couple of weeks ago - there is no chance that I would claim on my insurance policy because the company would increase my premium by twice the amount that it would cost to fix the car.  Many people who have minor accidents simply do not contact their insurance companies.  The sector is broken because businesses are penalised for claiming and using the insurance they have.<\/p><p> We have statistics on fraudulent claims for the first time.  Insurance companies now have to report fraudulent claims or suspected fraudulent claims to the Garda.  I found it quite surprising that from 1 October to the end of February, which is five full months, there were only 19 cases of fraudulent claims right across the insurance sector.  That includes public liability insurance, motor insurance and all the rest.  Either the insurance companies are not reporting what they are saying or they are exaggerating the number of fraudulent claims to justify the price gouging that is taking place, or there is something else going on.  That does not take away from the point that there needs to be a Garda insurance fraud unit.  We are very strongly in favour of that.  The committee is united on it.  It should happen without delay.  Is insurance fraud as considerable as the insurance companies are telling us?  If so, why are they reporting only three cases per month across all sectors of insurance?  The claims that are reported are suspected fraudulent claims.  Some of them may not be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#H00500","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":894,"content":"<p>I will deal with those questions in order.  With regard to commitments to reductions from the insurance companies, I agree absolutely.  We have quite a list of reforms that we believe are necessary but we are very conscious of the amount of traffic going through the Oireachtas at the moment.  We want to try to stay very focused.  It is one of the top three items on our list.  There is a considerable amount of work being done on this.  An enormous amount of pain is being caused by insurance premiums.  If we emerged at the end of this crisis with no reductions in insurance premiums to follow, it would have catastrophic consequences.  It is essential at this stage that we obtain clarity from the insurers as to the benefits of all this work.  I am conscious there have been developments since 2002 with regard to competition law and so on, so there may be complications.  That is why we have asked the Department of Finance to address this issue.  We have asked that it do so from a State point of view because the State is inextricably linked to the issue.  Very often, we are legally obliged to have insurance, whether it is motor insurance or, in many cases, public liability insurance.  As it is the State and organs of the State that are obliging us to have insurance, they cannot give the impression they are a third party on this issue.  We are looking for this kind of commitment from the insurers via the State as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  On fraudulent claims, I am aware of the data mentioned by the Deputy.  We welcome any clarity or transparency in this whole area.  I am not here to speak on behalf of the insurers but my understanding from some insurance companies is that when they make what they call section 19 complaints on suspected insurance fraud, they are not yet being logged on PULSE.  I have been told that by somebody anonymously.  I cannot verify it one way or the other.  I would be surprised by the low levels of fraud, as reported.  The experience of our members is that fraud is a good deal more prevalent than the statistics indicate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":895,"content":"<p>May I clarify that for the benefit of the committee?  The information is from the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We have got the information from the Garda.  The Minister says that in the period between 1 October 2018 and 28 February 2019, there were 19 incidents of insurance companies reporting insurance claim fraud as per the stated guidelines.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has advised that crime counting rules have not been applied to these data.  I refer to recording the data on PULSE.  However, while they are not accounted for on PULSE, as should be the case so we can have ease of access, they represent the total number of claims reported by the insurance industry.  In my view, that is concerning.  Either they are not taking this seriously enough or there is another reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#J00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":896,"content":"<p>I will deal with that point first.  We have covered it on page 7 of our submission.  There may be reluctance on the part of defendants, by which I mean policyholders, and insurance companies to invoke the fraudulent claim clause under section 26 of the 2004 Act.  There is case law on this.  We have quoted it on page 7.  Mr. Justin Kevin Cross said that because, in his view, the 2004 Act is so pro-defendant, with which we have an issue in the first case, aggravated or exemplary damages is the only real deterrent to an irresponsible or, indeed, over-enthusiastic invocation of such a plea.  In simple English, that means that if a defendant suggests in defending his or her claim that the claimant is making a fraudulent claim and does not succeed with that assertion, not alone will the plaintiff get damages but he or she can also get aggravated or exemplary damages.  That is crimping a lot of activity in the sector.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy implied that if awards came down, premiums might not.  I will qualify his perspective very slightly for him.  In our view, premiums absolutely will tumble, but in a competitive market only.  We have CSO data on that.  PIAB was established in 2003.  The CSO tells us that, from peak to trough, the cost of motor insurance came down 41% in four years since PIAB's introduction.  One should bear in mind that PIAB was not reducing awards in that period.  It was paying out what the judges were paying out but doing so on the basis of payments of &euro;45 being made to it.  The motor insurance market is a competitive market and one is legally obliged to have insurance.  Some of the problems the Deputy has heard about today concern those with a single underwriter.  To qualify this, if awards are reduced in a robust, competitive market, premiums will fall, but only where there is more than one underwriter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":897,"content":"<p>I welcome everyone, particularly Ms Murray, whose statement was very compelling.<\/p> <p>  With regard to practical measures, I will first address Mr. Boland.

Typically, the type of case that goes to the Court of Appeal involves quite substantial injuries.  I do not think anyone in this room would question the right of someone who has been seriously injured to get sufficient general damages to cover their pain and suffering.  This is not the issue.  The issue is at the bottom end of the scale for minor soft tissue injuries.  It is important to note it is not just with regard to whiplash but extends throughout the scale.  For example, if I bruise my thumb and there is no ligament damage, no breakage, a certain amount of swelling and a full recovery in a short period of time, at present the book of quantum entitles me to up to &euro;21,200 for that injury.

Mr. Boland has spoken about how data are collected and how it appears from a motor perspective, I will refer to liability data that the CSO may or may not collect.  I may be one of the random companies chosen so I am asked to fill in this form, the CSO annual services inquiry form, 2808B, annually.  I have tried to put this on the agenda before but have failed so far.  The form asks for the company's costs.  One question is what is the firm's insurance cost as a global number.  Say a firm's insurance premium is &euro;10,000, within that there is a premium for motor, for assets, for property, a premium for employer liability, for public liability, consequential loss etc.  The CSO should ask for a breakdown of the insurance figure as otherwise, the question is meaningless.  Liability is the key number, it is the biggest cost in any premium.  In the case of a manufacturing company, employer liability will be the most significant number.  In a business where people are on the premises, public liability is the key number.  If I was to be asked to give a breakdown of my insurance premium, if it was &euro;10,000, I should be asked for my public liability premium.  Then in another part of the form, to get the denominator for measuring the rate for public liability, one divides the premium into the sales figure.  That can be compared internationally to see if Ireland is an outlier: we are.  In the case of employer liability the actuarial formula is arrived at by dividing the premium into wages, which gives the rate.  The CSO is not collecting these data.  Either it does not understand the data or they do not want to collect them for whatever reason, maybe it does not think it is important.  It is vitally important that we have the data.<\/p> <p>  The Alliance for Insurance Reform has its asks but ISME's approach is different.  It reverts to Senator Kieran O'Donnell's question.  There are three key issues of which the first is quantum.  My colleague, Mr. McDonnell referred to several issues relating to legal reform, including reform of the courts and procedure.  The final area is the need for transparent granular data.  There is no one thing that will solve the problem, but those three things combined, if they are tackled simultaneously, will solve the problem.  That is the answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Coghlan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":964,"content":"<p>I need to answer the two Senators together because Senator Kieran O'Donnell asked a simple question which we did not actually answer, which was whether quantum was the silver bullet.  It is about 70% or 80% of the bullet.  I will not refer to any individual business but I ask members to bear in mind that we need to reform how liability is assessed.  Currently, if something occurs on a premises, there is not even consideration of negligence, the insurer effectively will simply ask the business \"Did this happen on your premises, yes or no?\"  Last week, the papers reported a &euro;30,000 settlement to a child in a city centre cr&egrave;che where one child went into another with a tricycle.  This happened several years ago and &euro;30,000 was awarded where the child is fully recovered and has a 1 mm scar.  Whether we think that is a good idea is a subjective assessment, however we might ask if that happened in a person's kitchen, and one child banged into another and gave a scar, should a payment of &euro;30,000 arise?  If the answer is no, then neither should it arise in a cr&egrave;che or a play facility.  We must get our heads around the fact that simply because something happens on a premises does not mean the owner of the premises is liable for it.  We have a bonkers concept of what constitutes negligence and duty of care.  We have spent a long time arguing that.  Currently anyone who owns or operates a premises who goes before a court, most especially where children are concerned, loses before going in to the courtroom, irrespective of the merits of their case.  That is an area that must be taken on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":965,"content":"<p>From the perspective of the alliance, I ask that members, as individual Deputies and Senators, ask as a matter of urgency what is necessary to get the Judicial Council Bill through quickly.

The three big asks I am taking from the discussion is to get the Garda fraud unit set up as quickly as possible.  Where are they with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, or the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy?  Are they playing pass the parcel with each other?  Is one saying it is not a matter for me, it is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality and<i>vice versa<\/i>or is it all a matter for the Garda Commissioner?<\/p><p>I refer to the book of quantum, which I have discussed previously with Mr. Boland.  It is a statistical, historical database of what has happened and the only way it can change over time is by claims changing.  Legislation cannot change the book of quantum but it can, as he suggests, cap the injury awards or whatever over time.  The book of quantum is historical and statistical and it is compiled from the information available.  Unfortunately, the premiums are as high as they are because the payouts from judges and the insurance system generally have been high.  We need to focus on how we can reduce those claims.  I do not doubt that everybody in their business is doing everything they can to minimise that.<\/p><p>In the ten or 12 years of her business's existence, has Ms Murray physically changed the design of her premises, taken out certain climbing frames, slides or whatever?  Twenty years ago I was involved with summer camps and people would tell us that we could not have step-ups and so on.  We hear about children not being able to play or run in playgrounds and so on.  I read about a claim yesterday where a table flipped over in the wind and, unfortunately, a three year old broke a nose.  The award was &euro;30,000 even though the nose healed perfectly.  I am sure there was some trauma for the child but I am not sure about an award of &euro;30,000 or where that figure come from.  Does Ms Murray have comparative figures for insurance premiums for similar play centres in the UK, although it has a different claims environment?<\/p><p>Most people have said the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is doing his bit but he is a lone voice in that regard.  I met the Connacht publicans yesterday and I am conscious that the LVA is doing significant work and that the Vintners Federation of Ireland, VFI, is helping out as well.  The biggest bone of contention the Connacht publicans had, bar the issue that arose recently in terms of the limits, is the cost of insurance generally, which is destroying their businesses.  They are getting one or two customers a night in some venues but they are still paying large insurance premiums for very little return.<\/p><p>The FBD representatives are coming in next.  Do the witnesses have any questions they would like members to put to them?  We get many lawyers blaming the insurance industry and the insurance industry blaming the lawyers.  I would like their thoughts on who is more at fault.  I am sure all of them are at fault.  I am throwing out the questions because we do not have much time for engagement.<\/p><p>The witnesses final big ask was in terms of their schedule about the reductions in the data availability.  Since I joined this committee in 2016, we have been crying out for visibility on claims.  They said the CSO and the Central Bank have more or less thrown out the idea of visibility on that.  They might give their thoughts on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#N01600","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":984,"content":"<p>I will respect the time constraints and keep my contribution as short as possible.  I watched Ms Murray's contribution in my office while I was doing other work and it was very sad because she was a person who was full of enthusiasm and had built up a business.<\/p><p>The emotion struck me.  All we can do is tell people to keep going and not to let others put them down.  It is important to say that because people become frustrated and opt out of business.  It has happened in my own area.  <\/p><p> Mr. Boland spoke about the slow pace of reform.  When I first came into the D&aacute;il following my election in 2016 I heard the Chairman making a very strong case for businesses in his own constituency in the context of insurance costs having risen by 100%.  Last year RGDATA told us that shop insurance had increased in many cases from &euro;10,000 to &euro;100,000.  Restaurant insurance has gone up by almost 50%.  The Chairman has heard me talk previously about the case of an hotel in my own constituency of Roscommon-Galway that was facing closure but a very innovative family took it over, maintaining the employment of 25 people.  The family looked at the insurance cover which was very low at the time, amounting to &euro;12,500.  A review was conducted four years ago and the family was advised that the proper cover would bring their costs up to around &euro;25,000.  Today, their insurance costs are almost &euro;50,000 per annum.  This really frustrates me because there were only two small claims against the hotel in the period.  One was to the value of &euro;2,500 and the other was &euro;1,500.  I ask the representatives of the insurance business here today to explain to me how that is possible.  In the context of such small claims, there appears to me to be no justification for that level of premium increase.  The Government's competitive watchdog, the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, said in 2016 that the biggest issue facing small business was the increase in insurance costs.  Three years later and many businesses are barely holding on.  These insurance costs will crucify more businesses if we do not make progress quickly.  <\/p><p> Senator Kieran O'Donnell asked a number of pertinent questions on the book of quantum.  When the reform of the book of quantum takes place - and the work of the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy in this regard must be acknowledged - can the insurance industry representatives assure us that insurance costs will fall?  I will give the witnesses another example of the problems here.  I know of a haulage company that has secured insurance abroad and I wonder if that is totally safe.  One haulier had to take out insurance abroad.  He has 15 trucks and at one point his insurance was costing &euro;70,000.  In one year, it increased to &euro;130,000, even though there were no claims against his business.  His insurance increased by almost 100%.  In terms of the costs of running a small business usually wages, raw materials and energy costs outstrip other costs but now, in many cases, insurance is outstripping even these costs.  That is not sustainable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#N01700","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":986,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegations.  We had lots of different groups in here, including road hauliers, insurance companies and legal professionals when we were preparing our report on insurance costs.  Nobody was to blame, according to those with whom we engaged.<\/p> <p>  ISME apportions a lot of blame to the Judiciary.  It argues that a substantial minority of our Judiciary is excessively, unfairly and unjustly pro-plaintiff.  ISME was not surprised to see the same High Court justice, who ironically oversees the personal injury list in the High Court, mount a stout defence of the current personal injuries system in the press, suggesting that awards for general damages have fallen in real terms since the 1970s.  ISME suggests that this committee should understand that while it does not expect the law to be on its side, it does expect it to be blind.  ISME members have advised the organisation that one of the most important considerations before they decide to defend a case in court is the name of the trial judge.  If it is one of a small number of judges with a pro-plaintiff reputation, they will instruct their counsel to settle, irrespective of the merits or strengths of their defence.  ISME argues that this is an appalling indictment of our Judiciary and I agree.  The statement from ISME is unbelievable but the representatives here today stand over it.  It is a sad state of affairs, in my view.<\/p> <p>  We have all come across cases such as those outlined by previous contributors and we understand the issues relating to the book of quantum and so forth.  Mr. Boland said that it was clear to his organisation that the dead hand of vested interests and the lack of sufficient political will are grinding the response to the crisis to a halt.  In that context, he is blaming the political system, as well as the Judiciary and vested interests.  I ask him to outline to us what we, as politicians, can do.

In response to Senator Paddy Burke, the pace of reform in this area is not fast enough.  I used the example of the last time we had a crisis in this area in 2002 and 2003, when all of the legislation and actions to address it were done and dusted within two and a half years.  We are nowhere near that timeframe this time around.  In very practical terms, what politicians can do to speed things up is get the Judicial Council Bill through the Houses as quickly as possible.  They can also exert political pressure to get the Garda insurance fraud unit up and running and this committee can hold the insurers to account in terms of what they are going to do to make sure that premiums go down.<\/p> <p>  I would respond to Deputy Eugene Murphy's question on the book of quantum by going back to what the Minister and the insurance industry have said constantly, namely, that claims drive costs.  That is the insurance industry's analysis of this problem so if the book of quantum can be resolved, that sorts the claims issue.  Certainly from our point of view, we would then regard the insurance industry as being under an obligation to respond with reduced insurance costs.  The Deputy's story about the hotel is one which is very familiar.  What happened there is happening all over the country.  In terms of why it happens, we are mystified and it is absolutely a question for the insurers.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Horkan, as I understand it an announcement on the Garda insurance fraud unit is imminent.  We would ask why it has taken so long to get to this point because it is our understanding that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been ready internally for this for quite some time.  We are awaiting a decision on that but there is an opportunity to apply political pressure.  We are told that it is a decision for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but surely the Government has a role to play in terms of expressing the desire of the State to have a Garda insurance fraud unit in place.  <\/p> <p> As the legislation currently stands, the book of quantum can only be revised through the history of awards over the previous two to three years.  However, the Judicial Council Bill will give the power to reduce downwards, regardless of awards history.  That is what we are expecting the Judiciary to do; we need judges to step up to the mark on behalf of society.  In terms of health and safety, I would suggest that this country is the health and safety nation  Our colleagues from Europe and further afield are gobsmacked at the level to which health and safety is acknowledged and enforced in this country.  It is time for the insurers to respect that in terms of the premiums being paid.<\/p><p>The national claims information database is a partial solution to transparency.  When the first report is released towards the end of this year, I suspect that it will be very unsatisfactory because it will be a first look, it will refer only to motor insurance, and there are no firm plans to examine liability.<\/p><p> To respond to the question on insurers, I reiterate that FBD and the broader insurance industry should be asked what they will do for policyholders in the light of the improvement in their financial position and the forecast additional improvement.<\/p><p> Deputy Burton referred to Northern Ireland.  I suspect that the UK, and Northern Ireland in particular, has its own problems in this area.  While the UK is by no means the ideal, as Mr. McDonnell noted, it is regarded by the rest of Europe as an insurance outlier.  I would not, therefore, necessarily consider Northern Ireland to be a role model in this area, not least because there may be complications arising from Brexit.  I would prefer if we got our own house in order at this stage and there is a fairly well-defined roadmap in that regard.  <\/p><p> On healthcare and early intervention on injuries, much has been done to try to achieve that but the problem is being caused by general damages, which are paid for pain and suffering, rather than special damages, which cover medical care and loss of earnings.  The general damage for the pain and suffering of the original incident is the problem, which is why the solutions we have proposed are in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":990,"content":"<p>To respond to some of Deputy Burton's points, all our businesses, with the exception of perhaps one or two, have a disclaimer for people to sign.  Unfortunately, however, when an accident happens to a minor, disclaimers are not worth the paper on which they are written.  We would welcome a change in the duty of care to the effect that when someone is on the premises of a business whose owner is not negligent, a disclaimer will stand.  Nobody is questioning anything about where negligence has occurred.  It would be ideal if a disclaimer stood for something but, unfortunately, it does not.<\/p> <p>  On the 24-hour accident care, we would all welcome it but one is afraid of one's life of suggesting paying for that or even giving the child a Smyths voucher if he or she has sustained an injury.  Insurance companies will say it amounts to an admission of liability if there is an offer of something.  Nevertheless, many businesses will offer something such as vouchers where something has happened that is not the business's fault, although one can still end up being sued even after offering something like that.  Being able to pay for medical expenses, as is the case in Scandinavia, would be great.<\/p> <p>  Senator Horkan spoke about similar premiums in the UK.  I am not sure whether he was present earlier when I mentioned that one of our members paid &pound;1,500 in the UK to have his trains insured there.  To have them insured in Ireland, however, he had to pay &euro;33,000 through the same company in the UK, which illustrates the difference.<\/p> <p>  On FBD, I challenge it to insure us as a group.

We are part of and embedded in the community, with 34 branches in cities and towns throughout the country.  Insuring farms and small businesses is our business.  They are critically important to us and represent 85% of our premium.  It is our job to be there when things go wrong.  We have a proud and long tradition, spanning more than 50 years, of paying claims and of being there when things go wrong.<\/p> <p>  From 2014 to 2016, FBD Insurance was making a loss.  It is in our customers' interest that we have stabilised and returned to making profit.  In order to stand by our customers and pay our claims, we must be stable and profitable.  We stabilised matters by taking a raft of measures, including charging our customers more.  The cost of insurance is too high.  It is affecting our customers' ability to do business and that affects us.  A great deal has happened in the attempt to address the cost of insurance, but not enough has changed.  With the permission of the committee, I will share FBD Insurance's insights into why this is the case and what must be done.<\/p> <p>  First, I will summarise what is causing the high cost of insurance.  In essence, Ireland has too many claims and those claims are costing too much.  People are too willing to make a claim and advisers are too willing to encourage them.  Compensation payouts are simply too generous and the cost of getting to a payout decision is too high.  To address the root cost of the high cost of insurance, all roads lead to our legal system.  The legal system dictates the level of award.  It sets the market price that determines the level of our awards, both in and out of court, and the system creates a vicious cycle.  High payouts with no downside encourage claimants and high legal fees encourage certain solicitors and barristers to take and make the case.  The legal system is difficult to reform and resistant to change and practitioners have little to gain and, perhaps, much to lose.<\/p> <p>  I would go further.  FBD Insurance does not recognise our legal system as the root cause of the problem.  We do not have the capability, or at least we have not demonstrated the capability, to fundamentally reform the system.  Litigation is always expensive.  I will share how costs spiral as a consequence of this system.  Take the example of a soft tissue injury from a low impact collision, meaning there was little or no damage to the car.  The occupant has a sore neck.  Bear in mind that soft tissue injuries comprise approximately 80% of our motor claims.  It is the type of injury that some jurisdictions do not recognise or for which they do not pay or pay very little.  Normally, it will take three years and up to five years from the date of the accident until the case is heard.  The Injuries Board will assess the injury 12 to 18 months after the accident based on a medical report that gives a six month forward prognosis but the majority of claimants will continue to report pain right up their day in court, three to five years after the accident.  The judge will make an award for the same injury based on three to five years of reported pain.  Court awards, determined later than the Injuries Board, are higher and costs are significantly higher.  The key insight is that the level of award is based on the length of time the complainant is complaining of the pain as opposed to the amount of pain the complainant feels.  Compensation is more a function of time than of suffering.  There is a major incentive, therefore, to bring a claim to litigation.<\/p> <p>  FBD Insurance has previously stated what it believes must be prioritised.  Our key recommendations remain outstanding or are work in progress.  We should lower the level of awards.  Why do we pay four to five times more than what the UK is already trying to reduce?  We must recalibrate claimants' expectations.  The proposed judicial council and its proposed redrafting of the book of quantum can be the vehicle, but awards and soft tissue awards in particular must be significantly and consistently lower.<\/p> <p>  FBD Insurance also believes that we must cap awards, implement what one might call a front stop on the legal system's generosity.  We need a standardised objective approach to assessing whiplash, a measure of pain that is not linked to the time it takes to settle the claim.  There must be a more efficient process up to and in litigation.  The vast majority of soft tissue injuries should be finalised in the Injuries Board.<\/p> <p>  Insurance companies must be more transparent and publish premium levels.  They must work harder on fraud.  We need help to be allowed to share data.  Finally, we must establish a dedicated insurance fraud investigation unit with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In a nutshell, we must build momentum and drive home meaningful reform of the legal system.<\/p> <p>  The chief executive officer of FBD Insurance, Ms Fiona Muldoon, has said that Irish society can have either high injury awards or cheap insurance, but not both.  As legislators, the members of the committee have the sole ability to help deliver what is to the greater benefit for most in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jackie McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":1000,"content":"<p>That was a robust presentation outlining the company's presence in the market.

There are probably much fewer participants in the market now than was the case previously.  Much of that goes back to transparency, and representatives of Insurance Ireland have appeared before the committee, in terms of the databases and the data that exist.<\/p> <p>  From our point of view it is very difficult to see what is happening.  We see many claims being settled.  Mr. McMahon spoke about fighting fraud.

Obviously, many cases are legitimate.  They are what they are and there is fault.  I do not know if Mr. McMahon saw the earlier session with members of the Alliance for Insurance Reform and ISME.  Various people were here.  The Alliance for Insurance Reform represents restaurants, publicans, small businesses and many people.  I am sure Mr. McMahon has engaged with them.<\/p> <p>  There was a particular focus this morning on play centres, the play centre industry and the broader play centre activity park and the like.  Our guests at the earlier session stated that their industry has paid money to insurers.  It was not FBD Insurance because they stated that most of their business has to refer to the UK because nobody here will insure them.  They have paid in &euro;5 million.  There are reserves of &euro;800,000 against claims and only &euro;200,000 has been paid out in the last five years.  By any measure, it appears to be a profitable industry.  Why will FBD Insurance not consider that, or will it?  There are play centres, activity centres, places for people to go for birthday parties and places for children's activities closing down in many towns.  One lady is in Navan and has the only one left, but she will have to close after 12 years in business.  She has seen her insurance premiums rocket.  Mr. McMahon might have heard a discussion on \"Today with Sean O'Rourke\" yesterday morning about play centres.  Other people said their insurance premiums have gone from very small amounts to multiples of those.  In one case it went from &euro;6,000 to over &euro;200,000.  Phenomenal increases were mentioned, and I only heard a small part of the interview.<\/p> <p>  There is an existential crisis here for many industries.  Representatives of marts appeared before the committee, and I am sure Mr. McMahon is very familiar with marts.  It appears that this is the most health and safety conscious country in the world and certainly in the EU.  If one goes to Brussels, Paris or elsewhere, there are holes in the ground and no fencing around them but if people fall into them it is their own fault.  We seem to have put great emphasis on this.  I am aware of a school that had no claims but its insurance bill increased from &euro;27,000 to &euro;34,000 on the basis that it was in a scheme and the scheme had ended.  It was more or less a case of \"You were getting it on the cheap for the last few years and we are going to ramp it up at the end of the term that was agreed\".<\/p><p>We have a problem with insurance.  I do not think the industry is doing enough to fight fraud.  I am not referring to our guests in particular and I would like to hear any figures they have on that issue.<\/p><p> I also have a question about solvency.  Is fraud leading to higher reserves?  Are higher reserves causing higher premiums, profits and payouts?  What would our guests do if they were on in our position?  It is all very well to state that we want lower premiums, etc., but what three things would our guests would do if they were legislators and what requests would they make?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#R00500","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>The Senator is touching on many of the fundamental issues.

The length of time can determine the costs not the severity of the pain. This is the key insight I can bring.  For example, we had a claimant who suffered neck and upper back injuries.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, awarded &euro;14,700 at 12 months after the accident based on a medical examination that the plaintiff would recover within 16 months of the accident.  The case went to trial and 4.8 years later - the claimant alleging ongoing complaint - the judge awarded him &euro;33,000, and costs were set at &euro;16,700.<\/p> <p>  Another case of soft tissue injury to neck and shoulder, for example, was awarded &euro;9,900 by PIAB one year and ten months after the accident.  In his report the claimant's own GP expressed the view that she was 100% recovered six months after the accident.  The case went to court and the judge awarded &euro;33,700.  The claimant was alleging ongoing complaints and stated that she did not agree with her own GP's first report.<\/p> <p>  A case that was not a soft tissue injury was a claimant who suffered scarring to the lower leg and post-traumatic stress after being bitten by a dog.  PIAB made an award one year and 11 months after the accident for &euro;78,600.  The case went to trial in the High Court two years and eight months after the accident and the claimant was awarded &euro;103,000, and legals costs of &euro;41,000.<\/p> <p>  We can talk about a lot of aspects on the margins and on the periphery of insurance costs, but a key point and the fundamental issue is that the legal system is too generous.  It is too generous by a factor of five timeS, especially on soft tissue injuries, which is where the real problem is.  It is incentivised because a dragged out, long and slow process generates significant legal costs.  At the end of the day the claimant wins because he or she gets a higher award and the lawyers win because they get significant fees.  Businesses, consumers and those who pay insurance lose.  Ultimately society loses.  Everything else helps with the margins but that is the significant issue that needs to be addressed.

I will be relatively brief.  I refer to the Judiciary's interpretation of the book of quantum.  The fundamental point is that it cannot be too loose.  If there is still a significant degree of discretion I am not sure we will solve anything.  If the judge merely has to have regard to the new guidelines it is a waste of time.  The application has to be much tighter than that.  We will have to watch that very carefully in the course of the legislation, otherwise we will not make the progress we want.<\/p><p>On the overall financial performance, I take Mr. McMahon's point that insurance companies have to be profitable.  It is a risk-based business.  I was looking at the annual figures.  Profit before tax of &euro;50 million equates to a 15% return on equities.  The gross written premium is &euro;372 million.  Profit before tax is therefore about 13% of the premium.  Is that typical of what the market would expect FBD Insurance to deliver as a public limited company, PLC?  FBD Insurance has investors.  I am not sure what the profile of its shareholders is.  I assume there are significant institutional shareholders among them.  Is that typical of what would be expected?  If that figure was 20%, 30% or more would the witnesses accept it was too high?  I appreciate that it is not at that level now. <\/p><p><b>Mr. Jackie McMahon:<\/b>That is what the investors expect.  That is what we target on their behalf.  They invest on that basis.  I can certainly understand the concern but I would just like to say that as an insurance company and a PLC our accounts are open.  They are published and audited.  We are the only insurance company in Ireland whose accounts are available.  The rest are folded into their parents in the UK or elsewhere.  To give some comfort to members of the committee I note that we are in a very competitive market.  People and investors need a return but we also need to grow our business.  It is basic economics.  If the profits increase excessively, sellers will want to sell more as a result.  This drives prices down and profits return to a normal level.  Those are the forces of the market within which we operate.  Competition is sometimes quite brutal but the free market will ensure that we continue to make a normal profit. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#W01900","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":1135,"content":"<p>Am I right in saying that FBD Insurance's financial report encompasses its full activity, that is, there are no intra-group transfers, management charges etc.?

I am not a member of this committee but I have a fierce interest in it.  I also have a Bill going through the Seanad that passed Second Stage.  There are questions about it but its purpose is to cap awards in the courts.  I have done a fair bit of research.  I think I might have been speaking with Mr. Cahalan regarding this.  The problem is fourfold.  We all pay insurance levies and up to 7% of a premium is a levy.  That is related to Quinn Insurance and all those insurance companies that failed.  Profits are also part of the problem.  People have spoken about excessive profits.  I am not anti-profit but there is a problem when they are excessive.  Fraudulent and over-exaggerated claims are a problem.  Insurance companies are not doing enough to go after fraudulent claims.  We as legislators have to do something with regard to people who bring fraudulent claims that are thrown out in court.  We should pursue them through the courts for making fraudulent claims.<\/p> <p>  The issue that is key for me is the awards.  I agree that the rewards are excessive.  They are four and a half times more than in the UK and way out of sync with Europe.  The awards are high across the board, especially for soft tissue injuries.  People have mentioned changing the book of quantum, which has been highlighted here.  It is not a matter of changing the book of quantum but changing what the judge's award.  I will not go on too much about it but I will ask Mr. McMahon two questions.  If his company is defending a claim and judge A or judge B is hearing it, and it knows that judge A will make an excessive award while judge B will give a reasonable award, does it settle before it goes into the courts if it knows that judge A will make an excessive award?  If judge B is taking the case, who will make a reasonable award, does the company let it go through the courts?  Is that a fair assessment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#X00800","speaker":"1438"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>When we have a strong case, we will fight that case regardless of which judge is involved.

It is very easy to kick the industry.  Given what has happened with PMPA and Quinn Insurance, Ireland has not had a great track record with Irish-owned insurance companies.  We need to be mindful of that.  If FBD were not in the insurance market in Ireland, we would be totally at the mercy of the German, British and French insurance companies.  People might like to bash them, but FBD is an Irish-owned company listed on the Irish Stock Exchange which provides many jobs here.  Many of its competitors are totally Internet based and provide few, if any, jobs in Ireland.  It is good to have an Irish-owned company that has a face.  FBD has an extensive operation in my town, Mullingar, including an extensive call centre.

That has not been overlooked, certainly in the business community.<\/p> <p>  Is FBD very vulnerable, as the only real Irish entity in the insurance business?  These larger European conglomerates can squeeze the markets.  There was common abuse with the undercutting of prices to try to squeeze competitors out of the market.  Is FBD still vulnerable to that?  Is much of FBD's book being underwritten by some of these larger insurers?  FBD used to do most of its own underwriting but I do not know if that has changed.  Could it be bullied at the will of some of the bigger British, German or French operators?

I will address both in my opening statement but, first, I will provide a brief overview of some developments in Bank of Ireland since our last meeting in July 2018.<\/p> <p>  Bank of Ireland is focused on the delivery of the multi-year strategy we announced last year.  This strategy sets out the plan we are following from 2018 to 2021.  It seeks to transform our culture, our systems and our business model, as well as improve customer service and grow sustainable profitability.  In 2018 we delivered new lending of &euro;15.9 billion groupwide, an increase of 13% year on year.  Last year was the first year of net new lending growth in ten years.<\/p> <p>  A core part of our strategy is to strongly support home building and buying.  In 2018 we increased mortgage lending by 17%.  We are funding the construction of 5,500 residential units across approximately 140 sites nationwide.  We are also the largest provider of new business lending into the economy and support two out of every three foreign direct investment projects coming into Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In addition to lending, since last June, we have taken several steps to improve the service we deliver to our customers.  With more than 250 branches nationwide, we have the largest network of any Irish bank.  In the second half of last year, we expanded cash services at more than 100 of our locations, opened two new branches and increased the number of front-line staff serving customers directly by more than 200.<\/p> <p>  We are also focused on reducing our non-performing exposures, NPEs.  At 6.3%, we have the lowest level of NPEs of any bank in Ireland but we must do more.  This is why, last week, we announced a transaction involving a potential securitisation of a portfolio of non-performing buy-to-let mortgage loans.  In common with all banks, our regulators have set out the capital requirements we must adhere to in respect of any NPEs that we hold.  This includes holding up to ten times more capital against certain impaired mortgages compared with others which are current with their repayments.  This represents capital that could otherwise be lent into the economy or invested in improving customer service.<\/p> <p>  Brexit, is of course, a topic that dominates the landscape in Ireland, the UK and across the EU.  It is also top of mind for many of our customers.  Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s economic pulse, our monthly index which tracks consumer and business sentiment, has reported weakening sentiment over the recent 12 months.<\/p><p>In March, this was down by 1.4 points to 89.4, a reduction of 7.7. compared with a year ago, with Brexit being the key factor.<\/p><p> At Bank of Ireland we look at Brexit in two ways.  First, how we can support our customers to navigate Brexit.  Second, how we are prepared as a Bank to deal with the outcome whatever that may be.  Within our customer base we see resilient businesses that are adapting to changing circumstances.  Nonetheless, particular challenges do arise for some customers.  These can include managing foreign exchange risk, investing in their working capital or changing their supply chains, operations or logistics.  In response, Bank of Ireland has launched a &euro;2 billion Brexit fund to support businesses across the island of Ireland.  Notwithstanding present issues, many businesses are also identifying opportunities for investment and growth, domestically and internationally, which we are keen to support. <\/p><p> Regarding our own business, Bank of Ireland was subject to two European Banking Authority, EBA, stress tests in 2018 - a baseline test and an adverse scenario assuming a severe economic downturn.  We performed considerably better than UK peers.  These tests demonstrated our resilience and showed we have enough capital reserves in the event of a severe financial downturn.<\/p><p> The committee raised in its letter the individual accountability framework for banking.  I mentioned earlier that transforming Bank of Ireland's culture is an important element of our strategy.  We believe that the individual accountability framework will act as an enabler of cultural change, not just in Bank of Ireland but across the sector.  A good corporate culture makes a tangible and positive difference for our customers, colleagues and sustainable financial performance.  Given this significance, we have made the transformation of our culture a core element of our entire transformation programme, and just as important as the transformation of our technology and how we are structured.  Bank of Ireland has, therefore, welcomed the proposals to increase accountability in the sector in Ireland.  We believe this will help to further drive the ongoing cultural change in banking, and we look forward to engaging proactively with the Central Bank on this matter.<\/p><p> Banking touches all parts of society.  I look at the work under way on culture and an increasing accountability in our sector as core to Bank of Ireland's task of rebuilding trust with our customers and the wider society that we serve.  I thank members for their attention.  We are happy to take any questions now. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#JJ00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":1199,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McDonagh and call Deputy Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#KK00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":1200,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation's appearance before the committee.  I ask Ms McDonagh to address non-performing loans, NPLs, first.  Bank of Ireland has reduced its non-performing exposures to the lowest of any of the banks.  It has been claimed that the bank has done so without selling any family homes.  Will she outline where the bank is at now?  Ms McDonagh said that the bank is now close to the 5% ECB target but we heard from the ECB this week that there is no such thing as a hard and fast target.  What securitisations has the bank entered into over recent years?  Were they synthetic securitisations or more like the Project Glenbeigh securitisation where the borrower has a new credit servicer and deals with a new agent in respect of them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#KK00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554366600,"counter":1201,"content":"<p>I will take two questions NPE performance and where we are right now and the question on the topic of securitisation.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy said, we have made very good progress in reducing our NPEs as a percentage of our total book.  We have the lowest NPEs of any bank in Ireland currently of &euro;5 billion, which is 6.3% of our total lending book.  That has been going down consistently through working with our customers to find individual solutions.  We speak to our customers and find forbearance solutions that work for them.  When we speak to a customer who has come to us or we have identified as having financial distress, we find that in nine out of ten of those cases we are able to find a solution and those solutions hold.  That has been a positive improvement.  <\/p> <p>  Our NPE performance and that reduction is over four times better than the industry average.  We have talked about getting close to 5% by the end of 2019.  The Deputy is correct that we do not have a 5% target.  Some other banks in Europe may have but 5% is a psychological line to cross to get to a more normalised level.  The average NPE of European banks is 3% to 4%.  We are focusing on getting to 5% and then to continue.  To date, we have done that exclusively from working with our customers.  We signalled, in the course of 2018, that we are looking at all options on the table and that we are open to all of the resolution strategies that could exist to reduce that further.  That is primarily because the definitions of what is impaired, a default and the capital that is allocated to those non-performing exposures is changing.  There is more and more financial incentive and reason to reduce NPEs because they are becoming more capital intensive.  Capital is finite and comes at an expense.  We can allocate that capital to supporting growth in our lending book and supporting Irish consumers and businesses.  We can use that capital to invest in our systems, improve customer service, meet regulatory requirements and make returns to our shareholders, which include the taxpayer.  We have trade-offs there.  We find that the amount of capital that is allocated to, for example, a non-performing buy-to-let mortgage is ten times the capital needed to allocate to a performing principal dwelling home, PDH, type mortgage.  That just gives the committee an idea of the quantum.  <\/p> <p>  Let me outline one of the options.  Last week, we articulated or announced our intention for a securitisation of part of our non-performing buy-to-let mortgage book.  This is a transaction that we intend to do for approximately &euro;375 million, which will create a securitisation of the cash flow from those mortgages.  There will be no transfer of legal title nor will there be any intention of a transfer of servicing of those mortgages.  From a customer perspective, we will continue to engage with the customer and collect the mortgage.  Nothing will change from a customer lens. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#KK00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":1202,"content":"<p>Will the majority of the risk remain with the Bank of Ireland in those circumstances?

If one withdraws one's cash from a Bank of Ireland ATM one is charged 25 cent.

Some 90% of our new mortgage business is on fixed-rate loans and we have led the market in that regard.  Fixed rate for first-time buyers and movers has grown to nearly two thirds of the market, up from slightly more than half of the market one year ago.  That is a market trend indicating customers voting with their feet and having a strong preference for the security and clarity provided by a fixed-rate mortgage such that they know how much will come out of their salary each month to pay their mortgage.  We keep our fixed rate under review.  We offer a fixed-rate mortgage at 2.9% for one or two year mortgages, which is very competitive.  We have reduced our fixed-rate mortgage rate over time.  Historically, we have reduced it by one third in the past three years.  We offer a competitive proposition.  We write to our customers annually, as required.  In addition, we have written to our customers on higher variable rates and reminded them of the opportunity to switch to a fixed rate.  That is good business because keeping a customer on a variable rate when he or she can get a better deal involves a risk of attrition and losing that relationship or mortgage which, obviously, would be a negative for the bank.  Some 8,000 existing customers moved from a variable to a lower fixed rate in 2018, while approximately 7,500 customers did so in 2017.  I am keen to continue increasing that number as we engage with our customers to encourage them to avail of what we believe to be our best offer in fixed-rate mortgages.

It is bordering on criminal for a customer to be paying 4.5% today on their mortgage.  It is significantly out of line with the market, given that Bank of Ireland is offering a fixed rate of 2.9%, Ulster Bank offers a rate as low as 2.3% and Finance Ireland, a new non-bank lender, also comes in cheaper than the Bank of Ireland rates.

That is customer choice.  Choice comes out of competition and competitive markets result in different choice and differentiation in terms of products.  The 4.5% to which the Deputy refers is only in the 80% to 90% loan to value bracket.  Customers below 50% LTV will be on a 3.9% rate.  As I said, we write to customers.  We go beyond the minimum requirement and go the extra mile to let customers know that they can avail of a very attractive fixed rate.  We have marketing campaigns.  We recently reset our brand in the market and we have some very active campaigning about our lowest ever rate of 2.9%.

I bet thousands of customers have a low loan to value ration but are still on the interest rate for over 80% LTV.

If any message comes out of today's meeting, although I am not sure it is one Ms McDonagh will want to hear, it is that those customers should certainly contact Bank of Ireland to see if they can get a better rate.  If they want to stay on a variable rate, they can submit an up-to-date valuation and avail of a reduction of up to 6.6%, move to a fixed rate and go on 2.9% or else shop around and switch their mortgage elsewhere to get an ever lower rate.

We have committed &euro;5 million to an investment over multiple years to improve the financial well-being of consumers in Ireland, not just our customers.  We launched it because despite the relatively high levels of education and GDP <i>per capita <\/i>growth that have come through since the crisis, the level of financial literacy in Ireland is very low, with 45% of people feeling confident about their interest rate.  Our target is to engage with 200,000 customers or non-customers in Ireland to offer them a financial well-being health check.  That will involve questions about meeting their financial commitments each month, so people can see how they rate or rank versus the rest of the population.  That should open a conversation about helping with their financial well-being.  We have also committed to entering every single primary and secondary school in Ireland as part of our youth financial literacy programme, and we are doing some innovation looking at international best in class practices in our financial well-being lab.  It is not just about sending another letter to a customer on SVR about a fixed rate offer; the broader issue is about making people more aware, from their time in education through all stages in their lives.

There are other ways to differentiate and we do that by recognising, promoting and developing staff but there is no way to vary pay under the current restrictions.  If there is a variable payment there would be a large tax associated with it.  In the Minister's letter there is also a restriction on a total payment of &euro;500,000 for any individual.  When I refer to normalisation of pay, I am thinking of being more aligned with other banks in Ireland.  At the moment the restrictions only apply to Irish banks, including Bank of Ireland, but other banks and financial services companies, along with all other private industry companies, are not restricted in the same way.  We know the historical reasons for this, of which I am mindful, but we are encouraging normalisation at this moment in time.  This is not just about a couple of senior people at the top of the organisation - variable pay can help drive accountability and reward the right behaviours and performance that are customer-focused at all levels of the organisation, including those who work in a branch.  Second, it is very difficult to compete for highly specialised roles and such people can be offered much larger packages by non-Irish banks in Ireland.  We are increasingly competing with \"Silicon Docks\" for people with very strong IT or transformation skills.  Third, it is making Irish banks unable to compete on a level footing with other banks and other sectors in Ireland.  This is a political matter and a matter for the Government.  We were asked for input into the third-party review and we shared that perspective with it.  We also gave detailed information of where we are seeing salaries and variable pay packages being offered which provide benefits that we are simply not able to provide.

The Bill conflicts directly with the guidelines the European Central Bank has put in place to encourage banks to reduce their NPEs to get towards European norms.  The capital allocated to non-performing exposures is much higher than to performing ones.  I said at the beginning that, for example, we require ten times more capital to be associated with a loan in respect of a non-performing buy-to-let mortgage than for a performing private dwelling house, PDH, or owner-occupied mortgage.  Having inflated NPEs and fewer options to reduce them would result in trapping capital associated with those NPEs.  It is essentially landlocking capital that we need to increase lending into the Irish economy to Irish consumers and businesses, to invest in our systems to improve services, to meet regulatory capital requirements or to provide a return to shareholders, including the Irish taxpayer.  That is the only way we can allocate capital.  I argue as a banker that competition, while it can represent challenges, is ultimately good for the consumer and the sector, whereas the Bill would disincentivise competition in banking.  It would make mortgage lending less attractive and less profitable to new entrants, which would reduce the competition many politicians and stakeholders would like to see within the Irish banking market.  If the ultimate objective is to increase consumer protection, the Bill will not achieve it.  That is not just my perspective.  The committee has heard from the BPFI representing the sector but also from the Central Bank, whose representatives were here.  I do not need to quote what they said on the record but the same CPC protections exist independently of who owns the asset.  The Bill would increase costs for consumers while affording them no additional protection.  In fact, it would reduce the availability of capital in the market.  For those reasons, it does not make sense and would be bad for the Irish consumer, the sector and the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#PP00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":1276,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome to the committee.

One of the conditions of that funding is that the applicants should have gone to a financial provider on a couple of occasions and been refused loans.

We also need to understand why such loans were taken out.  Certainly they are a factor in the decision but it is not a binary question of customers having borrowed X amount and therefore not being eligible for a mortgage.  We look at these things and try to work with customers, depending on their circumstances.  It is an overused phrase, but we look at these things on a case-by-case basis.  If a customer has debt elsewhere, that is absolutely fine.  People take out loans for many reasons and they use credit unions for many reasons.  We also provide personal loans for a variety of issues and we look at loans in terms of what they mean for customers' ability to repay a mortgage.  Once we are comfortable in terms of their net disposable income, we will look to the macro-prudential lending rules on the loan-to-income ratio.

We did some research on financial well-being using some international benchmarks.  When people undergo a financial health check and look at their financial circumstances, they come out with a score.  The score puts them into a category.  The categories are struggling, stretched, managing or thriving.  Our research shows that about 40% of the population are in the struggling category.  These are people who struggle day to day, or from pay cheque to pay cheque, to manage their finances.  They do not think about things like savings, the impact of loans on their ability to borrow or planning for the future.  When one moves up the categories into stretched, people have a bit more breathing space.  They are thinking about saving but crucially, are not doing it.  People in the managing category have surplus income on a monthly basis, understand that they need to save, start putting some money away but do not necessarily plan for the future.  We know from other research that only 50% of the Irish population has a pension plan, for example.  People in the thriving category are planning for their future.  They are thinking about their long-term future, rainy day savings and so on.<\/p> <p>  What we are trying to do is build awareness.  We see this in other aspects of life, where people look at their physical well-being for example.  We believe that financial well-being is a crucial part of one's overall well-being.  What we are trying to do is build awareness.  We launched our health check service and within two weeks, 20,000 people had undergone the check.  People can attend one of our seminars or come into the bank for a needs review with an adviser.  They do not have to be a customer of Bank of Ireland to do this.  They can go online, check it out and get a sense of where they stand.  That is what is really important.  The points the Deputy made about younger people saving for a mortgage and proving their repayment capacity are crucial.  <\/p> <p>  Another issue that is very interesting and about which there is a lot of debate is the rental market and the cost of rent versus a mortgage.  This raises issues like the amount of disposable income going on rent that could be going into savings.  This is about helping customers to plan and save as they go forward.  In the past few years I have noticed that our clients and customers have become much more serious and resilient in this regard.  They are more aware of the issues and are planning and saving.  The days of going off at the weekend and buying a house are long gone.  People are now really planning out their future and are being very serious about that planning.  There is also an increased awareness among many of our younger customers that it is not a good idea to take on too much debt.  They consider the impact of car loans and other debts.  It is important for people to look at their finances in the round and to plan ahead, whether those plans involve buying a house, going on a holiday or securing their long-term future.  There are tools and services available that can help customers to plan ahead.

Many of these landlords bring that certainty to tenants and bring a particular quality of management to these blocks.  For us, overall supply is the key.

The mortgage on that same apartment would be about &euro;1,100 or &euro;1,200.

We see it in many European cities and we will have to see it coming into Ireland, especially Dublin, with longer-term renters coming in.  In order to do that there must be the right quality there from a landlord's perspective.  There is room in the market for both of these stakeholders.  Ultimately, that must push up those developments and numbers.  Last year, 18,000 units were built in Ireland, which is welcome.  We reckon that will be 22,000 or 23,000 this year and the number will continue to grow over the next two or three years.  We need to see this continue to grow and see those numbers going up because all these pressures are driven by the issue around supply and we must ensure that we manage that in the right way over the next few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#RR00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":1293,"content":"<p>Does the bank have a sense of what percentage of household income should go towards a mortgage?

There were 57,000 homes purchased in 2018.  We often refer to the number of new build homes, which was 18,000, but in terms of the homes which were purchased, the secondary market was 57,000.  We estimate that around 15% were from the larger big investors to which the Deputy referred.<\/p> <p>  On supply and demand, we are seeing the supply come through, even though it is not keeping up with the demand.  The demand for new homes in Ireland is around 35,000 to 40,000 per annum.  The supply has increased from 15,000 in 2017, as Mr. Kelly noted, to 18,000 last year and the market consensus is that this year will be about 23,000 and 27,000 in 2020.  That increased supply has meant that price increases have reduced or softened slightly.  At the beginning of 2018 there was double-digit price increases in the residential property market.  That increase is still positive but is beginning to fall as supply comes on stream.  The macroprudential rules are also having their intended effect of slowing down demand.  The outlook for price this year is an increase of about 4% to 5%.  That has been more subdued than it was previously as supply increases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040400002#RR00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1554366600,"counter":1299,"content":"<p>The last time the bank was here we had a conversation about staff and remuneration.

With regard to our customers, we think about Brexit in two ways.  We need to make sure we are resilient and ready as an institution, but the majority of our energy and day-to-day activity relates to supporting our customers.  We do a monthly economic pulse.  The March results showed that both consumer and business confidence were at a low ebb.  Consumer confidence was at the lowest level we have seen since we started measuring it in the pulse four years ago.  We have seen some rebound in respect of business confidence, but businesses, particularly SMEs, are very concerned by the uncertainty which Brexit represents.  That is manifesting itself in many ways.  Many SMEs are not necessarily cancelling, but deferring investment decisions.  They are not buying extra capacity for their warehouses, employing more people, or replacing machinery because they want to see what Brexit will mean for them.  It depends on the sector and the part of the supply chain in which the business operates.  The sectors most exposed to Brexit, which the Senator mentioned, are those that are highly dependent of imports or exports and which are affected by volatility or lower margins.  Where they are lower down in the supply chain, their ability to respond to that threat is quite limited.<\/p><p>We are speaking to our customers.  We held over 250 events across the island of Ireland in 2018.  We have a team of sector specialists focused on agrifood, health care, hospitality and those manufacturing firms which may be more exposed because they are located closer to the Border, either in the Republic or in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> We have also launched a &euro;2 billion Brexit fund.  This is putting our money where our mouth is in terms of supporting customers at times when developing a contingency plan may require money.  This should enable them to take on sustainable borrowing to support them during uncertain times.  There will also be opportunities.  Brexit may represent opportunities to develop into new and continental markets, moving away from the UK, or in acquiring manufacturing or production capacity in the UK as a hedge.<\/p><p> We have a &euro;50 million unsecured foreign exchange fund for small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, customers who are exposed to foreign currency exchange to help them reduce that volatility which can eat into their margins.  We continue to have point-in-time commentary.  The Bank of Ireland website has regular videos and information guides for those exporting and importing about what to do.  Being there for our customers, not just in the public sense but for one-to-one conversations, is a priority.

For SMEs, we would see that there is some overhang from the crisis.  They are generally cash generative, meaning they can invest some of their cash reserves.  There has been a reticence among SMEs to take on new borrowing until they have clarity in respect of Brexit.

After reaching 5%, I do not have a hard number that we will pursue.  It goes back to optimisation of our capital.  We will work with customers.

We have seen an explosion in online transactions, such as card transactions, Internet transactions and so forth.  We are now processing 50 million payments per month through out business, which is a significant increase on a number of years ago.  The more online we get, however, the more important we believe the community presence is.  We will invest another &euro;11 million in our network this year and in upgrading branches around the country.  The workbench facility the Senator mentioned in Montrose gets much use.  That has been rolled out to 12 other locations around the country.  We recently opened workbenches in Letterkenny, Tralee and The Quay in Waterford.  This concept is taking off in communities.  Communities love the use of the branch, its layout and so forth.  We certainly see a strong future for that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the ATMs, I will not comment on an ongoing security issue.  We had two regrettable incidents in two of our branches in Monaghan and Cavan.  At times like this we must stand up and be counted.  We are very committed to those communities.<\/p><p>In Ballybay, which I visited a couple of months ago, the ATM was put back in within two months and is fully operational again.  That incident hit the community in Ballybay hard because it happened two weeks before Christmas.

However, what is most important is our commitment to our staff, the safety of our staff and our communities but also to continue to provide that service.  That is very important as we go forward.<\/p><p> In terms of five years, I wish I had a crystal ball but I still believe that for us to differentiate what we do as a bank in this market, that mix of online and community presence is essential.

With regard to restructurings or forbearance measures the bank entered into in respect of mortgages, we can see the table for private dwelling houses, PDHs, for example, and the vast majority of them are term extension or arrears capitalisation.  Currently, the bank has done 2,916 PDH split mortgages.  I ask about the bank's policy down the line when that warehoused debt crystalises.  It is a good solution for many people.  It buys time.  The debt is parked.  The Bank of Ireland, as I understand it, continues to charge some interest on the warehoused element of the debt, unlike most other banks.  The witnesses might clarify what the rate is on that.  What is the bank's policy at the end of the term of the mortgage?  If, say, a family had &euro;100,000 parked, the house could be worth &euro;200,000.  Let us say they retire from work.  They are on fixed incomes or perhaps social welfare pensions and they do not have the &euro;100,000.  My question is, what happens then?

For example, in those split mortgages for owner-occupier, on average, about 40% to 50% of the mortgage is on interest only and, on average, about 50% to 60% would be paying down capital and interest.  For the remaining duration of the mortgage, therefore, the first part of it will pay down to zero and then there will be a lump sum left at the end of the period.

It is difficult to make direct comparison because application fees are common in other markets but we do not have them in Ireland.  The cash-back aspect is also a differentiator.  Mortgage risk-weighted assets in Ireland, which vary from 35% to 40%, are 3.2 times the average in Europe, where it is 11%.

I have read the documentation and will submit questions about it which, I imagine, will be the same questions Deputy Pearse Doherty will have.  When the bank reads the documentation, if it is genuine in its efforts to make the bank customer focused, it will recognise that those customers, some of whom are staff or retired staff, inarguably had a legitimate expectation that they would have rolled onto a tracker mortgage.  The fact that these people were never on a tracker is not directly relevant.  There are thousands of customers who have been deemed impacted in the whole tracker examination and were never on a tracker but had a contractual entitlement to one.  I know that, in accordance with the letter of the mortgage contract, these customers did not have a legal right and that appears to be the case on my reading of it.  It is, however, also undoubtedly the case that there was much communication telling those customers that they would have the option of rolling onto a tracker.  It is not relevant that the tracker product was withdrawn.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about 200 customers and I really think the smart thing for the bank to do is to come down on the side of those customers.  Those people had a legitimate expectation that they would be in a position to benefit from a tracker and I am not aware of any other major outstanding issues from Bank of Ireland's tracker examination.  We have outstanding issues with other institutions.

We are delighted to have the opportunity, on behalf of the north west, to make a presentation to this committee.  We met members of the committee when they visited Derry city recently and we found that meeting very worthwhile and useful.  We commend the committee on the work it does and the positive change it wants to effect for the entire island.<br\/><br\/>As the Chairman outlined, I am the chairman of Donegal County Council and joint chairman of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership.  I am joined by Councillor Gus Hastings of Derry City and Strabane District Council, who is also the chairman of the North West Regional Development Group; Councillor Bernard McGuinness from Donegal County Council, the vice-chairman of the North West Regional Development Group; Mr. John Kelpie, chief executive of Derry City and Strabane District Council; and Mr. Seamus Neely, chief executive, Donegal County Council.  I apologise on behalf of the Mayor of Derry who is otherwise engaged today but wanted his apologies to be acknowledged.<br\/><br\/>The brief we received for today's meeting was to make a presentation on the limitations of the committee, the way in which Brexit will affect us, the work we are doing in our counties and region to propel the areas we represent forward and the ways in which the committee can assist us in that work.  To provide some perspective on these issues, we will each cover a specific topic as part of a coherent presentation and in an effort to avoid duplication.<br\/><br\/>Derry is the fourth largest city on this island, as has been recognised by the Government in the national development plan.  The cross-Border region served by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council has a population of approximately 350,000.  We expect this to be recognised and we want the region to be treated as a major centre and city region on this island.  It is important for the growth and prosperity of the people and counties we represent that this is realised and understood, as it has been in the national development plan.  A memorandum of understanding has been signed by me, as chairman of Donegal County Council, John Boyle, as Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, and the chairman of the Northern and Western Regional Assembly.  We pay tribute to the Northern and Western Regional Assembly for holding a meeting in the chambers of Derry City and Strabane District Council.  It was a momentous occasion because it was the first time a regional assembly held an official meeting outside its jurisdiction.  The meeting was a beneficial exercise as members of the assembly acquired first-hand experience of the co-operation, partnership and symbiotic relationship between Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council, and were able to see that we in the region are one people.<br\/><br\/>As a Donegal person, Derry is the city I recognise as my city.  Everybody on my side will recognise that also.  The people of Derry recognise that Donegal is very much part of their extended boundary limits and region.  Derry and Donegal people share the same surnames and there has been great interaction between them for generations.  It is most unfortunate that political decisions were taken that did not reflect the will of people living in the region and did not benefit them.  The result was that the symbiosis and partnership of many years broke down to some degree.  We restarted that partnership in the mid-1990s and we are now working with each other.<br\/><br\/>Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council are working on a cross-Border basis like no other jurisdiction in Europe.  We are working for the benefit of both areas, rather than competing with each other.  If we can get a company, an economic driver or an educational driver - anything that benefits any part of the region - to locate in the region, it does not matter to people in Donegal if it locates Derry and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We realise that the benefits will be to the north west and we will work together, collaborate and co-operate to assist in any way we can.<br\/><br\/>Approximately 35% of the population in the north west are aged 25 years or younger.  We have the youngest population in Europe.  We are very proud of this and want to build on it.  We have to work harder than other parts of the island, however, to retain the young population in the region we represent.  We will ask for assistance in doing this.  The region has some 40,000 third-level students at the Magee campus of Ulster University in Derry, the North West Regional College and the Letterkenny Institute of Technology.<\/p><p> We have two major hospitals, namely, Letterkenny University Hospital and Altnagelvin Area Hospital on the outskirts of Derry.  We must remember that the Government pumps a significant amount of money into the services available at Altnagelvin because it is funded on a cross-Border basis.  It is also important to recognise that the services available at Altnagelvin, such as cancer and cardiac services, are dependent on the critical mass of the population of Donegal.  The cash injection by the Irish and British Governments was made because a critical mass was established such that it could be argued that those services were sustainable.  Effectively, things such as hard or other borders or changes to the cross-jurisdictional code that is currently in place would create difficulties not only in terms of movement, but also on a human level and in terms of making arguments to sustain services that serve the people of the region.<\/p><p> We are a subregional economic driver North and South.  Our symbiotic relationship incorporates our critical mass and the economic drive and delivery in the region.  We are very proud to be able to entice businesses or investment into our region by reason of the critical mass that is established throughout the Border region, including areas such as Donegal, Derry city, Strabane, Tyrone, Omagh and Limavady.  The population level of our region means that we should have services equal to or better than those in most of the rest of the island.  We have worked hard together to establish those services.  There is a perception in the Border counties from which we come that those services may be in danger because of decisions that might be taken.  It is a somewhat frustrating time.  Equally, it is a time of great thought with very little foresight.  There is substantial fear among people in our region that the consequences of decisions that may be made in Westminster will impact more on our region than on any other in Europe.<\/p><p> On my way to this meeting, I crossed the Border from Lifford into Strabane.  If one is travelling from Donegal to Dublin, our capital city, one must cross the Border twice.  On the geography of Donegal, its longest land border is with the North.  Only 3% of its land border is with the Republic of Ireland, totalling fewer than 10 km of border with County Leitrim.  We are connected to the Republic of Ireland by an umbilical cord.  It is important that the Border between Donegal and the Six Counties be strengthened, cherished and worked on.  We must ensure that it is not weakened and that nothing is allowed to stop progress or collaboration.<\/p><p> The infrastructural need of our region is the greatest challenge we face apart from Brexit.  Donegal is the county furthest from Dublin, but there is very poor road infrastructure to the county and its towns.  Services taken for granted in many other counties are absent in Donegal.  We have no rail line.  There is an airport, which is located very much to the north west of the county.  We are almost totally dependent on road links to our county.  The promised upgrade of the A5-N2 road network has been on the cards since the Good Friday Agreement was signed in the late 1990s.  However, there has been little or no impact on the ground in that regard and that has held the region back.  When representatives of the committee were in Derry, we asked that the progression of the A5-N2 be fast-tracked and made a major Government priority.  We repeat that request and ask that every effort be made by the committee and all Members of the Oireachtas to further its progression.  If one looks at a map of this island, the north west is the only area not connected by a major motorway or dual carriageway.  It is an area in which we will fall further behind if the A5-N2 is not progressed.  In the context of the impending decisions on Brexit, the lack of that road infrastructure puts our region at a serious disadvantage.  Were it not for the great relationship built by the executive members of both councils and copper-fastened by the elected representatives of all political persuasions of the councils, we would really be struggling.  We have stepped up to the plate in terms of putting Donegal, Derry and Tyrone on the map.  We want to continue in that vein and see support from the Westminster Government, the Stormont Assembly and the Irish Government. It is important that the A5-N2 be progressed and not shelved or put on ice.  We need progress, not buzzwords.  We want to see shovels in the ground because the project is of such importance to our area.  We ask that that message be taken back to the Government.  The road would allow us to realise our economic potential, retain people within our counties and regions and be more connected with the rest of the island of which we are all part.  It is incumbent on all Members of the Oireachtas to understand that we are as deserving of such infrastructure as any other part of the island.<\/p><p> Derry city is the only city region in the UK and Ireland on a jurisdictional border.  Up to 20% of the employees of Donegal County Council cross the Border daily.  Similarly, many thousands of people leave Donegal daily to work in areas such as Strabane, Omagh and Derry city.  The free movement of people is of great importance in the area.  It must be recognised that we are a special case because of the cross-Border jurisdictional nature of Derry city, the environs of which spill over well into Donegal.  We must not allow anything to impact negatively on free movement in the area. <\/p><p> For many years, planning on each side of the Border was done on a back-to-back basis.  However, since the fabulous news of the Good Friday Agreement and the work done by committees and Members of the relevant Parliaments in regard to its implementation, Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council have started working face to face.  We are talking to each other, working together, finding out what can be good for the region and understanding its needs as a whole rather than those of each individual county.  County boundaries in the Republic of Ireland are important but, where necessary, must be overlooked.  Equally, the Border between Donegal and Derry city and Strabane must be overlooked for the benefit of all the people of the area.  That has been done.  We must ensure that nothing is done to curb the good work that has been completed or undermine the relationship that exists between the two councils.<\/p><p> The final point I wish to address is Brexit.  We should not talk too much about Brexit today but it is important to stress that, no matter what happens, the situation under any deal that is reached will be less favourable than what is currently in place between our counties.  No matter how good we are told a deal is, it will not be as good as the current situation.  There has been reference to green cards and people being worried about insurance.  Those are concerns of a very practical nature.  However, delving into it more deeply, the potential impact in terms of healthcare, education, the free movement of people and goods and tariffs is frightening for people in Donegal and Derry.  The potential impact of Brexit on normal day-to-day lives is flabbergasting.  We wish for the current situation to be maintained.  The Government has been doing very good work on behalf of all the citizens of this island in being constructive with the EU and the UK regarding what will come after the date on which a decision is made, whether that be 12 April or a later date.  It is important that the real and negative impacts on the people of our region be taken into consideration in any negotiations, discussions or talks on Brexit.<\/p><p>The people who are making those decisions must know their decisions will change lives for the people from our region.  It is important that point is emphasised.  I will now ask Mr. John Kelpie, chief executive of Derry City and Strabane District Council, to continue from where I left off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019040400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus &Oacute; Domhnaill","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554383400,"counter":1554,"content":"<p>To pick up on what Mr. &Oacute; Domhnaill said, all cities in Ireland and Europe face significant challenges these days in terms of sustainable economic growth, social issues, cohesion and so on.  It is probably true that those cities that are attaining some degree of success in tackling these issues are doing so because they are collaborating on a wider regional level.  They understand the concept of a wider city region.  Local authorities around cities are beginning to pool their efforts to act as a more coherent subregion of the state in which the city is located.  With the success of other city regions in mind, Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council have begun this new collaboration.  For decades, as Mr. &Oacute; Domhnaill said, the two councils have collaborated on many projects and have been very successful.  However, many of these projects have been single-issue focused and there has not been a wider strategic collaboration at a city region level to tackle the big macro issues at a strategic level.  That is what is new.  That is what has changed in the north west over the past three or four years.<\/p> <p>  A new integrated strategic approach is being taken at four levels.  Each of the councils restructured in 2014 and 2015 with the reform of local government in both jurisdictions.  That acted as a catalyst for both councils to look at economic development in a new way using new powers allocated to councils.  Each council has done that with reference to the other.  At north west level, while collaboration always existed, these new structures have emerged.  We will say a little about that later on.  At national level, we understand now, as a city region, that we cannot drive forward the north west city region on our own but must collaboration with both Governments.  The degree of collaboration with both Governments has accelerated tremendously in recent years and our attendance at this meeting is evidence of this.  We have been here before and this relationship is maturing and developing.  At international level, we now collectively market the city region as one place.  We hold joint investment visits and we are looking at a joint tourism strategy.  We are looking at the benefits of both places overlapping in the highly competitive world market in which other city regions are competing.  It is very important that we do this.<\/p> <p>  The ultimate aim is to drive forward the city region.  What we are doing is place based leadership, the place being the cross-Border jurisdiction in which the city region sits.  We have completely shared objectives and work completely in partnership.  Very importantly, we are outcomes focused.  There is no point in doing any of this unless we change some of the fundamental indicators that have held the city region back over the years.  It is a very inclusive approach.  In the slides, members will see the partnership model.  It is very simple.  All of the complicated models that existed in past, of which there were very many in the crowded cross-border jurisdictional space, have been simplified down to the model in the slides.  The north west strategic growth partnership, which we represent, comprises six elected representatives from both councils who have been given delegated authority to take key decisions in respect of economic development, environmental regeneration and community cohesion.  This is coupled with input from senior representatives from all of the Government Departments in both jurisdictions.  Working with that strategic partnership, shown in the blue box on the slide, is the development group, shown in the green box.  Within the development group are all of our regional partners, the educational establishments, the chambers of commerce, our communities, the health sector and all of the various sectors.  It is a very simple model.  We believe it is the only model in the European Union, on the border of the European Union or across two jurisdictions that has cross-community, cross-council and national government participation and the authority and power to take key decisions in respect of that city region jurisdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019040400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kelpie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554383400,"counter":1555,"content":"<p>Mr. Kelpie describes the model we have developed in recent years.  We wanted to ensure this partnership provides a single platform to voice the needs of the region and, more important, to speak for the potential of the region and drive that potential.  We have done this.  On the approach in general, we view the work of the partnership with the two councils and all the other partners as being a concerted effort to develop the whole of the region.  Essentially, we are about ensuring that things continue to happen in a way that better underpins the functioning of our local communities.<\/p> <p>  As we heard from the previous two speakers, the integral connections between the communities across both council areas are particularly important.  There is also a very strong focus on alignment of resources and effort around the development of the place, and on the development of policy that underpins the development of place and the functioning of communities generally.  We do that across three broad regionally agreed objectives, namely, economic growth and investment; physical and environmental development; and social and community cohesion and well-being.  It is a whole-of-place, whole-of-people, whole-of-communities approach.  We are now able to plug into a structure that brings in local and business perspectives and includes all the partners at local level as well as the councils.  Very importantly, it forges an opportunity to connect with the programmes of Government North and South to create an alignment that ensures maximum efficiency in the deployment of resources.  Essentially, we wanted to avoid duplication of effort and the deployment of competition where collaboration brings better outcomes.  At the end of the day, it is about realising the full potential of our place, which includes the fourth largest city on the island of Ireland.  It is, therefore, a very significant place.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kelpie referred to the wider partnership.  It involves education, business, community, councils and government.  Under the education and skills heading, our partners at local level are Ulster University at Magee, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, the North-West Regional College and Donegal Education and Training Board.  They are working on an aligned basis with the co-ordinated policies of both councils and the partners generally around those broad headings.  That has, for example, led to the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the four institutions which is now supported by a resource to develop it.  It is about ensuring there is continued capacity for our educational facilities to understand as quickly as possible the current and emerging skills and educational needs of our communities and businesses, so that there is capacity to respond on a real-time basis.  Bespoke classes are being put in place across all four institutions and 100% of the students that go through those courses go straight into employment at local level.  That is because there has been a joined-up approach.  Education is not being provided just because of the numbers but has been aligned with need.  That would not have happened to the same extent before and the approach is working very well.<\/p> <p>  We have developed international partnerships, particularly in the US but also in China.  The skills development piece has been across that as well.  In addition, and we do not always say this because we expect that people know, we have our joint north west promotion on marketing investment.<\/p><p>We would never now look at developing something in isolation without ensuring a collaborative approach is not the best option.  That is now second nature to us.  One of the things we are doing now is developing a city region dashboard so that can be there on an iterative basis where all of our citizens and business partners across the board, internal and external, and indeed beyond the region can come in and have a look at what is there, what the opportunities are and what the local statistics are to ensure there is real-time information around what are the opportunities and requirements of our region.  We have had a particular emphasis on supporting our SMEs in the north east of the US.  We have in-market support in the US.  One of them focuses on developing opportunities for our SME sector and more recently we have collectively deployed a resource to help us establish opportunities, particularly on the FDI side, in support of both the IDA, INI and Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p> We have done a lot of work on Brexit analysis.  We were the first two councils to commission collectively a detailed piece of work, working with Queen's University Belfast, the University of Ulster and Trinity College Dublin, that began immediately after the referendum and provided an opportunity to understand at local level what the issues were, to engage with all of our communities around that and to capture the energy and concerns that have been developed at local level and see how they might be constructively managed in a way we could articulate to both Governments but also to the EU.  That has been successful.  That work has continued.  More recently, we have worked with the other nine councils that are at or near the Border to develop a whole-of-Border approach to that.<\/p><p> Some of the specific examples we have done together supporting the economy and tourism at local level involve things like the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open and a feasibility study for the deep water cruise ship berthing at Lough Foyle in partnership with Foyle Port.  Things we are working on currently include the development of our north-west joint tourism strategy.  What we have done is ensure that our work together enables us to focus on the practicalities of what needs to be done to support communities.  Some of the examples I mentioned do that.  We have also ensured that while this is ongoing, that effort and energy is deployed in a manner that is consistent with and feeding from both regional and national policies so there has been a significant focus on ensuring that we articulate what our needs are in the national process, feed into and respect it and develop our own policies from that.  I will hand back to my colleague, Mr. John Kelpie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019040400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Neely","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554383400,"counter":1557,"content":"<p>With regard to spatial planning, probably one of the largest pieces of work we originally did was working with Government to establish the Derry-Letterkenny cross-Border city region prominently in the national planning framework and the national development plan.  Very importantly, as the fourth largest city region, the primary objective of the city region is to become a positive contributor economically to the economy on both sides of the Border.  To do so, it is really important that it is strategically recognised as such so we are very pleased with the prominence the city region has been given in both those documents.  We hope to use that prominence to advance many of the outcomes of the city region and deliver for both Governments on many of the objectives of the respective programmes for government so that is a very important piece of work for us.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at the whole spatial planning piece in the north west.  Both planning departments are looking at infrastructure and physical development.  We are beginning to look, not on a back-to-back basis as happened previously, but with a co-joined approach.  We mentioned Brexit, which is the topic of the day.  While the debate continues to rage, particularly in Westminster, as to what Brexit might look like at some point in the future, as the city region that will probably be most impacted by whatever type of Brexit emerges, we are already beginning to look at a post-Brexit landscape.  What might the landscape of the north-west city region look like and what are those opportunities?  We focused a great deal on the challenges in recent years but how might we move beyond this into a new era regardless of how Brexit falls in the coming months?  We recently commissioned a very exciting piece of work with Harvard University in Massachusetts working in collaboration with the University of Ulster, Maynooth University and Letterkenny Institute of Technology to engage our communities to take that piece of work forward.  We are about half way through that and hope to finish that piece of work in the next number of months.  That is a really exciting opportunity for any city region to be undertaking not least one at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019040400002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kelpie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554383400,"counter":1558,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the work it is doing and for inviting us.  I have been a member of the cross-Border committee for many years.  We have worked and progressed and the cross-Border committee has developed to where we are today.  It is very exciting.  We start off from a position of peripherality in terms of both Governments.  The most peripheral area is Donegal when viewed from Dublin while Derry-Strabane is the most peripheral area when viewed from Belfast or London.  If one starts off from that position with a border down the centre of it, one knows that affects economic development.  That is where we came from.  We are working to try to bridge that.<\/p> <p>  I am dealing with the environment, infrastructure and regeneration.  The Department for Infrastructure, DFI, is the utmost importance to us.  In respect of that connection to Dublin and the A6 to Belfast, the development of roads in the north west is crucial to the further development of the city region.  Having a city region is tremendous but not being able to travel to or from there is not.  Much work has been done on the N13 and N14 economic corridor, the TEN-T routes, the A6 to Belfast and N2 to Dublin.  That is the most important thing for us at the moment.<\/p> <p>  The multi-modal transport hub in the Waterside is a &euro;30 million development.  I have reservations about the frequency of the trains.  If someone cannot leave Derry city and get a connecting train through to Dublin via Belfast, that must be dealt with.  We met Transport Infrastructure Ireland and I made that point to it.<\/p> <p>  We have done other major developments that are within our remit.  The Strabane-Lifford project is at an advanced funding stage.  The north-west greenway will cost &euro;18 million and will cover 46 km from Derry to Muff.  Those things are in progress and tremendous funding has been provided.  The regional greenways technical feasibility study is underway.<\/p> <p>  There are two airports in the region, City of Derry Airport and Donegal Airport in Carrickfinn.  Information sharing and collaboration on the operation of route development are taking place.  That is very important for us.  It is very important that people can get to the region.  The development of a regional energy strategy and climate adaptation strategy relates to general policy on climate change and monitoring the same.  I started on this committee many years ago.  It goes back to having a proper road structure.  We are doing all this and have demonstrated this to Governments.  I salute both our chief executives and their councils for the work they do but we need infrastructure.<\/p><p>We need roads.  We do not have a train service into the area other than Derry city.  One cannot get that connection from Derry to Dublin.  That should be insisted upon.  I believe that with all of this, we would have a much better area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019040400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554383400,"counter":1560,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for inviting us.  This is my second time here.  Last time I came was for the north-west rural development INTERREG programme.  We raised many of the issues that we are raising today.  Some have been resolved.  The first time we talked about Altnagelvin was with regard to the cancer unit which is now up and running.  It has pride of place and it helps people from both sides of the Border.  We run many projects together for Donegal, Derry and Strabane.  The relationship has blossomed over the last four years.  Prior to that, we had a good relationship but we tended to be in silos because in the past, we had as many as six councils working together and now we have two major councils in the north west.  One of the most important things for us is that the relationships that are built up now continue even after Brexit.  We do not know what it will look like but it is definitely on its way.  We do not know exactly how soft or how hard it will be but this should not affect the Derry, Donegal and Strabane partnership.<\/p> <p>  Over the years, there has been a lack of investment, to say the least, in the north west.  It does not take a rocket scientist to know that.  The Chairman is well aware of it.  I want to talk about health and well-being.  The projects we have done include the cross-Border one on greenways and environmental development.  Inch and Ballykelly are good examples of what can be done when people get together and start to think as a unit.  I launched this particular project two weeks ago on behalf of north-west sporting pathways.  This is for all sports in the north west, especially the big four: rugby, ladies' rugby, cricket, football, Gaelic sports etc.  They have come together and the training will have a cross-Border emphasis.  It will not just look at individuals but at the whole.  That is good for all of Ireland because when people come together and work at those lower levels, it evolves very quickly.  Where friendships are cemented and built upon, they remain.  They are not imposed.  They are there because people want to be in them.<\/p> <p>  I am glad that everybody recognises that we are a region.  For a while, one would have thought that we were a small area.  The population of the north west is approximately 330,000.  In Derry and Strabane, there are 149,000.  There is a significant number to cover and a question of how to pay for them, which is where the real problem comes in.  When we set out our stall, we and our officials sit down together, look at the strategy and what is the best and most economic way to fulfil it.  If one looks at the most recent trip to Boston, one can see how beneficial it was to us.  Very few of the groups that went there are not doing business now with Boston and the north east of America.<\/p> <p>  We want to evolve the grassroots' organisations, such as sporting organisations.  That is only one of many.  Where one goes to next is the important matter.  Regardless of whether Brexit comes or not, the city deal needs to go ahead.  It is not that we want it to go ahead: it needs to go ahead.  We need to send a message to the rest of Europe and the rest of the world that we are open for business.  I hope the committee continues to support us on those issues.<\/p> <p>  When people talk about the Good Friday Agreement, they tend not to look at the detail.  We need to be very aware of that.  We would not have it without partnership and development and relationships being built on a solid foundation.  Otherwise it would have fallen apart.  There are those in the North of Ireland who want to see it dismantled.  We are well aware of that but we are not here to support that premise because some of what needs to be done has to happen immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019040400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gus Hastings"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554383400,"counter":1561,"content":"<p>We have heard a lot about what we are doing.  It is important that we lay out what we want our next steps to be and where we want assistance from this committee and other committees within these Houses.  Looking at the current projects and initiatives that have been approved by the EU and both Governments, it is essential that they are continued to fruition and completion.  We know, with the impending decisions that could be made, that there may be a premise that funding from different sectors could be stopped for projects on either side of the Border.  We would strongly request the committee to do everything in its power to ensure that any projects or initiatives that have been approved or commenced are finished to fruition and seen out for the betterment of the whole region.  We also see much discussion with regard to Derry city receiving a city deal from the British Government.  Talks are at a very advanced stage.  They are of a sensitive nature.  We have taken an initiative at a political and executive level where we have signed a letter and asked the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, that if a city deal is given for one part of the region, the Donegal side of the Border should receive similar funding to realise its full potential.  We need that to happen and we are looking forward to that.<\/p> <p>  We see inward investment coming into Ireland daily.  We as councils are working hard to get inward investment into our own area and region.  I commend the councils for doing that.  Perhaps if the bodies that are charged at a national level to take inward investment to all parts of this island were doing their job, there would not be as much of an onus on our councils to work as hard as they are to try to attract inward investment to a region in the north west of this island that can sometimes be forgotten about.  We want to ensure that we are at the table and that when we are at the table we are taken seriously.  That is why we are delighted to have the invitation today.<\/p> <p>  There is the potential of future territorial co-operation funding.  We look forward to that commencing and continuing in the future.  In that regard, on behalf of the group and the north-west strategic growth partnership, I thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, and the Northern Ireland Executive Office for their commitment, collaboration, buy-in, the vision that they have for what we are doing and their continued support for us.<\/p><p>We ask them to have faith in us and to continue to support us because we are doing this for the betterment of our region, our council, our people, our education, our health, our infrastructure and every facet of what is needed in those areas, not in Donegal or Derry but in the whole area.  A tranche of north-west partnership funding has been put into what the two councils are doing and we ask the committee to ensure that funding is continued and renewed, irrespective of what happens in Westminster or what decisions are taken at EU level, so that what we are doing can be strengthened and built upon into the future and the full potential of our region can be realised.  We ask the Vice Chairman and Deputy Crowe to use their good offices to ensure that happens.<\/p><p> I heartily congratulate the committee on the work it has done.  We are very aware of the good, hard and diligent work it undertakes on behalf of all the people, North and South, in regard to the Good Friday Agreement.  We want to work with the committee in the future and if we can do anything, either politically or on the executive side, we are more than willing to help.  The things the committee is trying to achieve will be beneficial to all of Ireland.

They were detailed, well presented and positive but they also outlined the challenges that face the region.  As our Vice Chairman said, this meeting follows on from the detailed briefing we had with the witnesses at the Guild Hall some months ago.  In my earliest days in the Oireachtas, I recall that the late Donegal Senator, Paddy McGowan, was a powerful advocate for the needs of Donegal and neighbouring counties in the north west.  He always spoke about the potential for cross-Border development, even in the early 1990s when things were rather dark on this island.  Listening to the witnesses today, one gets a sense of the results of the huge co-operation between Derry and Donegal and the benefits of the different initiatives that were painstakingly put in place for all the people of the region.  A big step forward has been achieved.  It was not achieved without people on all political sides stepping out of a comfort zone and pushing the boundaries in the best interests of all the people.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that Mr. &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned the memorandum of understanding being signed with the north and west regional assembly.  I was speaking to some of the members of that assembly on the day we were in the Guild Hall and they were very glad about it.  The counties in the north and west regional assembly are Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo and Galway and it is very important that the group works with its neighbours, namely, Derry and the part of Tyrone that is in the Donegal catchment area.  There are many similar needs in the area and there are similar opportunities for development.  When we think of the western part of the country, we have a tendency to think of an older age cohort but it is heartening that 35% of the 350,000 population are under the age of 25.  It is very encouraging information and it bodes very well for the future.  As Mr. &Oacute; Domhnaill and Mr. Kelpie said, there need to be huge efforts to ensure the retention of people in the area through third level and further education, because keeping talent in the region is very important.  We had the opportunity to meet with people at some of the colleges in Derry and we had met people from the Letterkenny Institute of Technology on a previous visit.  It is great to see such co-operation and collaboration because it makes the best use of limited resources.<\/p> <p>  In the last D&aacute;il and at my request, this committee met Donegal and Omagh district councils regarding the development of the N2\/A5.  I had requested representations to this committee as it was not really moving forward and we wanted to keep the project on the agenda.  Every one of today's witnesses spoke of the importance of that project and it is important in my constituency too, on the Monaghan side.  Anybody who travels from Dublin to Letterkenny and on to Derry will know of this yawning gap in infrastructure that needs to be reversed.  We have consistently supported the project over the years and we want it to move forward as it is absolutely essential.<\/p> <p>  We do not know what the outcome of Brexit will be but we all know that it will be negative and adverse for all of our island, regardless of what form of Brexit comes about.  As I have said in the D&aacute;il Chamber and at this committee, there are decisions on investment and infrastructure that are within the competence of our own Government, even if there are other areas where the Government or the Oireachtas will not get their way because the decisions on them will be taken in other fora.  We appeal to the Government to identify the infrastructural needs of, and to prioritise, the Border region in this regard, because that region will be impacted first and most adversely by Brexit.  If we do not have a modern infrastructure to assist businesses in remaining competitive and to make our region easier to get to, we will be in difficulty.  The N2\/A5 upgrade is essential in this regard, as are other road links throughout the Derry-Donegal region and in the north and west region.  All of us in the Oireachtas, as I am sure is the case in other parliamentary assemblies, have asked the Government to prioritise the infrastructural needs of the Border region, which is at the frontier of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  It is heartening to listen to the witnesses today and to hear what has been achieved.  In my earliest days in the Oireachtas, I listened to colleagues from Donegal and I heard councillors from the north west too.  While it is good to hear what has been achieved, the challenge is to realise the potential in the best interests of our people.  The Irish central Border area network, ICBAN, and the eastern Border region to which the Vice Chairman was closely associated in the past, came to this committee some weeks ago and made excellent presentations.  There is a determination within each of these regional groupings to deal with the challenges we have.  I will continue to support their important and valuable work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019040400002#H00300","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554383400,"counter":1565,"content":"<p>It is great to see the committee members today.  We had a presentation from the partnership a number of months ago in the region but it is great for them to be here in Dublin to make a presentation.<\/p><p>As the members know, I am a major advocate of the work of the partnership.  I am extremely supportive and very proud to be somewhat associated with the work that has been carried out to date with the partnership.  Everyone spoke of the uniqueness of the co-operation and collaboration and it is true.  It is fair to say there is nothing of the like elsewhere.  There have been various attempts at cross-Border initiatives over the past number of years but I have no doubt that what is happening in the north west is unique.  All our Border constituencies should be looking at this as a potential model for future development.<br\/><br\/>With the next steps outlined in the presentation, there are a number of requests.  It is important as a committee that we go through them and perhaps make some suggestions.  With regard to the continued partnership funding, a question was posed to An Taoiseach by our party leader a number of weeks ago about the commitment from the Irish Government for financial assistance.  I am glad to say An Taoiseach spoke very favourably on it but as a committee perhaps we could seek clarity on the current status of that assistance to ensure there is no confusion coming to the stage of the finalised current budget?<br\/><br\/>With respect to potential territorial co-operation, in Brussels a few weeks ago I met the vice chairman of the European Committee on Regional Development, Mr. Joachim Zeller, MEP, to speak about the uniqueness of the cross-Border areas.  The Irish Government is in conversation with the European Commission on potential post-Brexit funding.  My understanding to date is that it will not come into the Northern constituencies, although this is entirely inappropriate.  There needs to be a conversation with the Irish Government about a plea that any post-Brexit funding should come into the Six Counties of the North and a particular focus of that funding should be in the Border constituencies.  It has already been referenced here and there is absolutely no doubt as report after report indicates that the Border constituencies will be the worst affected areas in a good, bad or any type of Brexit.  I saw a report very recently indicating that the constituency I represent is at the bottom of two leagues and is 650th from the Westminster constituencies with respect to the cost of food and living standards in any potential Brexit.  That is not even unique to the north west and as members can imagine, all the Border constituencies will have problems.  There must be conversations involving the Irish Government on the post-Brexit territorial funding that could potentially come from Europe.<br\/><br\/>With regard to inward investment and economic development, Sinn F&eacute;in regularly meets officials and the Government in the South, as well as the British Government and officials in the Northern Ireland Civil Service, NICS, to ensure there is collaborative funding.  There is no point in funding the north-west region solely from either a Westminster perspective or the Northern Executive end and forgetting about the Irish Government.  It is fair to say the Irish Government has again spoken very favourably, standing up to the mark and potentially putting in additional funding at a stage when it thinks it might be appropriate.  I am a little concerned as to when that will be and who will make that request.  I am familiar with the letter that has gone from the partnership to the Government here in the South on potential funding.  As a committee, we could perhaps flesh that out a bit and see where the conversations are with the Departments down here.  It may be particularly useful if a request is sent from this committee to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Joe McHugh, about the cross-Border education initiatives we are discussing.  I know there is the potential for investment into the university in the city region but again I am not sure how far those conversations have developed.  They need to move on from where they are currently.<br\/><br\/>Everybody has spoken about the A5 and of course we are all supportive of that project.  My party colleague was last month at this meeting and An T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, was here to discuss the absolute necessity for the completion of the A5.  I giggled to myself yesterday as I was quite excited to see a notification in the <i>Derry Journal<\/i>about the A5.  I thought it was extremely sad for me to be excited about an environment impact process but all the same there is movement on the A5, so we must ensure that it does not stop in the way that it has in the past.  Again, we have heard a commitment from the Irish Government at various levels that the funding will be available but we need to ensure the department in the North moves this as quickly as possible.  Again, I have some faith that is moving in the right direction.  It is a flagship project and I take Deputy Brendan Smith's point on the need for projects such as the A5 to be ring-fenced in some way because of the changes in the Government.  In the North, we deemed it a flagship project, so regardless of the Minister, the Government must ensure it continues.  Perhaps that could be considered from this end.<br\/><br\/>I congratulate everybody on the work they have undertaken.  I suggest a follow-up from the delegation's end from the vice chairperson of the regional development committee.  Perhaps there could be a reflection on the conversations with respect to bringing the potential post-Brexit funding into the north west and all the Border constituencies.  I congratulate the witnesses on the large volume of work they have all undertaken.  I have no doubt, Brexit or no Brexit, that this relationship will continue to flourish and it is must do and we have no choice.  We are on the periphery and work undertaken to date can only grow in the years and months ahead.  We will do anything that we as a committee or our parties can do to help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019040400002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Elisha McCallion","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554383400,"counter":1567,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation and commend them on the work they have been doing and continue to do.

Newry, Mourne and Down District Council has been tied with Belfast so our bonus will be the southern relief road when the money comes through and also regeneration of the city.  We are very aware of the same problems in terms of cross-Border workers and the impact on them.  My background is in dealing with benefits and there are complex cases with respect to tax credits, for example, that will become ten times more complex.  These matters will affect people's daily lives, which is important to note.  Whatever Brexit happens, it will have an adverse effect on the witnesses and the area and constituency I represent.  I commend the witnesses on their work and it was a very interesting presentation.  We have much in common.  Newry, Mourne and Down District Council and Louth County Council have a memorandum of understanding that has been signed for many years and its effects are continuing.

When travelling between Dungannon and Donegal, its importance for the development of Donegal and the entire north-west region can be seen at every stage of the way.  We have to keep it on the agenda and not allow it to become a political football, because there is a danger that it could be used in that way.  We should try to encourage those along the way to allow it to proceed and to be in place as quickly as possible.  <\/p><p> Another important area is co-operation and working together, CAWT, and cross-border health and well-being.  Altnagelvin Hospital's new wing, and the affect it has had for cancer patients in particular, has opened a new healthcare dimension for Donegal.  Good work was done by the Assembly a number of years ago on the hospital and the tie-in with CAWT and cross-border development.  I hope that continues.  <\/p><p> Training and employment is another issue.  In my area, mid-Ulster and Tyrone, there are many trained engineers, but one of the big problems the area faces is the availability of labour.  We have to find ways of training new people, but also to attract new men and women into the engineering sector.  If that does not happen, the sector will move somewhere else, and there is a danger that those jobs will be lost.  We should look at training and employment as a means of keeping people in the area, but retraining should also be considered.  People who have been in different types of jobs could, for various reasons, consider retraining in the engineering sector.  People I met last week were considering the idea of robots which would carry out the engineering and welding.  It would be awful if young people from the area had to move away.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee for the work it is doing.  It is very important.

Ms McCallion is most familiar with those issues because she represents the area and works closely with Donegal County Council and within the grouping.  It is heartening to hear a group of people with influence say that they are here to support us and to work with us, because we feel we are doing great work and making a difference, not just in the region we represent but, as the Vice Chairman said, overseas and beyond by showing people what we have to offer, how we can offer it and what is available if they decide to return.  We also give opportunities to businesses and economic drivers in our own region.  We have worked hard at that in recent years.  It would not have come about if not for the fact that both chief executives were comfortable with each other and confident enough in themselves to realise that this was not about their own jurisdictions and their own jobs but the people in the entire region.  The political representatives followed, based on the confidence shown by the chief executives, and we commend them very highly for that.<\/p> <p>  We now find ourselves in a position where decisions which have not been taken by anyone anywhere on this island may impact more on the region we represent than any other region in all of Europe.  As Deputy Brendan Smith said, we are going to champion the region.  We are resilient and we believe in what we have to offer.  Indeed, we believe what we have to offer is as good as anywhere else in Europe.  Broadband speeds, for example, in Donegal and Derry are on par with the broadband speeds in Europe, thanks to Project Kelvin.  People do not necessarily understand that about the region; Donegal is seen as rural.  Derry, of course, is a city.  We have things we can celebrate, sell and champion, and we will do that irrespective of the decisions taken and the impacts they have on us.  All we are seeking from this committee and the rest of the Oireachtas is a little support, co-operation and funding to allow us to realise our full potential.  This is not for us but for the people in that area. <\/p> <p>  I thank the members of the committee for their input and their kind, supportive words.  We look forward to a good, bright, forward-thinking future for all of the people in our area.  We look at things such as rail connections between Derry and Letterkenny and transport hubs in Letterkenny.  We have considered the need for the Waterside transport hub and how it will benefit all of the people of the region.  As Deputy Brendan Smith, Ms McCallion and others have said, the A5 is integral to anything we will do and anything we will be able to achieve.  We want to stress that point.

I am looking forward to the questions of committee members arising from the presentation of the Irish Local Development Network.<\/p> <p>  Before discussing the reports, it would be useful to give a brief overview of the evolution of policy and practice in the area of activation and the direction these reforms have taken.  The period from 2011 to 2019 has seen significant reforms to the Government&rsquo;s approach to supporting people who are unemployed in their return to the labour market.  The changes have included streamlining and reorganisation of the services on offer from the Department through Intreo; the introduction of new services and schemes, including recruitment subsidies such as JobsPlus; work placements under JobBridge; tailored training under MOMENTUM and conversion education under Springboard; an increase in the number of case officers directly employed and indirectly provided via contract; the tailoring of the Department's approach to jobseekers using the model developed by the ESRI; and increasing the number of places on, and adjusting the approach taken within, State employment schemes, such as community employment, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme.  The Department has also developed an employer engagement strategy and a team to work very closely with employers on initiatives such as JobsPlus and national jobs week, which ran very successfully last week.  I pay tribute to all of the organisers and participants as it really was a success.<\/p> <p>  In all of these initiatives, we applied the principle of rights and responsibilities to encourage people in receipt of payments for jobseeking to actively engage with all or some of our services.<\/p><p>All of these changes were developed and implemented as part of the pathways to work strategy based on expert research and advice from bodies such as the OECD, ESRI and NESC.  Of particular relevance is the 2009 OECD report on activation policies in Ireland, the 2010 ESRI report on employment services and the 2011 report from NESC on services and supports for jobseekers.<\/p><p> The changes were overseen and guided by the Labour Market Council comprised of experts such as Dr. John Martin, former head of employment and social affairs at the OECD, Professor Philip O&rsquo;Connell of UCD, Ms Br&iacute;d O&rsquo;Brien of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU, Dr. John Sweeney of National Economic and Social Council, NESC, Dr. Peter Rigney of ICTU, and Mr. Tony Donohoe of IBEC together with senior leaders from a number of large employers<\/p><p> These changes have not only borne fruit but have been, in the main, warmly welcomed, by the jobseekers we serve.  The evidence for this can be seen in the reductions in unemployment and, in particular, long-term unemployment as we emerged from the recession that lasted from 2009 to 2013.  This labour market recovery differs markedly from that witnessed in Ireland following previous recessions or what was witnessed in other countries affected by that global crisis.  In previous recessions, it took more than six years of sustained economic growth for unemployment to respond and even longer for long-term unemployment to fall.  This time around the experience has been different.<\/p><p> Although it is difficult to attribute this performance in a quantitative way to specific actions and measures, there is some evidence the committee should consider.  Econometric studies of JobBridge, the back to work education allowance and JobPath, together with a value for money review of JobsPlus, all indicate a positive impact on employment outcomes for participants compared to non-participants.  The recently published ESRI econometric assessment of the streamlined Intreo process commissioned by my Department indicates that the reforms improved exits from the live register.<\/p><p> Furthermore, external commentary on the economy by the OECD, EU and IMF have singled out our activation reforms as being particularly effective in contributing to reducing unemployment.  Reviews of the Intreo process reforms by the INOU and by the European network of Public Employment Services have also been positive.  Perhaps most important, our customer satisfaction tracking research, commissioned externally and conducted independently, indicates high levels of customer satisfaction with the service and the services offered.<\/p><p> All of this evidence suggests that we do not need to implement major reforms of our approach to activation.  We now operate in line with best practice internationally.  That is not to say that we cannot do better and, in particular, that there are not changes that we need to make to adjust to our improving economic situation.  It is in this context that the two Indecon reviews on local employment services, LES, and job clubs were published last January will be considered.  Members will agree that the reviews are broadly positive regarding the impacts of the LES and job clubs, recognising the role the LES play in engaging with those furthest from the labour market as well as the useful role of job clubs in working with more job-ready clients.  Nonetheless, the Indecon reviews make several useful recommendations that are being considered by my Department.<\/p><p> Transitioning to multi-annual contracts from the current annual contracts, as suggested in the reviews, would enable contractors to plan for the medium term while the enhanced use of performance metrics would enable my Department to ensure that the performance of contracted employment services are of benefit to jobseekers and of value to taxpayers.<\/p><p>  On procurement, the Indecon reviews suggest that open or public competitive procurement be actively considered.  A move to competitive procurement is also consistent with legal advice my Department has received with regard to its obligations under EU procurement legislation.  Accordingly, this is a matter that is currently receiving active consideration.<\/p><p> In December, I had the privilege of addressing the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, conference where I informed the delegates that the Indecon reports would be published in early 2019.  There were naturally some concerns and nervousness due to delegates not having seen the reviews but we assured them they had nothing to be nervous about and that once the reviews were published, we would meet them and discuss the reports.<\/p><p> Senior officials from my Department met representatives of the LES and job clubs on 25 January last, shortly after the publication of the reviews.  They were joined by a partner from Indecon responsible for drafting the reviews who presented his findings and took questions.  The LES and job clubs have broadly welcomed the Indecon reviews and I am happy that they are positively engaging with my Department, as they always have.  The continued longevity and success of LES and job clubs cannot be based on standing still or an assumption that contracts will be renewed irrespective of legal requirements or service performance considerations.  From our discussions it is clear that the LES and job clubs understand that they need to adapt to changing circumstances.  It is encouraging to see their openness to change and reform and I am optimistic that we will continue to benefit from their services for years to come.<\/p><p> An econometric review of the JobPath service by the Department's statistics unit, led by a senior statistician on secondment from the CSO with support and input from the OECD, is nearing completion and I expect that the results will be published next week.<\/p><p> Some commentators have sought to present the service procured via JobPath as being somehow in competition with that procured via the LES and job clubs.  This simplistic presentation which has been put to me on numerous occasions is also misplaced.  To be clear, it is my view, and that of my Department, including people who were there long before me, that these services complement rather than compete with each other.<\/p><p> The evidence in Ireland, just as in every other labour market around the world, is that people who are long-term unemployed face significant challenges in securing employment opportunities.  For some long-term unemployed people, the period of unemployment is prolonged; this requires that there is a mix of services and service providers available to them over this period.  That is why we have LES and job clubs, JobPath, State-employment schemes such as community employment and T&uacute;s and a mix of education and training schemes via SOLAS and its contracted service providers.<\/p><p> Services can at different stages of unemployment offer different opportunities and supports to unemployed jobseekers.  Currently, with approximately 77,000 long-term unemployed people on the live register and a further 45,000 engaged in programmes such as community employment, CE, there is more than enough work for all of our service providers.  There may be a fear that a particular mindset is present but unfortunately there are more than enough unemployed people for all our services to help.  We would not be able to do what we need to support those people without the support of all our services.  <\/p><p> Looking at the future, the development of our service strategy will be driven by the twin purposes at the core of all public employment services.  First, the activation function of Public Employment Services, PES, is to facilitate the smooth functioning of the labour market by encouraging labour market participation and reducing what economists call \"friction\" as people enter, leave or move within the workforce.  It does this by trying to ensure that unemployed workers are matched through advice, counselling, work experience and training to job opportunities and to ensure that the job opportunities are in fact notified to, and made available to jobseekers.  Activation also means working with employers to make it easy for them to take on workers and specifically to encourage them to give unemployed workers, whom they might not otherwise consider, the opportunity to prove their worth and continue to work in the organisations where they get work experience.<\/p><p> The second core purpose of PES is social inclusion.  To ensure that unemployed workers are not disenfranchised by not having the social or family capital or network that gives them access to employment opportunities.  It is not simply enough for the State to passively provide income supports and then leave people to figure out on their own how best to find and sustain employment.  We have a duty to offer supports in the form of advice, work experience opportunities, training and education and occupational activities to all jobseekers.  In doing this, we provide a social capital or a public network to all unemployed workers that can help redress any inequality arising from differences in social and family capital.<\/p><p> This twin purpose of activation and social inclusion applies regardless of the economic backdrop.  However the challenges faced in delivering on this purpose changes as employment conditions vary.<\/p><p> We are, at this stage, moving from a position of having an excess supply of labour to one where labour supply is tightening.  This challenges us to create opportunities to bring more people into the labour market and to extend our services to other groups of people whom we could not reach, given constrained resources, during recessionary times.  This includes improving and expanding services for women not currently active in the workplace, but who want to be, and similarly for people with disabilities.  We are also moving from a position where many unemployed people had a strong record of prior employment to one where those people who are now long-term unemployed are increasingly characterised by weak labour market attachment and significant employment barriers.<\/p><p>This group of people requires more intensive support, delivered via a mixture of services and service providers, as I have outlined.<\/p><p> The Department is currently reviewing how it will adapt its services to address these challenges.  This is unlikely to require a major overhaul of service provision.  However, it will require a refocusing of effort and it is more than likely to require some redesign of our services to attune them to the needs of people facing significant barriers to taking up employment.  We are in the process of designing the activation and support services for the next generation.  At the moment we are lucky enough for our unemployment numbers to be coming down but these programmes need to be scalable.  If anything happens to employment in this country again, God forbid, we need to be able to scale them up easily.  The changes we have made to the design of the youth employment support scheme, YESS, which helps young people with significant barriers to employment to gain valuable workplace experience, are an example of the redesign of schemes that were working but can have a much more positive impact with a small number of tweaks. <\/p><p> One thing that I will not do is make the mistake made by previous administrations, with all due respect to them.  In periods of economic growth the State's PES were effectively allowed to wind down and wither through disuse because we did not need them.  This happened without any acknowledgement that we would need to be able to turn on the tap again.  In any future downturn in the economic cycle we do not want to have to rebuild the PES from scratch, as we unfortunately did between 2011 and 2015.  Although we have had major success, there is no doubt that we lost too much time in rebuilding the service.  This led to a situation where we entered the recession with far more people unemployed than would have been the case if the public employment service had been operating effectively for the previous several years. <\/p><p> A 2009 estimate from the OECD suggested the number on the live register was approximately 100,000 higher than it would have been if the PES were operating to best practice levels in those years.  In refocusing our efforts I will not countenance any reduction in capacity.  Between Intreo, LES and JobPath staff, we have approximately 800 case officers at present.  At a minimum I intend to maintain that capacity to the extent that I can, given available resources.  I also intend to extend the Department&rsquo;s service offerings to help other groups to access employment opportunities; people with disabilities and people, mainly women, who left employment to mind our children.<\/p><p> I believe that these are objectives on which we can all agree.  I look forward to hearing the committee's views and answering any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#A00300","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1583,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#C00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1584,"content":"<p>The Minister will not be surprised that I have a few observations and questions.  I eagerly awaited the opening statement which arrived late this afternoon.  I read it with some interest.  I thank her for coming before the committee, presenting her opening statement and addressing questions.  There is an awful lot of concern out there.  She has engaged positively with the ILDN but there is also a lot of fear.  That fear was echoed by representatives of the ILDN and SIPTU when they came before the committee.  There are concerns about the future for the LES and for job clubs.  The Indecon report shows what a massive success they have been.  Some statistics jump out.  In 2012, we had an unemployment rate of 16%; it dropped to 6.7% before the onset of JobPath.  This clearly shows that the successful schemes that were in place were making a massive impact in addressing the unemployment crisis we had at that point.  The Minister says that JobPath has been the most successful labour activation scheme in the history of the State and cites the drop in unemployment figures.  However, this drop had started and was brought about by the successful schemes that had been in place.<\/p> <p>  The Indecon report also shows that the LES achieved a 28.8% success rate.  The target was 30%.  My concern is that the Minister and the Department do not account for the fact this figure only records people who take up employment for more than 30 hours a week.  It does not account for the people who are engaged in part-time employment or work for fewer than 30 hours a week.  It does not account for people who have gone into education, upskilling, training or anything like that.  The achievement rate is considerably higher than the 28.8% listed.  We can compare that to the alternative scheme that the Minister cites, namely JobPath.  That scheme's target was 14% and it struggles to achieve that despite the money that has been put into the JobPath programme, Turas Nua and Seetec.  More than &euro;162 million has been spent and just over 11,000 people have entered employment that is sustained for 12 months or more.  <\/p> <p>  Several concerns were raised in our engagement with the ILDN.  Its representatives acknowledge that some changes are needed.  They will state that openly.  They are not afraid of change or of adapting.  They know they cannot stand still.  One recommendation that jumps out at me from the Indecon report is the move to competitive procurement.  I would like to tease that out with the Minister.  Her written submission states: \"A move to competitive procurement is also consistent with legal advice my Department has received with regard to its obligations under EU procurement legislation\".  I would like to see the legal advice the Minister has received.  The ILDN gave a number of different examples, though I cannot find them now-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#C00300","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1585,"content":"<p>I know what the Deputy is talking about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#C00400","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1586,"content":"<p>They cited specific programmes that were allowed to proceed without the requirement for open competitive procurement.  I quote the presentation made by Mr. Donal Coffey to this committee on behalf of SIPTU:<\/p><blockquote>A clearer reading of EU guidelines on competition policy and rules pertaining to state aid outlines how member states can work within the EU procurement environment while still protecting services of general interest...  Services of general interest expressly include services provided directly to the person, such as social assistance services, employment and training services, childcare, social housing or long-term care of the elderly and people with disabilities, according to Murphy and Deane.<\/blockquote> <p>This shows that we do not have to have a procurement process.  The guidelines are there.  I would be interested to see the legal advice the Minister mentioned.  <\/p><p>Her submission also states &quot;services complement rather than compete with each other&quot; and &quot;there is more than enough work for all our service providers&quot;.  That is interesting.  I have challenged her on this time and time again.  CE schemes throughout the State are struggling.  There is a massive number of vacancies on them.  She will say that this is because there is less unemployment and there are not enough people to fill them.  That is nonsense.  The number of referrals to JobPath continues to increase.  More than 206,000 people have been referred to JobPath.  People are now being referred to JobPath for a third year.  They are essentially doing exactly the same thing time and time again.  The initial referral of &euro;311 is paid not just once or twice but three times.  It is paid for doing exactly the same thing.  There is competition there.  People are being referred to JobPath and that is unfortunately impacting on the other schemes.  <\/p><p>There are a couple of other interesting lines I would like to touch on.<\/p><p>As was mentioned, this is unlikely to require a major overhaul of service provision but it will require refocusing on effort.  I ask the Minister to tease that out a bit, because she also said that between Intreo, LES and JobPath staff we have approximately 800 case officers at present.  The contract for JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec concludes this year.  Is the Minister clearly stating there is a role for JobPath into the future?  Will there be a renewed contract with JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec?  The Minister will be aware of a cross-party D&aacute;il motion calling for the ending of referrals to JobPath and solely investing in schemes such as LES, job clubs and the other successful schemes.  Does she believe there is a role for JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec into the future?<\/p><p> There is major concern over the type of model with the tweaking the Minister is proposing.  If she puts this out to open procurement, what are her intentions?  The fear is that she is moving from the not-for-profit community model that works to a more privatised model.  The concern in the LES and job clubs is that she is moving to a privatised payment-by-results model and away from the community.  Is that the intention?  The concern is that the payment-by-results model does not work.  The model that works is the not-for-profit LES based in community with the wraparound services that are provided in terms of upskilling, further education and all the other things that are not taken into account when their achievements are considered.  I would appreciate answers to those questions.  I hope I will have another chance because I have many more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#C00500","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1588,"content":"<p>We might get back to that, but before that I call Senator Nash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#D00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1589,"content":"<p>Like the Deputy, I would be concerned about the prospect of tendering for labour activation services.

If the Minister decides to tender for these kinds of services, the tenders should be designed very carefully so as not to exclude accidentally or otherwise organisations that are well equipped and well experienced in terms of providing these very important services.  We know that tenders are often designed to obtain the result the system may want.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on the timeline envisaged for tendering for activation services of this nature as that would focus our minds on the horizon ahead.<\/p> <p>  More than adequate information is available from the Indecon report to justify the sustainment of the LES and job club model into the future, particularly when we remember the considerable number of households with no working adult.  It concerns me and I know it concerns the Minister.  It concerns anybody with any interest in the idea and value of work in our society.  It seems very clear that the LES and job club model is best placed to deliver the kinds of customised and tailored services that those who are very distant from the labour market require.<\/p> <p>  The payment-by-results model, which seems to be entirely driven by the profit motive, is not well positioned to provide the kinds of wraparound and customised services that LES and the job clubs are renowned for providing.  LES and job clubs provide something that money cannot buy - the institutional memory and expertise built up over many years.  The Indecon report shows clearly that the LES operations across the country have very strong relationships with local employers.  Employers interviewed as part of this process demonstrated that their experience with the local employment service and job clubs was very important and very useful in identifying employees for their organisations.  That in itself is a very convincing argument for allowing the LES model to continue.<\/p> <p>  It is crucial to continue to have a community-based response with all the kinds of things that LES and job clubs do to reach those people who are of concern to me and to the Minister - those who are very distant from the labour market and those who for a variety of socioeconomic reasons often experience intergenerational unemployment.  In our day-to-day work in our communities we come across many people who are victims of those unfortunate circumstances.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister to reflect on my comments on public tendering and the legal position.  Even if she and her officials are minded to enter into a public procurement process to obtain labour activation services of this nature, I ask her to wait until she has the JobPath review in her hand because it should inform our approach to future labour activation services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#D00300","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1590,"content":"<p>Does Senator Higgins wish to speak now or does she want a moment to read the Minister's opening statement or has she heard it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#D00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1591,"content":"<p>I read the report, but I might take a moment if it is appropriate.

There have been many reports on what we have done in the past.  We have statistics for the numbers of people unemployed, the percentages who got jobs, the costs associated and so forth.  It is very quantitative, but the quality of jobs and the aspirations of people are rarely mentioned in the reports.  We spend a lot of time just looking at the raw numbers.<\/p> <p>  I do not pass criticism on what we have done in recent years.<\/p><p>However, the challenge we are facing for the next few years is a different ballgame.  What we did that worked in the past will not be fit for purpose.  We need more.  The group of people we are examining now are long-term unemployed.  In many cases they come from geographical areas which would be referred to as black spots of high unemployment.  The areas have had that tag for a long time.  Then there is the intergenerational issue in families.  The issue we are looking at is somewhat different.  We are also in a situation where, significantly, employers have positions they are unable to fill.  Our programme for the future must be more than presenting an individual to fill a vacancy because the capacity of the individual to fill that vacancy must be examined.<\/p><p> My first observation is that whatever new programme emerges must be more holistic and must deal with the challenge of the preparation of the person.  I know many people in their mid-20s who have never worked.  They might not have even done transition year and they are out of school for ten or 12 years.  They are not work ready.  In other words, one could present them with an opportunity but they do not have the experience and they are out of education.  There are many more challenges for such people and the new programme must reflect that.  It must go further than just focus on employment.  I accept that the Minister's responsibility is employment affairs and social protection.  This issue must be addressed in a whole-of-Government way.  That includes education and the role of DEIS schools.  The Minister has a role to play as she refers to it often with regard to school meals and so forth.  It must be well co-ordinated.  We still have a situation where the outcomes for children attending DEIS schools are not equal to those of children attending non-DEIS schools.<\/p><p> There is an array of challenges and they must be dealt with holistically.  While getting a person a job is one goal, the goals have to be more than that and include the quality of job and the community the person comes from.  This is not just about addressing the needs of an individual.  It is not just the individual but the family the individual belongs to and the communities the individuals comes from.  It is a much more difficult task than what we have faced over the last number of years.<\/p><p> I have a specific comment on one of the recommendations, which states, \"Reflecting the decline in the number of individuals who are experiencing long-term unemployment and given the role of other measures including JobPath in assisting this group, we recommend that Local Employment Services should in the future focus on the most disadvantaged activation and other client groups who are not currently obtaining assistance from other State-delivered\/funded programmes.\"  I would be careful with the last part.  Even if somebody is in a programme at present it might not be the appropriate one.  We must be careful when setting up a new activation to deal with the long-term unemployed.  If somebody is already in a programme, that programme is an opportunity that exists today but it might not be the best fit for the person's needs.  That person should not be automatically excluded.  I give that caution as we design the new programme.<\/p><p> Those are my opening observations.  I call Senator Higgins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#D00600","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1594,"content":"<p>I apologise for arriving late to the meeting but I had to attend a debate in the Seanad.  There is much that is very positive in the Indecon report and there is a detailed breakdown of what we already know from the different testimonies to the committee.  I wish to focus on the benefits of the LES.  I might mention JobPath but I will focus on the schemes we are reviewing.<\/p><p>The Minister will be aware that yesterday, I brought a public procurement Bill through Second Stage in the Seanad.  It has a long journey ahead.  What started my interest in that area was JobPath being proposed.  I recall being told at the time by somebody from the Department - I was a civil society representative at the time - that we had to do it because of European directives.  I looked at those directives, where they were coming from, how they were changing and saw that there was huge scope within them.  While much of the analysis of the report is strong and robust, what emerged, and it emerged strongly in our hearings earlier this week, was that the recommendation that competitive open procurement should be considered felt like a <i>non sequitur<\/i>.  The case was not made for it.  In terms of the services of general interest, there is scope for the model of delivery we have at present to continue or to be enhanced.  We do not necessarily need to move to an open procurement model.  It is important that the Minister and the Department allow this model to be developed further.  The ultimate test should be around the outcomes, and they should be monitored, but the competitive process has not always delivered the best outcomes for us.<\/p><p>Certainly, some of the very blunt measures, such as the 30% target, do not capture some of the positive work that has been done.  We know the LES have hit 28.8%.  They are almost hitting the 30%.  What struck me was that in both job clubs and the local employment services, that was the measure for over 30 hours.  However, a huge number of people were also moving into perhaps less than 30 hours work.  That was an important step for them in terms of their progression and building labour market attachment.  It may have been persons who were also balancing caring and they were considering the 15 hours childcare.  The way we measure it at present does not capture those who may only be working 20 hours or 15 hours, but that is an important step back into the market for them.<\/p><p>Another matter that strongly emerged from what we heard from the local employment services is the recognition that there are multiple other positive outcomes.  Jobs are one outcome.  I am aware that the Minister understands this issue because we have discussed it in the past.  A return to education is also a positive outcome.  That is not something for JobPath in its contract.  The local employment services have made strong connections with universities and while it might not hit the 30% target that is a very important outcome.  That texture of outcome and the responsiveness that local employment services have shown to a changing landscape are great strengths.  When services are not for profit, they are able to be more responsive than services that have not only the Department to engage with as their client but also shareholders with projected income and returns.  They do not have that flexibility.<\/p><p>The number of long-term unemployed has decreased, but there are other cohorts.  There are people who may not be on the live register and people who may be parenting alone.  They might have young children but may want to access services on a voluntary basis.  I was struck, for example, that those who would probably be qualified adults in the system had found support from local employment services.  That might be jobless households where somebody might not be on the register but who was able to engage and get supports in that regard.  It is similar for people with disabilities and particular programmes in that respect.  There is huge scope.  Again, it is very important that this wider scope of potential interest in people who may have a slightly longer route to employment and may need particular supports is in a positive frame and not in a punitive or sanction-based frame.  Local employment services can do that.<\/p><p>I called into the climate change committee meeting just as it went into public session and was voting.  It was an interesting experience.  One of the main issues debated was support in just transition for those in carbon-intensive industries as those change.  People wanted to know that it was not simply going to be a JobPath model but a joined-up model.  Again, the local employment services and the job clubs are exactly the type of measure and space for transitioning.  They have said that they have had the scope in the past and could have it in the future for working with those who are not unemployed yet, who may be in precarious work or who may be in sectors that are down-scaling.  That is a huge potential.  I will not go into all the evidence of how they work.  I am talking about the potential for the future.  As the Chairman said, we face a new set of challenges.  The local employment services and the job clubs are the appropriate tool for the complexity of what we face.  We are in danger of losing some of that if we move to an open competitive model that is frozen in time when we sign up to a five-year contract and have a certain number of people attached.  That flexibility in response could be lost.  I believe we should scale these up.<\/p><p>My last point is on something that is very good about the model at present.  I worked with Wexford Local Development and young rural unemployed people in the past.  What was wonderful was that we listened collectively to those young people on how they felt the system could work better and what a rural Youth Guarantee might look like.<\/p><p>There was an openness, a social benefit and a conversation, which is different from feeling like an axe is hanging over one's head due to the number of CVs one has sent.  People were feeding back and the system was responding.  This is basically a paean to local employment services and job clubs, but they are what we need for the future.  I hope that the Minister will tell us how this will translate into a scaling up and that she will address education links specifically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#E00200","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1596,"content":"<p>There are a number of issues for the Minister to address.

If I have missed any in my notes, the members might shout.<\/p> <p>  It is obvious that we all appreciate the services that have been provided by the LES and job clubs to hundreds of thousands of people down the years.  We are appreciative of the services they have helped us to deliver.  We have no intention of downsizing or changing negatively anything that they do.<\/p> <p>  To synopsise what I am hearing from members, they are happy in the knowledge that this forms part of the service offering that we will need.  We value the experience, expertise and tailoring of services, which Senator Higgins eloquently described.  We want to take advantage of that in future.  The Chairman hit the nail on the head.  When we develop the next generation of services, we must do so cognisant of the fact that the challenges facing some people now were not even around ten or 15 years ago.<\/p> <p>  There will be an array of services, but they will not be in competition with one another.  We do not sit down and say that JobPath is better than the community employment, CE, scheme.  It is not.  It is just different.  We must model services so that no two organisations, be they contractors for the State, our own people, host companies or so on, are doing the same job.  We must recognise the skills, talents and capabilities of each organisation and send sections of society that are facing different challenges to those organisations that are most receptive to helping them get through them.  That might mean CE during one period in an unemployed person's life before he or she moves to being CV ready.  Someone may move from one service to another over the lifetime of his or her unemployment.  I hope that the lifespan of his or her unemployment gets smaller and smaller.<\/p> <p>  We are aware of the changing factors and social difficulties that the people of this generation face.  We must tailor and model our services going forward.<\/p> <p>  Last week, Deputy Brady gave me the opportunity to reiterate the fact that the budgets for our contracted services had not changed.  Our intention is to model the next activation services that the State offers in a tailored way using the people, experience and expertise currently in place.  The LES and our job clubs will form an integral part of that offering.  I am as grateful for them as are most of the members present.  I met them before Christmas and intermittently since January.  I have told them that we could not have done what we did in recent years without them.  By the same token, we could not have done what we did in the past five years without Turas Nua, Seetec, CE, T&uacute;s, RSS or SOLAS in terms of training or the back-to-education grants from the Department of Education and Skills that allowed people to return to full-time third level education.<\/p> <p>  No two people who are looking for work have the same set of challenges in their lives.  Therefore, the services that we offer on behalf of the State must be wide and varied, and their next generation must be tailored and capable of being scaled up if, God forbids, something happens.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is right about this being outside the generational services offering on which we are working.  When I was before the committee last week, I suggested that we consider establishing an interdepartmental body to examine the daily and weekly challenges facing people from zero to 66 years of age and tailor a cross-departmental targeted approach to geographical black spots.  We cannot tailor five services from the perspectives of activation, education and experience and capture all of the challenges of the families in question.  More is needed.  Once that is done, it should be a priority in where we move next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#F00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1598,"content":"<p>It needs a Minister to lead it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#F00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1599,"content":"<p>Yes.  If I am here for long enough, I would have no problem doing so, but if we get this body of work done in the next couple of months, we need to consider putting a cross-departmental task force together immediately afterwards, or perhaps even in tandem, to examine specific geographical areas.  There could be a proof-of-concept pilot.  If it can get better outcomes for 1,000 people within 12 months, it might be a model with which we can move forward.  I am willing to do that.  The national action plan for inclusion is being launched in May.  If we can work between now and then on developing a pilot, that would be a great time to launch it.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned a new range of programmes, but they are not new.  We have a range of services offered by a range of contractors.  Some of them are fabulous but some could be better, given their skill sets and the need to reach people whom we have never reached before.  We need to enhance and empower services.  We are not getting rid of youth employment services, over 55s services, CE, T&uacute;s or RSS, but tweaks can be made to address specific challenges and enhance our offering.  That is what I hope to do with the Department in the coming months.<\/p> <p>  Senator Higgins discussed how we measured outcomes.  The same metric that is used for her is not used for Senator Nash or Deputy Brady.  The outcome is the provision of a pathway back to work and sustainable, happy and fulfilling lives for those we service.  The Senator is right about there being some people on the live register who need a more holistic wraparound service to help them get from where they are to where we want them to go.  For some, that might take three years.  For others, it might take seven years.  It can only be determined by each person's willingness to work and co-operate with the services, assuming those services are tailored to that person's set of needs.  Measuring outcomes in CE will not be the same as it is in T&uacute;s, JobPath, LES or job clubs.  Outcomes are measured in the fulfilment of the person's needs.  For some, that might just involve learning the capacity to understand that they need to show up at the same place ready for work every day.  A service might need to train someone to develop learning skills, teach people a different language and so on.  Some people will have a specific set of requirements on day 1.  By year 2, they might have a different set of requirements.  Different factors and outcomes for different levels of service are required to get people from where they are, which is long-term unemployment, into long-term, sustainable and supported employment.  That range of services will be designed in the coming months.  We will also tweak existing services to ensure that we fill every gap.<\/p> <p>  Thankfully, the live register figures are reducing, with numbers on the long-term live register decreasing at an even greater speed.  More importantly, they are doing so faster than in our European counterparts.  Given the current capacity in our system, this allows us to reach people who are intergenerationally unemployed and to address their issues.  It also allows us to reach people who are not on the live register but who want to work and just need access to the range of supports and educational opportunities.  It allows us to stretch our offering to reach a much wider audience.  This is not just about apple pie and love.  We are reaching the stage of not having enough people to fill the job vacancies being created by the economy, so it is in the country's interests to encourage people who are not working but who are not on the live register to participate in the economy.  We must provide whatever services we can to ensure that it is an easy and supported journey for them.<\/p> <p>  The most serious message that I should get across today is that our services are not in competition with one another.  That one has an outturn rate of 28% versus another's 25% or 9% or CE's 37% does not mean it is a competition.  Each person attending a body for assistance has different needs.  If the metric was the number of people who got a job within one year, some organisations would be excelling and others would not, but that would not take into consideration any of the challenges facing the people we have sent to those organisations.  This is not about competition.  It is about having an array of services that suit individuals' needs at a particular time in their lives.  As long as I can offer a full range of services that complement one another, that provide someone attending an Intreo office a choice depending on his or her social challenges, difficulties or barriers to employment, and that find that person a niche and allow him or her to progress to other services or into work directly, getting that right will be a measure of success.<\/p><p>I think that will be a measure of success, if we can get that right.  It will not be easy because, as I said, the people who are presenting have a variety of different issues but it is our job to provide services at the best level we can.<\/p><p> The biggest message I am hearing today is that the committee's concern and nervousness is over public procurement, so I will be very honest and brutal.  EU procurement rules apply to everybody except those services to which they do not apply.  The legislation, as advised to me by both the Chief State Solicitor's Office and Attorney General, is to the effect that, much and all as they and the committee would want it to be otherwise, the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, local employment services, LES, and our job clubs do not come under that derogation.  They have to be attributable to the EU procurement laws, as does everybody else in the country.  <\/p><p> That is not something to be afraid and fearful of.  If that is the only thing the committee is concerned about, even though it is not necessarily a message that we are getting from interactions with people from LES, and job clubs, then it genuinely has nothing to be concerned about.  Our job is to provide for the 77,000 people who are long-term unemployed, the 45,000 people who are on community employment schemes and want to progress into sustainable employment and those hundreds of thousands of other people who are not on the live register but potentially could be in employment if the proper services were available.  There is much work to be done at a tailored and detailed level.  People are facing different challenges today, and will do in the future, so we cannot offer the services that we intend to offer to the far too many people who are unemployed without the procurement of LES and job clubs.  We must ensure that we continue to use their expertise and employment skills in the future.  We must tailor our plans and models.  They will not be the same because some people will be looking for a certain type of service and others will be looking for a different type of service but there will be a place for all our service providers in the future.<\/p><p> Deputy Brady asked specifically whether I intend to contract JobPath in the future.  What I currently intend to do is to fulfil the contract we have, which runs until 2021, and what we decide for the future is totally dependent on the outcome of deliberations we will have with each other over the coming weeks as to what kinds of services we need to offer.  I ask the committee to ponder the fact that the 48,000 people who got work in the past number of years because of JobPath did so because of that particular model.  I do not know how many of them would have got jobs without that help but I am sure we did not have the capacity to look after those people within the system, through our own offices and those of our service providers, before 2015.  We were incredibly stretched which is why we introduced the new Intreo model and contracting services on a pay-for-performance model because it works as part of a mix of services.  That is international best practice.  That is not the only service, nor will it ever be.  <\/p><p> There are 48,00 people currently going through JobPath to whom we have a responsibility.  We will fulfil the contract with JobPath before we make decisions, in the next couple of weeks, as to what the next generation of services will look like.<\/p><p> Senator Nash asked if I could give him a timeline, if we are wedded to tendering, but  and I cannot do that.  We are currently in breach of the EU legislation and have been for the past number of years.  I am not rushing to confirm a tender next Tuesday.  We need to know for what we are tendering.  I cannot do that specifically until we know exactly what kind of services we want, and the range of them.  We will work in co-operation with LES over the next couple of months to find out what extra capacity and skillset they have that we have not heretofore been utilising.  Senator Higgins alluded to some of that.<\/p><p> We will decide in the next couple of months on the best level of service offerings for training, employment and activation services we need to give to the next generation of unemployed Irish people.  We will then work with the services we have to allow those people consider which ones they want to work with and fulfil.  It will not take years but it will not take weeks away either.  We need to ensure we get it right for the next generation, rather than for the next couple of years, and that the services we offer are based on the experiences we have today.  There is a reduced number of people on the live register but we have extra capacity within the current system to extend the services we currently offer and, indeed, future services we offer to people who heretofore we have not offered services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#F00500","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1601,"content":"<p>The Minister might think she is finished but she is not because a number of colleagues have indicated they have supplementary questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#G00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1602,"content":"<p>That is no problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#G00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1603,"content":"<p>I ask my colleagues to keep their questions to the Minister as specific as they can.

Different services will have different speeds, for want of a better word, depending on the support they are offering, the types of services they are offering and the people they are serving.  It might take one service a year to help somebody get a job and it might take another service three years.  Somebody might need to go from one service to another service for five years in total before they get employment.  It is not about how quickly we get somebody to the outcome.

It was an open competition with public tender.  When I mentioned lessons could be learned from it, I meant in the structure of the tender, the lot size and the awarding criteria.  It was an interesting process and we have learned from that.  We will take cognisance of those lessons when we are doing our own tendering process.  The only advice I get as a Cabinet Minister is from the CSSO and the Attorney General.  I am bound by that advice and I have been told there are no derogations regarding public procurement in EU legislation regarding my ambition for publicly tendering for service offerings.  I accept that advice.  As is normal, I will certainly not be issuing copies of advice intended for me and the Cabinet.  I am bound by that advice but I agree with the reasons underpinning it and the model itself.<\/p> <p>  I state again to Deputy Brady that there is no need to be fearful.  Regarding services we need to offer in future, there are more than enough people for the service offering we have today.  I refer to the 77,000 people long-term unemployed, the 42,000 people on CE schemes and anybody else who wants to work and who is not on the live register.  That is before we even tweak the system.  There are enough people to continue using the contractors we have into the future.  Our ambition is to tailor and tweak the services we are currently offering to suit the requirements and needs of people not being fulfilled in every way they could be today.  We also need to recognise that the challenges unemployed people face in the future will be slightly different.  <\/p> <p>  For about a year after I became Minister the case was often made to me that the sole reason for the decrease in CE applications was JobPath.  We changed the legislation last June to allow anybody on JobPath to be part of a CE scheme, if that is what the person wanted to do.  We still have, however, a large number of vacancies on our CE schemes despite there being no restrictions preventing anybody on JobPath applying for and participating in a CE scheme.  I can only conclude that the tens of thousands of people I was told were on JobPath who apparently wanted to do CE schemes have either gotten jobs, as part of the roughly 47,000 people now in work again, or are happy to continue with JobPath.  Applications have not been made in the kind of numbers Deputy Brady and his colleagues presented to me previously.  <\/p> <p>  We do have an issue at the moment with CE placement.  It is not as simple, as Deputy Brady seems to think it is, as having thousands of people on the live register and thousands of vacancies in CE schemes.  We cannot just make people go onto CE schemes.  That is not the way we work.  People have to apply for CE jobs and they can only do that if that is what they want to do.  We are certainly not in the business of making people apply for work experience if that is not what they want to do.  We are in the business of recognising that no one-size service is going to fit everybody's needs.<\/p><p>Over the coming weeks and months, we will develop and design a range of services that will be sufficient to provide a level of service support, activation, encouragement, mentoring, training and everything else that is required to help people who are out of work in the short, medium or long-term.  This will ensure they have a State service they will fit into nicely and be able to work with at the various stages of unemployment to get them back into long-term, sustainable and supported employment.<\/p><p> Deputy Brady stated that we had removed people from educational courses and training schemes and placed them on JobPath.  That is categorically not true.  People in training, on an educational scheme or doing a course in college do not appear on the live register.  The only people we send to JobPath are those who have been on the live register and have been under-employed or unemployed for more than 12 months.<\/p><p> The Deputy commented that we should beef up the numbers being sent to LES and JobPath.  The outcomes, expertise and excellent service we achieve are possible because the ratio of clients to case management teams in the local employment services and job clubs is below the best practice maximum.  According to international best practice, the ratio should be not more than 120 clients to one service case officer.  At the moment, the ratio is probably around 100 in all of our contracted services, including Intreo.  We have the capacity to scale up the number by about 20.  I have no doubt that when we start offering services to people with a disability who are not on the live register and those in jobless households who are registered as qualified adults as opposed to being on the live register, we will have more than enough people to increase the average ratio from 100:1 to 120:1.  If the Deputy is suggesting I should overload the local employment schemes by raising the ratio to 200:1, they would be overwhelmed and unable to offer the level of service they have been able to offer in recent years.  We have a capacity of 800 case managers and we need each and every one of them.  We have no intention of diminishing the services, particularly at a stage in the country's cycle when we are about to try to expand the range of people to whom we offer those services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#H01700","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1628,"content":"<p>On open tenders, compliance with EU regulations and so forth,  I respect the fact the Minister has received advice from the Attorney General.

We do not currently model the service on outcomes, but I think we should.  When I refer to outcomes, I do not mean that there should be a target of getting jobs for a certain number of people.  I envisage that the wraparound services on offer from our local employment services in the future will be far more holistic about getting people on the road to recovery, as opposed to getting them a job.  Outcomes can and should be measured in a variety of ways.  That is something we can potentially look at in the very near future.  At the moment, we do not really do outcomes with our local employment services or community employment schemes.  We do not intend to put people under pressure by giving them outcome targets.  We want to make sure we can see people moving and progressing through a range of services that are on offer.  Maybe they will move from education into employment, or from upskilling and confidence-building into education.  We want to see a progression over the range of services.  I would be very keen to move to an outcome level without putting any fear factor in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#K01100","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1658,"content":"<p>It will not be a payment-by-results dynamic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019040400002#K01200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1554384600,"counter":1659,"content":"<p>It should not be a performance outcome because what might be a successful outcome for me might be a different measure or metric of a successful outcome for someone else.
