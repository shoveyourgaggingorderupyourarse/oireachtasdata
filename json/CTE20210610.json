My colleague, Deputy Thomas Gould, is in the building and is trying to log in to the meeting but is having technical difficulties.  Perhaps that can be recorded until he gets in.<\/p><p>This all relates to section 15, which provides for the board of the agency.  I will go through each of my amendments in the group one by one.<\/p><p>In the section dealing with the competencies of the members of the board, it seems odd that there is no requirement to have competencies in land management, land economics and sustainable land use given that according to the Government, one of the primary functions of this agency is active land management.  Therefore, it is essential that there be board members with those very specialised skills that often necessitate university qualifications as well as work experience.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 108.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 109 concerns section 15(6).  It says that one of the requirements is for people to have experience of delivery of housing and goes on to say \"which may include the delivery of social and affordable housing.\".  I am worried about the word \"may\" given that the Government is saying that the primary function of the agency is to deliver affordable housing and a portion of social housing.  Therefore, I do not see why the word \"may\" is included.  A comprehensive knowledge of social and affordable housing delivery should be an essential criterion.  <\/p><p> Likewise, amendment No. 110 seeks a requirement to have knowledge of homeless services and homelessness prevention in those areas.  There is constant discussion about the need to ensure boards have greater diversity in terms of gender and ethnic and cultural origins.  Therefore, amendment No. 113 attempts to place a requirement into this section so that the Minister would have to have adequate regard for those.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 114 is a key amendment that aims to ensure that no member of the board has a conflicting financial interest in respect of the use of land for social and affordable housing by way of a mandatory self-declaration.  Again, this is such an eminently sensible thing.  Given that this will be a designated activities company and that even when it is subject to FOI, so much of the intricate detail of its dealings in land and residential development will be redacted, such a mandatory self-declaration is crucial.  <\/p><p> My last amendment in this section requires the Minister to lay a report on the directors before the Oireachtas no less than 30 days after the appointment of the board.  Again, this is something we have often called for when there have been changes to boards that come under the remit of the Minister so that there is full transparency and the Oireachtas, the media and the wider public know the people who have been appointed are and the basis for appointing them to such an important body, including their qualifications and work experience.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061000002#A00800","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623279600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I tabled amendment No. 112 to try to make the board of the agency as strong as possible and as weighted as possible towards people with experience in affordable housing, local authorities and approved housing bodies.

I will also deal with amendment No. 110 tabled by Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Gino Kenny, Paul Murphy, Br&iacute;d Smith and Mick Barry and amendment No. 112 tabled by Deputy Duncan Smith.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 108 to 111, inclusive, seek to include additional provisions in section 15 regarding the experience or qualifications of persons to be appointed as directors of the board in respect of experience in land management, land economics, sustainable land use, delivery of housing, public and affordable housing and homelessness services and homeless prevention.  I am opposing these amendments as I believe that this section as drafted has sufficient provisions to cover what is intended by these proposals.  As currently drafted, subsection 6 provides that the Minister will appoint to the board persons with &quot;satisfactory experience, competence or qualifications in relation to construction, delivery of housing, which may include delivery of social and affordable housing, finance, and corporate governance.&quot;  I believe the current text is sufficiently broad to encompass the criteria proposed and does not require amending.  Additionally, both the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the guidelines on appointments to State boards advise that the chair of the board should be consulted with to determine skills that are required for new board members.  In addition, the programme for Government provides that the LDA board should include a cross spectrum of housing, financial, governance and other independent experts needed to fulfil its remit and I am fully committed to ensuring that this happens.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 112 seeks to insert a new provision after subsection 6 to provide that among the board there would be at least one person who is a director or employee of a registered charity engaged in the delivery of social and affordable housing and one person who is a nominee of the General Council of County Councils and the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, acting jointly.  I am opposing this amendment as it is not usual practice for commercial State boards to be obliged under legislation to have nominees from specific sectors to be appointed to the board.  The process for the appointment of board members will be open and transparent carried out through normal State boards procedures and it will be open for representatives of these bodies to put their names forward for consideration.  Additionally, both the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the guidelines on appointments to State boards advise that the chair of the board should be consulted with to determine skills that are required for new board members.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 113 seeks to insert further text into subsection 7, which provides for the Minister to endeavour to ensure the board has an equitable balance of men and women.  I am opposing this amendment as I believe that the State board appointments process adequately covers the need to ensure diversity on all State boards.  Both the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the guidelines on appointments to State boards advise that the diversity of existing board members should be considered when approving new appointments to a State board.  This includes all forms of diversity, including gender and racial diversity.  As a consideration of diversity is explicitly stated in both sets of guidelines that will apply to the LDA, it is not necessary for a provision for diversity on the board to be included in the legislation.  I am committed to ensuring that there will be an equitable balance of women and men on the LDA board. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 114 seeks to amend section 15 by inserting a new subsection to provide that members of the board shall self-declare if they have any conflicting financial interests relating to the usage of land for social and affordable housing.  I am opposing this amendment as this is already covered by the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, which provides that the boards of all State bodies should should have procedures in place to monitor and manage potential conflicts of interest of board members and management.  The code of practice will apply to the board of the LDA.  I do not consider it necessary to put an additional provision into this legislation as it is already adequately covered by the code.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 115 seeks to amend section 15 by inserting a new subsection to provide that the Minister shall lay a report on the appointment of the board before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the relevant Oireachtas committee.  I am opposing this amendment as I do not consider it necessary.  It will be the case that all appointments to the board of the LDA will be carried out through the State boards process.  This is in line with the code of practice for the governance of State boards.  As standard, the Public Appointments Service will run all LDA board competitions in partnership with the New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA, and shortlisted candidates will be presented to the Minister for consideration.  Furthermore, details of all board appointments for the LDA and indeed other State bodies are publicly available on <i>stateboards.ie<\/i>and will also be available on the LDA's website.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061000002#B00400","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1623279600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>While I am not surprised by the script the Minister of State has been given to read out in response, it is always disappointing when what can be considered friendly amendments in the spirit of the Bill are simply rejected.

I am always wary when we are told we do not need to be specific about something because it is captured in the generality of the Bill.  We all know from practice that once a Bill is passed, if something is not specified the chances of it happening are lower.<\/p> <p>  The idea that there would not be a requirement for land expertise, for example, strikes me as bizarre, as do the other cases.  The difficulty with a code of practice is it is a code, not a legal requirement.

I suspect that if I were able to read the Minister of State's mind as he was reading the Civil Service script, he might not necessarily have agreed with everything he was reading out, but we will have to deal with that in some other way.

Therefore, legally preventing them in any circumstance from expressing a contrary personal view based on their experience is limiting the Government from achieving its objectives.  I will take as an example the outgoing chair of the Housing Agency, Mr. John O'Connor.  In the previous D&aacute;il, this committee would have benefited more if Mr. O'Connor, a man of immense experience and knowledge, had a little more freedom when necessary to give a personal view, that would have added to the public discourse and evidence base.  Experienced public officials, particularly as they are approaching the end of their careers, for example, as the head of the County and City Management Association, CCMA, or another agency, will sometimes test the limits of that legal gagging order, as Deputy O'Callaghan rightly called it, and we benefit from that.  We need the greatest level of expertise, evidence and experience.  Therefore, these are sensible amendments.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Accounting Officer issue, the Minister of State did not explain why.  He just stated that it was the practice.  We all know it is the practice that the chief executives of State agencies do not appear before Oireachtas committees as Accounting Officers, but why not?  Why do we not require the same level of transparency in the use of public moneys or, as in this case, public lands when the chief executive of an agency - in this case, the huge agency that the Government wants to create - appears before an Oireachtas committee that applies to Secretaries General?  Why is that the case other than it being the practice, which is not a satisfactory answer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061000002#E00400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1623279600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>In this legislation, the Oireachtas is seeking best practice.

The definition of market value is an accepted technical definition that is used by persons valuing land, including the Valuation Office, which will undertake most valuations of land under this Part.  In order for any valuation of land or property to take place there must be an accepted understanding of what market value means.  This definition of market value already appears in Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circulars 11\/2015 and 17\/2016 regarding the transfer and disposal of State property assets. <\/p><p>I want to reiterate that when land is being valued under Part 7, it will take into account the proposed use of the land, which will be to deliver significant levels of affordable housing as well as Part 5 housing. <\/p><p>The valuation date definition is technical and clarifies that where the LDA is acquiring relevant public land, the valuation date shall be the date that the LDA gives notice to the relevant public body that it will be acquiring the land.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendments Nos. 155 and 156 amend section 51 to remove the obligation on relevant public bodies to get their own estimate of the value of land where it is being offered to the LDA.  This was an unnecessary provision and would have increased costs to a public body where it was disposing of land to the LDA.  It is envisaged the Valuation Office will carry out this valuation exercise in many instances, as is existing practice for property transfers between public bodies.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 159, 161, 181 and 182 amend sections 53 and 54 to provide for the transfer of the public lands already being progressed by the LDA such as the Central Mental Hospital in Dublin and St. Kevin&rsquo;s Cork.  When the LDA was established in 2018 the Government decided these lands would transfer to the LDA but the actual transfer would not take place until this legislation was in place.  This amendment specifically provides for these lands as they are not covered by the two arrangements currently specified in the Bill where a public body offers land to the LDA or the Government directs land should be transferred following a report to Government by the LDA.  By specifically providing for these lands in this section, it will ensure the full provisions of this legislation will apply to these lands.  This includes there will be specific affordable housing attached to each site under Part 9 and the land can be valued in line with this Part.  The details of the land to be transferred are set out in a new Schedule.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 235 is a new Schedule that details these lands to be transferred to the LDA.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 162 further amends section 53 to clarify the valuation date for the purposes of valuing public lands transferring to the LDA shall be the date the LDA gives notice it will acquire the land.

This section and the discussion on these amendments are a key part of the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 157, 160, 164, 166 and 169 in this grouping are in my name.  They all seek to remove the references to market value and substitute the words \"existing use value\".  If we are serious about delivering affordable, cost-rental and social homes on a good value for money basis, we need to use existing use value rather than full market value.  The Minister of State said the full market value will be subject to the fact that Part 5 will be applied to these lands as it is applied to all residential lands and some of these homes will be affordable homes.  The issue with that is given the cost of Part 5 delivery to the State, its bearing on land values is quite minimal.  Given the way the Government is going about the delivery of affordable housing and the way it is defining affordable housing as being just a marginal discount on full market rates rather than being tied to people&rsquo;s incomes, there is a real danger the market value for the Land Development Agency, even allowing for the fact that some of the homes will be affordable, will have a very minimal bearing on the full market value.  If we want housing that is genuinely affordable and cost-rental housing  people on incomes below the national average income, for example, people who do not quality for social housing, can afford, it is very important land is delivered at a very affordable cost.  If our amendments are not accepted, land will not be delivered at an affordable cost.  Furthermore, we will not achieve that aim with respect to one of the key benefits that could be provided by the Land Development Agency in terms of strategic land assembly and getting land available at an affordable cost to provide cost-rental and social housing that is affordable.  These amendments are very important in ensuring the Land Development Agency is able to deliver land at a lower cost to achieve the delivery of affordable homes.  I strongly advocate for these amendments.  I would like the Minister of State to indicate why he believes the use of market value will deliver a better outcome for us in the middle of a housing crisis.  What is the Government's justification for basing this on market value when we need to be able to deliver homes at a much more affordable cost?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061000002#K00400","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1623279600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>As Deputy O'Callaghan said, this is one of the most important sections of the Bill.  I have seven amendments in this grouping relating specifically to sections 53 and 54.  These are new additions to the Bill.  They were not in the original version.  They did not get pre-legislative scrutiny.  Given these are the sections which will determine what the LDA will pay for lands it is acquiring from other State agencies, it is crucial we fully understand what it is the Government is proposing.  Unfortunately, when one reads the Bill and listens to some of what the line Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and some of his backbenchers have said, there are conflicting interpretations.  I am not saying people are wrong or are misreading the Bill.  Land valuation and the determination of price for land is a very complex area of professional expertise.  People who work in this area in local authorities, Departments and in the private sector get master&rsquo;s degrees from Technological University Dublin and have a level of knowledge about how one does this, which, unfortunately, many members of this committee do not have and, therefore, we are grappling with this as lay people.  The difficulty with the legislation is it is quite opaque in terms of how this will work.  I will throw out a few tangible issues, to which it is important the Minister responds.  Public land has different values depending on who owns the land.  Local authority land generally has what is known as historic value.  It sits on the books of a local authority on the basis of the value it paid for it.  That is very different from any calculation of its current use, whether it is existing use, which is the formula Deputy O'Callaghan and myself are arguing for, or market value, which is what is provided for in the Bill.<\/p><p>Therefore, the historic value, where that is lower than the existing use, should really be the transfer price so that the local authority does not lose out if it is transferring land but neither does the LDA pay above the price.  <\/p><p> The really important concept of existing use, which should be the standard under this Bill, is generally the land from other public agencies that will be transferred. It is not used for residential housing; it is used for a variety of different forms.  St. Kevin's is an old hospital site, Dundrum central is an old psychiatric hospital site.  The CIE and HSE lands in Limerick, for example, are public transport and public health lands and they have existing use values.  Existing use is invariably a lower cost than market value, so why the Government would not have used existing use as the bar is hard for me to understand and I would like it explained.<\/p><p> Finally, market value is the estimated value that the land will get when sold on the open market.  Of course, if conditions are attached to the use of the land, that constrains the market value.  For example, if we take the Dundrum central site, let us imagine it will have 10% social housing - which is too low, but that seems to be the indication - 50% affordable rental and purchase, and 40% open market sale.  When any professional land valuer is estimating the market value of that site, there are four separate calculations: first, the calculation which keeps the land value for the social housing very low, then second, a calculation for affordable sale units which could be based on the future imputed uplift of the value of that land if-and-when that affordable home is sold into the market.  That is a way of thinking about that valuation.  There will also be a valuation for the land that the cost rental units are on.  Again, that could be the imputed yield of those cost rental units over a period because that concretely affects the land value, particularly because the LDA may involve private equity investors or other private vehicles.  Then, of course, there is the full market value of the land that would have open market price homes.  The Minister said that his desire is in Dublin that a majority, if not 100%, will be social and affordable, but he is also indicating that some percentage could be open market sales.  For example, in open market sale, the price on the strip of land beside Dundrum central hospital last year, for a two-bedroom apartment, was &euro;500,000.  What many of us are worried about is, notwithstanding the fact that where there is a mixed tenure scheme with social, affordable rental and for purchase on open market price, there will be a land value calculation for each segment of that housing and the accumulated cost of that to the LDA would be higher than the existing use value.  If I am wrong, I am happy to be corrected but nothing I have heard to date says that I am.<\/p><p> Finally, the proposal around Part V is one of the most bizarre propositions.  Part V is based on an assumption that a developer paid full market price for the land and has a full development cost.  Part V has a very specific mathematical formula, which establishes the discount between the existing use value of the land at the point of purchase and the market value, if I understand it correctly, to achieve a discount for the purchase of the social and affordable homes by the local authority.  A Part V formulation cannot be applied when the land is not bought at full market value as it is sold on the open market.  That just makes no sense.  The big concern in this regard is that surely if land is to be transferred, much as I would prefer if it was not for the purposes this Bill is setting out, from CI&Eacute;, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;&iacute;reann, the HSE or a local authority to the LDA, the agency should not pay anything more for that land than its book value, whether it is existing use or the historic value on the books of that agency or organisation, otherwise it is paying above the odds.  Why is this important?  It is not just an accounting exercise.  The LDA will deliver affordable homes to buy and rent.  The price of those affordable homes, the price of the rent that is set or the price of the purchase, will be determined by the all-in development costs.  We know land, after the nuts and bolts of hard construction, is one of the largest factors of development so if the LDA pays more than it should for the land on which social and affordable homes will go, then unfortunately that will push up the development price and that will push up the cost to the affordable purchaser or renter.  I am less concerned about local authority lands.   How D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown managed that transfer will probably reflect the existing use value but I am really concerned about HSE, CI&Eacute;, OPW lands, etc.  We need the Minister to explain in plain English how this will work and how it will not result in what I, Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and others believe the LDA paying above what it should pay for land, thus pushing up the cost and ultimately the price of affordable homes to rent or buy for working people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061000002#K00500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623279600,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I support the points outlined by Deputy &Oacute; Broin on the price the LDA will pay for land.

We cannot have the LDA pay over the odds as that will have a negative effect on those trying to rent or buy affordable homes.<\/p> <p>  A report came out today, which said that young people now live with their parents three years longer, up to 28 years, because they cannot set out to rent properties.  The average age for a first-time buyer is now 34 and it has also increased by three years.  This has ensured that the housing crisis continues to get worse, whether from the point of view of a renter or buyer.  We are worried the LDA will not deliver what the Government says it will.  That is why the price of the land has to be correct from the start and why I support Deputies &Oacute; Broin and O'Callaghan's amendments.  I ask the Minister of State to consider them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061000002#L00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1623279600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I will address amendments Nos. 157, 164, 166, 175, 179 and 180 tabled by Deputy Cian O&rsquo;Callaghan, No. 158 tabled by Deputy Duncan Smith, who had to leave to attend another committee meeting, amendments Nos. 160, 169 and 170 jointly tabled by Deputies Cian O&rsquo;Callaghan, &Oacute; Broin and Gould, and amendments Nos. 163, 165, 174, 175 and 183 jointly tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 157 seeks to amend section 53 to delete the reference to &ldquo;market value&rdquo; and change it to &ldquo;existing use value&rdquo; and No. 183 seeks to introduce a similar amendment to section 54.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 158 seeks to delete section 53 and replace it with an amended provision that provides that the relevant public body disposing of land to the LDA will receive a price that is cost neutral for them. <\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 160, 164, 166, 169, 170, 175 and 179 seek to amend section 53 by deleting the reference to &ldquo;market value&rdquo; and replacing it with &ldquo;existing use value&rdquo;. <\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 163, 165 and 175 seek to amend section 53 by deleting subsections (2) and (3) and amending the matters that the Minister can prescribe regarding how land is to be valued.  <\/p> <p>  I will not accept these amendments.  I have tabled an amendment to provide for a definition of \"market value\" that will allow the land to be valued taking account the proposed use of the land, which will be to deliver significant levels of affordable housing as well as Part V housing.  I believe this is a more appropriate valuation.  Where land is being used for affordable housing, I expect the land value to be extremely low.<\/p> <p>  The definition of \"market value\" is an accepted technical definition used by persons valuing land including the Valuation Office which will undertake most valuations of land under this part.  For any valuation of land or property to take place, there must be an accepted understanding of what market value means.  I reiterate that when land is being valued under Part 7 it will take into account the proposed use of the land, which will be to deliver significant levels oaf affordable housing as well as Part V housing.<\/p><p>That is a 50% minimum and there is also 10% social housing and 10% affordable housing under Part V.  That is 70% in total.  I have also tabled an amendment to section 53(2) and to section 53(3).  It is important that the Minister can have the power to prescribe how land will be valued, and the matters that the Minister can prescribe are very clearly set out in section 53(4).  These provisions should be removed from the Bill.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 180 seeks to amend section 54 by removing the reference to the local authority.  Section 54 provides that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage can vest relevant public land in the LDA once a decision has been made that the LDA would acquire the land after it has been offered to it for sale by the relevant public body under section 51 or following a direction from the Government under section 52.<\/p><p> Vesting is often used where land is transferring from one public body to another and it can be a speedier process than traditional conveyancing.  It is appropriate that the Minister can vest local authority land in the LDA only where the land has been offered for sale by a local authority under section 51.  I do not consider it is appropriate to remove this provision.  Local authority owned land cannot be vested by the Minister to the LDA unless it has been offered for sale to it by the local authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061000002#L00300","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623279600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I wish to speak on the amendments that seek to remove the term \"market value\".  I can understand the desire to do this if the reason it is included in the Bill is not understood.  We go back to the discussion we had in the first session.  Effectively, the LDA is a mechanism that allows for the transfer of land at a nominal cost, so that when homes are built they do not include a significant land value.  Therefore, the process or calculation that allows us to do this is to take the existing market value and apply an affordability charge to the land.  In doing so, effectively the land is rendered of little or no value because if it was traded on the open market it would not be possible to have a profit or the normal developer's levy.  In other words, it would have nominal value.  Not only this but the responsibility to provide affordable housing on the land stays with the land permanently regardless of who the owner is.  It is a permanent devaluation in the cost of the land.  To remove the term \"market value\" would, in essence, remove the starting point of this devaluation process and, therefore, while it sounds like a good headline grabber it actually takes out one part of the equation, which would result in a land value that is nominal and, therefore, not included in the final price of the sale or renting of these homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061000002#M00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1623279600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>This is a very serious part of the Bill and, therefore, I am listening very carefully to what the Minister of State and Deputy McAuliffe have said.  My concern is, and I say this very respectfully, what the Minister of State and Deputy McAuliffe are saying is not the same and let me outline why this is the case.  I understand the Government's amendment very clearly, and the Minister of State rightly used the phrase \"future use\" and not \"existing use\" value.  This future use is, as I outlined at the start, a mixture, with some social, some affordable and some open market housing.  Therefore, each bit of land, depending on its future use, will have a different market calculation.  Some will be very low and some might be a little bit higher.  If, as the Minister of State suggested, that there could be some developments with 30% open market sale then that land has full market value in terms of what it would get on the open market.  The combined cost of these three is higher than the existing use.<\/p> <p>  Likewise, and this is why the cost rental issue is relevant in the valuation, the Affordable Housing Bill allows for limited return shared equity investment, essentially private sector investment, which adds to the overall cost.  This produces a yield and this yield is relevant to the market valuation of the land if those units are ever to be traded in future.  It would be reasonable to expect that this would have to be taken into the market valuation.<\/p> <p>  Likewise with affordable purchase housing, if the terms and conditions of the affordable purchase housing are similar to those under the serviced sites fund there is a clawback, and once the clawback is paid they are open market price houses with open market price land.  This gets very serious because, of course, this goes to the heart of whether or not the agency is compliant with EU state aid rules.  A lot of private developers will look at the price at which the LDA acquires land for development.  Parsing the valuations to ensure there is no undue state aid, particularly with respect to any aspect of the housing which allows either full market profit or a limited profit.  Therefore, we could have at a future stage legal challenges by large residential developers who will dispute the land valuation.  It happened in the context of NAMA and some of its land deals.<\/p> <p>  I respectfully disagree with Deputy McAuliffe that this is a mechanism to reduce the land to a nominal cost.  If we were going to do that we would just use the existing use value or the book value based on historic cost to the State agency.  This is an attempt to work out a complex valuation formula that will not run aground on state aid rules and will allow for a varying series of valuations on each piece of land depending on what it is used for.  This will result in the LDA paying more for the land than if it paid existing use value.  I suspect there is no way around this because the Government is wedded to trying to get this vehicle off-balance sheet and this is part of the price but that price is a higher cost to the LDA and the taxpayer and, ultimately, higher prices for the purchaser and borrower.<\/p> <p>  People really need to think very carefully before they approve this because it is an area where there will be in the future, mark my words, a Committee of Public Accounts hearing and a look-back inquiry from the Comptroller and Auditor General asking why on earth the LDA paid 5%, 10%, 15% or 20% or more above the existing use value for a piece of land owned by a State agency, resulting in higher prices for affordable purchasers and renters when they should have got it at existing use value.<\/p> <p>  This is not some headline grabbing issue.  It is fundamental to whether the agency can do its job and can represent value for money for the taxpayer and affordable purchaser.  If people who have more knowledge on this than I do, and there are many of them, can convince me I am wrong I will be happy to accept it.  However, if I am correct then, in future, when the Comptroller and Auditor General is before the Committee of Public Accounts at least I will be able to say I raised these matters out of genuine concern on Committee Stage.  If it ends up that these amendments are rejected and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and I and others are ignored, well so be it.  This is one of those moments, not unlike the NAMA legislation, where what legislators in the House do will determine how much money the taxpayer pays for land in future, how much affordable purchasers and renters pay and whether it is a good deal or not.  Let us take this very cautiously and do the right thing by the taxpayers and working people in need of affordable housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061000002#M00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1623279600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has spoken to the amendments I have tabled.  I accept the view put forward by Deputy McAuliffe was put forward in good faith.  I do not agree with it.  I do not believe under the legislation we will see land acquired at little or no cost.  What we will see is land acquired with a fairly marginal impact on the full market value because of the provisions on affordable and cost rental housing.  If we look at Part V delivery at present, the discounts being achieved are not at the levels that originally were envisaged.  In fact, Part V delivery is quite a good part of the mix for some private developers because there is a guaranteed amount of sales immediately and guaranteed financing.  In terms of delivery it can work out quite well.  I have concerns this will not achieve the solid discounts Deputy McAuliffe and others have spoken about.  This is my concern with regard to moving these amendments, and it is very important for achieving homes that are affordable to purchase or affordable rent, which I know is what we all want.
