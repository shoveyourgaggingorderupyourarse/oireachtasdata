Graffiti is a real problem in cities and towns all over the country.  One cannot travel through cities like Dublin, Cork or Galway without seeing the impact of graffiti on the public space.  I am calling on the Minister for Justice and Equality to consider reintroducing the anti-graffiti programme that was in place up until 2009.  Many people refer to graffiti as a mere irritant but I prefer to refer to it as vandalism or criminal damage.  <\/p> <p>I met an elderly gentleman last Saturday who was trying to clean the gable end of his house for the third time in three months, at great expense.  This gentleman is a pensioner in his early eighties.  He explained that he could no longer climb a ladder to remove the graffiti and that no assistance was available to him.  The anti-graffiti programme that was in place previously funded the removal of graffiti in public spaces and places that could be seen from public spaces.  It supported small business people in removing graffiti from their premises and distributed anti-graffiti kits.  The reintroduction of this programme would be a recognition of the many volunteers who clean their own communities week in and week out.  While there are many Tidy Towns committees that clean up their communities on a weekly basis, they cannot deal with criminal damage to householders' property.  I ask that the Government would consider reintroducing the programme which could be funded in various ways.  It could be co-funded by the Departments of Justice and Equality and Communications, Climate Action and Environment, with matching funding from local government.  We need a programme because volunteers must be recognised.  The financial hardship that householders are suffering when trying to remove graffiti must be acknowledged.  People have pride in their homes but are waking up to find the gable end of their houses destroyed by criminal activity.  The fact that there is no assistance available to them to remedy the situation is unacceptable.  <\/p> <p>The Minister of State may have been provided with a stock answer by the Department but I ask him to consider the matter and discuss it with his colleagues and the Department.  I ask that some mechanism be provided to assist communities in dealing with the scourge of graffiti which mainly affects urban areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#A00500","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.<\/p> <p>The community graffiti reduction programme was introduced in February 2008 and was sponsored at that time by the then Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Pobal managed and delivered the programme on behalf of these Departments and a total of approximately &euro;1 million was spent under the first phase of the scheme.  Due to the declining state of public finances at the time, the programme was formally brought to an end in the middle of 2009.  The programme was separate from, and in addition to, graffiti abatement programmes carried out on an ongoing basis by the local authorities.  <\/p> <p>As the Senator will no doubt be aware, and as the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has previously advised the Oireachtas, primary responsibility for management and enforcement responses to litter pollution, including the defacement of structures by writing or other marks, lies with local authorities under the Litter Pollution Act 1997.  The Act provides significant powers to local authorities to deal with these issues, including on-the-spot fines.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions to deal with graffiti, taking account of local circumstances and competing priorities.<\/p> <p>In terms of the justice sector generally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has advised that it tasks local community policing units with compiling information which might identify individuals associated with various graffiti incidents.  The Criminal Damage Act 1991 is the legal framework utilised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to police anti-social behaviour of this nature and alleged offenders are processed in accordance with the provisions of this legislation.  The Probation Service, which falls under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, operates two graffiti removal projects as part of its community service scheme.  One project is based in Dublin and the other is in Cork.  The Probation Service does not have a dedicated graffiti project budget.<\/p> <p>While the Minister for Justice and Equality is supportive of any measures to remove graffiti from our local areas, he regrets to advise the House that his Department has no plans to reintroduce the community graffiti reduction programme.  The issue is not a primary function of the Department and while the public finances are clearly in a better position than ten years ago, there are other competing pressing demands on the resources available for allocation by the Department.<\/p> <p>I encourage the Senator to approach the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to see if his Department would provide additional funding for a pilot scheme under the aforementioned anti-graffiti awareness grant scheme administered by the local authorities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paul Kehoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I understand from where the Senator is coming and the frustration of a lot of people, but it is not just in Dublin that there is an issue with graffiti.

I ask him to consult the relevant Departments to see whether a programme could be brought forward to alleviate the problem in every city and town.  The programme that was in place was discontinued because of the financial crash, but there is now an opportunity for the State to show leadership to the local authorities in reducing the size of the problem.  The only thing I ask the Minister of State is to reconsider and talk about the issue within his Department and with the Taoiseach to see if we could have even a small fund of, say, &euro;5 million that would be matched by local government to deal with graffiti.

He mentioned that I should approach the Department of the Taoiseach.  I encourage him to go to the Minister responsible for local government and the environment because it is through that Department that the issue should be tackled.  The Department of Justice and Equality can prevent the problem of graffiti from happening through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but the issue of the removal of graffiti should be pursued through the local authorities.  The Senator should, therefore, approach the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, or his Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, who has responsibility for local government to see what can be done to deal with the problem.  It is not the statutory function of the Department of Justice and Equality.  While clearly the public finances are in a better position than they were ten years ago, I understand there are other competing and pressing demands within the Department of Justice and Equality.  I encourage the Senator to raise the matter with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, given that he has statutory responsibiliy for the local authorities.

I thank her for being here and appreciate her attendance at this very busy time.  I am glad that she has come to take my Commencement matter.<\/p> <p>Let me outline what moved me to ask this question again.  I have raised it consistently since I entered the House.  I am sure the Minister of State and her officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been alert to the mobilisation on social media on the concerns of Irish citizens living in the North.  What we are seeing play out is Brexit exposing not just the negativity but also the anomalies and issues that need to be addressed for Irish citizens resident in the North.  The reality is as follows.  <\/p> <p>As we all know, the Good Friday Agreement is an internationally binding agreement between two sovereign states.  It confers, as a birth right, both Irish citizenship and British citizenship or everyone born in the North.  That assertion has never been codified in British law and to the extent that is necessary in domestic law in this State.  All of the anomalies have come into sharper exposure as a result of Brexit.  It is obvious that people are concerned and will mobilise.  They are offended, hurt and worried as a result of our failure to deal, both legislatively and legally, with this firm commitment that was made 21 years ago.  Given the threats posed by Brexit and in a climate in which we have already lost our right to vote in European elections and to representation in EU institutions, as well as access to various EU institutions such as the European Court of Justice, it leaves people not only deeply exposed and worried but also creates a tiered level of citizenship.  It creates inequality and goes against the core and heart of the Good Friday Agreement because we will have citizens resident on these islands who will have at various levels rights and entitlements and access to European mechanisms and institutions.  <\/p> <p>That is an important point to make and I will listen intently to what the Minister of State has to say because it is crunch time and the Government must address these issues.  The UK Minister of State for Immigration, Ms Caroline Nokes, brazenly stated, in contradiction of the Good Friday Agreement, that as a matter of law everyone born in the North was a British citizen.  Not only does her comment run contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, it also runs contrary to it in word and letter.  I ask colleagues to take one minute to think about how that makes people feel.  We do not derive our Irishness from our passport or even the Good Friday Agreement but from being Irish.  After centuries of conflict the Good Friday Agreement indicated to the world, on a legal basis, that we had created a path out of conflict and that people's identity, allegiances and rights would all be respected.  It is now clear in the already calamitous environment created by Brexit that these important core aspects of the Good Friday Agreement are not being lived up to or fulfilled.  I do not think we will hear the end of the matter until it is resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#B00500","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  He is right that it has been raised with me directly and indirectly via social media and otherwise.  It has also been raised with the Minister.<\/p> <p>Ensuring both the citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are upheld in all relevant areas is vitally important.  It is something on which the Government and I are continuing to engage intensively.  The Government has noted the update on UK immigration rules announced on 7 March, as the Senator outlined, to give effect to the UK settled status scheme and the letter from the UK Minister of State for Immigration, Ms Caroline Nokes, MP, on 5 February.  We are all fully aware, including the Government, of the concerns the statements made raise for Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland, particularly, as the Senator outlined, given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.  It is important to be clear that the statements in no way change the current position - the EU citizenship of Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland will continue in all circumstances.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As EU citizens, they will continue to enjoy the right to live and work throughout the European Union, as well as the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality.  It is very important that we return to the words of the Good Friday Agreement.  It \"recognises the birth right of all of the people of Northern Ireland to identify and be accepted as Irish or British or both, as they may so choose\".  Accordingly, it is confirmed in the agreement \"that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments\".  <\/p><p>Last December the T&aacute;naiste wrote to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to raise the case of Ms Emma DeSouza, the concerns related to the identity and citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and suggest a review of the issues and questions which have been raised not just in recent weeks but for some time, as the Senator outlined.  Following this engagement, the Government noted and welcomed the fact that the Prime Minister had acknowledged in her recent speech in Belfast on 5 February that there had been serious concerns raised about how UK immigration rules treated citizens exercising their right under the Good Friday Agreement to be Irish.  The British Prime Minister affirmed that \"the birth right to identify and be accepted as British, Irish or both\" and the right to hold both British and Irish citizenship were absolutely central to the agreement.  She said she had asked the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to urgently review the issues surrounding citizenship to deliver a long-term solution consistent with the letter and the spirit of the agreement.  They were welcome commitments and acknowledgements by the Prime Minister.  The Government and our colleagues in the North are now actively seeking the outcome of the review announced by the Prime Minister in February.<\/p><p>There is clearly a need for the UK Government to provide an assurance for everyone living in Northern Ireland that the citizenship and identity provisions in the Good Friday Agreement are being fully taken account of in all policy areas, regardless of the United Kingdom's approach to exiting the European Union.  The Government also fully recognises the importance of access to EU programmes for Irish citizens and, therefore, EU citizens living in Northern Ireland.  We are continuing to work to find ways by which they can be protected, consistent with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  I repeat that this is irrespective of the approach being taken by the United Kingdom to exiting the European Union and whether we have a deal.  Obviously, we would prefer to have a deal scenario.  The protocol expressly confirms that Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland \"will continue to enjoy, exercise and have access to rights, opportunities and benefits\" that come with EU citizenship.  Access to specific programmes is to be addressed during the period of transition and in the overall context of the future relationship.<\/p><p>We are ready for a no-deal exit by the United Kingdom and have actively been exploring ways by which we can protect continued access to EU entitlements for Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland, wherever possible.  In any scenario the Government, the T&aacute;naiste and I will continue to engage with the UK Government to ensure the important citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement will be upheld in all relevant policy areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#B00600","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I do not want to make the Minister of State's life any more difficult than it is.

What we are not yet seeing is a resolution of the issue.  While I fully understand and appreciate that the main responsibility for dealing with it rests with the British Government, inside our passports, it is stated the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible for us.  People need to hear these words, but they also need to see them being translated into action by the Government.  There must be pressure from this state and our colleagues in the European Union.  The British Government must be told that it will be in breach of the Good Friday Agreement if it does not codify in law what is expressed within it.  Potentially, this issue affects 1.8 million people.  It will not affect everyone as there are those who are content with their British citizenship and identity in the North.  Fair play to them; I fully support and respect that right.  However, an increasing number in the North, rightly and understandably, are demanding that their rights under the Good Friday Agreement be asserted and legislated for.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned the speech made by the British Prime Minister on 5 February in which she outlined a review of these issues.  We have heard no more about it since.  Actually, what we have heard is the statement made by Ms Caroline Nokes, MP, on 7 March, that, as a matter of law, that we are all British.  From 5 February to 7 March, that was the British Government's approach.

He cited two reasons on that occasion, one of which was related to the issue of data protection under EU law, while the other was Brexit.  He was too busy in dealing with it.  In May 2018 we informed him that, according to research conducted by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, he was able to share the data.  The Schedule to the legislation could be amended to allow the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, under section 63 of the Finance Act, to make a regulation to make the database available.  When the Minister, Deputy Ross, told us that he was not able to share the information because of EU data protection law, he was not aware that the previous Minister, Deputy Donohoe, had shared data in the driving licence registry with everybody, from car manufacturers to the Health and Safety Authority, the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, eFlow, a private company, the Road Safety Authority, the National Transport Authority, the National Consumer Agency and the local authorities.  People approved by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, commercial services and the office of the provost marshal of the military police have access to it.

The improvement in the quality of life for organ recipients and their families cannot be overstated.  We have a duty to do everything we can to ensure that as many people as possible benefit from organ donation.  Work is continuing to finalise the general scheme of a Human Tissue Bill and to deliver on the commitment in the programme for Government to provide for a soft opt-out system of consent for organ donation and an associated register.<\/p> <p>The aim is to make organ donation the norm in Ireland in situations where the opportunity arises.  Under the soft opt-out system, consent will be deemed, unless the person has, while alive, registered their wish not to become an organ donor after death. However, it is proposed that even though consent is deemed, the next-of-kin will always be consulted prior to removing any organ.  If the next-of-kin objects to the organ donation, the donation will not proceed.  The best way to ensure that a person's wish to become an organ donor is realised is to have a conversation with one's family and to make one's wishes clearly known to them.  <\/p> <p>The proposed opt-out register for organ donation will create a clear and easily communicable choice to individuals to either opt-out of deceased organ donation entirely, or to allow deemed consent to apply.  Signing up to the opt-out register will be a definitive expression of the person&rsquo;s wish not to become an organ donor after death.<\/p> <p>The Senator&rsquo;s proposal to share code 115 on a driver&rsquo;s licence in respect of organ donation with the HSE's Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland would not guarantee that the person&rsquo;s wish to become an organ donor would be carried out.  This is also the situation in regard to organ donor cards.  The decision to donate organs in the case of a deceased person rests with the next of kin.  Health service personnel will not proceed to transplant organs without the permission of family members, irrespective of whether the deceased person carried an organ donor card or had ticked code 115 on their driving licence.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, due to the need for medical practitioners to be informed about the medical history of the potential donor to ensure the safety of the recipient, the co-operation of the family will always be required as part of a safe organ donation process.  An opt-out register will make organ donation the clear default option, and signal to citizens the move towards organ donation being the norm.  The general scheme of a human tissue Bill is being finalised at present and will be submitted to Government shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#D00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I do not want the Minister of State to take this personally, if that is not the worst answer I have heard to  a question put in the Seanad, it is fairly close.<\/p> <p>Some 1 million people in this country have registered that they would like to be to be organ donors.  That information is available in the Government system.  This will increase organ donor rates from 52% to 92% if the family are informed that their loved one wants to be an organ donor.  The Government is saying it will not do this and make this information available to families, the health services or doctors and nurses so that families can be assisted in making one of the most traumatic decisions that anyone can ever make.

A big row broke out about school patronage in recent days.  We know there is a demand for non-denominational or Educate Together type schools, which I know are not exactly the same but, equally, the process of managing the transition of any school, which is currently a faith-based school, into a non-denominational or interdenominational school needs to be handled very sensitively.

The transition needs to be managed very carefully in terms of the way it is processed, whether it be that the junior infants come in under a different ethos and are taken by the existing teachers or new teachers come in to take the junior infants and other teachers transition to other schools.

A Sinn F&eacute;in MEP, Matt Carthy, has supported an upper limit of &euro;60,000 for basic payments, with farmers having the option of topping up their payments through participation in environmental schemes.  This would allow for front-loaded payments that would offer additional support proportionally for smaller and medium sized farms.  It is absolutely vital that there is a separate environmental scheme available, such as GLAS, in the next round of the CAP.  Any attempts to incorporate GLAS into the basic payment will lead to a severe reduction in income for farmers and must be resisted.  In this week's vote, Fine Gael's political group significantly weakened this ambition so that the direct payments will be capped at &euro;100,000, with loopholes that will allow payments even above this limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#H01000","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>This is a speech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#H01100","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>It is a speech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#H01200","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":66,"content":"<p>It is near the end of this parliamentary term and the implementation of the 2020-2027 programme will fall to the Parliament to be elected in May.

I had a communication today from a man who seems to be a remarkable and good father to his two children, aged three and five.  They were both perfectly normal, well developing children until the age of two.  Suddenly they started to deteriorate and it turns out that they have a very rare disease called metachromatic leukodystrophy.  They are both in a difficult situation but one has had treatment and may be stabilised.  In Ireland we only test for eight rare disorders as opposed to the 35 recommended by the American Food and Drug Administration, FDA.  In one year, the Italians have increased the number of rare conditions tested for from four to 40.  This is an area in which we need to improve.  We must align ourselves with the test programmes being conducted in Italy.  We must increase the number of conditions for which we test because it is often significantly cheaper to test and treat rather than waiting until a chronic situation develops.  I appeal to the Government to move in this direction and to increase to 40 the number of disorders for which we test and treat.  That is the compassionate response.  The father to whom I referred talked with so much passion about the fact that had this test been done and had his children been diagnosed early, they would now be in a much better condition.  Although his situation is tragic, he felt the need to speak out on behalf of other parents to prevent them from being involved in a similar horrible situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#J00300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Norris.

Given that my sister lives in New Zealand, I am glad that the Prime Minister managed the crisis so gracefully and instigated change so swiftly.

Last year my party colleague Deputy Robert Troy introduced a Bill which would establish an Irish coastguard authority and designate said body as the principal response agency to engage in the management and co-ordination of responses to major emergency events within the State.  The Bill would create a statutory Irish coastguard authority, and in doing so, acknowledge the stellar work the coastguard already does and ensure that it would continue to be able to do so.  Since the introduction of that Bill, the coastguard has banned volunteers from using blue lights and sirens on vehicles while travelling to incidents.  Clearly this situation needs to be rectified and proper training for volunteers provided.  Staff and volunteers were informed that drivers are no longer permitted to use blue lights and sirens while driving on public roads but can use them when parked, which seems ludicrous.  This undermines the valuable role of the coastguard.  A second-rate emergency response service is not in the public interest.  A plan must be put in place immediately to roll out emergency driver training for coastguard volunteers to restore their full use of emergency lights and sirens.  Will the Leader consider organising a debate in the House on this issue and on the emergency services more generally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#J00500","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Government representatives in this and the Lower House on supporting the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017 last week.  There was much contention surrounding the legislation, much discussion and a lot of concern among those stakeholders directly affected.  Their concerns and fears are ones for which I have both understanding and great sympathy.  Their fears for the future of their businesses, the viability of the industry and the welfare of fishermen and their families are genuine and real.  However, the Bill is not about an added threat.  It is about fairness and, most of all, about reciprocal arrangements.  It is about ensuring an environment that is conducive to a shared future for the northern and southern fishing fleets.<\/p> <p>I had a conversation on Monday morning last with Mr. Alan McCulla, the CEO of Sea Source in Kilkeel.  Sea Source is a fishermen's co-operative and is a member of the Anglo North Irish Fish Producers Organisation, ANIFPO.  While Mr. McCulla welcomed the progression of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, he made a number of points which deserve mention in this House.  He first made the point that he was disappointed that the trigger for action was the impounding of two Northern Irish vessels in Dundalk Bay.  He said that it was a pity that it took this highly visible demonstration to mobilise action.  He spoke to me from his office at the harbour in Kilkeel where he could see a significant number of Irish-registered fishing vessels.  Those vessels presented no threat to or issue for him.  He expressed concern about comments made last week that Northern Ireland vessels were sailing under flags of convenience.  He said that there is an argument to be made that, in some quarters, this was a question of people in glass houses throwing stones.  Mr. McCulla reassured me that any notion of an armada of fishing vessels heading into Irish waters was ridiculous.  The suggestion that these vessels would detrimentally impact the industry, environment, ecology or economy in any way was unfounded and the contrary was the case.  Mr. McCulla made the point that the northern and southern fishing industries needed to work better together.  He argued that a stronger working relationship would support and safeguard the entire fleet, wherever that may be on the island.  He spoke about ensuring a sustainable, profitable and viable industry for all.  Even though the incident in Dundalk Bay appeared to have political undertones, it was dealt with swiftly and the subsequent actions by the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government must be commended.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ian Marshall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2486\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2486&amp;amp;pid=IanMarshall&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Mr. McCulla felt strongly that in light of the current debate, it would be useful to propose that the Government should initiate a joint discussion forum to further these relationships, build bridges and ensure that we have a strong, resilient, all-island industry, ultimately avoiding a similar contentious incident happening in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#J00600","speaker":"1439","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Yesterday, we received a great presentation from Irish Rail in Buswells.

He informed us that all of the hybrid trains that are currently used will be used on the long services, such as from Cork, Galway, Sligo, Westport and Ballina.  He said that the new trains which are being purchased will all be electric and will be used on shorter routes, such as to Maynooth, Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and such.

Quite a number of people use wheelchairs and such, and they are at a disadvantage when large numbers of passengers use the service.  There are quite a number of complaints.

It will not surprise the Leader to know that I have a different take on it to the conservative stance taken by my colleague, Senator Horkan, from Fianna F&aacute;il.  St. Sylvester's infant school in Malahide has become the third Catholic school in north Dublin to write to parents, warning them not to vote to change from a Catholic school to a secular school.  These letters, which were ordered by the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, contain a number of unsubstantiated claims, such as: stating that the standard of education will drop; teachers' contracts will be under threat; there will no longer be school uniforms; children's safety will be compromised on school tours; and grandparents will no longer be allowed to be celebrated.  It is utter nonsense.  These letters represent nothing more than scaremongering tactics by a powerful vested interest.<\/p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills should demand an explanation from each of the three schools and from the archdiocese.  It is unacceptable that such an important consultation process is being manipulated and influenced by a body with a powerful ideology.  The reality is that in north Dublin, 97% of school places are in schools with a religious ethos.  The Department has discovered through consultation that there is demand in the area to divest patronage and move to a secular model.  We must work towards ending the patronage system completely.  It is time that the State finally took responsibility for running and delivering an education system for all of its citizens through a secular medium, rather than simply outsourcing its responsibility to private patronage bodies.  As a republican, I believe in the separation of church and State.  It is fundamentally wrong to separate children at the age of five on the basis of religion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#K00300","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>An RT&Eacute; reporter in our part of the world, Pat McAuliffe, died in the last few days.

It is timely that we would have that debate now.  As Senator Lombard pointed out, last week we launched our climate action report after seven months of hearing witnesses and deliberations.  It will chart our way forward to decarbonise our economy.  A key issue in that is decarbonising transport, and without a doubt, railways have a big part to play in it.  For a considerable period of time, when there was no money in the country owing to our economic situation and our banking situation, which was about a 15-year period, there was no proper investment into railways.  Now, as we are beginning to invest in rolling stock in the lines and in the engines and carriages, we want to make sure that they are investing green, they are being supported in doing so and that it is part of the solution in reducing our carbon emissions.<\/p> <p>We also need to address other issues with our railways, particularly with journey times, especially into the west and into Mayo so that there would be shorter journey times, more services to make it more practical for people to use and an improvement in capacity because often there is not enough space for passengers on trains.

I mention the issue of West on Track, which would see a rail line going up pretty much along the western seaboard or charting a path along what we call the Atlantic economic corridor, which is obviously a notion or a proposition.  To back it up we need to see this rail infrastructure which would not just take passenger services but freight services as well.

It is unacceptable that blocks of people are crippled with the property tax without the capacity to pay, and one of the flaws which everyone agrees on across the Houses, is that the system is unfair and that needs to be put right.  I am advised that there is a report on the desk of the Minister for Finance since November on this local property tax.  It is disappointing that this report has not been fully published but let us not pre-empt the whole day yet and see what comes out of the decision of the Government.<\/p> <p>I am calling for a debate in this House because realistically, we need to have a full, fair and comprehensive debate on how we will fund local government and services.

We were told this was an additional source of funding, not a substitute source of funding for the central funding of local government.  It was marketed on television, radio and leaflets as bringing new community facilities, new swimming pools, new parks and new public amenities and that has not happened.  Chief executives of the 41 local authorities will tell us that the reality was that the central government allocation was dropped and substituted by the take of the local property tax and there is an unfair balance across the country.  I am not suggesting for one moment that local authorities that are weaker and do not have the revenue resources should be crippled either.  They need to be supported by central government but for those who collect and have money, it should be kept locally and spent locally and decisions about that local funding should be made by councillors.

If it clearly shows that we do not have enough garda&iacute; to prevent crimes such as this happening in the first place, it also raises the question of whether we have enough garda&iacute; to investigate crimes such as this thereafter.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am gravely concerned about this matter, especially when I understand that no overtime is available for the investigation of such crimes in the Border counties.  This matter clearly illustrates that we have a serious problem.  I have preached here for long enough that we are totally exposed in the Border counties and it is time that the Government gave us the resources that we need.<\/p><p>The banks also need to step up to the plate as they have a responsibility.  I understand that there is no tracking device attached to any of these ATMs.  One would also question why such large amounts of money are lodged overnight in banks in towns like Castleblayney and Ballybay in the first place.  I ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality requests of the banks that they step up to the plate and play their part in security.  Today, the main street of Castleblayney is cordoned off so businesses are suffering because nobody is allowed to enter the town.  There is also an ongoing issue with the market house in Castleblayney and part of the town is cordoned off on an ongoing basis.  We need help in the Border counties.  We need extra resources, especially with Brexit on our doorstep at the moment.  I ask the Government to please keep these matters in consideration going forward.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#L00800","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#M00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#M00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Last night I got a telephone call from somebody I dearly love who told me that today she will be homeless by lunch hour and her property will be taken from her by a bank.  It deeply disturbs me the way things are going on.  This woman is in her 60s.  I lost my house in my 30s and while it is possible to recover when one is in one's 30s, it is totally impossible to do so in one's 60s.  The heartbreaking thing behind this story is that this woman has been through several court cases.  There was not a word, letter or telephone call for almost seven years but yesterday, she received a telephone call to say her case would be before the High Court today and she would be out of her home within six months.  She has nowhere to go.  I am mindful of the woman in a film I saw some years ago who had her entire life in a group of bags or a shopping trolley and that was it.  That is all there was.  l asked myself what had gone wrong and there are no simple answers.  The house was repeatedly sold from one lending agency to another.  I assume that by the time the house was eventually purchased by the people who are now justifiably recovering their asset - and I am not for one moment complaining about that - they probably bought it for 10 cent in the euro.  That is the problem.  If somebody said it to me that I could have bought the house for 10 cent in the euro then I would have bought it and would have seen to it that the person was not thrown out on the street.  There are families all over this country who would do the same thing, rather than see somebody they love suffer.  I am totally baffled that we can sit idly by and allow these major multinationals come in here and buy up properties at 10 cent or 20 cent in the euro yet evict Irish citizens.<\/p> <p>I was president of the Teachers Union of Ireland when we cut the pay of our members by up to 30% and we did so to save this country.  While none of us liked the measure, and people in this House took similar cuts, we did it because the country needed it.  Can we not now in some way take control?  Can we set up a housing agency that will be offered these houses at 10 cent or 20 cent in the euro?  Can we ensure that when somebody is about to be chucked out on the street that the house is sold to that agency, which allows the person to continue to live in the property?  I am talking about a woman in her 60s.  I am sick of listening to calls for debates on homelessness.  I am sick of listening to the Minister for House, Planning and Local Government being lashed verbally.  There is no simple answer.  Can we have a debate that might consider how to deal with deviant mortgages and people who are about to find themselves on the street?  I am heartbroken today for this particular person.  I wish I could go, pick her up, take her in my arms and take her away.  I do not want her to suffer the pain that she is suffering today.  I would do anything to take her pain away.  I respect the right of the bank to seize its property but, good God, I respect the woman's right to live out her life in some sort of peace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#M00400","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I agree with the call made by my colleagues, Senators Paddy Burke and Mulherin.  I, too, attended the presentation made by Irish Rail yesterday.  I applaud its plans and what it is Irish Rail is striving to achieve by way of the provision of new electrified rolling stock and improvement in journey times.  As the two Senators have raised, there are important issues regarding passenger comfort, ease of access and so on.  Many smaller stations throughout the country will not be manned in future.  The Irish Rail officials told me yesterday that they hope to provide personnel on trains on all lines to help passengers.  Obviously the personnel will be expected to assist passengers getting on and off at these unmanned stations.  I suggest that the initiative is worked out more properly.  I support the call made by the Senators for a debate as it would be timely in regard to everything that Irish Rail is trying to do and hope to do.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise another subject matter.  It is very good that the British Prime Minister has at long last - and I suppose it was forced on her really - dropped her red lines and now there is hope of progress being made.  It is good that there is going to be a cross-party approach.  It is the only way they would make progress, seeing that the two parties in the UK had their own difficulties for so long.

Ash dieback is a quite a serious disease, particularly in the midlands and a lot of the Ulster region.  Let me explain my reason for asking the Leader to raise the issue with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  His Department closed the scheme to tackle the problem in February 2018 and continued to tell people who have been affected by ash dieback that it will open the scheme next month but that been promised for the last year.  I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Minister and ask him to come here to discuss the matter.  I have discussed the issue before and Senator Boyhan is well in tune with it.  Ash dieback seems to have become a serious issue, particularly in the midlands.  As this is National Tree Week, which is an initiative that calls on people to plant trees, forestry is a topical issue at present.  A lot of forestry and certainly ash plantations in the midlands have been decimated by ash dieback.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise a curious query.  There has been a lot of talk, particularly by a Deputy in the area, about a new bridge being built in the town of Newbridge as part of a national plan.  I ask the Leader to ask the relevant Minister and then inform me whether there are plans afoot to build a new traffic bridge in Newbridge, as touted by some local Deputies.  I would appreciate if the Leader will bring me up to speed on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#M00700","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I thank the 18 Members of the House who contributed to the Order of Business today.  On my behalf I and that of my party, I express sympathies to the family of the late Michael Fahy who died.  Senators Leyden and Boyhan very eloquently paid tribute to the man for his longevity of service and his unique role in Irish politics.  We send our deepest sympathies to his family and to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on his sad passing.<\/p> <p>I join Senator Lombard in paying tribute to the late Pat McAuliffe who died suddenly on Monday in Cork.  In a previous incarnation I had the pleasure of working in RT&Eacute; Radio Cork as a sports reporter with Pat McAuliffe.  He was one of the most accommodating and supportive broadcasters to anybody engaged in journalism.  His encyclopaedic knowledge of sport was legendary.  His gentleness in his interviewing of managers and players after games was exceptional.  To his partner, to his brother Matthew, to the RT&Eacute; family and to the sports family in Cork we wend our deepest sympathies on his death.<\/p> <p>Senators Horkan, McDowell, Leyden, Feighan and Coghlan raised the issue of Brexit, which is a moving target every day.  We all share the sentiment the Senators expressed this morning.  We hope the British Parliament in tandem with the British Government arrives at a common-sense decision.  There is a joke going around that the British people might see the end of May before the end of April.  However, we have to pay tribute to the British Prime Minister at one level for her steadfastness in trying to get a result.  I welcome her engagement with Jeremy Corbyn this morning and I hope it will bring results.<\/p> <p>I note Senator McDowell's words regarding President Macron and the whole relationship.  I do not believe there is a payback for tax realignment and tax policy.  The T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and the Minister for Finance have said it repeatedly.  I certainly hope there is not because this is a stand-alone issue.  This is about the European project in itself as opposed to tax harmonisation or what individual countries do.  However, I would certainly be happy to agree to the Senator's request for a debate on the issue.<\/p> <p>I repeat that I hope the DUP will recognise that it has a key role to play.  It can bring people with it and it should take leadership given that the people who vote for that party will be dreadfully affected by a hard Brexit.  Equally, it is important that we continue, as the Taoiseach has done this week with meetings with President Macron and tomorrow with Chancellor Merkel, to build bridges across the Continent.<\/p> <p>Senators Horkan, McDowell and Gavan raised the issue of school patronage.  As Senator McDowell said, the issue needs to be handled sensitively and in an intelligent way.  The Minister and his Department have not been involved in the letters sent to schools in Malahide.  The process outlined by Government has two distinct phases: identification and implementation.  That is important because the transfer of patronage is about one issue.  In tandem with that, there needs to be proper consultation with the school community on the reconfiguration and the patronage issue.  The formal implementation phase has not yet commenced and there is no requirement on the Department until September of next year.<\/p> <p>There can be considerable scaremongering and hyperbole on the issue with suggestions about the refusal to celebrate Christmas, Easter or other festivals.  Many schools already do that in a non-denominational manner as it stands.  It is important to have a calm debate and a process that is informative and that is handled sensitively and carefully.  I understand the letters parents received are not based on information from the Department of Education and Skills.  I hope that the reconfiguration process around diversity will allow choice for families so that we can have the school communities that people want.  I look forward to that happening.  We will certainly have that debate again with the Minister in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>Senators Horkan and Gallagher raised the issue of what is happening to ATMs.  Senator Horkan made the sensible suggestion that the money could be dyed or decommissioned in some shape or form.  While I do not want to get into a particular row with Senator Gallagher, it is a bit rich of him to criticise the Government when his party decimated rural areas.  He can do it if he wants, and he can say it again.  Fianna F&aacute;il closed Garda stations.  It closed the Garda College in Templemore.  It cut recruitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#N00100","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Fine Gael has been in government for the past eight years.

The Minister for Finance, who was on \"Morning Ireland\" and \"Newstalk Breakfast\" this morning, is anxious to have a real debate on the matter.  The Senator made a point about deferral but the Minister has bona fides in respect of this issue.  His approach is to keep, but reform, the local property tax and to avoid a sudden increase in bills for people.  He wants to ensure valuations are based on a considered measure, rather than a rushed one.  Senator Boyhan spoke about money being spent but money is being spent locally, though I take his point that more needs to be done and that it needs to be better explained.  The Minister is sending a report to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which is welcome.  I would be happy for him to come to the House on the matter.

I also thank my group for supporting me and I thank all those who have spoken to me over the course of the development of this Bill in the past two years about their experiences of procurement, either as procurement officials or as people on the receiving end of public procurement.<\/p> <p>This topic may seem wide and abstract but public procurement affects every area of our lives, even the most intimate areas such as the food we eat in hospital, the surfaces our children fall on, the person on the other end of a phone line when we have called for help.  It affects the landscape and the greatest infrastructural projects too.  Our roads, streets, public spaces, schools, hospitals and all the buildings we share are part of the public procurement process in many cases.<\/p> <p>There are areas where the public delivery of services is better than public procurement but where public procurement is used, it is vital we do it responsibly and that we design and sign contracts on behalf of the people of Ireland.  When we do that, we have to ensure we get the maximum public benefit, including the social and environmental benefit.<\/p> <p>My interest in this area dates back to 2014 when the current European directives were being introduced.  In 2015 and 2016, when I was still a member of civil society organisations, we worked around the potential we saw in those directives and the scope in them for social, environmental and other considerations, a scope which has, unfortunately, largely been unrealised.  My Bill is not simply more pressing in the context of recent controversies such as CervicalCheck and the collapse of school projects under Carillion and Western Building Systems.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not simply a response to the problems which need to be addressed.  It is also about the potential to be realised, the fact we spend tens of billions on public procurement and that those tens of billions are an incredible source of leverage and potential benefit to all our people.<\/p><p>We turn to the subject matter of my Bill, which concerns public procurement.  What it does is to try to join up the dots in the procurement process and put quality at the heart of that process.  There are three ways that a contracting authority may decide to undertake procurement, three bases on which it can decide to make its decisions.  It can decide on the basis of the price-quality ratio, the balance between price and quality, it can decide on the basis of life cycle costing, or it can decide on the basis of lowest price only.  Lowest price only was what was used in regard to CervicalCheck.  It has been shown to have serious consequences because it removes quality from the equation.  If the decision is made to go with the lowest price only approach, it becomes very difficult to try to introduce quality later on in the process.<\/p><p>At the time the European directives were transposed, France and Scotland chose to exclude lowest price only altogether so that lowest price would not be an option for contracting authorities.  I am not attempting to replicate that.  Instead, my Bill focuses on the Dutch model, which respects the discretion of contracting authorities but seeks to change practice and culture.  Under my Bill, the price-quality ratio, where price and quality are considered, would become the default and the norm.  Contracting authorities have the discretion to decide they want to go for lowest price only, but if they go for lowest price only, that needs sign-off at a senior level and they must publish a rationale.  Effectively, what this Bill does is to oblige authorities either to think about quality or to think about why they are not thinking about quality.  I hope it will lead to a change in practice where lowest price will become the exception rather the rule.<\/p><p>In most areas, the Bill does not seek to prescribe the exact ratio between quality and price in a decision.  It recognises that this may vary and, for example, it may be 30%, 80% 60% or 40% on quality.  The one area where we do set targets, however, is in regard to the billions which will be spent under the national development plan.  These projects are not like those where, if we sign a three-year contract, we can learn from it and make changes the next time.  National development plan projects are once in a generation or once in a lifetime projects.  We simply have to get them right.  That is why the Bill sets a threshold or target of 50% minimum for quality on national development plan projects.  Again, exceptions may be made but a sign-off at senior level is required and the rationale must be provided.<\/p><p>I want to clarify an important point.  This Bill does not mean that procurement has to cost more.  In the Netherlands, the model which we are following, 73% of contracts still went to a lower bidder but those lower bidders also had to prove themselves in terms of quality.  What it means is that commitments and evidence in regard to quality were on the table alongside the proposals on price.  It is very important to note that research from the construction industry and from academic institutions in the Netherlands found that the public benefit was 2.4 times higher where a mix of price and quality was used.  What we saw was that for a little bit more thought earlier in the procurement process, almost double the public benefit was delivered.<\/p><p>What do we mean by quality?  This Bill is not prescriptive.  It recognises that what is quality in one area may differ in another.  Sometimes it is about the track record, the performance and the materials that may be introduced.  The Bill is not prescriptive.  It largely reflects the wide space within the language of the directives in terms of quality.  What it also does is to require ministerial guidelines to be put in place.  Those guidelines will contain existing commitments and targets, that is, cross-cutting commitments made by Government and already signed off on.  They are not ones I am adding in but ones that already exist.  These would be in areas like climate, accessibility and inclusion.  This will get people out of their silos when they are doing procurement and it promotes joined-up thinking.  If I am designing a space and I look to the commitment in regard to, for example, Irish Sign Language accessibility, maybe I will build a space for an interpreter because I have become aware of that cross-cutting commitment.  If we are using materials, we may think more about their sustainability and how they contribute to our emissions targets.  It is joined-up thinking.  Again, it is for contracting authorities to decide which elements of those guidelines they wish to take on board, but it requires they show they have thought it through.<\/p><p>In the Bill, I also put forward the human rights duty.  Again, the human rights duty already exists for public authorities and they are required by law, including in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission legislation of 2014, to promote equality and human rights.  What this Bill simply does is require them to report on how they are delivering on equality and human rights, and to build that in to their regular procurement reports, as required by the regulations.<\/p><p>I want to address a few questions and concerns that have been raised with me over the course of my conversations with different parties.  Who is involved in the sign-off?  In the Bill, I set out Accounting Officers, accountable officers and Ministers as sign-off.  Having engaged with the Government and listened to the concerns that were raised, however, it is my intention to remove Ministers from that sign-off process on Committee Stage, and I have engaged the Office of Parliamentary Legal Adviser, OPLA, on amendments to that effect.  It will be Accounting Officers and accountable officers, usually at Secretary General level.<\/p><p>Will this require more red tape?  The answer is \"No\".  What this Bill does is save us from complicated processes of repair later on in the procurement process by making sure things are done in a clear and transparent way from the beginning.  It is empowering legislation.  It empowers procurement officers to think about quality.  I have spoken to those who feel nervous about using quality because they feel they would have to get permission from above.  Now we know they can think about quality and they can do a better job.  In the same way that, for example, the fines being added in terms of data protection empower data protection officers, this Bill empowers procurement officials to think in creative and positive ways about the benefits to society.<\/p><p>The Bill has wider benefits.  It rewards and allows for the recognition of those companies, usually SMEs, that are delivering higher standards, that have records and that have done the work in terms of quality.  It gives SMEs from whichever European country a potential comparative advantage.  It also has the wider benefit that when the State, as the largest customer in Ireland, raises the standards, it raises standards right across the board.<\/p><p>I thank all of those who have supported me on this Bill.  I believe it can be a game changer in terms of the landscape, culture and practice of public procurement.  If successful, I believe it will have ripple effects across every area of our life together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#O01200","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending.  I formally second the Bill and commend Senator Higgins on bringing it forward.  It is an incredible Bill that will have an immeasurable impact on people's lives through how the State engages in the public procurement process.  It is a testament to Senator Higgins and her drive for positive reform in this sometimes complex and technical area.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I pay tribute also to Ciara Gaynor and Janet Horner in our office for all their work to get the Bill to this point.<\/p><p>Getting the process by which the State tenders, vets and awards contracts to companies in the private sector for the provision of State services right is important in many areas.  Ethical, fair and balanced public procurement is key to fostering public confidence, ensuring the State leads the way on the use of procurement to advance human rights and equality and ensuring we do not take a short-term perspective for a short-term financial saving which, in fact, ends up costing more and more in future.  Procurement may be a complex process in itself, but the end result impacts on the lives of citizens in incredibly intimate and important ways.  While the Bill may involve a great deal of jargon and appear, on the surface, simply to change the balance in assessing the ratio across price, cost and quality, it is actually about immeasurable improvements in the real lives of people who interact with the firms we contract through public procurement.  The Bill is not prescriptive about who should be awarded contracts.  Rather, it sets the philosophical underpinnings according to which those choices should be made.  As such, we say quality, accessibility for disabled persons and sensitivity to the experiences of minority communities, including migrants, LGBT people and Travellers, are just as important as financial costs and just as valuable in the achievement of excellence and confidence in our public procurement process.  This area may be full of complicated processes and various oversight and accountability measures but at its heart, it is about people and making their lives and experiences better and safer while providing higher quality services.  That is why the Bill is so important.  It seeks to create a shift in culture where we end the race to the bottom and start to think about public procurement in a new way.<\/p><p>The Bill is not about simply saving ourselves money for the coming budget but about a commitment to valuing the quality of goods and services.  If the State cannot be everywhere and do everything, it is the people we choose and the goods we select through public procurement that will make up the foundations of our motorways, food for our schoolkids and the processing of our most personal and private data.  Public procurement cannot and should not just be about how to spend as little money as possible in the here and now.  It should be about building a process that can look 20 years into the future when assessing costs while learning from past mistakes to ensure procurement processes grow and develop.  In the procurement process for once-in-a-generation projects such as those under the national development plan, we must set ambitious targets in the weight we give procurement quality.  We will not get a second chance.  Price should not be the be-all and end-all when decisions are made as to who will build our schools and hospitals, feed our kids in schools and administer important parts of our health service.  Personally, I do not want the only thing to matter in who we choose to be how low they dared to bid for a contract.  I want to know that when a procurement officer decides who is to get a contract, he or she has the well-being of my children in mind and is thinking about our domestic and international human rights and equality commitments, not seeking only to make an immediate saving for the Exchequer.  I want officials to take a long-term perspective and to consider properly the importance of the quality of the services being tendered.<\/p><p>At the briefing on the Bill in the audiovisual room yesterday, it was stated that everyone who had been involved in public life or the provision of services in Ireland would have many examples of bad public procurements which they wish could have been avoided.  They would not have proceeded if they had known how they would turn out.  I am sure the Senators present can think of examples.  Could they have been prevented by a Bill like this?  Could the CervicalCheck errors have been avoided if a Bill like this had governed the public procurement process that outsourced those checks?  Today is the first anniversary of those errors becoming public knowledge.  Could the lives and health of the women involved have been safeguarded if quality of procurement had been mandated as of equal importance as cost?  I sit on the education committee where we investigated the failings by Western Building Systems, which led to 42 schools being assessed in respect of their structural safety.  My daughter was a student in one of those.  I want my daughter to go to school in a building that is warm, comfortable and safe, not one that was built as a result of a race to the bottom for the lowest-cost bid and which may simply fall down.  Could the building errors have been avoided if quality was given as much weight as price?  We will never know.  However, the Bill will go some way to safeguarding against catastrophic errors like this in future.  Even when it comes to the food served in schools, hospitals, direct provision centres and our prisons, I do not want contracts awarded on the basis of the lowest cost.  Nutrition is an important area where even small increases in cost can result in huge increases in quality.  I want to know considerations like this are required to be factored into a procurement process.<\/p><p>I thank Members who are supporting the Bill and pay tribute to Senator Higgins again.  It is a great Bill and it will improve people's lives.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#P00200","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I welcome the thrust of the Bill albeit there are aspects of it around which I have concerns.  The Bill is about getting the most economically advantageous tender and how that process should work.  A fundamental point, to which Senator Higgins referred, is that one cannot have the final decision-maker involved in any way in the process.  Section 2(4)(b) of the Bill provides that &quot;In applying <i>subsection (2)<\/i>, contracting authorities shall not include a best price&ndash;quality ratio in a case to which the National Development Plan relates where the price criteria is greater than 50 per cent&quot;.  Ultimately, we have to get value for money.  I do not fully buy the argument that one can absolve contractors on the basis that there was not enough emphasis on quality in a tender process.  If one is building, one should be building to standard.  There are regulations in place according to which one must build.  Therefore, I am nervous that if one brings the issue of price down to 50%, one may not actually get value for the taxpayer.  It is something I am concerned about.<\/p><p>The Senator said there was an exemption in section 4, which relates to departing from the contracting criteria.  Section 4(1)(b) provides that &quot;The requirements of <i>paragraph (a) <\/i>do not apply where the chief decision maker of the contracting authority or contracting entity concerned is satisfied that there is no material difference in quality between the potential options&quot;.  Once again, whatever criteria and weightings apply should be dealt with in their entirety.  One might now have a situation where a person says that in fact the bulk of the criteria can be parked because they are all the same and simply go back to price.  It might undermine the Senator's argument about it not being solely around price.<\/p><p>A review is ongoing between the Department and stakeholders around the best way to get value and around social considerations.  I place the matter in a local context for myself.  When we had the regeneration projects under way in Limerick, I would have liked to see more local workers involved.  Typically, however, projects had to go on eTenders under the public tendering process to which anyone could apply.  However, a requirement was later brought in that 10% of people had to be employed locally, which I supported strongly.  I understand that Senator Higgins has met the Minister and that there are discussions taking place.  I fully understand the import of the Bill but I will always look for unintended consequences.  As such, I do not particularly like the fact that the Bill prescribes that not more than 50% of the decision on a contract can relate to price.  The worry is that those other aspects could be open to abuse.  I suggest we come up with some other basis.  Decisions cannot be solely on price because that has given rise to unintended consequences too and there may have been a race to the bottom, albeit we do not know if that is the case, and a review is ongoing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Value for money is also important.  I do not want a situation to emerge where contractors come in who are aware of the process involved and who kick the value for money issue down the road.  We are taking money from taxpayers and we have to spend their money wisely.  I understand the point of carrying out public projects, but we can never get away from the fundamental point that if people are paying income tax or if they are on social welfare and are paying VAT on the goods they buy, we have to ensure we spend their money wisely.  That point is often lost in the process.  When I speak about taxes, I am not referring to taxes paid by people who are working but rather all taxes, including income tax, companies paying corporation tax, VAT and stamp duty.  We have to ensure we get value for money. This is an important matter, and I welcome the discussion, but I do not support much of the detail proposed.  I support the social aspect of it, but I will let the Minister put the Government's view.  I regard this as a working document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#Q00200","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Higgins and Ruane for introducing this Bill.  I am happy to tell them that Fianna F&aacute;il is happy to support it through to Committee Stage.  That is not to say that it is perfect as it is - we all acknowledge that it is a work in progress - but the idea of examining public procurement and public authorities and utilities under the contract preparation and award criteria is a very timely topic to be discussing in the context of issues such as the national children's hospital.  I do not want to be party political about it, but we are all wondering how an initial figure of &euro;650 million seems likely to rise to &euro;2 billion.  Equally, the national broadband plan for rural areas, which is the scheme the State has been promising since 2012 or 2013 and which intends to deliver to areas that do not have high-speed broadband, is associated with high costs.  There are implications around how we will deal with that.  This is not just about the cheapest way to do things.  We need a quality product.  Technology is changing by the week or month in terms of what can be delivered and how it can be delivered, and there are questions as to whether we should use fibre optics or wireless systems or alternatives.  These things are all very important.<\/p> <p>We probably all know the adage that if something is too cheap to be true, it probably is not true.  The saying \"buy cheap and buy twice\" is equally true.  I have often seen scenarios where people have been presented with a list of contractors for a school building project, for example, or any kind of commercial contract, having been told that they must select the contractor offering the work at the lowest price.  They end up praying that particular contractors do not come in with the lowest price, because they know that particular contractors have a history of coming in low, finding fault with everything, making many changes to the plans, and then charging enormous prices.  They end up being thankful that particular contractors do not get the tender or feeling that they are in trouble because the contractor did get it because, although they tendered at the lowest price, it is well known that it will require far more management and attention to ensure that problems do not arise and costs do not escalate.  There are many reputable contractors, but they are not all as good as each other.  There are those which are better and there are those which have a bad track record of delivering the projects they promised to deliver.  There is certainly merit in looking at a system which does not say that the lowest tender always has to be accepted, regardless of who the contractor is or their track record.  There is scope to change that.  Perhaps, as the Bill is teased out, there are ways in which we can deal with that.<\/p> <p>We have the Government Procurement Office, and it is the case that many areas, including the 400 voluntary secondary schools, have schools procurement units which advise schools on how best to procure things, such as negotiating with the ESB or for gas or any other items schools require.  If a security alarm contract or a burglar alarm contract can be negotiated, there are savings that can be made.  Nobody has to pay over the odds.<\/p> <p>CervicalCheck was mentioned by a number of people as an example of another scandal.  I am not sure that this Bill would automatically solve the problems that arose around CervicalCheck, but it is certainly timely in that it looks at how we procure and how we look at the initial tender.  We faced issues about mobile phone licences years ago and the weighting that went to various things.  People were on the committee that decided how those weightings would be allocated.  Almost by default, once a level of subjectivity is introduced, we enter an area that can possibly be manipulated.  It can be coerced in a particular way to favour one person or another, and I do not know if that can be legislated for.  It is something we need to be careful of.  As Senator Higgins develops her Bill, we must ensure that there is a significant level of transparency involved.  People may not like the CAO system, but at least it is transparent.  Once interviews are brought into processes, it becomes likely that people will meet others that they know directly or through other people.  It will all be transparent, but there will be a level of subjectivity involved.  Sometimes it is useful, but problems arise over how the process is handled, the personnel on the board, who selects the tender and whether they have any conflicts of interest.  All of those points have to be considered.<\/p> <p>Relevant points were made about Carillion and Western Building Systems.  Both companies appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to discuss the collapse of Carillion.  We heard how contracts are awarded and how the main contractor gets the work.  I know many people who have done work for the State having got the job as a subcontractor to a main contractor.  The main contractor was paid by the State, but the subcontractors got treated very badly in some cases by that main contractor.  I know some of these people, and they are very good business people who were very good at the work they did.  These people thought they were doing work for the State, whether for the Garda or the courts system, but they were caught out because the main contractor and subcontractor fell out, leaving the subcontractor in a very difficult position.  The main contractor benefited from that difficulty.  All of those things must be looked at when we are dealing with State money.  It is not fair that anybody who does the job they signed up to do does not get paid.  Equally, it is not fair if people do not do the job they are being paid for.<\/p> <p>This is useful legislation.  I have a couple of concerns that the Minister of State may be able to address when he makes his contribution.  It may not be possible to allow a money Bill to be introduced by someone who is not a member of Government.  I will be interested to see if the Minister of State considers that this is legislation that will require a money message at some point.  If it does and it is not going to get one, this could be the most wonderful idea but it will go nowhere.  I hope that is not the case, but perhaps the Minister of State could address that.<\/p> <p>In terms of procurement and contracts generally, whether broadband or the national children's hospital, there is a need to shine a light on how this is done.  I do not want to repeat the valuable contributions made by Senators Higgins and Ruane, who covered many of the points I might have made were I introducing the Bill.  I wish it well on Committee Stage.  We have concerns but we are happy to tease it out further on the next Stage.

It aims to improve the quality of procurement, as well as protect the construction sector from a system that at times focuses predominantly on price at the expense of the construction sector, particularly subcontractors.  The Bill focuses primarily on improving the weighting of price and quality and on enhancing the guidelines on social considerations.<\/p> <p>I will offer some observations on the Bill.  It gives further effect to the 2014 EU directives on public contracts and utility contracts.  Its primary purpose is to mitigate the use of pricing as the exclusive grounds for contract award criteria.<\/p> <p>Section 2 relates to public authority contracts, while section 3 deals with utility undertakings but it deals with them in much the same way.  The Bill details the most economically advantageous tender, MEAT, criteria under which contracts may be awarded, noting that these criteria include elements such as price, quality, social and environmental considerations and so on.  However, the way these elements are weighted is not specified in law and is for the contracting authority to decide.<\/p> <p>Section 2(4) specifies that contracting authorities shall not use price as the sole award criterion and that contracting authorities shall not weigh price above 50% in the contract award criteria.  This applies unless, as per section 4, the contracting authority does not believe quality would make a material difference to the public work or undertaking and issues a declaration to that effect to the Office of Government Procurement.  Such a declaration should then be published on its website.<\/p> <p>Identical provisions are given for utility undertakings in section 3.  A number of comments could be made in this regard.  There are times when price being given a predominant weighting in the awarding of a public contract makes sense.  One example is when there is little scope for differing quality among the bidding economic operators.  At other times, such as in the restoration of a heritage building such as Leinster House, it is advised that quality be given the predominant weighting.  It is universally acknowledged by industry that the use of price as the determining criterion in the awarding of public contracts has a number of negative effects.  Lowest price tendering leads to lowballing in the tender bids which inevitably leads to cost escalations.  We saw this with the national children's hospital.  The lowest price can compromise quality and lowest price favours large companies over small and medium-sized enterprises, since they possess large enough cashflows in their business to adjust for low bids.  For this reason, the Bill's attempt to restrict the use of price only in contract award criteria or in its weighting at over 50% is welcome.  However, there are some deficiencies.  In particular, the declaration that must be given to the Office of Government Procurement by the contracting authority, as per section 4(1)(b) is not fleshed out.  What must the declaration include?  On what grounds can it be rejected?<\/p> <p>Section 6 provides for the issuing of guidelines on social considerations concerning qualitative, environmental, social, human rights and equality considerations.  Contracting authorities would be obliged to compile a record of compliance with any of these obligations.  The Minister would then issue a revised set of guidelines or a report justifying why compliance is not required.  Any consideration of these social clauses is welcome, and, while we support it, we would also welcome legislation that hardwires principles of social justice and equality within the procurement process.  One example of this is the Social Clauses in Public Procurement Bill 2013, initiated by Deputy McDonald.  That Bill provided, among other things, that one long-term unemployed person should be employed for each &euro;1 million comprising the value of a public contract.  We would like to see such principles hardwired within the procurement process.  My party colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, is currently working on this.<\/p> <p>We are keen to see greater transparency and accountability in procurement practice.  Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien recently initiated the Regulation of Tenderers Bill in the D&aacute;il, which provided for the disqualification of abnormally low tenders and the disqualification of badly performing contractors from the tendering process.  Any Bill that seeks to improve the Government's lacklustre and costly procurement strategy should be welcomed.<\/p> <p>I thank Senators Higgins, Ruane and Black and the others involved in bringing forward this Bill.  We look forward to the Bill going to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#S00300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Senators Norris and Nash are next.

Under this law, a public contract is defined by who is doing the purchasing, what the person is buying and who the person buys from.  The various directives also set down minimum time limits.  That is fair enough because it gives companies from other countries in the European Union the opportunity to put in a tender.  Under the 2014 directives contracts are required to be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender, known as MEAT.  Again, I would argue that \"most economically advantageous\" also implies that some degree of quality control in place.  I would have thought that was absolutely essential.  Member states had the option of restricting the use of lowest price or lowest cost standards but Ireland failed to do so.  I do not understand why we did not do so.

I understand that this is based on the Dutch approach to this area.

In the Netherlands, 73% of contracts were awarded to the lowest bidder.  We still have a situation where the State is getting the best price but is also getting good quality, and that is very important for the taxpayer.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell spoke about taxpayers but we all pay tax.  Even the most penurious old age pensioner has to pay tax because he or she pays VAT and this, that and the other.  We are all taxed to death practically in this country.<\/p> <p>The Bill is significant in that it acknowledges the fact that there may well be situations in which the lowest price is the best.  It is significant that discretion is allowed here and one is not tied into a contract in a rigid way.  The parties that award the contracts are allowed significant discretion.  Other Members referred to various situations which call for a parliamentary response.  I refer to matters such as the Scally report where it was clear that part of the problem was opting for the lowest possible price and that created a significant problem.  Then there is the Carillion issue.  This work was outsourced to a British company, despite the fact that it was widely known that it had a high risk rating, but the State took the lowest price possible, not worrying about the question of quality.  Then we have the question of the construction of the children's hospital.  This is quite extraordinary.  There was a low quality rating and 75% of it was awarded on the low cost and 25% of it on quality.  That is ridiculous, particularly when the lowest bid was &euro;130 million less than the next one.  That is a margin of 20%, which is unheard of.  There might be 5% or 10% flexibility but when it reached 20%, questions should have been asked and if this Bill were in operation, such a situation would not continue to occur.

We have heard a lot about MEAT but what Senator Higgins is trying to achieve here is the addition of the two vegetables, which is a balanced diet and a balanced approach to public procurement because quality needs to be put at the heart of public procurement policy.<\/p> <p>The Labour Party is pleased to support this Bill.  It is a modest proposal and if taken on by Government and if it passes through the various stages here, and subsequently in the D&aacute;il, it could deliver a paradigm shift in tendering and procurement processes.  There is an onus on us in this Legislature to ensure that the State operates best practice and leads from the front in the power, influence and leverage that the State has in terms of it and us being the largest procurer of services, products and so on.  We have significant power and leverage that we do not often use in promoting best practice in labour standards, environmental standards and achieving quality design standards and aesthetics in public buildings, for example.  Some of the public buildings that have been constructed in the State in recent years and recent decades - and I acknowledge that design is a subjective matter - leave a lot to be desired.  It should be ensured in our  public procurement processes and in tendering and design standards that quality and aesthetics are at the very heart of them because the development of public buildings and public projects should be an expression of who we are and demonstrate who we are and what we want to be as a State.  At the heart of this Bill is an ambition to achieve those kinds of aims.<\/p> <p>State procurement should always aim to have a high standard of labour practices at the heart of everything we do.  At least in theory there is an obligation on those who successfully obtain public contracts to ensure that high labour standards are maintained and that labour and employment standards are maintained, respected and complied with but that is not always the case.  For example, in 2017, following an investigation that I established, it was found that a number of cleaning contractors which were used by the HSE were not paying the employment regulation order rate.  In one case it was in a hospital in the southern part of Ireland, not too far from Senator Kieran O'Donnell's base.  All the HSE did was to insist that the rate be paid to staff but the contractors got away with breaching and being non-compliant with an employment regulation order with absolute impunity.  Anyone in breach of employment and labour standards and in breach of our laws, whether they be tax laws, employment laws or whatever the case might be, should immediately lose the contract.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.<\/p> <p>I was interested in Senator Horkan's remarks on disputes that arise between subcontractors and main contractors in construction.  They are damaging disputes and many subcontractors went under in recent years because of the behaviour of large contractors.  Back in 2016, I appointed a panel of adjudicators under the Construction Contracts Act 2013, which emanated from this House under the guidance of former Senator, Feargal Quinn.  That legislation was nuanced and finessed by me and the then Minister, Deputy Howlin.  That panel of adjudicators is in place now and I understand it is working well.  It is an important protection for subcontractors who are employing many thousands of people in dealing with the vagaries of that industry because the reality was that in some cases a lot of subcontractors would have to go to the superior courts to get satisfaction and to get money that was owed to them returned to them.  Now we have this clear process in place that is very effective, from a cost point of view as well, to vindicate the rights of subcontractors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#T00500","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins in particular for her engagement with me and my Department over the past while, not only on procurement but on other issues.

If the Government is lacklustre, we would welcome any suggestion that she has in the same spirit as we have welcomed Senator Higgins's proposal.<\/p> <p>Public procurement is a key part of my portfolio and an integral part of the Government's overall reform agenda.  The Government acknowledges that the Bill is well intentioned with many good points raised and we appreciate, in particular, that Senator Higgins has engaged with my officials and those of the Office of Government Procurement in the development of the Bill.

I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General would not support some of the comments made.  I will address them shortly, but, first, I want to place the Bill and the Government's concern in the context of its public procurement reform programme.  The reform of the public procurement programme is and remains driven by the need to obtain value for public money in procuring goods, services and works.  The Office of Government Procurement and the procurement policy were put in place at a time when the country had literally run out of money and was banjaxed.  It is essential that the achievement of value for money is not adversely affected by the inclusion of overly prescriptive requirements and increased administrative and reporting burdens, which I know is not Senator Higgins' intention.  Public procurement is essential for the sustainable delivery of much needed public services.  The State spends approximately &euro;12 billion per annum on goods, services and works and procurement is a powerful tool in spending public money in an efficient and sustainable way.  Contrary to some of the commentary to the effect that the Government is spending nothing in Ireland, 94% of the &euro;12 billion is spent in the economy, of which approximately 54% is spent in the SME sector, to which the State is a large contributor.  Better managed procurement can lead to significant savings in public budgets and more investment.  How public authorities purchase directly affects an economy, through competitiveness, economic growth, levels of taxation and innovation, as indicated by Senator Ruane when she correctly said the State was the largest procurer in the country.  Public procurement also represents a huge business opportunity for all businesses, large and small.<\/p><p>It is essential that the public service operate in a co-ordinated and effective way to deliver value for money and sustainable savings for taxpayers.  Senator Norris who is not present questioned what is value for money.  I am sure if he took down any report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, he would find a succinct definition of what it is and, more importantly, what it is not.  Significant progress has been made since reform of the public procurement programme began and the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, commenced operations in 2014 under the then Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  Together with four key sectors &ndash; health, defence, education and local government - the OGP has been driving the achievement of value for money, enabling compliance, promoting business participation in procurement, increasing communication and guidance, professionalising the service and driving transparency.  It is doing so in the context of the EU directives specifically set out for procurement.<\/p><p>While the OGP has made significant progress in driving implementation of the reform programme since 2014, this is an opportune time to reflect on the progress made and the challenges that remain and to consider the learnings, with a view to identifying the future direction and shape of public procurement and how best to achieve it.  It is something I have asked my officials to initiate in conjunction with Government colleagues and others to see what suggestions can be made.  I have said it previously in this and the other House.  It is welcome that Senator Higgins has taken up the opportunity to do so.  If there others who wish to do so to bring forward proposals without using words such as \"lacklustre\", I would welcome them.  A consultation process is under way to ensure all elements of the reform programme will be aligned.  I have sought the views of Ministers, their Departments and bodies under their aegis, as well as SME representative bodies via the SME advisory group.  I chair the group which meets regularly and reflects the leadership of small and medium-sized enterprises across the country.  All suggestions made in the group are considered and many of them have been implemented by the Government.  The feedback from the consultation process will help to shape future public procurement policy and operations aimed at having a more efficient and accountable public procurement process.  I do not think any Senator is suggesting it is anything other than accountable.<\/p><p>My Department recently launched a consultation process with construction industry stakeholders to develop the next generation of public capital works management framework, to which reference was made.  Both the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I are very conscious of the construction industry specifically.  While several references were made by Senators who are no longer present to the construction sector, not everything is falling down.  Not every hospital is falling down and not every school project is over budget.  Not every process is failing.  The vast majority are totally within budget and of very good quality and we never hear about them.  That is probably true in the case of 99% of them, but that is a separate issue. <\/p><p>A specific issue to be addressed in the consultation process is the consideration of creating a revised quality to price balance in the award of public works contracts.  It will address the use of MEAT, most economically advantageous tender, an unfortunate acronym that I do not particularly like to use, and the words \"lowest price\" in contract evaluation.  It would not be appropriate to be prescriptive in primary legislation in that regard.  The Bill proposes that contracting authorities should award contracts on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender, rather than price only, unless sanctioned by a Minister or the Accounting Officer.  While I appreciate the concerns raised by Senators about the use of price only in procurement processes, such a provision would be disproportionate and add to the administrative burden in buying generic, commonly acquired goods and services.  I think the Senator also acknowledged this.<\/p><p>When debating the issue of procurement, a lot of attention is focused on the award stage of public procurement processes.  What many do not realise is that there are a number of stages in the process that can be used to develop and assess the quality of commonly acquired goods or services that make them suitable to be assessed on a price only basis.  A lot of work goes on in the Office of Government Procurement specifically on this issue in the development of frameworks that can be used in the procurement of individual products.  For example, the specifications and requirements in the procurement of office supplies, books, electricity, fuel, consultancy and recruitment services and a range of other products can be set out clearly in tender documentation, leaving the buyer room to judge the primary difference between suppliers, which is the price.  It has to be acknowledged that public procurement facilitates the State in being in a position to provide much needed public services in a sustainable manner.  Therefore, reducing the public buyers&rsquo; choices in assessing tenders could impact on the sustainability of such service provision.  The existing model reduces considerably the burden that would otherwise be carried, for instance, in respect of bureaucracy, if we had to treat each procurement process as separate.<\/p><p>Under EU law, the method used in evaluating tenders must be set out clearly at the start of the process.  The proposed legislation would, therefore, require a Minister or an Accounting Officer to become directly involved in developing the strategy for numerous procurement processes.  This would not be practical, as the Senator said.  It would not be possible to intervene at award stage because the methodology to be used in marking would have been decided and published as part of the tender documentation.  I think everybody accepts that if a Minister or an Accounting Officer was directly involved, it could lead to a situation where he or she would be wide open to allegations of improper interference in the procurement process.  While I know that is not the intention, it could, as Senator Horkan noted, be an unintended consequence.  It would be not be realistic to expect a Minister or an Accounting Officer to be in a position to develop detailed award criteria for all processes.  It would invariably lead to questions about the integrity of the process and political interference, perceived or otherwise, in individual spending decisions.  Therefore, a Minister should not be involved, as proposed in the Bill.  While I understand and appreciate the Senator intends to remove that provision on later Stages of the Bill, having Accounting Officers or accountable persons involved in the development and sanctioning of individual procurement processes raises similar issues.  These posts require a level of independence in order to be able to gauge and question the activities of officials reporting to them.  Everybody accepts that they have to be above reproach.  If they were required by law to be directly involved in procurement processes, this reporting line would be broken, creating a potential gap in accountability.  The legislation is not entirely clear on the reporting or declaration arrangements for the utilities sector which is largely privatised.<\/p><p>The Government is exploring the scope for the inclusion of social considerations in public contracts such as environmental sustainability, disability access and training for young or disadvantaged persons.  This arises specifically from an issue that was raised with me a number of months ago by former Senator Kathleen O'Meara which I took on board.  It is because of that very positive engagement with the former Senator that we have started to explore the inclusion of social considerations.  There might be an opportunity for me to update the House on what we are doing in that regard.  A cross-departmental social considerations advisory group has been established.  It brings together relevant officials from policy departments and procurement practitioners to promote and facilitate the incorporation of social considerations into public procurement projects.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This was done with the support and leadership of three Ministers of State, Deputy David Stanton, Deputy Finian McGrath and myself.  The group will give practical assistance to public buyers that wish to use public procurement to enable wider public policy considerations.  It held its first meeting on 12 March 2019.  Membership of the group is drawn from the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Rural and Community Development, Justice and Equality, Health, Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Housing, Planning and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Education and Skills for guidance on training issues.  The group's functions include the identification of social policy objectives that could be advanced through public procurement; matching some of those identified social objectives with suitable procurement opportunities, to be trialled on a pilot basis; and advising on the appropriate method for incorporating social considerations into frameworks and contracts.<br\/><br\/>The group will consider monitoring and reporting arrangements, which can be applied to future projects where social considerations are to be incorporated.  It will also advise on the development and implementation of strategies to communicate its work across the public sector, including any policy and training implications therefor.  If opportunities arise this framework and group provide a means of exploring them.<br\/><br\/>Public procurement in Ireland is governed by EU and national law and national guidelines.  The EU treaty principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination, transparency, mutual recognition, proportionality, free movement of goods and services and the right of establishment must be observed on all tenders.  All public procurement processes must comply with national legislation.  There is, therefore, no need to restate the requirement to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 as this is already the case.<br\/><br\/>Two articles in the directives also cover human rights issues.  Article 18 of the public procurement directive provides: <\/p><blockquote>Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that in the performance of public contracts economic operators comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or by the international environmental, social and labour law provisions listed in Annex X.<\/blockquote><p>Senator Nash rightly referred to this provision in his contribution.  He legitimately raised cases where people have been unfortunately mistreated in the public sector.  This is not unique to the public sector or to Ireland.  We must all work collectively to stamp this out. <br\/><br\/>In addition, Article 57 gives contracting authorities the right to exclude an economic operator where it has been the subject of a conviction by final judgment in a number of areas, including child labour and other forms of trafficking in human beings as defined in Article 2 of directive No. 2011\/36\/EU.  Extensive general guidance on conducting procurement in line with legal requirements is available to public authorities on the Irish portal for public procurement and the website of the OGP. <br\/><br\/>Staff involved in public procurement processes are required to be aware of the provisions of the various Acts, directives, regulations, policies and procedures that relate to their procurement area.Moreover, the OGP has developed standard template tender documentation which sets out obligations for the successful tenderer.  This strong regulatory regime, combined with a consistent application of procurement practices through the use of standard template documents, ensures that human rights are fully considered in a public procurement process.  That is notwithstanding the concerns that Senator Higgins raises.  However, I am sure she will accept that a lot of what she has raised could be covered in other legislation. <br\/><br\/>I understand that the Bill, which deals with the fundamental aspects of how the State procures, has not undergone a regulatory impact assessment.  In answer to Senator Hopkins' query, the Government's view is that this Bill would require a money message.  The Bill places an additional administrative burden on contracting authorities and limits options open to the State in seeking value for money on commonly acquired goods and services.  The measures proposed in it would call into question the audit trail of individual procurement processes and restrict the State's ability to provide services that represent value for money.<br\/><br\/>The Government appreciates the intention behind the Bill.  We have discussed it at length.  However, for the reasons I have set, it will abstain in the vote on the Bill.  This allows an opportunity to examine other options.  We appreciate the work that the Senator and her colleagues have done and the genuine and significant concerns that have been raised.  However, we have raised issues that could prevent the passage of the Bill.  I will abstain on it.  When it proceeds to further Stages, there will be an opportunity for us to have a discussion on it line by line.  <br\/><br\/>Many of the contributions rightly stemmed from some procurement processes have gone pear-shaped.  People often form their own analyses, thoughts and reflections on things that go wrong.  There is an awful lot about the current processes that goes right, particularly our engagement with representative organisations of the small and medium enterprises, SMEs, that are doing this work throughout the country on a daily basis.<br\/><br\/>Issues pertaining to construction have recently been raised.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I are acutely aware of that.  We are working on the medium-term review of the construction works management framework.  Reference has also been made to costs arising from the national children's hospital.  I accept that point.  However, nobody is suggesting an issue concerning quality.  Quality was referred to in one of the contributions. <br\/><br\/>The Government will abstain on the Bill so it will probably proceed to Committee Stage, which will give us an opportunity to discuss it further.  As I outlined earlier, we are in the middle of a review of procurement processes in a range of areas.  We have sought the views of Departments and State agencies.  We are going to engage with the lead spokespersons of the Opposition as part of that.  Anybody is free at any stage to bring forward a detailed Bill on these issues, as Senator Higgins has done.  Not everything we do is wrong.  Throwing glib comments around in the Seanad or the D&aacute;il about how the Government spends money on behalf of the taxpayer will not get us anywhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#T00600","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and all other contributors for their engagement.

Rather, it is a part of value for money.  As the Minister of State mentioned the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, I took the liberty of checking its definition of value for money.  It is interesting to note that finding the lowest price is only one third of it.  The definition of value for money used by the Comptroller and Auditor General includes spending less, but spending effectively and wisely is equally important.  This Bill is an attempt to ensure that spending well and wisely is placed alongside spending less.  Those considerations are not in contradiction of the need to spend less, but alongside it, which is important.  This week, two or three committees are discussing procurement issues where problems were encountered.  These problems could be avoided if time was taken for a little more thought earlier in the procurement process. <\/p> <p>I wish to briefly address a couple of concerns.  There were questions regarding the criteria.  To be clear, there is no scope for the criteria to be discretionary.  They must be measurable, objective and clearly applicable to all who apply.  There are currently constraints on how criteria are applied and there is not much scope for discretion.<\/p> <p>There is concern that this would be used or manipulated.  Mention was made of tenderers who may be aware of the process.  At the moment those who are aware of the process know that all they have to do is tender an unrealistically low bid and if that is the lowest quoted cost, the contracting authority will be legally obliged to give them the contract.  As was described eloquently by Senator Horkan, this is despite the officials in the room knowing that it is not a quality bid.  This Bill seeks to address these issues upstream before any companies are involved and before there is a call for tenders.  It would take effect at the design stage of the tender to ensure that space to reflect on those issues is provided later when the call for tenders goes out and companies have applied.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I had already indicated that I intend to remove the reference to Ministers.  The Minister spoke of Accounting Officers being involved in detailed processes.  They would not be.  It would only be in what I would call exceptional cases, where lowest cost is being used in a very simple way, which will not be detailed, that an Accounting Officer would be involved.  In that case they would be involved simply in signing off on that decision.  It does not involve them in the process and they are not required to be involved.  Where quality is being used it would sit with the procurement officer.  I have talked with procurement officers who want to use quality measures, and sometimes feel nervous about whether they would be allowed to do that.  This would empower and encourage the appropriate level of procurement officers to go ahead and use quality measures in the right way.  It is an empowering piece.<\/p><p>The provision is at pre-call for tender and no companies are involved, so I do not believe there is the concern about company A, B or C.  This is before any company has bid, before the process is finished and before any involvement from an Accounting Officer has begun.<\/p><p>We are aware of the unintended consequences: we have seen them at lowest cost.  There is 2.4 times the benefit, which is back to the value for money issue.  This is what we have seen.  It is double the public benefit.  There were a few other issues but I will skip over most of them.<\/p><p>On the question regarding the Office of Government Procurement, it would not be in a position to reject a declaration but at least the rationale would have been published because the decision must sit within the discretion of the contracting authority.<\/p><p>I welcome that the Minister has indicated there is a national conversation under way on this.  It is very important.  The Minister referenced many of the stakeholders and I suggest that he may add another stakeholder.  As well as the companies and the contracting authorities, I would add the users of services to the list of stakeholders to ensure the users are heard, consulted with and given an invitation to talk about what it means to use adult diapers, to use a playground, to try to access a building and so on, and that this is reflected.  There is a real opportunity there.<\/p><p>Other Members have spoken about potential areas of exclusion such as poor employment standards, the non-payment of subcontractors and tax evasion.  That is another part of the procurement landscape, as are social clauses.  The Bill, which deals with design and criteria, will sit very well alongside proposals that other parties may bring around social clauses, social considerations and exclusions.  It does not attempt to do everything.  It is not attempting to intervene at one point in the process but I believe it will change the landscape, the practise and the culture.  It could change the experience of the public in a good way, as my colleague, Senator Ruane very eloquently noted, in respect of the trust the public has that their concerns and experience are cared about in procurement in Ireland.  I thank all Members who have supported this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#V00200","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1554283800,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#W00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#W00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

This Bill was brought before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport in October 2018 for pre-legislative scrutiny, where we had a robust and constructive debate.  The Bill was published in November 2018 and passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in December.  It then passed through Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il in January and Report and Final Stages between February and March this year.  At all Stages, there has been constructive debate.  Deputies on all sides made valuable contributions and, as far as possible, I have worked to accommodate the amendments tabled from the beginning of the process.  I have accepted four Opposition amendments and I tabled a further 14 amendments which were either agreed with Deputies in advance or simply served to refine the wording of the Opposition amendments.  While there have been differences of opinion, the spirit of the engagement has been largely collaborative and I believe the current version of the Bill is greatly improved on the version first published.<\/p> <p>The main purpose of the Bill is to implement European Union Regulation 598\/2014, which came into effect in June 2016.  This regulation sets out the rules and procedures regarding the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports.  As the regulation only applies to major EU international airports, based on traffic levels in Ireland, it only applies to Dublin Airport.  That is highly unlikely to change for the foreseeable future.  This Bill provides, for the first time, that noise generated by aircraft activity at the airport, including inbound and outbound flights, will be subject to extensive, detailed assessment, ongoing monitoring and regular review.  I propose to raise the bar for what the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, as the operator of Dublin Airport, is required to do to comply with noise rules.  This Bill is fundamentally about ensuring the sustainable development of the airport, which balances the ambitions of the DAA, the needs of business and tourism interests and the legitimate rights of local residents.<\/p> <p>As an island economy, we are heavily dependent on air connectivity and there is no doubt that the threat of Brexit on the horizon has brought that dependency into sharp relief.  At the same time, no reasonable Government can envisage unfettered development on pure economic interest grounds.  There have to be rules and regulations to ensure that all developments are justified, proportionate, appropriate and respectful of a broader range of criteria than simply economics.  This Bill provides for that broader perspective.  It respects existing planning and development and environmental laws and is underpinned by binding EU regulations and directives on environmental and aircraft noise.  It ensures that every time a planning application at Dublin Airport is considered, the aircraft noise implications will also be considered.<\/p> <p>Under Regulation 598, member states must designate a competent authority as the independent noise regulator, with responsibility for assessing noise, setting restrictions if required and monitoring and enforcing compliance.  In Ireland's case, Fingal County Council is to be designated as the independent noise regulator for Dublin Airport.  This is what the Government has decided and the Bill as passed in the D&aacute;il provides for that.  This designation has been the subject of extensive debate in the D&aacute;il, and during pre-legislative scrutiny.  Opposition Deputies have expressed concern that Fingal County Council is conflicted, largely because it receives rates from the airport authority, and there were also concerns that it did not have the required noise expertise.  I have addressed both of these issues head-on during the D&aacute;il debate, and I have also addressed them separately in parliamentary questions over recent months.  I do not believe there is substance in either of these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#BB00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Fingal County Council does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#BB00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>The issue of a potential conflict of interest has been considered by the Office of the Attorney General.  There are no legal grounds for it.  The fact that Fingal County Council raises some of its revenue income from commercial rates, and the fact that some of its rates income comes from the DAA, does not represent a conflict of interest in the context of the council being responsible for the regulation of aircraft noise at the airport.<\/p> <p>On the matter of resourcing and expertise, the council will establish a new, well-resourced, and dedicated aircraft noise regulation office within the executive branch, which will include the appropriate noise expertise.  The office will be headed at a senior level by a director of services, with all of the appropriate arrangements to ensure decisions are taken fully in accordance with the law.  By all reasonable, verifiable measures, there is a compelling case in favour of Fingal County Council.  I stand over the decision of the Government and the advice which underpins it.  It has been subject to extensive policy deliberation and legal scrutiny.  It is a robust and sound proposal.<\/p> <p>Any decision to be made by the council, in this role as noise regulator, will be evidence-based and will be fully in adherence with the requirements of national law and the EU regulation.  If it is anything other than this, then it will clearly be susceptible to challenge under the appeals process and-or judicial review.  That said, I have responded to concerns by agreeing to new provisions, passed in the D&aacute;il, for a regular periodic review of the performance of the noise regulator with regard to its functions under this Bill.  This review will take place within seven years of enactment, once a full cycle of the entire regulatory process, including any appeal, has been completed.  Furthermore, the noise regulator will be required to produce an annual report, detailing the work it has undertaken throughout the year and setting out its work programme for the following year.  This will be separate from, and in addition to, the annual report produced by Fingal County Council.  These new provisions were specifically included to address concerns raised by opposition Deputies in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>I would like to take Senators through some of the finer detail of the Bill.  At least once every five years, the noise regulator will undertake an assessment of the noise situation at the airport.  This will include taking into account future developments planned at the airport.  Where the noise regulator identifies a noise problem on foot of that assessment, it will adopt the so-called balanced approach.  The balanced approach is set out in the EU regulation and allows the regulator to decide what steps need to be taken by the airport authority to offset the impact of the noise.  It might mean more home insulation or adjustments to flight paths or it might require physical works to act as sound barriers.  That will be a matter for the regulator following its detailed assessment.  The balanced approach entails undertaking an analysis of the various measures available to reduce the level of identified noise through the exploration of four principle elements: noise reduction at source; land-use planning and management; noise abatement operational procedures; and operating restrictions as a last resort.  This process will be open and transparent.  There will be public consultation, and at each stage, the regulator will be required to publish information and evidence and keep all stakeholders abreast of developments.  Open consultation is an important aspect of the EU regulation which has been carried through to the Bill.  The draft decision will be accompanied by a report detailing how the decision was reached, which will include a non-technical summary.  This will ensure any individual will be in a position to input into the process and that the consultation will not be limited to those with technical expertise.<\/p> <p>This comprehensive assessment of noise by the regulator will involve consideration of the health impact of noise levels on local residents.  There was extensive debate on this issue during the D&aacute;il debates on Committee and Report Stages.  Some Deputies took the view that the Bill did not sufficiently reflect the importance of human health in the overall assessment of noise at the airport.  A number of amendments were put forward which they believed would address the perceived gap.  However, as I tried to explain during the debate, much of the commentary on the lack of reference to health in the Bill was based on a misreading of the Bill and of the underlying EU regulations and directives.  The Bill must be read in tandem with EU Regulation 598 and EU Directive 2002\/49\/EC, the environmental noise directive, because the noise regulator must have regard to all three of these in carrying out its regulatory assessment of noise.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In doing so, the regulator will have regard to the impact of aircraft noise on human health.  I tabled two amendments on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to highlight and make it more explicit that health aspects are to be considered by the noise regulator.  Two further amendments, however, which were passed in the D&aacute;il and which relate to the evaluation of health impacts on local residents, will need to be undone because they make the Bill legally unsound.  I will explain my rationale in greater detail on Committee Stage for seeking to remove these provisions. <\/p><p>The Bill also provides that where the airport authority applies to the planning authority to review and amend any current planning permissions, any such application will also require the input of the noise regulator before the planning authority makes a final decision.  This includes the current planning permission for the new runway, which has operating restrictions attached to it that reduce the number of allowable night-time flights.  It is well documented that the DAA views these operating restrictions as overly restrictive.  The Bill does not pre-empt any decisions that may be made by the noise regulator on the appropriateness of those restrictions if it has cause to review them.  It simply allows the noise regulator to examine all noise mitigation measures available, in line with the balanced approach, in order to mitigate any noise problem that may arise from the operation of the second runway.  Once it examines any application to review the operating restrictions attached to the second runway project if such an application is made, the noise regulator may determine that no change to the operating restrictions is needed, or decide on more onerous restrictions, or decide on an entirely new set of noise abatement measures.  That will be a matter for the new regulator. <\/p><p>Another aspect of Regulation 598\/2014 is the requirement to designate an appeals body to provide for an appeals mechanism against decisions of the noise regulator.  To provide for alignment with the Planning and Development Act, the Bill designates An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the independent appeals body.  Where an appeal against a regulatory noise decision is made to the board, it will have 18 weeks to make a decision.  There is also provision for the board to undertake a 14-week public consultation process where it is of the view that there are alternative noise mitigation measures or operating restrictions other than those proposed by the noise regulator.  An appeal against a planning decision can also be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In the circumstances where a planning decision into which the noise regulator has input is appealed to the board, once again the board will have the power to decide on the most appropriate noise mitigation measures and operating restrictions, if any, that are to be introduced at Dublin Airport.  The Bill, therefore, sets out a process for a noise regulation regime that will allow for full stakeholder engagement, along with an independent appeals process which will provide certainty to stakeholders.  In essence, it sets out a structured approach to assessing and addressing aircraft noise at Dublin Airport with the objective of facilitating airport development and expansion in a way that minimises, as far as practicable, the noise impact of that expansion. <\/p><p>The Bill outlines monitoring and enforcement powers, another area in which important changes were made in the D&aacute;il to address concerns raised by Deputies.  Provision has been made to allow any person to request the noise regulator to review the effectiveness of noise mitigation measures, which will allow for a system where local residents, businesses and schools with genuine complaints have somewhere to go.  On foot of a commitment I made in the D&aacute;il, I will table a further amendment on Committee Stage to make it clear that the noise regulator must respond in writing to any request made to it to review the effectiveness of measures.  There will also be an onus on the airport authority to ensure it adheres to any decision of the noise regulator and that any measures are implemented effectively.  The airport authority will be required to produce an annual compliance report, to include a non-technical summary, which will be published by the regulator.  The regulator will monitor compliance and has the power to direct the airport authority and airport users, as necessary, to comply with any noise mitigation measures and operating restrictions, with recourse to the High Court for non-compliance.  This is the most effective method to ensure compliance. <\/p><p>The Bill also provides for other consequential amendments to the Planning and Development Act, one of which is the declassification of development at Dublin Airport as strategic infrastructure development for the purposes of planning applications.  This measure will mean that an application for planning permission for development at Dublin Airport will revert to being processed in the same way as most planning applications, that is, any application will be made to Fingal County Council in the first instance, with provision for appeal to the board against its decision.  This arrangement will facilitate the involvement of the noise regulator in the processing of a planning application that has a noise dimension, with a direct appeal to any such decision to be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p>I will table a small number of further amendments on Committee Stage which will include commitments that I made during the Bill's passage through the D&aacute;il.  Ultimately, Regulation 598\/2014 is intended to ensure that major European airports are developed in a sustainable manner and are subject to oversight and scrutiny in respect of planning, environmental laws and noise levels.  The Bill will ensure that Ireland has an airport noise regulatory regime that is compliant with EU law and which meets international best practice.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#BB00500","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554283800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for appearing in the House to present the legislation.  We will reluctantly support the Bill to aid the development of the airport, although we share the concerns of many of the residents around the airport and in wider Fingal in respect of the manner in which the Government has approached the establishment of what it claims is an independent regulator.  Ireland will become one of only three countries in the EU which, when transposing the legislation, have given the local authority the responsibilty.  The Minister pointed out that the local authority is a large rate payer but argued that there will not be a conflict of interest.  It is the definition of a conflict of interest, however, that the people who pay the regulator a sizeable portion of their annual budget would be monitored by the same organisation.  As we know, the Irish Aviation Authority was originally intended to be the designated body but that was proven to be unlawful.<\/p> <p>While all the arguments on the importance of the airport have been made well, we will again table amendments that we tabled in the D&aacute;il and expand on them.  Since 2016, we have spoken about the issue of the noise regulator and which body it should be.  We have expressed our concerns time and again that the power will rest with the local authority, and we are concerned that it is being made such a large part of the local authority's responsibilities, given that there will be a director of services.  Having considered the other options, we believe such a role is unnecessary and will not provide the necessary balance for the independence that we, or anyone else, would require.  The requirement to have recourse to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is specifically mentioned in the Bill as a result of amendments we tabled.<\/p> <p>We would like to hear again the Minister's views on the ability of people to access funding, on how much will be made available for those directly affected or whose properties may have been directly affected, on the target, which will almost double the amount of air traffic approaching Dublin Airport, on the flight path adjustments and on the capacity of the new authority to impose the changes.  In light of the fact that once the runway is built, the flight path adjustments will be quite limited, I wonder what scope there will realistically be for the regulator to do anything in that regard.  When we table those amendments, we hope the Minister will reconsider them in order that we can make more progress on shaping the Bill.  As I stated, we are not happy with the alleged independence, which is the kernel of the issue.  While an ability to appeal decisions surrounding the legislation is important, that the referee will be paid by the airport leads us to be concerned that the legislation does not contain even the cover of independence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040300002#CC00200","speaker":"1414"}]
