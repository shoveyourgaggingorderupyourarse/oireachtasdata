This is a large increase in real terms in one year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently reviewing and building systems that will enable our development programme to grow further, including as a proportion of GNI, in a sustainable and responsible way.  This includes working in co-ordination with the many other Departments and bodies spending official development assistance.  My Department also continues to work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and other Departments through the interdepartmental committee on international development, on how a growing ODA allocation can be managed most effectively across government.  This, along with other work to further build systems and staff capacity, will inform when and whether it would be possible and appropriate to provide a roadmap to 0.7% for 2030.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to this but we tried to put a roadmap in place a number of years ago and it looked completely out of date within a year because of the pressures the economy came under.  We are trying to build capacity to ensure we can spend a lot of extra money every year before we agree to an actual financial roadmap to 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800005#C01000","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1637227200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his answer.  There is a great deal of merit in what we are already doing with ODA.  Next year's figure of 0.32% of our GNI is very welcome.  We know how well that money is going to spent and how far it will go.  However, I return to the end of his reply where he referred to the appropriateness of providing a roadmap.  It is 51 years since wealthy countries committed 0.7% of GNI to ODA and in the years since that commitment we have, I think, fallen &euro;24 trillion behind that in global terms.  Thus, in the absence of a roadmap, some of these commitments are just statements.  I do not doubt for a second the commitment but we need a roadmap.  That roadmap could say that if the global economy is on this level, here is how we will get there and if things subside a little more, then here is how we will get there in that eventuality.  However, we need to lay out a pathway to these commitments.  We leave ourselves a little at risk of talking about tokenistic commitments in the absence of a clear route to get there.

The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, anticipates spending close to &euro;120 million more on asylum and refugee costs in Ireland.  That is part of our overall ODA contribution because the costs for asylum seekers and refugees in their first 12 months in the country is considered ODA funding.  As such, we are working across Departments.  We have also agreed in the programme for Government to double climate finance by 2025 up to approximately &euro;225 million.

We would not have had &euro;174 million extra in the budget just passed were it not for our commitment to 0.7% by 2030.  I would not have had the political credibility to be able to do that.  That has been the basis of what we have been trying to do over the past number of years.  Even when we had Brexit budgets and Covid budgets that were significantly impacted by external factors, we still managed to quite significantly increase our ODA budget each year over the past number of years because of that commitment, which has been strongly welcomed by D&oacute;chas.

We need to ensure that the international media has access to the areas where migrants are and that there is assistance and support for migrants and their families in what is an extremely difficult situation.  Ultimately, we have to try to stop this too.  If we allow a precedent to be set, whereby third countries that have a quarrel with the EU can essentially use migrants in this way, that is totally unacceptable as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800008#F00500","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Policy","time":1637229000,"counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800008#F00600"},{"type":"question","time":1637229000,"counter":80,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[56489\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800008#F00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on his recent visit to Lithuania.","asker":"1481","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1637229000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I would like an update from the Minister with regard to his recent visit to Lithuania where, I understand, discussions around rule of law and issues pertaining to Hungary, Poland and Belarus took place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800008#F00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1637229000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I visited Lithuania on 27-28 October for a number of bilateral engagements.

Notwithstanding this, the passport service has issued more than half a million passports to date in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issue within one business week.  Current passport processing times are ten working days for simple adult online renewals, 15 working days for complex or child online renewals, 40 working days for first-time applicants on passport online, and eight weeks for the an An Post mail-in service<\/p>  <p>  The aforementioned passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and relate to passport applications submitted to the Passport Office with required supporting documentation.  When passport applicants do not provided all of the requisite documentation to the passport service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport.  Currently, there are 108,000 passport applications on hand at the Passport Office.  Of the online applications on hand, 34,000 or 35% of applications, are incomplete and the onus is on the applicant to submit the required documents to the service.  The passport service contacts applicants who have not submitted the requisite documentation.<\/p>  <p>  However, the passport service must wait in those 34,000 cases until the applicants submit the outstanding documentation that is required.  While it makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, its experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.  The passport service is attaching particular priority to the nearly 7% of online applications that have not been issued on or before the estimated issue date indicated to the applicant.  Intensive work is under way to eliminate this problem and these delays are regretted very much by the service.<\/p>  <p>  I will respond directly to all four of the Deputy's questions to make sure I get to them all.  I have answered the question on the timelines.  The requests for further information are predominantly about ensuring we combat against fraud, because fraudulent applications to the Passport Office happen all the time and we need to isolate and deal with them.  That is why paperwork and its accuracy are important.<\/p>  <p>  As many people did not travel and therefore did not look at their passports for 18 months, we anticipate there will be a much higher demand than normal for passports next year.  It could be somewhere between 1.3 million and 1.7 million passport applications.  That is why we are effectively doubling the numbers in the Passport Office and working with the Office of Public Works, OPW, to increase significantly the space within it.<\/p>  <p>  Why did we start off with a cap on Oireachtas Members of no more than five per week?  The reason is we wanted this to be a service specifically for emergency passports, not a general call line for Oireachtas Members for all passport applications.  We wanted to make sure we could fast-track emergency passports quickly for Oireachtas Members and felt it was unlikely they would have to deal with more than five emergency passports per week.  We got very negative feedback on that and have increased that number to 15.  The whole point is we want normal passport applications to go through the normal processes.  However, if there is an emergency, rather than having to look for the Minister or his office to solve it, we wanted to put what is in effect a call centre in place that could solve emergency cases quickly for Oireachtas Members.  That was the thinking behind putting a cap on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800010#H00200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1637230200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I understand that, but people should be able to rely on the Passport Office to communicate effectively with them, answer their questions and give them confidence that they have a reasonable prospect of getting their passport either on time or at least by the target issue date.

It still says the passport was available two days ago, but it is not and then we cannot contact the office.<\/p> <p>When we contact the Passport Office, or our offices contact the Passport Office, we are told by the officials that they will make their best efforts.  I appreciate that they are making their best efforts.  If one follows up again because the passport has not arrived two days before the travel date, one is told that it constitutes a second inquiry even though it is an inquiry about the same passport.  I would worry about limiting this.  The permanent government has to be held to account.  The only way that it can be done in certain instances is via Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800010#H01000","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637230800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>We are over time.

This service did not exist at all until we set it up.  Many people had been coming directly to me and my office to say that a family has to travel on Friday, but it does not look like the passport will have arrived until Monday or Tuesday.  They asked us to intervene in an emergency way.  We set up a special service on a temporary basis to deal with the fact that many emergency cases need addressing.  I want to make sure everybody knows that every time an emergency passport is taken out of the system, it slows the system down for everybody else.  The staff have to stop the machine and pull a passport out.  Hundreds of other passports are slowed down every time that happens.  We are trying to keep that facility to genuine emergencies, as much as possible.  That is not to say that the other information, whether it is on the online portal or on the phone, is not still there and available, as it always would be.

The European Commission Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d and David Frost met most recently on Friday last.  They agreed to continue and intensify talks at official level.  They will meet again tomorrow.  Following last week's meeting, Vice President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d noted the need to make serious headway this week, particularly on the supply of medicines.<\/p>  <p>  I met with Vice President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d in Brussels on Tuesday.  We agreed to maintain close contact as the European Commission continues its discussions.  I strongly welcome the continuation of talks between the EU and the UK.  We need to give these discussions every chance to succeed.  To recall, the protocol is the joint EU-UK solution to mitigate the disruption Brexit causes for citizens and businesses on the island of Ireland.  While concerns have been expressed about how the protocol is operating, it is important to note that support for the protocol remains strong in Northern Ireland.  Recent polling in attitudes to the protocol in Northern Ireland show that a majority of people view the protocol as a good thing for Northern Ireland.  People across communities support ongoing efforts to seek solutions and a pragmatic and flexible approach.<\/p>  <p>  I remain in regular contact with business, civil society and political stakeholders in Northern Ireland.  I am very aware of their views about the opportunities the protocol offers to Northern Ireland, giving them access to both the UK and EU internal markets.  Surveys show that two thirds of Northern Ireland businesses see the opportunity here.  We are seeing historically high foreign direct investment interest in Northern Ireland.  We need to use the protocol to deliver on a prosperity agenda for the people of Northern Ireland.  Realising these opportunities should be the focus of our energy at this time.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has listened carefully to the views of Northern Ireland.  The Commission has brought forward a package of proposals, published on 13 October, which addressed the issues that matter most to people in Northern Ireland.  The Commission's engagement with people in Northern Ireland is continuing.  Last week, Vice President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d held two round-table meetings with businesses and civil society to ensure their voices continue to be heard as talks with the UK progress.<\/p>  <p>  Ensuring the uninterrupted long-term supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland is a key protocol-related priority.  The European Union has committed to doing whatever it takes to address this issue.  It has clearly signalled a willingness to amend EU law to ensure that the supply of medicines to Northern Ireland is fully safeguarded.  The European Commission has also brought forward proposals regarding the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Its proposals could reduce sanitary and phytosanitary checks and controls by about 80%.  It would cut in half the checks, controls and documentation currently needed for goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.  This would make it easier for Northern Irish businesses to move goods into Northern Ireland, while at the same time continuing to benefit from all the advantages of full access to the EU Single Market.  The EU is also proposing an unprecedented role for Northern Ireland political representatives and stakeholders in the protocol, ensuring that the voices of the people of Northern Ireland are better heard and understood.  As Vice President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d has underlined, this package represents a significant move by the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has acted in good faith.  We now need a good faith response from the UK.  I call on the UK Government to engage seriously and constructively in talks with the EU, so that we can provide stability and predictability for Northern Ireland.  This is a point that I continue to make in my contacts internationally on the issue, including with my EU counterparts, whom I met in Brussels earlier this week - they have shown extraordinary solidarity and will continue to do so - and also in my contacts with the US Administration.  I look forward to the Deputy's comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800011#J01700","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1637230800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>There are three Members who each have one minute.

I have a supplementary question.  We have talked at length about the generous package of proposals that the European Commission has made on foot of engagement with Northern Irish civic, business and political leaders over the summer.  Perhaps the response to that from certain people has not been as appreciative as it should have been.  However, it has gone down very well, most importantly, in Northern Ireland.

Looking back ten days ago, it was clearly the case that the British media and the British political establishment had been forewarned that this was the time when Article 16 was going to be triggered.  Fortunately, they pulled back from the brink.  The intervention of the Irish Government and Irish diplomats played a significant part in that.  The British Government ultimately recognises that if it triggers Article 16, the EU will not then require this country to implement a hard border on the island of Ireland in order to protect the Single Market of goods.  What would have happened is that trade tariffs would have been put on UK goods coming into the European Union.  That clear message was sent by Ireland and by the European Union to Britain.  It forced the UK authorities to concentrate their minds.  However, I urge the Minister to keep going with these negotiations.

The way that Article 16 is being used as leverage in this whole situation is also a concern.  The instability and uncertainty that surrounds Article 16 is not where we need to be.  There needs to be greater clarity on it.  To what extent has the Minister been able to communicate these concerns to the parties involved?  He sounds more optimistic about the continuing talks.

There is much in that command paper that the EU simply cannot facilitate but there are certainly elements that can be the basis of agreement.  That is particularly the case as regards goods coming from Great Britain that we can show are staying in Northern Ireland, in terms of the removal of the vast majority of checks that are currently required on those goods.  It is important that we try to give space for the negotiating teams to make progress now.  Lord Frost and Vice President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d meet again tomorrow in Brussels and there is hope that the change in tone in those negotiations that was evident last Friday will have continued into this week in our efforts to try to find compromise and a way forward.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's question, of course we have to prepare for a triggering of Article 16 and a setting aside of significant elements of the protocol should the British Government decide to do that.

I do not believe the triggering of Article 16 is necessary and I think we can resolve the outstanding issues on the implementation of the protocol through dialogue and discussion.  It is also worth noting that the EU is willing to put into law, or into legal agreement, what it claims it can do to reduce the checks burden.

The MRV is an important element of the defence equipment development plan and is provided for in the Government's national development plan as a major capital project.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capacity for a wide range of maritime tasks.  The Naval Service retains certain capabilities that allow for underwater search and surveying, for example, an underwater remotely operated vehicle, ROV, and a magnetometer system.  As part of the ongoing development of capabilities, further capabilities that will enhance the Naval Service&rsquo;s under-sea situational awareness, such as multibeam echo sounder systems, are also being developed.  Projects for other vessel replacements, such as the replacement of the coastal patrol vessels the <i>L&Eacute; Ciara<\/i>and <i>L&Eacute; Orla<\/i>, will be considered over the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence in the context of overall capability development and funding, along with the overall equipment development plan process.<\/p><p>I accept that our capacity for subsurface surveillance is somewhat limited but we do have some capacity, particularly with the use of the ROV.

For this reason compulsory retirement ages for ranks in the Permanent Defence Forces are considerably lower than in many other forms of employment.  The age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force has been the subject of a number of reviews.  A range of policies were introduced to ensure an appropriate age profile and levels of fitness including fixed-term contracts for certain ranks enlisted from 1994 onwards.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from an adjudication in 2015, it was agreed that a further review of contracts of service for line corporals and privates and corporals in receipt of technical pay 1 and 2 would be conducted.  It was subsequently agreed with PDFORRA that all privates and corporals recruited post-1994 would be allowed to continue in service to 31 December 2022 or until they reach the age of 50, provided these personnel meet certain criteria during the interim period including medical grades and fitness tests.  This agreement was extended to include post-1994 sergeants who can also continue to serve to the same date, subject to their meeting similar criteria in the interim period.  These measures are in place to provide time for the review to be completed. <\/p>  <p>  A joint civil and military review of mandatory retirement ages of all ranks in the Permanent Defence Force has been conducted.  The review has taken into account the report of the Public Service Pay Commission on recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force which included in its recommendations the need to consider options to tackle barriers to extended participation in the Permanent Defence Force.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations in the joint civil and military review require consideration from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to implications on costs and pensions.  Discussions with PDFORRA will take place following consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

In that context, we need to overhaul the contractual employment situation for Irish troops.

The climate action plan follows the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 which commits Ireland to a legally binding target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050 and a reduction of 51% by 2030.  These targets are a key pillar in the programme for Government.  The climate action plan sets out a course of action over the coming years to progress further Ireland's response.  The plan sets out ambitious decarbonisation targets for key sectors including transport, industry, the built environment, electricity and agriculture.  The defence sector is not a specific sector identified in the national climate action plan.<\/p>  <p>  The public sector is required to show strong leadership and commitment to drive the decarbonisation goals we have set for ourselves.  The defence organisation has a positive track record in this regard.  The plan also requires strong buy-in from private sector businesses, householders and others to make a concerted effort to reduce energy usage, conserve water and so on.<\/p> <p>An important part of the climate action plan is that public bodies will lead by example.  The defence sector is no exception.  There are multiple examples of us leading in this space in terms of how we manage buildings and energy management in barracks.  We have incorporated that into our capital investment plans in terms of efficiency, energy management and green procurement, which is essential as well.<\/p> <p> When we are looking at replacing ships, for example, efficiency and energy management will be a big part of that, which it is.  No sector is exempt from driving down emissions and that includes defence as well.  That will certainly be factored into our capital investment programme.

In terms of the climate impact, how are we equipping our forces to be able to respond in an effective and efficient manner in our overseas roles?  We have seen increased desertification and an increase in sea levels and that has an impact on the movement of people, giving rise to more refugees.  That is the reason I say it is a difficult area to get a grip on, in some respects, but because of the role the Defence Forces play, there must be a specific plan in this area.

I wish to outline to the House the scale of investment activity being targeted at improving the Defence Forces built infrastructure as set out in the five-year plan published in January 2020.  The programme provides a blueprint for investment in the Defence Forces built infrastructure over a multi-annual timeframe.  The allocation of &euro;37 million for maintaining and improving the building stock in 2021 was the highest allocation since 2008.  This level of provision will be increased in 2022 to accelerate the already successful delivery of the programme.<\/p>  <p>  The future development of the Defence Forces training centre is prioritised in the infrastructure plan.  In recent years, we have seen the completion of: a new high security ammunition depot; modernised accommodation in Pearse and Plunkett Barracks; and a recently completed new electronic target range.  These improvements in the training centre were all recently completed at a combined cost of more than &euro;17.5 million.  Notwithstanding the impact of Covid and Brexit on building projects throughout the country, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that progress on implementing the five-year plan continues apace and I anticipate the commencement on-site of the following projects in the Curragh Camp in 2022: a new cadet school, contract to be awarded shortly; a new barrack services engineering store; a new purpose-built communication and information services facility; and provision of a new Army ranger wing headquarters.  These projects represent a further investment of in excess of &euro;16.5 million in the Curragh Camp alone for next year.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, work in 2022 will also focus on developing a new military college auditorium, a new bonded warehouse building, and an upgrade of the new medical school.  I am aware of the criticisms that have been made on the quality of the building stock in the training centre.  However, based on what I have just outlined, I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge that this represents a significant investment, even though there is much more to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800016#O00800","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1637233800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply as he needs to set out exactly what he is intending to do.

Deputies will be aware that there have been three reports from the independent monitoring group, IMG, since the publication in 2002 of the report of the external advisory committee on the Defence Forces, The Challenge of the Workplace.<\/p>  <p>  Following extensive discussions over several months between the Secretary General and the former Chief of Staff on next steps for the IMG process and what that would encompass, it was considered that a back-to-basics external review of policies, systems and procedures for dealing with matters relating to dignity, equality, discrimination, bullying, harassment and sexual harassment was required.  On that basis the IMG process is to be set aside. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will also be aware, I met recently with participants from the Women of Honour group and with a number of serving female members of the Defence Forces where I had the opportunity to listen carefully to their experiences in what were very informative, frank and emotional meetings.  In addition, there has been a number engagements between senior civil and military management and relevant stakeholders including with both the participants from the Women of Honour group and a group of serving female members of the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of those meetings, I have decided to proceed with an independent review without delay to examine the effectiveness of systems, policies and procedures to deal with workplace issues relating to bullying, discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct in the Defence Forces.  The draft terms for this review have been shared with a range of stakeholders including the representative associations, serving members and the Women of Honour group.  I look forward to receiving their observations which will inform the final terms of the review, which I intend to finalise in the coming weeks.  I wish to underline that this review will be undertaken by external and entirely independent and unbiased experts in this field.  In this regard, potential members are also under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies will also be aware that I have recently announced interim measures for both former and serving members of the Defence Forces, both male and female, who have been affected by unacceptable behaviour in the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  An agreement has been reached with Raiseaconcern, an organisation working with private sector and public bodies on issues relating to workplace wrongdoing, on the appointment of an external confidential contact person who will be available to assist both serving and former members of the Defence Forces who have been affected by these issues.  This service provides a safe space to support the reporting of alleged wrongdoing. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have announced that my Department and the Defence Forces are engaging with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre in terms of assistance for both serving and former personnel who have suffered sexual harassment, sexual assault or rape in the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to reiterate my commitment and that of the Secretary General and Chief of Staff, to ensure that every member of the Defence Forces, male and female, can carry out their duties in a safe and respectful workplace based on dignity, equality and zero-tolerance for any kind of unacceptable behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800018#Q02000","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1637235000,"counter":250,"content":"<p>There are supplementary questions from Deputies Colm Burke, Catherine Connolly and Gino Kenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800018#Q02100","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1637235000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>The Minister spoke of the review he announced on 28 September.

I am sure there will be an opportunity to focus on those recommendations when that report is done.<\/p>  <p>  The independent monitoring group, IMG, process has a value.  When I was last Minister for Defence, we worked a lot on the IMG process to improve systems in the Defence Forces around reporting.  There have been a whole series of changes within the Defence Forces linked to the IMG and the series of reports and reviews done through it.  Unfortunately, the testimonies we have heard from people show the IMG process has not made the fundamental change in culture in the Defence Forces that is needed.

The reason \"independent and unbiased\" is a term used to describe the new review body is we want this to be an external review as opposed to an internal one within the military system or within the Defence Forces, which is what often takes place if there is a problem.  The Chief of Staff sets up an internal review within the Defence Forces.  That is the way the Defence Forces works with respect to many of the issues it must assess and review.  This is different.  We want an external group of people to put in place a very robust and in-depth assessment of the Defence Forces and the systems within it to ensure people are protected in their workplace.  That is, I believe, what the Women of Honour and many currently working in the Defence Forces want as well.  We have tried to listen to them and put in place a review they can trust and believe in.<\/p>  <p>  We will finalise the terms of reference once we have had feedback from all the relevant stakeholders.  That will happen in the next few weeks.  We certainly hope to have this done this side of Christmas so the review body can be up and running from January.

I commend the Minister on the work he has done on that.  I do not need an answer to the point I will make and that I ask the Minister to reflect on, which is that that process does not necessarily mean we should shelve the work of the fourth independent monitoring group.  The Minister said the previous independent monitoring groups did very good work.  The second did good work and the third, which reported in 2014, concluded that \"the challenge remain[ed], to continue to improve human resource management and institutional culture including dealing with human issues of bullying, harassment, sexual harassment and discrimination\".  I ask the Minister to consider that this makes a very strong case for the continuation and conclusion of a fourth independent monitoring group to continue the good work it has done in the past, rather than setting it aside on the basis of his highly commendable proposal to establish an independent review group into the allegations made in the radio programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800020#S00200","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1637236200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>The last time we spoke about \"Women of Honour\" in the Chamber, I asked the Minister if he had sought legal advice regarding those who had already made settlement agreements with the Defence Forces and signed non-disclosure agreements, or where non-disclosure agreements were part of the settlement made.

I again ask if he has got legal advice regarding those non-disclosure agreements that were part of settlements made with the Defence Forces where the person who made a settlement seeks to be involved in any review process?  I do not believe this review or any subsequent actions should be closed to any person who wants to be involved in it because of a non-disclosure agreement.

While the Government remains committed to returning to and maintaining the agreed strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, a number of factors, some of which are hard to predict, will impact on the timeframe in which this can be achieved.<\/p><p>I have acknowledged the ongoing staffing challenges in the Defence Forces, and a range of actions are designed to tackle this.  Continuing recruitment has resulted in a total of 577 personnel being inducted as of 15 November.  The scope of direct entry competitions was expanded in 2021 from ten competitions, to include a new Air Corps aircraft technician competition.  Additionally, direct entry terms and conditions continue to be revised to improve intakes.  The re-entry campaign for former members of the PDF continues.<\/p><p>On retention, there has been significant progress on pay arising out of increases due from recent pay agreements, the most recent of which was a 1% increase on annualised salaries, or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on 1 October, with further increases to follow.  There are now service commitment schemes in both the Air Corps and the Naval Service and a special naval service tax credit for seagoing personnel.  Furthermore, in light of the particular challenges faced by the defence sector, the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission, PSPC, to undertake a comprehensive review and analysis of the underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces.  I am confident the pay benefits delivered by the public service pay agreements, in tandem with the implementation of the PSPC's recommendations, will improve recruitment and retention challenges currently being experienced by the PDF.<\/p><p>Additionally, the Commission on the Defence Forces is due to submit its report by the end of the year and I look forward to receiving it in due course.  The recommendations will then be fully considered and will inform future decisions regarding the Defence Forces.  My focus remains on retaining and restoring the Permanent Defence Force to its full capacity, but it will take time for some of these measures to take full effect. <table>    <tr>       <th

Le linn an tsamhraidh, bh&iacute;omar ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an d&oacute;igh a chuir Fine Gael an t-iarAire Katherine Zappone isteach ar bhord an St&aacute;it fosta.  Anois, le c&uacute;pla seachtain anuas t&aacute;imid ag caint ar an d&oacute;igh a l&aacute;imhse&aacute;il an tAire, an Teachta Eamon Ryan, ceapach&aacute;n beirte do bhord an St&aacute;it.<\/p>  <p>  Today, the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach; and the Committee of Public Accounts will publish their report into the appointment of Robert Watt as Secretary General at the Department of Health.  It is an appointment that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was involved in.  There was not any proper process.  During the summer, there was the Zapponegate scenario, where Fine Gael was appointing a former Minister into a made-up job paid for the public purse.  A number of weeks ago, the Minister appointed two friends to the Climate Change Advisory Council despite a recommendation from the Joint Committee on Climate Action that there should be an open, competitive and transparent process attached to such appointments.  Cronyism is at the heart of how this Government does its business.  That is without doubt.  We have seen it clearly since the summer.<\/p>  <p>  I know that most people would have expected higher standards from the Green Party but that is not what is coming from it.  Once the Minister had the opportunity to dole out jobs for his friends, he was shown to be just as capable as Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are at doling out those jobs.  I know that the two members appointed are eminently qualified.  Their qualifications are not in question.  That is not the issue.  One of these individuals was a former special adviser to the Minister.  The other was a Green Party election candidate.  These positions are paid from the public purse, at &euro;10,000 per year, with travel and subsistence claims on top of that.  They are paid for by the taxpayer.  The taxpayer deserves no less than a transparent, open and accountable process but the Minister let the taxpayers down.<\/p>  <p>  Nothing precludes the Government from making sure that all appointments are transparent and open but it has not happened in this instance.  We have sought clarity on this for two weeks.  We have asked about the appointment process but nothing has been forthcoming.  Why did the Minister pull this stroke?  Why did he decide to ignore the Joint Committee on Climate Action?  Why did he breach his own guidelines on the appointment process?  Why did he believe it was right to appoint a former special adviser and election candidate to this position without any due process?<\/p>  <p>  There is a wider issue with regard to this.  The Climate Change Advisory Council has an important role to play.  It guides the response to the climate crisis.  It is vital that it is independent of the Government and that the advice the Government receives is not predetermined or reflective of ideological persuasions.  That is crucial for this council.  Independent advice is of no use if the Government is simply getting the advice that it wants to hear on critical issues such as carbon tax, which are hitting ordinary families hard while the Government fails to provide alternatives.<\/p>  <p>  Why did the Minister ignore the Government's own guidelines in appointing these two individuals to this State board?  Does he accept that this was just an old-fashioned political stroke?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800021#T00100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637236800,"counter":285,"content":"<p>This council was appointed exactly as is set out in the law.  It was appointed in the same way that the previous Climate Change Advisory Council was established.  It was appointed after going through all the proper Government procedures, going to the Cabinet, giving advance notice and discussing it with colleagues both within the Department and within the Government.  To my mind, this council has that correct mix of skills which not everyone has.  They are very specific skills.  As the Deputy mentions, these individuals have been recognised by being appointed by previous governments to similar bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency.  One of the individuals has unique experience in world energy policy and a variety of institutions that brings real expertise to the council.  I do not believe this expertise would have been available elsewhere.  I know a number of people on that council.  If I was to exclude people who I know and have worked with in the past 30 years, it would diminish the skills that we need.  We need a balance of different skills.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, the Department and the Minister are best placed, as set out in the legislation, to be able to make that call.  If I excluded people on the basis of having worked with me or knowing me in the past, that would not serve the Irish people well.  As the Deputy said, the individuals that he mentioned absolutely have the necessary skills.  I stand over the process.  I believe it was correct and it was followed to the letter of the law.  It is a law that was passed by a vast majority in this House, including Deputy Doherty's party, knowing the appointments procedures which we would and did follow.  The critical thing now is what this council does and how we work collectively.  If Sinn F&eacute;in wants to turn climate into a divisive issue, while accusing others of cronyism and so on, I do not think that serves the people in making this leap and incredible change.<\/p>  <p>  The advisory council is well constituted and has done a good job to date.  It will serve not just this Government but the next one.  I do not believe that it will in any way reflect any partisan or other interests because someone might have worked with me in the past, or because there are 15 people on it from a range of diverse backgrounds.  Some of them served on the previous council and I believed it was important to carry over that expertise.  Some of them have expertise in just transition and social policy, which I believe it is important to include.  Other people, who I have worked with, know the science and were needed.  My Department, I as the Minister, and the Government acting collectively, acted correctly and appropriately in how we approached getting that balance and mix of the right people.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to questions about climate, how the budgets are set, and how we will fund this climate transition.  If we do not have a carbon tax, where will we get the &euro;5 billion?  I would love to have questions on the substance because that is what people want.  They want to know how we will make this leap.  I do not think they want it to be turned into a politically divisive issue when the legislation was agreed and the process was followed.  Let us sit down and talk about climate and have a real discussion about how we meet this challenge.  That is what I would love to have questions about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800021#T00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1637236800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>The public wants open and transparent government.

The Minister might want to talk about something different but he pulled a political stroke.  He talked about the legislation.  We tabled an amendment to that legislation, stating that the appointments would be through an open, transparent process.  It was rejected by the Minister because, he said, he has to abide by the guidelines of the Government, which is the public appointments process.  Section 8 of those guidelines applies to all boards, commercial and non-commercial.  Will the Minister tell me and the public why he decided to ignore those guidelines and to appoint his special adviser and a Green Party candidate to a position on a State board without a transparent, open and fair process?

School communities and principals are contacting every Deputy in this House about that level of confusion.  They are saying daily that the system is at the brink of collapse.  I spoke to a principal in the mid-west today who told me that he had a close contact issue with a member of staff, he contacted the helpline, as he is required to do, and he was told that the advice issued on Tuesday, even though it is on the website, is not yet active.

The Deputy is correct in saying that our schools are under pressure, particularly in terms of availability of staff.  I have been briefed by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, a former primary school teacher, that there is a real stress in terms of availability in that regard.  The Department of Education recognises that and in response it has increased the substitute panel, which I know is under pressure, to 480 places.  The Department has written to 111,000 teachers via the Teaching Council to see if there are teachers who are out of work for a variety of reasons, including retirement, who might be willing and able to return.  It has also written to the higher level education colleges to see if those studying primary school teaching, without getting in the way of their important studies, could help to close that gap.  Last but not least, it is waiving the rules and restrictions around job-sharing and career breaks in order to get those people back into the system.  All of this is being done because there is real pressure on the schools and we recognise that.  That will, and has to be, managed.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, I agree with the Deputy with regard to the need for antigen testing within schools.  There will be an announcement this week.  It has been complex and difficult.  We all know that we have had to follow public health advice on this throughout this crisis.  There are concerns that people may use antigen tests in the wrong way in that they may be taking them when symptomatic.  We need to be identifying those who are not symptomatic, but test positive.  We need to get that right such that it does not get in the way of public health guidance.  There will be an announcement this week, followed by delivery of that system to our schools.<\/p>  <p>  On the booster vaccines, this goes back to a certain extent to earlier discussions at the first roll-out of the vaccines.  My view is that the approach NIAC has advised in terms of the ordering of delivery of boosters has been the correct one.  NIAC has shown really clear evidence that boosters do work, that vaccines work.  Those in our hospitals, in particular those in the ICU, are typically people who are either unvaccinated or they have an underlying condition.  The vaccines are keeping people out of hospital and out of ICU.  The boosters will do that even more.  We should follow the advice of NIAC on the ordering of boosters in terms of best protection of public health.  I do not think we should make any variation or deviation from that advice.  If NIAC revises it, so be it, but I do not expect it will do so.  The approach that NIAC has taken, and we have taken, to follow public health advice has been the right one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800022#U01700","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1637237400,"counter":304,"content":"<p>We appreciate the Minister's engagement, but he will appreciate that if the school system collapses and schools have to close, which we absolutely do not want to happen, society will not be able to function.

The provision of this vital link not only makes sense but is crucial to providing safe road infrastructure.  Equally important at this time is the provision of a bypass for Tipperary town.  The Minister has acknowledged this need and is on record as being in favour of an early resolution to the menace of traffic in the town.  As he knows, it is in an area of high traffic, with massive congestion.  The current level of traffic through the narrow Main Street in the town is measured at approximately 85,000 vehicles a week, including heavy goods vehicles.  This level of traffic through the centre of any town would prove detrimental to quality of life and business activity.<\/p>  <p>  In March this year, the Minister agreed with my statement in the House that Tipperary should be liberated from the scourge of traffic congestion.  Having listened to the details of the misery and nuisance being suffered by businesses and residents, he acknowledged that constructing a bypass of the town, ahead of any planned major works on the N24, would provide a solution.  Having listened to the points I raised and due to his familiarity with the town, the Minister stated that the provision of a 6 km to 7 km stretch of roadway would form a bypass of Tipperary town and its construction should be a priority.  He concurred with my assessment that traffic in the town exceeds efficient operational capacity and it needs rescuing from unacceptable levels of traffic and pollution.  He referred to the national policy and strategy he is pursuing as Minister and, in that context, stated that a Tipperary town bypass is an example of a project that should be prioritised under the town centres first strategy.  He agreed that a bypass for the town could be incorporated as a priority in an upgrade of the Cahir to Limerick Junction road.<\/p>  <p>  Since the revised NDP was announced, we have had contradictory statements leading to uncertainty as to when road projects will be sanctioned and delivered.  Where does the Minister stand on this issue now?  Will funding be provided for the project and a bypass of Tipperary town built?  What is the timeline for its provision?  Will he publicly reiterate that the people of the town can look forward to clean air and freedom from fumes?  The time for talking about freeing up their town from chaotic congestion and poisonous pollution is over.  The time for sympathising with the people who are subjected to these conditions has come and gone.  The time for rhetoric has passed.  It is now time to tackle the problem and we are looking to the Minister for decisive action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800023#V00200","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1637238000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I am aware that the Deputy attended the meeting of the transport committee yesterday at which we looked at some of these issues, but he was not able to ask these particular questions.  I am glad he can avail of the chance to do so today.  As he heard yesterday, we have some &euro;5.1 billion allocated to national roads under the NDP between now and 2030.  The reality is that a large proportion of that, amounting to some &euro;4 billion, will be spent in the latter half of the decade.  A large number of public transport projects are coming through, including the Connecting Ireland rural public bus service, BusConnects and rail projects across the country, which require a large upfront capital investment in the next four to five years.  This means there will be a tight constraint on the roads budget in the immediate coming years.  Within those circumstances, we have to prioritise and give a clear signal on what should come first.  I am saying to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which has responsibility for this, that priority should back up the national planning framework, which is about balanced regional development, compact development and low-carbon development, and should particularly complement the Government's town centres first strategy, which is about bringing life back into the beautiful 19th century market towns all over the country.<\/p>  <p>  Tipperary town is a perfect example.  It is a beautiful town with great people but it is suffering from really heavy volumes of traffic, particularly freight traffic, going right through its centre on Main Street.  If I recall correctly from a survey carried out in the town, some 30% of retail businesses are not working because the town is dominated by that through traffic.  I am glad to put on the record of the D&aacute;il what I have often said to TII and will say again, namely, that in looking at the upgrade of the Cahir to Limerick Junction roadway, which is what is has been commissioned to do, it should, first and foremost, look at, and proceed with, the option of a bypass of Tipperary town, which could, as the road is later developed, be part of a wider upgrade.  First things first, we must rescue Tipperary town from the excess domination of through traffic, particularly heavy freight.<\/p>  <p>  It is a perfect example of what we can do, with a fairly small budget allocation, to advance the town centres first policy.  It is perfect in terms of balanced regional development and it helps compact development and low-carbon development, which are the centre points of our transport strategy.  Tipperary Town Council will have an opportunity to transform the centre of the town by taking as much through traffic out as possible and really improving the public realm.  We have seen what happens in towns where that is done.  There are examples across the country but I always pick Clonakilty because, in our family, it was a case of, \"Clonakilty, God help us\", and now it is an incredibly thriving town.  That came about partly because the through traffic was taken out of the town, pedestrianisation was introduced and a really high-quality public realm was created.  We can do the same in Tipperary town and that is what I will be saying to TII.  We must make sure we get the design of the bypass right and get it built first.  That is the priority for roads investment, as an example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800023#V00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1637238000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>This will be music to Deputy Lowry's ears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800023#V00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1637238000,"counter":310,"content":"<p>It is not usual for me to get good news, a Cheann Comhairle, so I certainly welcome the Minister's commitment to the project.

The commitment he has given today makes it a good day for Tipperary.

At my request, a task force was established with cross-agency reach to address a multitude of problems in Tipperary town.  The group has received a huge level of engagement and co-operation from the community.  To date, it has completed a substantial body of work and published a detailed plan.  For it to retain the trust and confidence of the public, it is necessary for the Government to deliver a fully funded and tangible action plan.

It could also build on what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has done in implementing an historic change in terms of identifying vacant sites and lands that are not being developed and including them in the zoned land tax proposal he has brought forward.  That should, more than anything, give a clear signal as to how we can bring life back into our towns and put buildings and accommodation back into town centres.  The great advantage of this is that it uses existing resources.  People can walk or cycle to the school, church or pub.  It avoids having to constantly build out and spend a huge amount of resources on an ever more dispersed population model.

He has ensured people in the horticultural sector now have to import 4,000 tonnes of peat from Latvia.  Some 200 lorries bring it to and from the port every time.  The Minister should think of the carbon footprint, because he thought it was a good idea to run out of here one day and shut down Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  What does the Minister have to say about the importation of peat briquettes from Germany?  What is the carbon footprint there, instead of having our own production of peat briquettes here in Ireland, because he shut it down?  He has done nothing for those people.

He has done absolutely nothing.<\/p>  <p>  What has the Minister done, only offer grants to people that they cannot get?

He is 72 years of age, he wants a grant to insulate my house and he has been told he has to wait at least two years.  What does the Minister have to say to that man?  He need not start telling me about the millions of euro he is pumping into insulation when, at the stroke of pen, the Government could have changed the VAT rate which would have been meaningful, real and attainable there and then.  The Minister is forcing the people in Ireland to endure the highest electricity and heating bills in the EU.  He is failing to safeguard the interest of the Irish consumer.<\/p>  <p>  The price of petrol and diesel has gone up 30% or 40% since March.  I recently met with the Irish Road Haulage Association.

The things we use every day are delivered by road.  What has the Minister done for those people?  He has done nothing.  Again, he is failing to safeguard the interest of the Irish consumers.  Myself and my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group were seeking a cut on the VAT rate for diesel and petrol, gas, home heating oil and electricity; a reversal of the increase to the carbon tax; a once-off energy voucher for low-income families; and a 50% cut on excise duty on motor fuel.

If the Deputy asked the good people in the tourism industry in Kerry, whom I know well and with whom I worked for years, whether they think Kerry would benefit or not from going green, I bet they would say \"Yes\".  The Deputy could go down to Valentia Island to listen to some of the visionary thinking going on in places such as that on how we could tap into hydrogen power, the same way it was the first place of contact for cables between Ireland and America 150 years ago.

It will not work as a fight or if we play this as a divisive political game.  That 72-year-old is rightly concerned about how he can get his house insulated.

People's health benefits, which is the main thing, and not just the climate, as well as their pocket because they will not have to pay the big, extortionate bills, which are all due to the reliance on international fossil fuels.

In the interests of full disclosure, I should say that I own a scooter.  I love my e-scooter, which is really handy for somebody like me in Dublin 1 or Dublin 7, as my constituency of Dublin Central is very populous but fairly compact.  For people who live somewhere like I do, a scooter is a game-changer.  They can get around the city quickly and easily.  Something we do not talk about enough is the affordability of scooters as a means of transport.  For so many people around me - for students, for carers - it is something that is within their means and they can go much further distances without relying on bus schedules or the Luas.  They can really take transport into their own hands, which is hugely important, in particular for people on low incomes.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, I am incredibly supportive of legislating for e-scooters, which is very important.  I am also the parent of a child who uses a white cane and who is registered as blind, and who is also hard of hearing and has dyspraxia, which means the street is always difficult for her.  It also means we are constantly in contact with the National Council for the Blind, NCBI, which does incredible work and which we certainly rely on for services.<\/p> <p>During the course of this Bill I have been in contact with the NCBI, which has talked me through some of its recommendations on this Bill, in conjunction with the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.<\/p> <p> Before I go through some of the recommendations they made to me, I want to talk about some of the principles of what makes a good street for someone like my nine-year-old child, who finds it difficult, who cannot always see pavements or obstructions and who cannot hear cars coming.  The first principle is the hierarchy of the street.  To some degree this is referred to in our design manual on urban streets and roads and is as follows: the most important user of a street is a vulnerable pedestrian.  That is not just a pedestrian but a vulnerable pedestrian; somebody who might have mobility issues; who might be older and who might find it difficult to walk long distances; who might find it difficult to cross a road in the time the pedestrian crossings give him or her; or who might not see a kerb.  The second most important user of a street is the average pedestrian, the third is cyclists and self-propelled vehicles, the fourth is public transport, the fifth is private rented transport, the sixth is local business deliveries, the seventh is local motor traffic, the eighth is non-local motor traffic, and so on.  The hierarchy of the street sets out who the street must service first and it is true that if a space is designed for the most vulnerable among us it will be a usable space for everybody.<\/p> <p> All footpaths, streets, squares and developments and all decisions around transport should be designed with universality of access in mind.  On that point, one of the most important things the NCBI, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind raised with me is the need to keep footpaths safe.  I have been watching this debate closely and during it I have heard a lot about scooters whizzing past people and the idea that there might be collisions.  We have never had a collision between my child and a bike or between my child and a child on a scooter.  We have been pretty lucky.  That does not necessarily solve the issue because a bike or a scooter on a footpath does not have to hit you to rob you of your confidence.  If a cyclist or somebody on an e-scooter whizzes past you, you can feel the air change around you, you can hear the noise and you can feel something coming at you.  It robs you of your access to that public space, it makes you feel like you are not safe and it makes you more likely to stay at home.  We know that is what people with vision impairment do; they stay at home because they feel they are not safe.  We need to ensure this Bill has robust and clear language around the safeguarding of footpaths and keeping footpaths safe and clear of motorised vehicles and e-scooters.<\/p> <p> The second principle of what makes a good street for someone with vision impairment, which is one of the more important ones for me, is the alert for vehicle acoustic systems.  This is a conversation we would have had around electric cars and it is incredibly important.  People with vision impairment face this challenge across the world.  Electric vehicles of all sorts are relatively quiet and in some ways that is fantastic because people like me who live in inner-city Dublin are used to the hum of the city but do not want to hear the roar of traffic.  We want our communities to have a reasonable level of noise and not to have noise pollution.  The idea that we would have less noise is appropriate and good.  That is also a huge boon to anybody experiencing a sensory processing disorder or autism.  However, we also need to be able to hear cars, vehicles and e-scooters coming.  It is advisable that there be some provision in the Bill for vehicular acoustic systems; that is a good idea.<\/p> <p> The speed limit should be under advisement.  Other countries have a slightly different speed limit and they do not necessarily go with 20 km\/h; sometimes it is 15 km\/h.  I accept that we should be advised on that by the experts but an e-scooter whizzing past you at 15 km\/h and an e-scooter whizzing past you at 20 km\/h are two hugely different things.<\/p> <p> I will move to the third principle of what makes a good street for someone with vision impairment.  We do not always get transport right but we did get one important thing right in recent years and my colleague, Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe MEP, did a lot of work on this.  When Bleeper bikes were introduced in Dublin, it was required that they would have somewhere to park.  An issue that has come up with e-scooters globally over and over again is that where there are private providers of shared e-scooters, they get dumped on footpaths and left everywhere.  I am hugely supportive of this and the shared schemes for these bikes are even better because people do not even have to spend &euro;200 or &euro;300 on a scooter; they can simply sign up to the scheme and that is fantastic.  As has been done with the Bleeper bikes, we need to ensure that when those private providers move into an urban, suburban or rural area, suitable parking is provided so that they are not strewn across footpaths in an obstructive way.  This is a city where we already have parking obstructions from people parking their cars on footpaths, bins strewn across footpaths and, in particular at this time of year, leaves.  We should not add to that problem by allowing people to park their scooters anywhere and everywhere.<\/p> <p> I will move to the fourth principle of what makes a good street for someone with vision impairment.  I want to call out the issue of shared space.  I am not sure how viable or possible it is to consider geofencing and reducing the access of e-scooters to shared spaces.  It is still included in the design manual for urban roads, DMURS, document but shared space is incredibly difficult for people with vision impairment.  It is almost impossible.  People with vision impairment need kerbs and protected space.  It is the exact same principle as cycling on a road; you need to be protected as you cannot necessarily see what is coming up against you.  Shared space simply does not work and we should be looking to remove it from all our local authority design guidelines, DMURS and any other design guidelines that are in place or legislatively accounted for.  There should be no more shared space and we should not see it coming into design models.  I have seen bodies like the National Transport Authority, NTA, suggesting shared space around transport nodes in the last year and a half.  That is worrying and it should not be something we continue to design for.<\/p> <p> I am hugely supportive of e-scooters and I am an owner and user of one.  They are a game changer but we all have to share our public space and realm.  Some of us are motorists, some of us are cyclists, some of us use skateboards and some of us will use e-scooters.  Every single person in Ireland is a pedestrian at some stage.  We need to work to represent an inclusive and ambitious way to deliver a public realm that is accessible and walkable and supportive of every single vulnerable pedestrian out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800029#EE00400","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637241900,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important Bill.  There are a lot of great provisions within the Bill that will have positive implications for road users.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus on scramblers first because this is an issue that affects many of my constituents.  I note that the Bill commits to introducing measures to address the antisocial use of scramblers and that is a positive development.  The use of scramblers, and their links to antisocial behaviour and sometimes to organised crime, presents a threat to law and order in urban communities.  In my area of Dublin Mid-West, the use of scramblers is of particular concern.  An awful lot of anxiety is associated with the revs and roars of these vehicles being used in areas where they simply should not be used.  It translates into intimidation and fear in communities where scramblers and quad bikes are used irresponsibly.  They are sometimes used as part of antisocial behaviour campaigns, to fuel illegal behaviour or sometimes to help in organised crime.  This is simply unacceptable.  I am pleased, therefore, that the Minister has drafted this legislation which will allow for the seizure of these vehicles when they are used in public places.  My colleague in Clondalkin, Councillor Kenneth Egan, has done considerable work to shape policies on this and I thank him for his work.<\/p>  <p>  The public do not want to live in places that feel unsafe.  They want communities, parks, streets and canal paths that are safe.  Communities have had enough of the revs, roars, intimidation and antisocial behaviour associated with scrambler misuse.  The legislation the Government is finalising will change that.  It will make a real difference to our communities across Dublin and in urban areas throughout the country.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the commitment to tackling this problem where it counts - on our streets, in our parks and along our canals.<\/p> <p> I also welcome the provisions in this Bill that will regulate the use of powered personal transporters, such as e-scooters.  Whether we welcome them or not, e-scooters are already on our roads.  That is a fact.  They are being used by people every day but up until now, the lack of legislation has put those road users and those scooters in a dubious legal space.  Their personal use has led to a plethora of unsafe habits from some, but not all, users.  It is right that we regulate the use of e-scooters.  However, I share concerns around safety and accessibility.<\/p> <p> A recent study commissioned by Transport for London indicated that riding an e-scooter could be 100 times more dangerous than riding a bicycle.  The study also found that a person who uses an e-scooter regularly will on average require medical treatment for injury sustained by use of an e-scooter every three years of use.  Anecdotally, an accident and emergency nurse I know told me that over the past couple of years e-scooter injuries are becoming so common that she sees at least one e-scooter related injury every shift.  They range from cuts and sprains to more traumatic injuries, such as head injuries, and the risks are real.  It is vitally important that the rules around e-scooters are strongly enforced and that the public knows the responsibilities are there should they choose to use an e-scooter, which, as many colleagues have pointed out, are a quick and eco-friendly way of getting around congested places such as our city centre.<\/p> <p> The rules and the responsibilities need to be looked at too.  They should not be used to transport more than one person or to carry goods.  Mobile phones should certainly not be used while driving an e-scooter and they should not be allowed on pathways or pedestrian areas.  Those laws must be enforced by the Garda.<\/p> <p> In terms of accessibility, I support the proposal for the introduction of a scheme similar to the Dublinbikes scheme.  This would be the best possible way of making e-scooters accessible in public and a similar approach to that taken by other European countries.  It is also the best way we can encourage their use, ensure scooters meet all the safety standards and make them a viable alternative to cars.  When used safely, e-scooters and e-bikes offer an excellent alternative to car travel.  Reducing the number of cars on our roads and our emissions is a focus and a commitment of this Government going forward.<\/p> <p> However, more needs to be done to encourage their safe use among the public.  For example, I would support allowing e-scooters to be brought on board public transport where space allows.  It would make it easier for members of the public to incorporate e-scooters into a hybrid commute where they may choose to use a scooter for part of a journey and opt for public transport for the rest.  If you are living further outside Dublin you might hop on a bus to get to halfway in and as traffic congestion starts to build up, hop off the bus and onto your e-scooter.  That needs to be a real option and an alternative for people.  They are small enough vehicles.  Many of them can be folded and picked up easily.  They should be allowed on public transport where possible but, of course, their transportation should not in any way affect the availability of space for wheelchairs, which must be prioritised at all times.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister for bringing forward this important legislation.  It is a flagship for the Department and I welcome it.  This Bill has the power to revolutionise how we get around Irish towns and cities while also reducing emissions and tackling congestion.  I very much look forward to Ireland having one of the safest and most accessible e-scooter regimes in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800030#FF00200","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637242500,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I welcome the provisions in this Bill for e-scooters and other personal powered transporters.  However, I feel we are in danger of overhyping both the benefits and the dangers of e-scooters.  No doubt e-scooters will be useful for some people, especially people who do not enjoy secure cycle parking, but we need to avoid what I might call techno-utopianism, but also techno-fatalism.  I do not personally think that e-scooters will be a game changer for our villages, towns and cities.  They will be of some utility but I do not see evidence that dissuades me that cycling, including e-bikes, will be the machines that revolutionise transport.<\/p>  <p>  The bicycle is the paragon of efficiency.  Humans are moderately efficient from an energy perspective when walking, but when cycling, they are more efficient than any other animal on earth.  Electric bikes are wonderful because they augment human efficiency to make journeys of 10 km to 30 km possible, even for those of us who are not physically fit.<\/p>  <p>  E-scooters may not be revolutionary, but neither are they a lethal scourge that must be regulated like a deadly weapon, as I have heard some Deputies suggest.  The provisions in this Bill for personal powered transporters are sensible - a weight limit of 55 kg and a maximum speed of 25 km\/h.  These numbers are important because of the physics.  The kinetic energy is proportional to the mass and the square of the speed.<\/p>  <p>  We effectively have three categories on our roads: those on foot and in wheelchairs and buggies; those on bikes and scooters; and vehicles.  Where possible, we should separate all three but where there is mixing, we need to regulate speed to make sure the most vulnerable are protected.<\/p>  <p>  E-scooters fit neatly into the category already occupied by bikes.  What is proposed is sensible and proportionate.  What we need to do is reallocate road space for bikes for the intermediate modes of cycling and scooting and get cars out of our villages, towns and cities.<\/p>  <p>  I will make a small point about the power rating for electric bikes.  There has been some confusion between peak and continuous power ratings, especially for cargo bikes.  To clarify, many e-bikes and e-cargo bikes are advertised with their peak power rating, which can be 600 W, 700 W or 800 W.  That number is simply the maximum instantaneous power that the battery, electrical system and motor can output on its power curve.  I want to highlight that the legislation refers to continuous power, not peak power.  The continuous power is the maximum power that can be outputted consistently and safely without overheating.  The majority of e-bikes sold in the EU are within this limit of 250 W continuous power even if they are advertised with a peak power that is higher than this.  The confusion is unfortunate but I particularly want to reassure people who have already bought e-bikes that conform to EU regulations that this legislation merely restates those power regulations.<\/p>  <p>  Scramblers are an issue in many estates in Limerick.  They have been the cause of considerable stress for residents.  It is not only the fact that they make the roads in estates incredibly dangerous; it is also the screaming noise that reverberates around, preventing people from sleeping and generally enjoying their homes and their neighbourhoods.  It has been frustrating for residents to feel that garda&iacute; were powerless to stop and seize vehicles.  The increased powers that will be available to garda&iacute; will allow them to stop and seize scramblers and quad bikes even if they are not in a public place.  I very much welcome these provisions.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the provision to bring fines and penalties issued by traffic wardens in line with those issued by garda&iacute;.  We have significant challenges in the enforcement of road traffic legislation in this country.  I pay tribute to traffic wardens.  Their job is a thankless and difficult one, but it is a vital job to keep our roads and streets safe for all.<\/p>  <p>  While I am addressing the issue of road traffic law enforcement, I want to address one issue that I believe to be a scourge on our streets, that is, the issue of footpath parking.  I accept that people may not fully appreciate the consequences of parking on the footpath but it is one of the most antisocial things a person can do on the street to restrict the movement of buggies and people in wheelchairs - people who are most deserving of free movement - is despicable.  Following representations from me and Deputy Matthews, the Road Safety Authority carried out a campaign this year to remind people not to park on footpaths.  I hope it had some effect.  I hope that traffic wardens working for the local authorities can help to address this issue and I hope that provisions in this Bill can help the efficiency of the administration of these penalties.<\/p>  <p>  We face a significant cultural challenge in driving and parking and the enforcement of road traffic law.  I believe we need to examine seriously how we can encourage and compel local authorities and the Garda to enforce safe streets for all.  Public information campaigns, as I mentioned, are important, but we ultimately need to make sure the law is enforced.  In many local authority areas, it is acceptable to park on footpaths, drive in cycle lanes and block bus stops.  This behaviour affects the most vulnerable and we as a State need to ensure that local authorities and the Garda direct sufficient resources to this issue.  I would welcome debate and discussion about how we can do this, through amendment of this Bill or other means.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I want to address one element of this Bill that is not yet incorporated but that the Minister has indicated will be facilitated by means of an amendment.  <\/p> <p>I believe experimental traffic orders would be a useful initiative to tackle a real problem, that is, the delays in implementing road traffic infrastructure.  We have got to a stage where making it safe for children to cycle to school or for people to cycle to work gets tied up in court appeals before a single bollard is screwed into the road.  I have seen debates around the country get extremely heated and there has been irresponsible scaremongering about making our roads and streets safer for vulnerable road users.  We have to reallocate our road space to make walking and cycling safe for all without endless, interminable culture wars that seek to lock in an inexorable rise in car dominance and that prevent even trial measures from being implemented.<\/p> <p> We have not seen the detail of what the Minister will propose but it is useful to reflect on the system in the UK where experimental traffic orders avoid the pitched battles of a public consultation and endless debate about what road space reallocation might look like, and seek to make the trial and the consultation the same thing.  Briefly, a reallocation of road space such as the introduction of segregated cycle lanes or other traffic control measures such as one-way restrictions are introduced and then the consultation starts about how well the measure is working.  Members of the public and interested parties can object within six months of the introduction of the trial.  The trial must be either retained or removed within 18 months.  To me, this is a much better way of seeing the effect of measures to make streets more sustainable because it allows people to see how the streets work.  We simply must move beyond divisive battles about how we use our streets.  This type of trialling has been shown to be effective in the UK and I look forward to the Minister's proposals on this for this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800031#GG00200","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637243100,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I will have to say a word in defence of the older generation.  I do not see myself on a scooter, bike or trike or anything like that in the near future, unless I have been overexposed to the sun or something, but I must announce myself as a motorbiker.  It is an enjoyable mode of transport.  I still have the bike and still indulge in using it.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague just spoke of sharing space on roads.  There are more people competing for that space than ever before, with more vehicles and more types of vehicle.  It is important that we recognise that each and every one of us has a role to play in maintaining the highest safety standards.  I have noticed a considerable difference between the manner traffic moved before Covid and how it moves now.  I detect a lot of impatience.  I can understand why people have become impatient, but, as a result, safety standards have dropped.  It is in not unusual to find yourself in a queue of traffic, bumper to bumper, and have someone jam in between you and the car in front, and then the next thing the car behind you is in the back window.  That has happened on countless occasions on the motorways and on roads and general.  There is no need for it.  We should all recognise each other's right to share the space and get to and from work or whatever the case may be, causing the minimum impact.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister has a difficult job to do.  We are trying to reduce emissions, which we have committed to, and rightly so.  I hear the young generation saying that we can all cycle to work but we cannot.  Some of us could have cycled to work once upon a time but I have no intention of going back to it any time soon if I can avoid it.  For those who can and have a short distance to go, by all means, let us provide the space and the safety standards that will allow that so people can improve their health and have an efficient and emission-free mode of travel to and from work.<\/p>  <p>  I know that he is doing so, but I ask that the Minister to pay special attention to the safety standards, especially on dark mornings and evenings of which we know a lot about now.  All users of the roads must pay particular attention to each other.  Failure to do so can only result in tragedy.  The tragic thing is that we have all seen situations where a family has been bereaved where a child or young person went off in the morning, happy-go-lucky and carefree, and has not come home the same way.  It is important that we set aside some time to think about the need to do so.  I pay tribute to those on e-scooters and baby trikes and trolleys who pay attention and are careful in how they use their vehicles on the road.  Not all do so but quite a number do and it is good to see.  It will catch on and there will be more awareness.  As a result travel will improve and make the place better.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like everybody to have access to electric cars.  That has not been possible.  I am not suggesting that it could have been done, but we might have started earlier.  Like the Kerryman said when asked for directions to Cahirsiveen: \"If I was going there, I wouldn't be starting from here\".  There are two options for vehicles, electric or hydrogen.  I do not see any other way to do it unless we put cars off the road altogether and that is not going to happen.  People in the cities will say that is the objective and that is what they want to do but that is not going to happen.  There are some situations where putting cars off the road just cannot apply.  We have to realise that.  I know the Minister knows that because we have had this discussion in the past.  There are parts of the country where it is not possible to get public transport without enormous cost, and not even then.  We have to retain the rights and entitlements of people to go about their business in whatever way possible and do the best we can on emissions.<\/p>  <p>  If the investment is undertaken in time, we will achieve that but if we postpone everything until, say, we have more energy generation in the middle of the Atlantic, that means we will never do so.  I have been through that in elections with the anti-wind turbine people.  I know what is there.  However, we must push on and work towards improving the quality and standard of travel for all our people and improving emission levels in line with the international targets - and there is no reason we cannot do that - while, at the same time, ensuring their safety.  We must also ensure that we can close off the roads.  During Covid, I thought there was a move by Dublin City Council to narrow the roads to nothing.  I think it has done a good job on that so far.  Where I used to travel up along the quays at night and it might have taken 15 or 20 minutes, but it often takes an hour now.  I am not an expert on traffic movement, but I could do a better job on that.  All this is part and parcel of what we need to do.  <\/p>  <p>  Times are changing, as are modes of transport.  People are working from home.  Some say the extra people working from home means that we will not go to work any more.  That is not true.  The truth is we can wistfully think about those things but it will not happen.  The D&aacute;il would be a peculiar House if we all started working from home.  An Leas-Cheann Comhairle can imagine what it would be like calling the House to order in that kind of situation.<\/p> <p>Let us be realistic about it.  The way to deal with that is digital hubs at various locations throughout the country, which can be provided with fast broadband and whatever technology is required.  That is on the one hand.  At the same time we must provide for the social interaction that naturally takes place when people go to work.  Life becomes very boring if people just go to work, shut the office door, stay there all day and walk out the door again in the evening.  They like to chat and have a bit of social interaction.  That is part and parcel of life.  If we abolish that and make it that little bit more dull then obviously people will not want to go to work and will decide to take alternative options.<\/p> <p> There are also indications, to me at least, that right now is a good time to provide the alternatives.  Right now is a good time to be able to say to people of all ages there are ways and means of alleviating the burden of travel and commuting, and we will look at it and do so practically in a way that fits in with the standards and way of life we have now.  Whatever we have to do, we have to do and we should do it.  I hope the Minister will be mindful of these issues in the operation of all legislation, not just this particular Bill.  I know he is concerned about this and for the right reasons.  However, very often people typecast him in a different direction to suit the occasion.  We live in a time of change.  We must move on.  It is possible to do one of two things.  We can stick our two feet in the ground and say we are not moving anywhere and that we are going to remain as we were.  We cannot do that.  The international thinking has moved on as well, so we cannot do that.  We can say we want to drive at whatever speed we have always driven at on the motorways because that is what motorways are for.  However, what if that motorway is crowded, as many of our motorways now are, especially the M50?  The Minister introduced regulation on special speed limits for it, which is quite correct.  If the road is jammed with traffic, travelling at 120 km\/h is grand provided nothing goes wrong.  However, if something goes wrong and the car in front suddenly has to stop, or gets bumped from behind or whatever the case may be, then everything comes to a halt very quickly.  Therefore, we need to do that as well.<\/p> <p> The last point I wish to make relates to safety.  I have not commented on this previously.  There are risks with schoolchildren going to school or college or whatever it may be in the early hours of the morning and coming home in the wintertime darkness, and they are not all road traffic risks.  I ask that they be borne in mind.  The experience in other jurisdictions indicates to me that young kids on their way home from school, especially girls but boys too, have been accosted from time to time.  It is something we need to bear in mind because if we are changing the rules, as we must, we need to bring along with us that there may be changes where health and safety is concerned as well.  We need to put in a note somewhere to the effect that these are the new rules and this is what is safe.  We know from the context of Covid we might have to say it a few times before the message will hopefully get through that this is a safe way to travel, or whatever it may be.  I recall travelling up and down the country in a previous incarnation as a Minister of State in different times.  There were young kids on the roadsides in rural areas in the darkness of the morning.  They were waiting with the rain pouring down on them.  It is a different scene from what applies in many other parts of the country.  There are countless risks that need to be addressed.  I emphasise that to try to ensure that health and safety issues are borne in mind and some provisions made to ensure we can at least protect users of the roads, the footpaths and of various modes of transport that are different to those in existence heretofore.  We need to recognise we must put in place whatever provisions are necessary to protect all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800032#HH00200","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637243700,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I welcome this Bill and the regulation of e-scooters.  It is really important.  We need some kind of structure and guidelines for users of e-scooters.  The public is ahead of Government on this.  Travelling through Dublin city, people are on scooters every day.  They have decided they are using scooters so it is important Government regulates them and legislates for their use.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen presentations from some companies in this area.  There are big, glossy leaflets and the companies are making commitments and saying how much is in their bank balances.  It is important that when these companies come to Ireland, they are not allowed to cherry-pick.  They must commit to delivering nationwide and not just for Dublin.  It was said to me that if one of these companies does not get Dublin, they will probably just leave the market.  They will have no interest in the rest of the country.  They have no intention of going to Limerick, Galway or Waterford.  It is important the local authorities work together and ensure the companies are not allowed do that.  They must commit to this project and ensure they deliver a service in all the urban settings across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The NCBI, the Irish Wheelchair Association and Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind recently issued a paper outlining their concerns.  They identified the parking of e-scooters as an issue.  That will be a huge challenge.  Deputy Hourigan mentioned it earlier.  She spoke much more eloquently than me.  This is going to be a key make-or-break part of the project.  If the parking methodology is not done right it will not work.  It is very important the e-scooters are not allowed to become trip hazards and obstacles for those with disabilities.  Navigating the city can be challenging enough for visually-impaired people without also throwing a load of scooters all over the city.  Last October, Copenhagen made the decision to ban e-scooters from its streets after disabilities groups voiced concern.  That came into effect in January.  Copenhagen is a city that is open to different modes of transport and e-mobility, yet it has decided to knock this on the head.  Thus there is a concern here.  There is a view scooters are great, that they are exciting and that they are going to offer a great alternative.  However, there is evidence enough there to suggest that may not be the case and we must introduce them very carefully.  Local authorities will have to introduce their schemes cautiously.  Dockless scooters and possibly dockless bikes tend to face more vandalism.  They have been thrown into rivers and canals in other cities where they were introduced.<\/p> <p>We know that in different cities there were issues with scooters and e-bikes all being thrown into various rivers, if there was no docking space.  We do not want to see the River Liffey or the Grand Canal become a place for e-scooters and e-bikes.  I understand that a company in Manchester faced so much vandalism, it decided it had to pull out of the scheme.  It is important, when big companies come into the market promising the sun, moon and stars, that local authorities are not overly dazzled by the size of some of them.  As I said, I have attended a few presentations, and it all sounds fantastic and looks as if every angle has been covered, but the reality is international evidence suggests that sharing schemes may not work here.  That is something local authorities will have to take on and do so very carefully because it is important that these companies have a strong local connection.  Many of these big companies will tender for various contracts to deliver the e-mobility schemes across the cities, but if they do not have a local connection it will impact on how they deliver the service and how they respond to difficulties that may arise with the scheme.  <\/p> <p> I strongly agree that e-scooters should not be allowed on footpaths.  This legislation will not allow that to happen.  Footpaths should be safe from e-scooters because it can be very frightening for older people to see someone on a scooter flying towards them.  They are also concerned that if they go around a corner they will get knocked over by a scooter that is going at 15 km\/h or 20 km\/h on a footpath.  It is very dangerous.  Many older people have said to me that they do not have any serious objection to e-scooters, but they are nervous about the idea of scooters on footpaths, breaking traffic lights and so on.  There has to be regulation and a system of fines in place to ensure there is a consequence if the rules are not adhered to.  There must be fines for those on e-scooters who use footpaths.  If they use footpaths, they have to face the consequences because it is not acceptable, just as it is not acceptable that adults cycle bikes on footpaths.  Some regulation has to be in order.  <\/p> <p> There are areas that should be geofenced from e-scooters.  A previous speaker mentioned that shared space does not work and I fully agree with this.  There are areas, for example, in Dublin city, that will have to be geofenced to ensure e-scooters cannot be used in those shared spaces.  Grand Canal Dock is one such area that should not have e-scooters in it.  I have received a number of reports about e-scooter users racing through Grand Canal Dock, taking a shortcut or looking to fly through it, causing accidents, worrying residents living there and people who are just walking around enjoying the atmosphere.  Sharing that space is not going to work with a scooter travelling at 15 km\/h, 20 km\/h or 25 km\/h.  It just will not work.  Certain pedestrianised areas, such as Grafton Street and Grand Canal Dock, should be geofenced to ensure that e-scooters cannot fly up and down them.<\/p> <p> I have previously raised the issue of cyclists with Dublin City Council.  Cyclists should not be allowed to use Grand Canal Dock either as there are such a large number of them and they cause a major amount of stress and injuries to residents and people socialising in the area.  If we introduce scooters, it will become an area that will almost be not welcoming to pedestrians.  E-scooters do not work in shared spaces and, in certain settings and neither do bicycles.  We have to ensure that the new sharing scheme geofences certain areas so e-scooter users and cyclists are not allowed terrorise people in areas such as Grand Canal Dock.  Adding e-scooters to that environment is of no benefit to anyone.  It is not a huge area and people can move around the Grand Canal Dock area legally and safely, if that is what they wish to do.<\/p> <p> This legislation is important.  I do not have an e-scooter but I think I will get one.  I have no doubt the Acting Chairman would look great flying around on a e-scooter.  When he gets too old for his motorbike, he might try an e-scooter.  This legislation may not be as good as the hype is building it up to be, but there are many concerns.  We have to take into consideration the views of the Irish Wheelchair Association, the NCBI and the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, which I mentioned earlier, and whose members made a very fair and open statement.  We need to take their concerns into consideration because it is difficult enough to navigate the city without adding all these obstacles.  Where e-scooters will be docked and parked will also be crucial and will make or break the plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800033#JJ00900","speaker":"1555","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637244300,"counter":425,"content":"<p>This wide-ranging legislation is welcome.  Numerous constituents have contacted me regarding e-scooters and e-bikes and, therefore, the legislation concerning them is welcome, in addition to the newly installed traffic management system for the M50.  That is very important.  I understand there will be investment in improving our public transport system, which is very good news.<\/p>  <p>  I was very heartened this week by the great news that a long-awaited bus service for Carlow town has been given the green light, with services expected to begin in the second half of next year.  This is wonderful news for Carlow because the overwhelming need for this service has been known about for some time.  I have made consistent efforts, including representations to the NTA and the Minister, to get this project up and running.  It has always been a top priority and has never been more important, especially since the major announcement a few weeks ago regarding the technological university for the south east.  As the Minister will be aware, we have two excellent third-level colleges in Carlow and, therefore, this bus service is timely.  I ask him to ensure the service is in place no later than the middle of next year.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is also part of the Government's efforts to introduce and encourage alternative models for mobility, especially for people who mobility issues.  That is very important for anyone who has a disability or needs access.  We see it in my town of Carlow where there is a great railway station, but it has no wheelchair accessibility.  This is one part of all the issues we need to look at.  This Bill aims to reduce our reliance our cars, which is very important because we all need to do our bit on climate action.  I recently received several phone calls from people in my area about the traffic in Carlow town being backed up, especially during school times and when people are going to work.  We need to examine that issue because more public transport is needed for rural towns.  Dublin and our other cities are important but smaller areas, such as mine, which is a rural town in Carlow-Kilkenny, do not have enough public transport.  I ask the Minister to look at that as part of the programme as we go forward.<\/p>  <p>  I also very much welcome the provisions, which are being strengthened by this Bill, dealing with the dangerous antisocial use of off-road scramblers, quad bikes and other similar vehicles, and the amendment to strengthen laws on insurance and road traffic enforcement.<\/p> <p>These are all things that we need to make sure happen.  These measures will help to improve road safety while also helping us to drive down the cost of insurance for law-abiding drivers.  We must consider the safety of all our road users as a priority.<\/p> <p> I have some concerns relating to those living with disabilities.  Tonight, I will be in the Chamber to speak on the motion regarding the report entitled Aligning Disability Funding with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Budget 2022 Pre-Budget Submission.  I will talk about policy change to support those with disabilities to live their best lives.  We cannot then proceed with legislation that might allow e-scooters to be permitted on footpaths.  The Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021 must prohibit the use of e-scooters on footpaths and include such uses as an offence.  It is important those who are visually impaired can hear these vehicles.  We need to look at the acoustic vehicle alert system, AVAS, on all e-scooters so that they can be heard approaching.  This is essential for the safety of pedestrians who are blind or visually impaired.  I recently had several phone calls.  We have our joint policing committee meeting every few months, like all local authorities, and I am delighted to be part of that.  I brought this up at the meeting after having had phone calls from the people of Carlow, where these scooters are on the roads.  I have sometimes seen two people on one scooter.  The evenings are getting dark and you might find yourself suddenly almost on top of them.  I got several phone calls about scooters on footpaths.  I cannot highlight enough that in smaller rural towns, our footpaths are small.  We have to be careful with this for people with a disability, in wheelchairs, with buggies and older people who are out walking.  We cannot allow this type of thing to happen.  It would work against us in the long term.  The legislation currently allows for a maximum speed limit of 20 km\/h but this is far too fast for other road users and should be reduced to 12 km\/h in line with other European Union countries.  I ask the Minister to continue to do that.<\/p> <p> The issue of schools has been raised.  Parents have contacted me about speed zones at schools.  I ask the Minister to look at reducing speed limits near schools to 6 km\/h.  I have brought this up on several occasions.  When a lot of traffic congregates, even if only for 20 or 30 minutes, we need to look at something like this.  These are all important health and safety issues.<\/p> <p> EU Regulation 540\/2014 mandates all manufacturers to equip their new electric vehicles with AVAS by 1 July 2021 but it does not attach this requirement to e-scooters.  I agree with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland that this is our chance to lead others.  I know many Deputies have addressed this.  Many of us have welcomed this.  It is good that we are legislating and we have to progress, so this will happen.  I see some good things and people in my area use e-scooters.  If we do not find a balance regarding footpaths and speed, and how this is dealt with and policed, whether through the Garda or other agencies, that will be an issue.  I ask the Minister to address my concerns.  I look forward to hearing from him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800034#KK00300","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637244900,"counter":427,"content":"<p>My constituency includes Newcastle West, with 7,000 people, and Abbeyfeale, with more than 2,000 people.  They are currently in the throes of having a bypass made for their town.  This is welcome for the people who have been in traffic queues from Limerick to Kerry, and from any other part of the country.  However, it can be traumatic for an individual owning a house, farm or a business, as I am sure people will agree.  People have significant anxiety and more needs to be done to manage people's expectations, given the unrealistic timelines.  For example, there might be an announcement that such a project would take six years.  People could be given a breakdown of the project.  This particular project will take two years to get through the planning stage with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, with between six and 12 months for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make its ruling.  If planning permission is granted, it will take up to three years for acquisitions of land and houses, and everything else that comes with it.  This type of information needs to be brought out into the wider community to help people and to help with future-proofing our country.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment the Adare-Rathkeale councillors who had the foresight to see that withholding with regard to a section of greenway prevented funds from being wasted later.  That decision applied to a section of the greenway which was proposed where the Adare bypass will be.  I have a question for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, with regard to the criteria it follows, which relate to the cost ratio, the returning of investment, the least impact on residential homes, biodiversity, cultural impact, and archaeology.  I am bothered by how much input the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has had, for example, with regard to the housing list in Newcastle West.  In Limerick city and county, there are 2,347 on the housing list.  There are currently 343 people waiting for houses in Newcastle West and 139 in Abbeyfeale.  My concern is about how planning can be made sustainable for the people of Newcastle West in conjunction with a bypass.  This Department deals with heritage and local government as well as housing.<\/p>  <p>  Has TII liaised with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media?  The Newcastle West greenway will be crossed at least twice by the proposed route, which only officially opened two weeks ago, at a cost of &euro;100 million.  I met Deputy Brian Leddin at the opening of the greenway.  The greenway is fantastic infrastructure.  Deputy Leddin told me that he cycled in from Abbeyfeale to Barnagh.  I asked Deputy Leddin how he got from Limerick to Abbeyfeale.  He was a bit red-faced since he could not answer me because he had to use a form of transport with his bike in the boot.  Afterwards, he was heading out to meet the Government at the summit.  I asked him how he was going to travel from Barnagh.  He had to go to get an antigen test and then to go to the airport, where he had to load his bicycle into the boot of another car to return to where he had to go.  I acknowledge the bus routes that are proposed for Limerick but a majority are for west Limerick.  The need for them in east Limerick has not been fulfilled.  West Limerick is a tourist destination and I welcome everything that comes to it, but we also want infrastructure in east Limerick.<\/p>  <p>  To date, 250,000 people have used the Limerick greenway.  I question the joined-up thinking relating to the accountability of these two Departments to future-proof the two market towns, Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale.  I have complimented the greenway and walked and cycled it myself.  It is a brilliant amenity.  With this proposed route, we are now telling the people of Newcastle West that the greenway will be crossed at least twice.<\/p> <p>That is a waste of taxpayers' money.  I mentioned that the Adare-Rathkeale councillors  - I was a member of that council at the time - had the foresight to stop the greenway at a particular section until the bypass was built, and then it could be used alongside it, thus saving money.  That money saved went towards the construction of the Newcastle West district greenway.  Surely to God, we could have joined-up thinking among Departments.  This route did not happen yesterday or today.  When this route was being proposed, we could have created many things to allow for that road structure.  Now, we have to tell the people of Newcastle West and the users of this greenway that if this road goes ahead, they will have to be stopped from using the greenway at two different sections.  That is not right.<\/p> <p> From the point of view of forward planning, I would like now that the people, especially of Newcastle West, would be properly informed about the full process and that whatever services are available would be provided to them personally to save them the anxiety of having a bypass coming through their homes or lands.  This needs to dealt with.  I spoke to one woman in particular whose father came to the house that is on one of the routes.  The family has lived there since the 1800s.  Her great-grandfather lived there.  Her father was born into that house in 1915 and she was born into it 52 years ago.  There are fierce memories attached to it.  This woman told me of her anxieties in regard to the historical past within her home and that her family had had to rely on online platforms to figure out what was happening on the land around their house and in regard to the proposed route.  There was no communication between the family and TII.<\/p> <p> I want now to speak about e-scooters.  I welcome regulation around motorised vehicles, be that an e-scooter, a motorcycle or other vehicle.  There are laws in place and we all have to respect them.  I would welcome any measure around scooters from the point of view of safety.  In this debate, I have heard Members speak about scramblers, quads and so on.  I grew up in an area where quads, scooters and scramblers have always been in use.  The Government keeps taking away from people, telling them that they cannot drive this or that here or there.  Why not invest in places where they can drive them?  People who want to engage in motor sports can do so in places like Mondello Park.  Likewise, people who want to go horse riding can do so at horse riding tracks.  In terms of my culture, when I was growing up I was considered to be what was known as a petrol head.  I am interested in vintage vehicles.  I support our heritage, from the basic steam engine to the tractor and the horse to everything we have today.  That is my culture.  It was my heritage.  Along with other people in the vintage societies, I use that to recognise our heritage.  We also use it to raise much-needed funding for charities and other services who need it in a hurry.<\/p> <p> I watch motor sport, from motorbikes to everything else.  I love watching it.  If the Government is taking something away from people, in particular if it is in a city or large town, it should give them an alternative.  We can educate people when it is in a controlled environment.  Let us give them something in terms of their culture.  E-scooters were mentioned.  I agree they should be regulated within built up areas and where people's safety is involved.  Where there are people with disabilities, there should be investment.  This goes back to the point I made earlier about the opening of the greenway and Deputy Leddin.  There was no infrastructure to take the Deputy to the greenway.  As I have been saying since I was first elected to the D&aacute;il, we all support the green agenda and we want to lower our carbon footprint, but to do that we need infrastructure.  As I see it, up to now, we have put the cart before the horse.  There are many students in my area who cannot get to college using bus transport because the bus would not get them there on time.  Those who live outside of the town cannot drive to the local town because there is no adequate area where they can park a vehicle to then get a bus to go to college.  This is the reason I am always raising the issue of infrastructure.<\/p> <p> I would like to speak about the roll-out of bus services throughout the country.  When it comes to the Department allocating bus routes for the schools, the private operators are given a specific amount to operate those routes.  If we mirror that with the routes serviced by Bus &Eacute;ireann, I can guarantee you the private bus provider is getting a lot less than the subsidies being paid to those who operate bus services on behalf of the Department.  That is wrong.  I am aware that bus providers have offered their services in areas which the Government has not looked at yet.  The Department is telling them it is not looking at those areas.  It is only looking at proposed routes.  Why is that?  It is because the Department wants all of the money invested in Government-funded bus services.  The Department can come up with a route for which it knows it does not have to have a business in place because it knows it will be 100% funded to run these routes.  Why not think outside of the box and look at the private bus operators?  These are the people who take my child to school.  Even though I have to drive a mile or two up the road to meet the bus, my son gets on the bus and he goes to school.  Many people in rural areas would use rural transport if it was available, but is not there.  I want the Minister to look at all of Ireland.<\/p> <p> In our discussions yesterday on emissions, I said that Ireland is 0.01, or one-tenth of 1%, in terms of carbon in Europe and 0.04 globally.  Yet, we are importing products from countries which in one case is responsible for 35% and in the other case 25%.  We are increasingly importing more from those countries.  As I said, Ireland is 0.04 in terms of carbon globally.  Why not look at investing in our own sectors and creating work for our people?  We now know that the best produce in the world comes out of Ireland.  We have grass-fed animals producing milk and beef.  We have the best conditions and soils for growing vegetables, as well as everything else that comes with that.  We have the best milk in the country because of the Golden Vale grasslands.  Why can the Government not invest in our farming and other businesses that can sustain what we have now and stop importing to the benefit of some other country?  When you round it up, we are always only talking about Ireland and the changes we need to make.  We need change globally.  In terms of the changes we can make, we need to stop importing goods from areas that are killing the planet.  That is the answer.  We need to stop importing and use our own produce.  Whatever it is the Government got tied up in in Europe, it seems to be brainwashed.  It is using its statistics for Ireland.  Ireland could be self-contained.  We could reduce imports into this country.  By using our own products, we could bring down prices for everyone living here.<\/p>  <p> I have mentioned several times to the Minister that 98% of the products coming into this country enter through Dublin Port.  How many of the trucks we see on the motorway bringing produce to our doors to feed our families are coming in through Dublin?  I have asked the Minister to invest in Shannon-Foynes Port, which he said he is doing.  We could halve transport costs throughout the country if we got Foynes up and running immediately.  The largest ship in Europe could dock there.  It would centralise the distribution of goods leaving from places like Limerick.  At the moment, everything is centralised through Dublin.  A change in this regard could make a real difference if the investment were given.<\/p> <p> I have tried different routes to get from Dublin to where I live.  Leaving this building at 4.30 p.m. on a Thursday a few weeks ago, it took me an hour and 32 minutes to get to the Red Cow interchange, which is a distance of 9.6 km.  I then travelled the 217 km to my home in 2 hours and seven minutes.  I drive a diesel vehicle that does approximately 80 km to the gallon.  To get to Dublin by public transport, the nearest train station to me is Charleville.  If our business is delayed, like it was last night, I cannot get the train home because the last service to Charleville leaves too early.  In that case, I have to use the Dublin Coach service, known as the green bus, which will drop me to Arthur's Quay or Adare.  The problem then is I have to get somebody to collect me and take me home.  When I work out the carbon footprint of getting myself to Dublin, it is lower when I use my car than it is using all the various forms of transport that are otherwise required.  Somebody has to drop me to the train station and go home before coming back to collect me and returning home again.  It is the same with the bus.  There is no adequate parking for people to leave their cars for a couple of days.  Students who want to use bus transport find the same problem of there being no parking infrastructure.<\/p> <p> I appreciate what the Minister is trying to do but he is doing so from within the bubble of a city area.  Everything I have heard about electric scooters today has been focused on their use in urban areas.  It is all about cities.  In fact, scooters should not be driven on greenways because they are used by people and families to take a recreational walk or cycle.  They are a place for exercising.  However, for people with an e-scooter who want to get from A to B, they would have to use it on the greenway because they could not take it out on the main road.  You could not use an e-scooter on most of our roads because the circumference of the wheels is too small.  With the potholes and rough terrain on the roads, the vehicles would need at least a 100 mm wall of a tyre, like on a car, to sustain all the bumps.  The condition of the roads is a result of the lack of investment in rural areas.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to think outside of city areas, look at Ireland as a whole and plan to bring the country together.  He will get an awful lot more with honey than with vinegar.  The people who are suffering all the time when the Government makes changes in Dublin are those from rural areas.  They have no choice but to use a car and they cannot afford electric vehicles because they are too expensive.  Not only that, they do not have the range to sustain the journeys people are making.  Will the Minister consider an incentive to offer a 50% subsidy on the purchase of an electric vehicle to every household in Ireland?  It might encourage people to make the switch.  By doing this now, we could offer further incentives when the infrastructure is put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800035#LL00200","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637246100,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I may share time with Deputy Harkin, who has not yet arrived in the Chamber.  I only wish I had some of this time last night to speak during statements on the report of the air accident investigation unit.  I had three and a half minutes to contribute to the debate on that 350-page report.  Perhaps the House will, at some point, look into priorities for the time allocated to different business.  Having said that, this is a very important Bill and I do not mean to diminish its significance.  However, it is ironic that I should get 20 minutes to speak in this debate and only three minutes to contribute to the discussion on the very important topic last night.<\/p><p>The Bill consists of 13 Parts and 46 sections and references 53 Acts.  It is important legislation but its introduction raises the question as to when we will have a consolidated road traffic Bill.  It is not fair to the Garda or the people who will be affected by the legislation that it should be so complex.  It is not fair to anybody.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to consolidate road traffic legislation and I would like a date for when that will be introduced.  I acknowledge that the past year and three quarters have been very difficult because of the Covid crisis, but at some stage there must be a recognition that we need to review legislation to see whether it is functioning and consolidate it where necessary.  To proceed as we are doing is intolerable.<\/p><p>There is an urgency to this Bill because we have a situation whereby users of e-scooters are currently functioning outside the law.  However, there has been an attempt to put so much into this Bill that it makes it difficult to scrutinise.  There are very good provisions in the Bill, which I support, although there are also one or two measures in respect of which I have concerns.  I am not a member of the relevant committee but I understand from its Chairman that members will be going through the Bill line by line and teasing out its provisions.  That is very important because, for the first time, we are going into a private space in terms of following up a perceived offence.  Up to now, driving was in public; now we are looking at a private space.  That needs to be teased out, as does the judicial review section, and there are one or two other provisions that give rise to concern.<\/p><p>I pay tribute, as I do every time we debate new legislation, to the Library and Research Service for the Bill digest it has produced.  It is stated on page 2 of the document:<\/p> <blockquote> \tA Bill Briefing page is available which is being updated ...  There is no usual table of provisions and the Bill is examined thematically.  Not every topic in the Bill is examined because of a lack of time. <\/blockquote>  <p>For the second time this week, I am highlighting that this fantastic service is under extreme pressure. There has been no such statement by the service but it is my interpretation of the situation each time I read a Bill digest.  In this instance, the document goes through the provisions thematically rather than individually for the stated reason of a lack of time.<\/p><p>The digest, the briefing information and the explanatory memorandum explain that the Bill aims to provide for the regulation of a new class of vehicles called powered personal transporters.  I will not go through the details as they have been outlined by other speakers.  It also seeks to regulate scramblers, quad bikes and similar vehicles.  I support Deputy O'Donoghue in his comments about looking at the issues positively and seeking to provide alternative places for the use of quad bikes.  It is a good suggestion, which the Minister might consider.<\/p><p>It is important to consider the context of the number of deaths and injuries arising from the use of these vehicles.  In October 2020, the Road Safety Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na urged parents not to buy scramblers or quad bikes for children as Christmas presents.  Christmas is coming again and the same concerns arise.  The RSA's provisional statistics show that in the period from 2014 to 2019, three of the six people who died in Ireland as a result of an incident involving a quad bike or scrambler were aged 18 or under.  The statistics also show that in the same period, 60 people were involved in collisions involving a quad bike or scrambler on a public road.  Of those killed or injured between 2014 and 2019, 41% of casualties were aged 18 or under.  That is the serious context in which we are debating this legislation.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for many new powers and an alignment of matters of law in Ireland with European law in terms of medical fitness and so on.  I welcome all of that.  I also welcome the enabling provisions for the M50.<\/p> <p>I also welcome the linkage between the driving licence and the vehicle ownership records, and the extension to traffic wardens of the powers available to garda&iacute; in terms of paying fixed fines.  There will be three stages, or a trinity of attempts, albeit the fine more than doubles on the third occasion.<\/p> <p> I also pay tribute to the traffic and community wardens.  I remember when the post of community warden was introduced at local level in Galway, it had an unbelievable job description and they should have been paid 20 times what they were being paid.  They were to be the eyes and ears of the community on the ground and to deal with just about everything.  It was rolled out as a pilot project, but was never quite rolled out properly after that in terms of the number of wardens we need on the ground.  Our city would be much better for having more wardens.  That is something else I suggest we look at.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State talked in here about the challenge and said we were attached to our cars.  That is not true.  Motorists have been left with absolutely no choice but to use their cars.  I put my hands up and say I am back using a car.  I drive to Dublin every week.  I am somebody who used public transport, while realising other people could not.  I am not into a blaming game.  I am into recognising the climate change challenge leaves us with little option but to have a fundamental change.  I have gone backwards and am driving to Dublin every week.  I try to leave the car untouched from when I drive up on a Monday until Thursday and I resume my use of the bike at the weekend.  However, this is not about me.  It is about what has happened as a result of Covid and it does not suit my own life.  There is no public transport for me to get home late on the evenings when I go home.<\/p> <p> We have a legacy of inadequate public transport and now we have Covid on top of that, where we do not use public transport anymore.  That is a huge challenge for the Minister, on which I would happily work with him, because we need 100% use of public transport.  That is not happening.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, said many things in her speech.  I listened to and reread it.  The other thing that attracted my attention was her statement that the main challenge before her as Minister of State at the Department of Transport is to ensure the establishment of a sustainable transport system.  She then went on to talk about active travel.  I absolutely endorse the statement that the main challenge is public transport.  Without that, we cannot even pretend we are going any way towards meeting our climate challenges.<\/p> <p> I am being a little parochial by referring to Galway, but I do so to make general points.  I do not want to sound like a broken record when I mention again that I had the privilege of being mayor of Galway some years ago.  The only reason I mention it is that my colleagues and I forced the inclusion of park and ride facilities in the then city development plan, which became law on 1 February 2005.  Some 16 years later, we have no park and ride in Galway.  It was one of the occasions on which the councillors did their job against management advice, forced the situation, put in park and ride services in the east and west of the city, and left it up to management to roll that out with our encouragement.  It has simply never happened.  Can one imagine that we have no park and ride in Galway, which is one of the four or five designated gateway cities?  We now have a situation in which it will be very difficult to get enough space for park and ride, other than the successful but limited service provided at Christmas.  We were told in one of the last statements from management, of which there were a few before I left to come up to this august building, that it was premature to roll out park and ride.  That was 2016.  Here we are in 2021 with no park and ride.<\/p> <p> I hope some Minister will stand up and tell me I am totally wrong when I say there is no master plan for Galway city, based on the common good.  There are plans, but no master plan led by the public service.  I am a great fan of the public service, while being constructively critical.  We have no master plan for a city destined to increase its population by 50%.  Instead, we have developer-led development.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, agreed with me on more than one occasion, on the D&aacute;il record, when I said we were back to developer-led development in Galway city.  I do not know how many times I have to repeat it, but that is what we are at.  We have a significant amount of land.  A major strategic centre in Ceannt Station in the middle of Galway is being led by the station and an interested party.  The docklands, under a limited company, is developing its land in the sense that it is seeking to sell off the available land to fund the development of the docks sometime in the future, in a city where the housing crisis is worse than Dublin, with no exaggeration.  The Minister knows this.<\/p> <p> I could go on a rant, but I do not want to.  I want to set out the facts.  I hope, at some stage, sense will prevail and we will get a public servant who produces, with the help of expertise, a master plan for Galway to face its challenges in climate change and biodiversity, not to mention traffic congestion.  As I have the time, I will use it.  I will go so far as to say that traffic congestion has been allowed to build up unsustainably and deliberately.  There is no park and ride or comprehensive school programme to lift the school traffic off the road.  It is impossible at peak times.  All our eggs went into an outer bypass from 1999 onwards, which the Minister knows, because one of his colleagues was there at the time.  From 1999, an outer bypass was the only solution put forward, regardless of my opinion.  I am clearly on the record for my opinion on this.  No other sustainable steps were taken apart from those which were piecemeal, reactive and forced.  We are back again with the N6 project and waiting for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to come up with its decision, which has been adjourned many times.  I will not pre-empt that decision, but I will wait and see.<\/p> <p> It seems to me that if we are seriously interested in climate change, we should be looking at Galway as a pilot city.  The selection of Galway was debated at the climate change committee.  It is one of the cities destined to grow and increase its population by 50%.  It has two public and two private hospitals, two universities and many schools.  The vast majority of people, as the Minister well knows, want to come into Galway.  I understand, even from the figures from the engineers brought in for the N6, that more than 90% of people want to come into Galway.  Therefore, it is crying out for an urgent master plan.  It is crying out for sustainable development within the footprint, which is in keeping with the national planning framework and the plan.  However, that is not happening and cannot happen if it is developer-led.  I implore the Minister, as I have done on many occasions, to bring forward the proposal to have a feasibility study for light rail.  I ask him to prove me wrong that light rail is part of the answer to the traffic congestion in Galway.  I ask him to choose Galway as a pilot project, with all the advantages it has, such as the natural beauty and fantastic employment record.  The city is going under because of a housing and traffic crisis.  Let us bring forward a feasibility study for light rail.  Let us get a sustainable master plan for Galway city.  Let us look at the infrastructure that is stopping proper development on the east side of the city.  Deputy Canney has mentioned the lack of infrastructure and sewerage facilities there many times.  If we go out to the county, raw sewage is going from Carraroe straight into the bay and Clifden has a problem.  We need basic problems sorted out in order to have sustainable development.<\/p> <p> The Minister might ask what all of that has to do with the Second Stage of this Bill.  It has everything to do with it.  The Minister of State said the biggest challenge is in sustainable development, which is not happening, despite the sweet words.  Last night, I read out words from a psychologist, with regard to the Air Accident Investigation Unit, who talked about words meaning nothing.  That is the most dangerous thing happening in politics.  Words do not mean what they are supposed to and people are losing trust.  There is a huge danger that we are encouraging people on the right to look on us as all the same and without difference.  That is a very frightening prospect.<\/p> <p> Returning specifically to the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021, I think it was the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, who spoke about active travel, walking and cycling.<\/p> <p>I do both of those.  I spend my time on a bike when I am not driving to Dublin and I can tell the House that it is positively dangerous.  I have reached the point where I watch out all the time.  I have that experience.  I have a small amount of wisdom about it from burnt experience.  Mar a deirtear i nGaeilge, t&aacute; ciall ceannaithe agam.  I watch out all the time.  Most people cannot do that.  They are nervous on the road.  During the pandemic we had a fantastic cycle lane system in Salthill in Galway.  It is now gone, but it is under review again.  It was a majority of councillors, led by the mayor - I declare an interest here because the mayor is my sister &ndash; who forced a situation to get this back on the agenda.  They did that with maximum consultation with businesses.  At some stage there has to be a realisation that cycling must be made safe.  I listened carefully to what Deputy Hourigan said in that regard.  I echo what she said.<\/p> <p> I refer to Galway with a general meaning behind it.  Twenty years ago, we introduced the Barcelona declaration, which deals with universal access and demands that buildings and roads should be designed to be universally accessible, to do away with the distinction between abled and disabled.  However, the idea that there should not be a distinction between abled people and people with a disability went by the board during the pandemic.  The Government's message in this regard was inadvertent at first, but it failed to learn.  We cannot give a message that allows for the extension of alcohol consumption facilities out onto the public way without examining the rights of others, such as residents, people with disabilities, and so on.  That examination did not happen.  I do not blame the Government for failing to do that initially.  I agreed with it.  However, at some stage the Government has to say \"oh good lord, this is not working\"  It should get a report back from the local authority on whose rights have been affected by this policy.  Deputies and councillors in Galway have been inundated with residents telling us that they just cannot sleep because things are happening in their back gardens and that various obstacles are being thrown in the way of people with a disability as they try to negotiate the streets of Galway.<\/p> <p> I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the fact that little or no progress has been made on the Bearna greenway.  I left Galway in 2016 when I got the privilege of coming here to the D&aacute;il.  In January or February of that year, just before I came here, my last meeting was with the private consultants who were engaged with the local authority to progress the Galway to Bearna greenway.  It took me a year and a half, or longer, to get copies of the reports that were done on it.  I was then told that they remained as draft reports.  As such, they were never discussed at council level.  That was the management response to those reports.  I do not expect the Minister to be a god or to work miracles, but at some stage there must be consequences for the lack of progression of the Bearna greenway.  Little progress has been made on the other side of Galway, at Oughterard.  However, progress was made beyond Oughterard on the Clifden side.  I welcome that.<\/p> <p> Much more can be made of the school transport scheme.  Any time a Member asks a question about school transport, they get a stock answer about the hundreds of thousands of students that the school transport scheme is providing for.  We need an urgent review of the school transport scheme to make it open to everybody.  Obviously, the schools have to be prioritised.  However, if there are available buses, they have to be looked at.  I do not personally think that BusConnects is the answer for Galway.  The Minister talks about facilitating BusConnects.  The revolutionary change of which Deputies speak will come when we move people into Luas-type transport, rather than into buses.  I am, however, open to other views.  My preference is for light rail, and to get a feasibility study on it as soon as we can.<\/p> <p> I have nearly used all my time, but the last thing I would like to draw to the attention of the Minister is Bus &Eacute;ireann, specifically the number of buses that remain parked and unused in its parking area in Galway city.  My understanding is that the figure amounts to hundreds.  I could be exaggerating, although I always try to understate, rather than overstate.  It has been brought to my attention that the buses are sitting there with a view to being sold off a different auction.  This is because there are certain regulations about not using a bus after a certain time.  I understand the vast majority of those buses are not within that time.  Even though there is massive traffic congestion in Galway, there is a substantial number of buses just sitting there when they could be used as part of the solution, even on a temporary basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800037#NN00300","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637247300,"counter":433,"content":"<p>The Sinn F&eacute;in slot will not be taken.

I appreciate the broad support for the principle of the Bill, as well as the constructive approach that was in evidence through the debate.  This legislation has the improvement of public safety at its heart.  We may disagree on the best way to provide that.  However, these are disagreements we can work on in practice, rather than disagreements in principle.  I would like to address a number of points which were raised throughout the debate, which I hope will reflect back on some of the contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Many Deputies referred to our proposals on e-scooters and powered personal transporters, PPTs, in general.  I appreciate the broad agreement that we need to legislate in this area.  The issues raised about PPTs are all important, such as where and when they can be used; whether we should require helmets and high-visibility clothing; issues regarding liability; the need for lighting and audio warning devices on scooters; and the regulation of PPT rental schemes.  We need to discuss these issues and we need to be sure we get them right.  At same time, it is important to be clear on what kind of legislation we are dealing with at this time.  The Road Traffic Acts set out definitions for classes of vehicle.  For example, they define mechanically propelled vehicles.  They also define bicycles.  The details of specifications for vehicles, rules on safety equipment and rules for when and where they can be used are set out in the regulations.  The Bill will add a new class of vehicles, PPTs, to the Road Traffic Acts.  This will enable existing regulatory powers to be used to provide for the standards PPTs will have to meet, as well as where they can be used safely.  This will allow us to respond promptly to changes of circumstance.  In the case of PPTs in particular, it allows us respond quickly to what is an area of rapidly developing technology.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Carey referred to forms of micro-mobility other than electric scooters.  I assure him that intention in defining PPTs is to cover all vehicles of these types.  I will, of course, take all views into account in making these regulations.  My Department has conducted two public consultations on PPTs and has received great deal of feedback which will be useful in framing the regulations.  We remain open to good ideas.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue of insurance is a matter for the Road Traffic Acts, which require mandatory insurance for mechanically propelled vehicles, but not for bicycles.  In my view, in this respect, PPTs should be considered as closer to bicycles.  I will not, therefore, propose mandatory insurance.  A PPT is, in fact, a lighter vehicle than a bicycle and unlikely to cause more damage on impact than a bicycle would.  On the same principle, we do not intend to require tax or insurance on PPTs.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened to the debate on the issue of the power rating of electric scooters.  I am inclined to agree with those who say this is an area that needs flexibility.  I will therefore propose an amendment so that the weight, power and design speed limits in the definition of PPTs can be varied in regulations to respond to this rapidly evolving technology.<\/p>  <p>  I also note concerns raised about an age limit for PPT users.  This is a matter we are considering.  It will be dealt with in regulations, if necessary.  On the matter of supply to a minor, further examination suggests that the provision in section 34 of the Bill would not be enforceable.  I will be proposing to remove it.<\/p>  <p>  The rules around e-scooter rental schemes will be important to get right.  This will include safe parking, as several Deputies have observed.  However, the Road Traffic Acts do not deal with existing rental schemes, such as those for cars or bicycles.  The appropriate place for dealing with PPT rental schemes is in the context of sustainable travel.  This will need to be discussed with the local authorities and the National Transport Authority, NTA.<\/p>  <p>  Several Deputies raised issues of enforcement.  The enforcement of this legislation, like that all road traffic legislation, will be for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some Deputies have raised queries about Garda resources in relation to PPTs, scramblers and other issues.  I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary resources, but any detailed queries on this are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the important work done in prelegislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas committee on transport.  This has informed our work here.  I agree with him on the importance of raising public awareness before the new traffic management measures come into force on the M50.  <\/p> <p>I also share the views expressed by others that careful analysis will have to be undertaken before any decision to apply similar measures on other roads.  In addition, I assure Deputy Fitzpatrick that the Bill makes clear who will have access to information on the motor insurance database and for what purposes.<\/p> <p> Deputy Carey also mentioned data security in connection with driver licences and vehicle data.  In this case we are not creating a new database but a linkage between data held by the Department on driver licences and on vehicle ownership.  Software systems containing State records have always been a target for hostile actors.  Although no system is 100% safe, the Department takes database security seriously and constantly reviews, updates and monitors all software security systems to ensure the systems are as secure as possible.<\/p> <p> The question of people submitting video evidence to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for certain traffic offences was also raised during the debate.  This is an important point but it is part of a wider discussion of evidence submitted to the Garda by the public and it would be premature to address it in law at this time.<\/p> <p> We have committed in the programme for Government to improve conditions for asylum seekers.  I am happy to confirm I will be bringing forward an amendment to ensure asylum seekers will be eligible to apply for driver licences.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the supportive comments from Deputies on the need for legislation to address the antisocial use of scramblers and quad bikes.  Action in this area is essential and, as was pointed out, so are enforcement and community engagement.  I confirm there has been detailed discussion between my Department, the Department of Justice and the Garda on the issue.  I thank Deputy Lahart for his interesting and carefully considered comments on scramblers, as well as on a number of other issues.  I agree with him that the legislation on scramblers is only one part of the solution to the problem.  Community initiatives and public awareness of the dangers are also essential.<\/p> <p> The question of incentives for e-bikes is one for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, but I am happy to support ways to promote their uptake.  I can see the arguments for a stand-alone Bill on e-scooters but in the long run these are a type of vehicle used in public and they do belong in the setting of wider road traffic legislation.  Deputy Lahart also suggested we have a choice between private ownership or shared rental schemes for e-scooters.  I do not believe we need to make this choice and we can and will have both.  I appreciate his concerns about the possibility of all types of unregulated machines being used but this is precisely why we are introducing the proposals we have in the Bill to ensure powered personal transporters, which can be used legally, are safe vehicles and must be used in a safe way.<\/p> <p> Deputies Sherlock and Murphy raised questions on the proposed changes to planning laws to facilitate the BusConnects project.  The Bill will provide for specific and limited circumstances under which An Bord Plean&aacute;la can approve a scheme or road development that materially contravenes a development plan or local area plan.  This is not a new procedure.  The board already has the power to grant certain permissions that contravene a development plan in specific circumstances.<\/p> <p> The proposed new rules on fit and proper persons to be a driving instructor were raised by Deputies McNamara and Carey.  The principles of excluding persons with certain types of convictions from certain professions, either temporarily or permanently, is well established, for example, the law on taxi regulation.  Deputy McNamara's suggestion of considering additional offences has been noted and will be considered prior to Committee Stage.  Deputy Carey suggested removing the provision relating to penalties for people whose driver licences have recently expired.  I take his point given the situation with Covid.  I believe that in the long term it is a good amendment and I intend to keep it in the Bill.  However, commencement of the provision will be considered only when we have a certain and more normal situation after the pandemic.<\/p> <p> Deputy Carey also mentioned publication of collision reports.  The Road Safety Authority does publish analysis of factors involved in collisions but this can take some years due to the need for detailed examination and coroners' inquests.<\/p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh raised the issue of the proposed horse-drawn carriages legislation.  Following delays as a result of the pandemic, I can confirm that work on horse-drawn carriage legislation has now been recommenced.  It is complex and technical and due care needs to be taken to get it right but I expect to see it published as a stand-alone Bill.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies raised the question of backlogs in the driver testing service.  Although it is not directly relevant to the legislation I would like to make a comment on this.  Covid has, of course, caused delays and a backlog in the service.  The Road Safety Authority had taken on additional testers to deal with this.  Deputy O'Rourke asked a question on this and I will answer it.  I am happy to say the ten testers whose contracts were due to expire in December and the seven whose contracts were due to expire in March are all being offered extensions by the Road Safety Authority.  This will maintain capacity for the time being.  I understand the new testers whose contracts are due to expire will not reach the end of their contracts until May.  In the first quarter of next year, the Road Safety Authority will conduct a detailed review of the evolving situation with the test and resource needs, and we will see where we go from there.<\/p> <p> I reiterate that after the Bill has passed we will turn to examination of the consolidation of the Road Traffic Acts, as Deputy Connolly requested in her contribution.  It is something that is important.  I agree fully with her that our legislation is often very complex to administer and understand due to a lack of consolidation.  Despite the complexity of the Acts, the Department knows of no case of a prosecution that has failed due to a lack of consolidation.  However, that does not take from the argument the Deputy rightly made.<\/p> <p> My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, indicated in her opening speech we would bring forward amendments on Committee Stage and I also mention this today.  Some of these will relate to the BusConnects projects to make sure there is flexibility.  To answer Deputy Leddin's question, that will also include provision for us to put in place experimental traffic management systems whereby local authorities will have to take real ownership of these new, innovative measures in a way that allows us to trial them for a period and afterwards to withdraw or retain them.  This will give it real legislative strength.  We need to do so after a recent decision on the Strand Road in Dublin as there is a risk it could have a chilling effect on all new innovation and development of traffic management for decarbonisation and improving the public realm.  I am looking forward to developing those and explaining and introducing the amendments on Committee Stage, as well as other amendments on giving greater certainly to the legislative underpinning of BusConnects.  I look forward to a constructive debate on Committee Stage and I thank all of the Deputies for their contributions on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800039#PP00300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637247900,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021: Referral to Select Committee","time":1637247900,"counter":437,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800040#QQ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1637247900,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Transport and Communications, pursuant to Standing Orders 95 and 181. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800040#QQ00400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637247900,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1637247900,"counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800040#QQ00600"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637247900,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637247900,"counter":442,"content":"<p>The ultimate aim for a legislation in this area is to reduce the risk of new offences.  This is the lens through which we have to look at every measure in this Bill.  It is about how we make our communities safer.  I must say that I am honestly not sure about electronic monitoring of sex offenders.  I am absolutely in favour of keeping people safe and monitoring.  The idea of electronic tagging for sex offenders has been floated for a long time.  It was considered back in 2009 by the Department of Justice and again by Frances Fitzgerald when she was Minister.  It is easy to see why it is a popular idea.  The concept of tracking sex offenders electronically aims to provide a level of comfort or reassurance to victims and the community at large while also making it easier for the Garda to monitor offenders effectively.  At present, some 1,708 people are subject to a reporting requirement under the 2001 Act.  A total of 319 of these are supervised by the Probation Service and 192 are under post-release supervision in the community.  The remainder notify their whereabouts to their local Garda station.<\/p> <p>Electronic monitoring is already provided for under the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which states if an offender is facing a sentence of more than three months, a judge can restrict his or her movement instead of imposing a prison sentence and an electronic tag can be used to ensure the offender maintains a strict curfew and stays away from certain areas.  When electronic tagging was trialed back in 2010, prisoners on temporary release had to keep the devices in their pockets as the straps kept breaking.  There were also faulty transmissions of signals resulting in periods were prisoners were not monitored.  Granted, that was a trial and the whole point of trials is to make sure something works.  There have been improvements to GPS technology, which has come a long way in the past 11 years, but regardless, this goes to show that electronic monitoring may not be infallible.  If such monitoring is going to be used more, there will have to be some degree of testing and monitoring of devices.  There would also need to be significant monitoring of the individuals with these devices to ensure nothing is amiss.<\/p> <p> No monitoring currently takes place, aside from instances where prisoners are given temporary release under limited circumstances.  We need to take a closer look at why that is the case.  To date, there has been a marked reluctance to use electronic tagging despite it being legislated for, but there is no sense in legislating for the broader use of a technology that is not being used.  I may be wrong and it may not be permitted to use such technology in these circumstances.  I look forward to hear what the Minister of State has to say in that regard.  <\/p> <p> The main reasons for the hesitancy in using electronic tagging seem to be its cost, the resources required and its effectiveness in reducing crime.  Electronic monitoring requires a large support staff to monitor people's movements, as well as enough garda&iacute; on hand to react if an offender breaches the terms of their directions.  With 1,708 people currently subject to a reporting requirement, how many people could garda&iacute; feasibly monitor?  Has there been any kind of study into the capacity that is available?  There was some suggestion a number of years ago that legal advice had been given to the effect that people could only be monitored for a maximum of 12 hours a day.  There does not seem to be any mention of this in the Bill.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on the legal advice the Department has received on the length and degree of monitoring permitted via these devices?  Will that be clarified in this legislation?<\/p> <p> Electronic monitoring cannot replace traditional measures of supervision and it will not make any impact on the rehabilitation of offenders.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has described evidence about the benefits of electronic tagging as \"fairly unconvincing\".  It argues that what is really needed is investment in resources for the Probation Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but that needs to happen anyway.  Ultimately, there seems to be a lack of empirical evidence that electronic monitoring works.  While Garda knowledge of the whereabouts of a sex offender is often a comfort, particularly to the public, it is not all that effective in crime prevention.  <\/p> <p> I recall discussing the issue of anti-social behaviour orders, ASBOs, in this House many years ago.  Several members of an Oireachtas committee went to the UK to an area in which ASBOs were being used extensively.  The real takeaway from that visit was that the ASBO was fine in principle but the monitoring required and the resources needed for rehabilitation were  significant and way more than we had anticipated.  For some people, ASBOs were a badge of honour and something of which to be proud, which was deplorable.  <\/p> <p> We are all familiar with the fact that most sex offenders are known to their victims.  The annual report from the sexual violence centre in Cork, for example, found that almost nine out of ten victims of rape or sexual assault knew the perpetrator, while 13.2% were raped or sexually assaulted by a stranger.  Despite knowing this fact for many years, it does not seem to sink into the narrative around sex offenders.  Realistically, this is probably because it is a hard fact for any of us to come to terms with that anyone close to us would be capable of such a horrific crime.  There are sex offenders out there who present a significant risk to others and who need to be monitored consistently, not simply electronically, for the protection of the community and indeed, sometimes for their own protection.  I came across a scenario where a sex offender was living very close to a playground and was known.  One can see what could arise in that kind of situation.  While the narrative is often focused primarily on convicted offenders, we also need to pay close attention to other aspects of prevention.  We need comprehensive consent education in our schools from an early age and we must also educate children and adults on boundaries, how to identify when someone has crossed them and when one is at risk of crossing someone else's boundaries.  <\/p> <p> As set out in this Bill, the maximum period for electronic monitoring is six months.  Tagging cannot be used as a long-term solution.  If we extend that maximum period any further, we could be stretching our human rights compliance.  If properly resourced and compliant with an individual's rights, electronic tagging may be useful in certain circumstances, for example, where there is a certain level of risk or where it might address immediate issues relating to offenders following conviction or upon their release.  There is a benefit in somebody being tagged if they are out of prison for a specific duration.  Ultimately, however, it does not provide the means for addressing the problem of sexual offending behaviour in either the short or long term.  <\/p> <p> For the period in which someone is monitored, he or she would need to be accompanied by all the relevant supports necessary to aid rehabilitation and reintegration.  There is a lot more to changing people&rsquo;s behaviour than just taking away control and freedom.  People have to be given the education, tools and motivation to change.  In some cases, they do not want to engage with the kinds of initiatives that could change behaviour.  Punishment and accountability are vital as a deserved consequence for seriously harmful crimes.  They also provides security and some measure of justice to victims.  Having an offender held appropriately accountable for their crime is necessary for victims to have faith in the system and to encourage others to come forward and report abuse.  However, the penal system cannot be about punishment alone.  We need to be careful that we do not isolate offenders from society even further because all the evidence shows that this only makes the rate of recidivism rise and makes communities less safe.  The object of the exercise for all of us is to use legislation as a means of changing a culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800040#QQ00700","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637248500,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this profoundly important legislation.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, in particular for working so swiftly to bring this Bill before the House.  This legislation is primarily concerned with strengthening the monitoring of sex offenders within our communities but, more importantly, it is focused on protecting and supporting survivors of sexual offences.  This gives them the reassurance that the person who perpetrated such an awful crime against them will not have the opportunity to do so again.<\/p> <p>Our criminal justice system is centred on the perpetrator of the crime.  Where possible, we should be focused on a victim-centred approach.  Reforming the criminal justice system to be more victim-centred is an ambition of the Minister and it is one that I fully support.<\/p> <p> Returning convicted sex offenders into society after a prison sentence is complex.  It can often come with a lot of anxiety for survivors, their friends and family.  That is because, much of the time, close ties can exist between many sex offenders and their victims.  We have a robust system in place to manage those with a conviction for a sexual offence, but this legislation will further strengthen that system, and put a number of important actions on a statutory footing.<\/p> <p> I welcome the extension of the notification requirements for sex offenders and the shorter three-day notice period for a change of address.  Ireland must not be found lagging in this area of criminal justice and the provision brings us in line with other jurisdictions, including the UK.  This legislation will also provide for electronic tagging and prohibit convicted sex offenders from engaging in certain work, in particular working with children and vulnerable people, which is a highly important provision.  In terms of working with vulnerable people, the prohibition on sex offenders will be limited by sentencing and I have some concerns about that.  The Bill will be an important part of the existing range of protections in place to support survivors of sexual offences.<\/p> <p> I wish to give voice to some of the points raised by the Rape Crisis Network Ireland on the Bill.  Who better to consult with than with those exceptional advocates, the victims of sexual offences.  The network broadly welcomes the move to update the previously outdated language in the definition of a \"vulnerable person\".  However, I agree that there is scope to go further with this definition beyond those with a disability or mental illness.<\/p> <p> The O'Malley Review of Protections for Vulnerable Witnesses in the Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual Offences set out that there is nowadays a widespread view that witnesses in criminal trials, especially for a sexual offence, may be vulnerable by virtue of the circumstances, even if they do not have a physical or mental disability.  Rape Crisis Network Ireland asks that we consider inclusion of circumstances where a person is the previous victim of the released offender's crimes, or is at particular risk for another determined reason, within the definition of vulnerable person.  The network makes a good point about enhanced Garda notification and identification.  These provisions are welcome, but it is important that the Garda have the necessary IT infrastructure to ensure that there is a capacity to co-ordinate information throughout the country.  This is not the case currently because information is retained locally.  Adequate Garda resources will be essential, especially when it comes to the electronic monitoring of sex offenders for it to be workable.  It is important that we ensure those resources are in place.<\/p> <p> Sadly, we know that sexual offences are predominantly committed against women.  Some 29% of women in Ireland have been affected by domestic abuse.  A total of 12 % of Irish women and girls over the age of 15 have experienced stalking.  One in four women in Ireland has experienced physical or sexual violence since the age of 15.  The statistics are horrific.  Strength and support are needed to overcome the lasting impacts of sexual abuse of any kind.  These are scary and scarring experiences, especially for women.  I welcome the work that the Minister and the Government are doing to prevent and reduce instances of sexual offences, violence and abuse against both men and women.<\/p> <p> I also take this opportunity to commend the work that organisations such as Rape Crisis Network Ireland, Women's Aid and Safe Ireland do.  In particular, I want to mention Saoirse Women's Refuge in Rathcoole in my local area, which does amazing work in supporting women and children who are affected by domestic violence.  Victims of sexual offences can be brought some comfort in knowing that their offender has been brought to justice and is being closely monitored and managed by the Garda.  This Bill gives them that comfort.  Groups like Saoirse Women's Refuge provide much needed around-the-clock support for survivors.<\/p> <p> I welcome this legislation, as it will strengthen our approach to dealing with sexual offenders when they return to the community, but, most importantly, it will give survivors the support and protection they need and deserve.  It will bring us another step closer to achieving a victim-centred criminal justice system, for which we all must continue to strive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800041#RR00200","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637249100,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I welcome the long-awaited changes encompassed in it that were campaigned for.  The Bill will allow the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to be updated in 2021 to ensure convicted sex offenders are effectively managed and monitored.  SORAM will be placed on a statutory footing.  There is a recognition of the need when assessing and managing risk to draw on expertise not just from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service but to include expertise available in the HSE, Tusla, the Prison Service, and school and housing authorities to name but a few.  There is a crucial need for adequate resourcing to underpin this legislation.  Up-to-date IT systems will be vital, as will a clear funding stream to ensure that happens and that the systems are maintained.<\/p>  <p>  Electronic monitoring has been used in the UK since the late 1990s and was extended recently to include monitoring those convicted of domestic violence.  There can be benefits to electronic monitoring for sex offenders in terms of compliance with a post-supervision order, monitoring curfews and to verify an individual's location at any given time.  Again, adequate training and resources are vital to ensure success and that the desired outcome is achieved.<\/p>  <p>  Another area of the Bill, which is most welcome, but disgracefully late in arriving, is the proposal to explicitly provide for the court to prohibit sex offenders from working with children and vulnerable adults and engaging in certain activities that would bring them into contact with those individuals.  The fact that the term of prohibition will be limited by sentencing means this is not the cure-all for children and vulnerable adults that it could be.  The previous language relating to vulnerable persons was so outdated it could be described as archaic, but it is a missed opportunity.  The O'Malley review observed witnesses in such trials are vulnerable by virtue of the circumstances in which they find themselves.  The circumstances are not of their making, and only exist because of the choices of others.  There must to be a scaffolding of supports for victims of sexual offences before, during and after the trial, including anonymity, court representation and other support services, primarily provided by the rape crisis centres network.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the point made by other speakers that the cause of rape is the rapist and the choices they make.  There is a categoric need to ensure that the survivors of sexual assaults are not inadvertently subjected to further trauma by the judicial system, be that through delays or postponements, which undermine emotional resilience, often built back after significant time, therapy and support.<\/p>  <p>  I am struck by the fact that we are discussing the Bill on a day when there are headlines about another suspended sentence for somebody convicted of a sexual assault.  In the case in question in County Donegal, the person was given a six-year suspended sentence for burglary and four years for sexual assault.  That is simply not good enough, because justice delayed is often justice denied.  The victim of the sexual assault in that case has certainly had justice denied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800042#SS00200","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1637249100,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Barry.

Sexual crimes are a very important subject.  Sexual violence of any kind is utterly hideous.  Gender-based violence and toxic misogyny are reprehensible in any form but they exist and manifest and, unfortunately, they are on the rise in society.  The profound effect on the victim is incalculable.  For people who have been sexually abused or had sexual violence committed against them, that effect stays with them for the rest of their lives.<\/p> <p>It will also have a profound effect later on, when they have children, and so on.<\/p> <p> I want to look at a different aspect in regard to the societal issues around sexual violence and the sexualised nature of our society.  It would not be radical to say there are elements of popular culture that are insidious in the way the sexualisation of women is portrayed.  It is horrible how some parts of popular culture can be that insidious.  An element of that is at the root of sexual crimes and gender-based violence.<\/p> <p> Even with regard to domestic violence, we have seen in the past 19 months, because of the pandemic, the profound effect of the environment where a woman is subjected to a horrible level of bullying, intimidation and harassment, and, obviously, that has a terrible effect on the children of that person.  It is a horrible situation.<\/p> <p> I have serious concerns about the provisions in the Bill that deals with electronic tagging.  There is probably no evidence that it deters the individual from doing other things.<\/p> <p> As to investment in domestic violence supports, where women present themselves, there is definitely an argument that there needs to be more provision in that regard.  It has to be invested in where women present in that situation.<\/p> <p> Rehabilitation is very important.  Some of the people who have been incarcerated have committed the most dreadful crimes.  However, how did that arise?  Was it nurture or nature?  Was it societal?  Was that person born to do that?  I do not think so.  There is definitely an opening for rehabilitation and an opening to prevent a person ever getting to that stage.  That is very important.<\/p> <p> There is also training around consent.  We have seen this with the #MeToo movement, which is a very important movement where women have come out saying they have been subjected to quite subtle but forceful violence and sexual approaches in the workplace.  We have seen through the Women of Honour movement in the Defence Forces the women who came out and said they were subjected to horrible and toxic behaviour.  As I said, this has a terrible effect on those who are subjected to it.<\/p> <p> I understand this is the most serious of issues but I have serious concerns around certain parts of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800042#SS00700","speaker":"1565","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637249700,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I and every Member of this House received email correspondence regarding this Bill from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  Many points were made in that email but there are two points to which they asked us to pay particular attention.  The first is that a victim support-advocacy voice should be specifically named in the legislation, and we support that.  Second, they emphasised the view that the arrangements will not work unless adequately resourced, which is a key point.  We have domestic violence centres in this State where Trojan work is done but they are nowhere near adequately resourced.  Rape crisis centres are nowhere near adequately resourced.  It is the same with mental health counselling facilities.  Anti-sexual violence education programmes, including programmes for sex offenders, are inadequately resourced.  In the budget that the Government brought forward last month, &euro;20 million was set aside for domestic violence support services and &euro;5 million for sexual violence prevention and protection, a total of &euro;25 million, and the same budget provided &euro;17 million for the greyhound industry.  It is unreal.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill proposes to give new powers to the police.  In discussing those proposals, it cannot go without comment that we are talking about resources for a Garda force that ignored thousands of 999 calls, which ignored claims of image-based sexual abuse and which, at the last count that I am aware of, since 2018 has had at least a dozen officers with barring orders against them.  This shows that, when it comes to discussing proposed new powers, we need to couple that with a discussion about democratic control over the police force in this country.  We also need to discuss it in the context that the priority for extra resources is the underfunded services I have mentioned, all of which have a proven track record of helping survivors with both support and healing.<\/p>  <p>  The final point I want to make concerns of the role of active social movements in challenging misogyny, challenging rape culture and challenging the culture that facilitates sexual offences and gender-based violence in this country.  Active social movements played a key role in the recent gains in LGBTQ rights, and active social movements played a key role in winning the changes for the repeal of the archaic anti-abortion laws and for abortion rights in this country.  It can and, I think, will be the same on this issue as well.<\/p>  <p>  Active social movements challenging gender-based violence and femicide are hugely important.  Next week, on Thursday, 25 November, is the UN day set aside and designated International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and gender-based violence.  I am sure there will be many activities and campaigning events around the country, and I am going to draw attention to just a few of them.  ROSA, the socialist feminist organisation, is organising what it is describing as a Walk With Women.  It is asking people to show solidarity and to walk with women in Dublin city centre, Dublin west and Cork.  I think this is a very valuable initiative and I would appeal to people to support these and other initiatives and to participate in these initiatives.  They are important events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800043#TT00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1637249700,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Sexual offences in Ireland are unique, when we look at the criminal code, because they are targeted nearly exclusively against one group in society, and that is women.  I know there have been and there are sexual offences that are perpetrated against men but, predominantly, these are offences that are perpetrated against women.  We need to recognise that when they are being perpetrated, they are offences that are combined with physical violence, as well as sexual violence, against that victim.<\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; are getting much better with regard to how they investigate sexual offences.  I think that it is recognised, when one talks to people who have been victims of sexual offences, in many instances they are now saying the garda&iacute; performed particularly well in the investigation of those offences.  We need to figure out in this House what we can do to facilitate and to protect women who, as I say, are predominantly offended against when it comes to these offences.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to say some of the legislation that has been introduced in recent years provides greater protections to women who are victims of sexual offences.  More broadly, in 2017 we introduced legislation that recognised for the first time the importance and role of victims of crime in our criminal justice system.  For too long the criminal justice system has been focused on the issue of the guilt or innocence of the accused.  It is important we recognise that victims have an important part to play in the criminal justice process.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, on the work he has done on this Bill and for bringing it before the House and I commend the Minister, Deputy McEntee, as well.  It is a very important Bill.  Members have spoken about the provisions within it and I do not intend to repeat what has been said so eloquently by other Members, but there is universal support here for this Bill and that is indicative of how there is recognition in this House that more needs to be done to protect victims of sexual offences.<br\/><br\/>I refer the Minister and the Minister of State to an article that was published about ten days ago in <i>The Irish Judicial Studies Journal<\/i>.  It is entitled &quot;Towards a Presumption of Victimhood - Possibilities for Re-Balancing the Criminal Process&quot;.  This article was written by Mr. Justice Peter Charleton and Orlaith Cross.  In the article they set out how they believe the criminal trial and justice process needs to be rebalanced in favour of the victim.  They are not suggesting the rights of the accused should be diminished in any material way or that the presumption of innocence should not apply when it comes to somebody who is charged with serious offences.  However, the article puts forward a number of proposals on rebalancing the trial process.<br\/><br\/>One thing all of us in this House are aware of is that when you speak to women &ndash; and it is predominantly women &ndash; who have been through the process of a criminal trial where an accused is being prosecuted for a sexual offence against them, they find the criminal trial process intimidating and demanding.  We have an obligation in this House to try to change that so it is not as demanding or intimidating.  A number of suggestions were put forward by the authors in the article as to how that could be done.  One of the suggestions they put forward is that providing information to somebody who is a victim of an offence, regardless of whether it is a sexual offence, is not enough in itself.  We have introduced measures in this House in recent times that will give more information to a complainant in any trial and to a victim in a sexual offence trial.<br\/><br\/>The second point the article makes is that on numerous occasions we have spoken in this House and recommendations have been put forward that the victim in the criminal trial process should have separate legal representation.  That can happen under existing legislation in circumstances where the victim is being cross-examined and where it is believed the prosecuting counsel is not providing sufficient protection.  What is suggested in the article is that there should be a closer relationship between the victim and the prosecuting counsel.  We know that in a criminal trial the prosecuting counsel is prosecuting on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  He or she is representing the interests of the State.  It is true the prosecuting counsel is not employed or hired on behalf of the victim but the reality is the prosecuting counsel and the DPP are representing the interests of the victim who has made a complaint that the DPP believes is sufficient to launch a prosecution.  There needs to be closer contact between prosecution counsel and the victim in a criminal trial process.<br\/><br\/>A third point mentioned in the article is that it might be necessary for counsel and solicitors to engage in training by professional bodies and that perhaps State parties should engage counsel and solicitors.  That is something we have spoken about before but we have not really done that much about it and it is notable a service exists in England and Wales, the Advocate&rsquo;s Gateway, which provides a toolkit on questioning vulnerable witnesses and up-to-date resources.  That is something we should also look at.<br\/><br\/>Another point that is sometimes made by people who have gone through the trial process is that they find the cross-examination process intimidating, demanding and challenging.  Cross-examination plays an important role in trying to establish the truth and nobody is suggesting the right to cross-examine should be taken away from any accused person.  However, it must be the case that the right to cross-examine can be curtailed or limited in time.  We already see that happening in civil trials and it has not resulted in miscarriages of justice or inaccurate results.  Similarly, we need to look at criminal trials again to ensure cross-examination is not permitted to go on endlessly for the sake of trying to undermine and exhaust a witness.<br\/><br\/>Another point that is made is that an accused usually does not give evidence.  I am not suggesting an accused should be required to give evidence but the article refers to how the self-serving statements, made at Garda stations, of accused persons who do not give evidence are read out at trials.  We need to look at that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800043#TT00300","speaker":"1553","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637250300,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I welcome that this Bill has been brought forward and I add my voice to that of others in that regard.  I have spoken to Rape Crisis Network Ireland and to other experts in the field, of which there are many given the subject nature we are dealing with.  We all accept the reality that we need to put this on a better footing to ensure all necessary community organisations are aware of the issues around people who pose a danger to children and society.  We are talking about people who have been convicted of some of the most heinous crimes.  I agree with an awful lot of what has been said earlier, that we need to deal with the victim, across all crimes, in a better and more coherent way.  Often when you talk to people they tell you about being retraumatised and about being unaware of events, particularly in the judicial system.  That can lead to real problems.  That is even true in situations where the prosecution's case works properly and the person who has committed the crime is found guilty.<\/p>  <p>  I mention the framework for protecting people who have suffered brutal attacks, whether we are talking about child sex abuse or rape.  We know in a lot of cases the protective framework people avail of is the NGO sector, including a rape crisis centre or the likes of Womens Aid in Dundalk.  Since I have mentioned it I point out that Womens Aid in Dundalk is carrying out a fundraiser of 16 days of action and a 5 km walk.  It is taking place between 25 November and 10 December so I will have to get myself a bit fitter if I decide to do a bit more than walking on those days.  It is a vital organisation doing vital work.  I am always worried when such an organisation has to go to this level of fundraising.  These organisations exist because they fill necessary gaps the State does not deal with.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill.  Parts of it will need to be looked at.  We can talk about monitoring all we want but we must have the ICT systems and training for garda&iacute; in place.  I welcome the changes that have happened.  The protective services unit that has been set up in Castlebellingham in recent years has been successful in dealing with domestic violence but we still have a long way to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800044#UU00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1637250300,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of this legislation and the fact we are debating it here at long last.  It is 13 years since the then Government committed to bringing in this Bill.<\/p> <p>The Minister's predecessor, Mr. Dermot Ahern, told me in reply to a parliamentary question on 22 April 2009 that unless we reformed the notification process here in this country in tandem with what had been done in the UK, our jurisdiction would become a safe haven for convicted sex offenders.  Sadly, I believe, over the past 13 years, that has happened.<\/p> <p> The Bill will close off quite a number of dangerous loopholes that are currently within the existing legislation, particularly in terms of the management and monitoring of high-risk sex offenders.  The current law left that system completely open to abuse and people who wanted to avoid detection could easily do so.  This legislation will ensure for the first time in this country we have an effective sex offenders register, and that is a very positive development.<\/p> <p> I also believe the provisions in the legislation to create a legislative basis for the assessment and management of risk posed by sex offenders, the disclosure of information by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding someone who is on the sex offenders register, and the Garda being able to apply for the discharge or variation of a sex offender's order are welcome and I would hope these new powers will ensure many of those who are convicted of serious sexual offences will avail of the treatment and support services within the Irish Prison Service.  Many sex offenders today are rejecting treatment despite the fact that treatment services have been expanded.  Only one in eight sex offenders avails of treatment in prison even though, as I say, there has been an expansion of the capacity of the treatment services being offered to sex offenders, both in Arbour Hill and in the Midlands Prison in Laois.  According to research by the psychology unit within the Irish Prison Service, availing of those courses reduces the risk of reoffending by three and a half times.<\/p> <p> In 2009, when the Department of Justice carried out the review of the current legislation on the sentencing, treatment and monitoring of sex offenders, it recommended making early release of sex offenders conditional on their engagement with the treatment programmes.  This needs to be reflected in this legislation.  Such a system is in place in Vermont in the United State, which is one of the benchmark states globally in terms of the management of sex offenders, where sex offenders are not eligible for parole unless they have availed of treatment in prison.<\/p> <p> There is a key inadequacy in the new law before us.  While I welcome that it provides the right to information, limited though it is, and we will deal with this in more detail on Committee Stage, the big weakness in this legislation is that it fails to address both analogue and digital rights to be forgotten by convicted sex offenders.  This is a fundamental weakness in the legislation.  For the sake of the victims who have to live with the consequences of those perpetrators' actions and any potential future victims, those convicted of sexual offences should lose the right to be forgotten permanently.<\/p> <p> There are two aspects to this.  The first relates to the right to be forgotten online.  We have seen recent press coverage of activities of criminals who were behind multimillion euro vice rings being forgotten by Google following requests under the EU privacy law.  Google has also delisted news articles relating to convictions for sexual offences, including court reports on men convicted of possessing child sexual abuse material.  It is completely unacceptable that court reports are being wiped away online.  The idea behind our court system is that this takes place in public and that information is available to the public, yet here we have these guilty parties now applying for requests and exploiting the privacy laws.  That must not be tolerated.  On the operation of the right to be forgotten, the European Court of Justice decision in 2014 established the right to request that Internet search engines delist links containing information about them that is inadequate, irrelevant, no longer relevant or excessive.  I do not believe that information regarding sexual offenders falls under any of those four thresholds.  It should not be tolerated.  There is not an absolute right to be forgotten and it must be balanced against public interest factors.  It is in the public interest that that information remains available to the public because it is vital information.  We cannot airbrush away the stories of these victims.  It is wrong.  It is a further abuse of these victims.  We must ensure that will not happen.<\/p> <p> Google has defended its handling of the request to delist these articles about criminal convictions for sexual offences and organising prostitution.  It has stated it is only in compliance with the guidelines set down by the European Commission and it is doing so based on the amount of time that has passed since the article was first published.  That is not an acceptable threshold to be used to consider this.  There is relevant vital information that must remain in the public domain, not only to protect future potential victims but also to protect the rights, the narrative and the story of victims of these convicted sex offenders.<\/p> <p> The other right to be forgotten is in terms of sex offenders changing their names through deed poll.  There have been quite extensive reports in the United Kingdom where the use of deed polls has been abused by registered sex offenders to change their names, about which they do not inform the police authorities there or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na here, and they go under the radar again.  While registered sex offenders are required to notify the Garda - within seven days at present and three days after this law is enacted - of a change in name, the onus is on the sex offender to report that change in information.  That, as we know, does not work today.  Sex offenders are supposed to inform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of their address within seven days and of any subsequent change to that within seven days, and as we know, we have breach after breach, week after week, of that basic condition that is left out there at present.  As a result, people are literally disappearing off the radar by changing their names by deed poll and not informing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p> In the UK, sex offenders have in many instances changed their names without informing officials.  It is quite common for this to happen and I suspect the same is the case here in Ireland.  Sky News, in a report, found numerous cases in the British courts where names have been changed but the individuals were the same as the ones who had carried out similar offences previously.  The report goes on to talk about the case of Terry Price, who conducted a string of sexual offences over three decades and had changed his name five times in an effort to cover up his recurring pattern of behaviour.  Price was even allowed to change his name while he was in prison.<\/p> <p>We need to ensure that this law is amended to protect the victims and to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes do not have the right to be forgotten, to change their name or to try and circumvent the sex offender register, as they have consistently done up to now.<\/p> <p> I will return to the issue of disclosure.  It is great to see the change of mind on the principle of disclosure.  It is very significant that it is being put onto the Statute Book and into legislation for the first time.  I am concerned that it does not go far enough.  As the Minister will know, I published a Bill in 2012 which was accepted on Second Stage in 2013.  It provided for far more extensive disclosure that balanced the rights of parents and those protecting children and, at the same time, the rights of the convicted offender.  I hope that on Committee Stage, the Minister will revisit the wording I proposed in 2012. <\/p> <p> There has been a right to disclose to the public in the UK for a considerable time.  Disclosures about registered child sex offenders were made in just 7% of cases directly impacting on 60 children.  More interesting is that it also led to other actions, including referrals to the children's social care services, in 27% of cases.  The British Home Office research suggested that the police and other criminal justice agencies had seen benefits in the formalisation of the process, which led to the provision of increased intelligence and the provision of a better route for the public to make inquiries about their concerns.  In this country, we need to change the attitude in relation to reporting suspicious activity.  As a population, we are slow to report our concerns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we tend to leave it to somebody else.  Sometimes that decision has devastating consequences for victims.  Sadly, in many instances, we are talking about children here.<\/p> <p> I will give three examples of what I am talking about.  I put this on the record previously but I will revisit it today.  There were three incidents in counties Louth and Dublin involving strangers approaching children on streets and at playgrounds.  This highlights the need for us to look again at what type of disclosure we are prepared to introduce.  In the first case in Dunleer in County Louth, a stranger pulled alongside a playground and called out a boy's name as he played with friends.  In another incident in Monasterboice, again in County Louth, a man in a van called out to children on a Sunday afternoon.  The previous month, Garda&iacute; investigated a third case, at Lansdowne Road in Dublin, where boys of ten and 11 years of age were approached by a stranger driving a black car.  That was only reported to the Garda&iacute; some time later.  This exposes the lack of reporting of suspicious activity.  In the Dunleer incident, the individual in question had to have done some preparatory work in obtaining details about the particular child.  Did these inquiries not raise a suspicion at an earlier stage and why were they not acted upon?  It took ten days for the Dublin incident to be reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We need to send out a clear message to the public that they should report all suspicious activity.  The best way to do that is by encouraging parents to report suspicious activity on the basis of giving the garda&iacute; the right under certain limited circumstances to disclose relevant information to parents.  I believe it is important that we look at the wording of this legislation regarding disclosure.<\/p> <p>  The work I have put into having this Bill published and hopefully enacted is down to the efforts of one individual, now-retired Sergeant John Hynes, who was based in Castlerea, County Roscommon but is from County Mayo.  I want to publicly acknowledge his work in trying to progress this particular legislation.  John, who was responsible within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for enforcing and monitoring sex offenders, was so frustrated about the lack of progress in dealing with the anomalies within the current legislation that he spoke out about it and pointed out the weaknesses within the legislation.  There is no doubt that in my part of the country and many other parts of the west, there are individuals, some of whom are in prison today, who would never have been put in prison or convicted were it not for the Trojan efforts of the now-retired Sergeant John Hynes.  I refer not only to his day-to-day work and that of his Garda colleagues throughout the region, but also to the support he gave me when he helped me to progress my primary legislation in 2012.  I have continued to make efforts since then to try to bring about this legislation to reform the laws in this area.  I look forward to working with the Minister over the coming weeks.  It would be a great Christmas present to see this legislation enacted before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800044#UU00300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637251500,"counter":460,"content":"<p>As this is the European Day for the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, it is appropriate that we are discussing the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2021 today.  I thank the Minister and his officials for bringing this important legislation to the House.  I will be supporting this Bill which includes a number of important amendments to the sex offenders register notification requirements.  It also introduces provides for electronic tagging and for a prohibition on convicted sex offenders engaging in certain types of employment.  While such bans on working with children or vulnerable people have been made by the courts in the past, the Bill will now provide for an explicit power with regard to prohibition.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will address the concerns of communities around the country about the ongoing management of convicted sex offenders in the community.  It introduces stricter notification requirements on offenders, will allow for electronic monitoring in certain circumstances and will explicitly prohibit convicted sex offenders from working with children or vulnerable people.  The Bill fulfils commitments in Justice Plan 2021 and in the programme for Government to update the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to ensure convicted sex offenders are effectively managed and monitored.  The publication of the Bill is an action in the second national strategy for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.<\/p>  <p>  The key features in this Bill include a change to require sex offenders moving location to notify authorities within three days rather than seven days.  It explicitly provides for the court to prohibit a sex offender from working with children and vulnerable adults.  It provides powers to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take fingerprints, palm prints and photographs to confirm the identity of the person.  It creates a legislative basis for the assessment and management of risk posed by sex offenders across teams involving probation officers, garda&iacute; and Tusla.  It allows the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to disclose information relating to persons on the sex offender register, in extenuating circumstances, for example where there is a serious threat to public safety.  It allows the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply for the discharge or variation of a sex offender order.  <\/p> <p>It also allows, as mentioned, for electronic monitoring of sex offenders to assist in ensuring an offender&rsquo;s compliance with a sex offender order or post-release supervision order.<\/p> <p> The latest numbers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na show there are 1,708 persons currently subject to the reporting requirements of Part 2 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  Included in that figure is a total of 319 sex offenders being supervised by the Probation Service currently living in the community.  There are 192 such offenders on post-release supervision in the community by the Probation Service.  The remainder are notifying at Garda stations.  In addition to those currently subject to the reporting requirements, there are 433 people in custody having been convicted of a sex offence since 2001 who will be subject to reporting restrictions on release.<\/p> <p> The Bill places the current sex offenders risk and assessment and management, SORAM, monitoring process for high-risk offenders on a statutory footing.  This is particularly welcome.  SORAM involves the joint management of sex offenders by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service with the involvement of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, where there are child protection concerns and with other agencies where necessary.  I hope SORAM can address some of the issues Deputy Naughten just spoke about, especially those relating to the identity and the onus on the sex offender to notify garda&iacute;.  Hopefully that is something the Minister of State can take up on Committee Stage when the time comes.  SORAM currently operates on a non-statutory basis.  The Bill also provides a power to garda&iacute; to disclose information about a sex offender&rsquo;s previous convictions to a member or members of the public where the offender poses a risk of causing further harm.  The purpose of proposals relating to SORAM and the proposals on the disclosure of information relating to sex offenders is specifically to provide a legislative underpinning to the current administrative processes.<\/p> <p> Many of the provisions in this Bill are welcome.  They will update legislation in this area and help to protect women, children and vulnerable people in our community.  However, I believe this Bill could go further.  I would like to see restrictions on travel abroad, for example.  Currently, where there is good co-operation between police forces and there are high child protection standards, such as in Northern Ireland, the UK and across much of Europe, the safeguarding policies work well.  Sadly though, this is not the case in many countries such as Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, to name a few.  They are struggling to deal with the issues of sex tourism, trafficking and exploitation, despite the best efforts of many local agencies, campaigners and elected representatives in those jurisdictions.  The Minister of State will be aware that last month I reintroduced the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2018 which seeks to give courts the option of issuing restrictions on travel when passing sentence.  I ask the Minister of State to consider amendments on Committee Stage which might strengthen this Bill and provide for travel restrictions on sex offenders.  I believe it is linked to the intention of this Bill and ask the Minister of State and the officials to take that on board and examine the request.<\/p> <p> I appreciate all the work the Minister of State and the officials have done to progress this legislation.  I hope Deputies from right across the House will support this positive legislation which will help to safeguard women, children and vulnerable people in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800046#WW00200","speaker":"1481","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637252100,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for bringing forward the Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting it.  It is not before time that we see the 2001 Act being updated.  To go 20 years without updating it is far too long.  It must be noted that these amendments were originally introduced in 2018.  Pre-legislative scrutiny was completed in January 2019.  It has been a very slow process.  I hope that will not be repeated when it comes to ensuring the measures we are talking about are properly resourced and initiated for the sake of everyone in our communities.  I welcome long-awaited reforms that would help our children and more vulnerable people to feel safer.  The Bill also addresses some real omissions inherent in the original Act.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill contains a provision to empower the courts to prohibit an offender from working with vulnerable people and children.  To be honest, I find it difficult to accept this is only being attended to 20 years on, but it is a much-needed change to a key failure of the original Act and is again long overdue.  As matters stand, the offender is only required to disclose their conviction and sex offender order to an employer.  The responsibility was on the Judiciary to include restrictions on access to children or vulnerable people at sentencing.  While I understand the courts have ruled on cases like this in the past, I am glad to see we are now talking about an amendment that would give certainty to the powers of the courts in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments also introduce a reduction from seven days to three days for those subject to a sex offender order to register a change of address with the Garda.  Given the possibility these offenders could be relocating to an area in the vicinity of a location which is profoundly unsuitable, being allowed seven days to let the Garda know of a change of address was far too long.  While I welcome reducing this to three days, I believe it has been said here before that garda&iacute; should be informed immediately of even the intention to move residence.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to the monitoring of sex offenders, it is my hope, which I must indeed demand, that the resources our garda&iacute; need to implement the much-needed changes in this Bill are provided without any need for pressure from the organisations working out there on a daily basis, or indeed from the Opposition benches in this House.  This applies to the provision of electronic monitoring or tagging.  This amendment is to ensure post-release compliance by offenders who are subject to a sex offender order.  Again, this will only work if the ICT system in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is adequately resourced.  This call for resources has been made by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, which says an increase in spending on Garda ICT is needed to support the full roll-out of the amendments.  It is important this sits against the backdrop of the meagre funding for Garda ICT units since they were first introduced in the late 1990s.  I appreciate some of the funding has been made available in budget 2022 but any clarity on where that funding will be spent would be greatly appreciated.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, there is no excuse for sexual assault.  Sometimes we see reports that imply some fault on the part of a victim of sexual violence or rape because of his or her consumption of alcohol or some other substance.  This is rubbish.  References of this kind, whether explicit or implied, must be rejected no matter who utters such rubbish.  Nobody asks to be sexually assaulted or raped.  This crime is committed by the perpetrator.  The victim is not at fault.  As Deputy Ward said earlier this week, the only person at fault in these circumstances is the rapist.  The more this is understood, and the alternative myths done away with, the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800047#XX00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1637252100,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Like everybody else who has spoken I regard sexual offences as heinous crimes which are exceptionally damaging to society, which is why we punish them as crimes, and to individuals.  These offences leave a long-lasting mark on the victims.  I can understand some of the calls in the Chamber for far greater punishment of perpetrators in that regard.  Nevertheless, I have a couple of questions about the Bill.  It might not be very fashionable at the moment but I still think it necessary to tease out legislation and do what we intend to do and not do that which we do not intend to do.<\/p>  <p>  The first question I have is where the impetus for this Bill is coming from.  All Ministers and especially, I suppose, Ministers for Justice want to punish evil and promote good, particularly in these times.  I am yet to meet a politician who did not say up with good and down with evil, but where is the impetus coming from?  Is it coming from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Has the Garda said it needs additional powers to deal with this matter?  Has the Probation Service called for these additional powers?  If not, where are these provisions coming from?  It is important to determine where they are coming from so we can figure out how well they are going to be implemented or what the likelihood of their successful implementation is.  I ask that this question be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I have looked at another provision of the Bill - section 5, which provides that the principal Act is amended by the insertion of a new section 3A after section 3.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111800047#XX00300","speaker":"1518"}]
