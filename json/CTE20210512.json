We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee today to discuss the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018.  As the committee is aware, licensed moneylenders are regulated under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, which sets out the specific regulatory regime for this sector, including provisions reflecting particular features of this sector and, in particular, the high cost of this type of credit.  The Central Bank assumed responsibility for licensing and supervising moneylenders in 2003, when responsibility transferred from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  We fulfil this role within the parameters of the legislative regime.  Under the legislation, any firm involved in moneylending activity requires a licence from the Central Bank, which must be renewed every year.  In line with our mandate, working to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy, we maintain a proactive and focused approach in supervising the sector, ensuring that the requirements imposed on the sector continue to be effective and provide suitable protections for consumers.<\/p> <p>  There are currently 35 moneylenders licensed to operate in Ireland.  The business model operated by licensed moneylenders generally falls within the following categories: home collection firms, firms operating a catalogue business model and other firms, including firms providing credit to fund gym membership, insurance premiums, etc., and firms involved in the provision of goods on credit.  Licensed moneylenders are required to carry out their business under the specific terms of their licence.  We have not permitted a maximum APR or costs charged within the sector to increase.  In line with our gatekeeping responsibilities, we have not allowed practices such as pay-day lending to enter the Irish licensed moneylending market.<\/p> <p>  There is a strong consumer protection framework in place for consumers who choose to use the services of licensed moneylenders.  Consumers are protected by a range of provisions that moneylenders must adhere to, including the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, the (Licensed Moneylenders) Regulations 2020, the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010 and the Consumer Credit Act 1995, all of which include additional provisions specific to the moneylending sector.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the protections provided under these regulations, there are important protections provided for in legislation that mean licensed moneylenders are prohibited from applying additional charges, including in the event of default or non-payment by the customer.  Therefore, a customer can never be asked to pay more than the total amount payable as stated on the moneylending agreement.  Moneylenders are also required to undertake a creditworthy assessment before entering into a moneylending agreement with the consumer.  We have made, and set out, our clear expectations to all credit providers, including licensed moneylenders, that they lend responsibly and act at all times in the best interests of the consumers.<\/p> <p>  Last year, following an extensive public consultation process, we introduced new regulations, which replaced the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders, to further strengthen protections for consumers of the licensed moneylending sector and to enhance professional standards in this sector.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the existing requirements, moneylenders are now required to include prominent, high-cost warnings in all advertisements for moneylending loans with an APR of more than 23%.  The warning must also prompt consumers to consider alternatives.<\/p> <p>  Moneylenders may not be permitted to make unsolicited offers to apply for credit to consumers who have recently made, or are nearing, full repayment of a moneylending loan.  There is a limit on moneylenders&rsquo; contact with consumers and a limit the offer and promotions of loans to consumers.  Where a loan is required for basic needs, such as accommodation or electricity, moneylenders will be required to inform the consumer that a moneylending loan may not be in their best interest and to provide contact information for the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  There are also new requirements for staff and agents working in the sector, designed to enhance their professional standards.<\/p> <p>  While the regulations came into effect on 1 January 2021, due to the financial impact of Covid-19, the high-cost warning requirements in respect to advertisements for moneylending loans with an APR in excess of 23% came into effect earlier, from 1 September 2020.  We assertively supervise this sector, taking supervisory and enforcement action, where required, to protect consumers&rsquo; interests.  Compliance is required through supervision initially and at annual licensing processes.  Applying the fitness and probity regime, we undertake thematic and firm-specific inspections and engagements, we undertake market monitoring, we conduct consumer-based research and we monitor industry trends, including complaints made to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman of Ireland, FSBO.<\/p> <p>  In respect to the new proposed legislation, the Central Bank is supportive of all initiatives that seek to enhance existing protections for consumers in the moneylending sector.  The Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018, as drafted, proposes to place a cap of 36% of APR charged by moneylenders, which could present some specific challenges.  Moneylender loans are generally short term in nature.  Their cost and the associated APR can be very high when compared to other forms of credit.  APRs may appear to be extremely high on short-term loans when compared to the actual cost of credit over the longer term.  Therefore, lowering the APR may be ineffective and counterproductive and not achieve the objective of lowering the total cost of credit if, for instance, a moneylender chooses instead to extend the duration of the loan, resulting in the consumer paying more over the longer duration of the loan.<\/p><p>Neither the 1995 Act nor the regulations provides for an interest rate cap, nor does the 1995 Act define \"excessive\" in the context of interest rates.  The Central Bank, therefore, has no statutory power to impose a market-wide cap on rates, and the introduction of an interest rate cap would require a legislative amendment.  Any legislative proposals seeking to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit to customers of moneylenders should be calibrated to ensure no unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion.<\/p><p> Our focus has been on improving the transparency of these costs and increasing consumer awareness by setting of requirements such as the need to warn customers about the high-cost nature of loans and to disclose all the fees, costs and interest in a clear manner prior to entering into the moneylending contract.  Our public register of licensed moneylenders also sets out product details such as the maximum APR, maximum cost of credit and collection charges, if applied.<\/p><p> One of the challenges in considering rates charged by moneylenders is finding a balance between the availability of credit for consumers who do not have access to regulated credit elsewhere or who do not use other regulated credit providers and the provision of short-term unsecured loans which can be at a high cost.  For small amounts of credit and for those consumers with an impaired credit history, there may be limited alternative credit options available to them from regulated credit providers.<\/p><p> We have concerns regarding the proposed legislation as currently drafted.  Any legislative proposal imposing such a cap would have to be carefully considered to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit and to ensure unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion do not arise.  We recommend an assessment of the impact on consumers should be undertaken to inform this approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021051200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620774000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms McEvoy to the committee to discuss this legislation which I tabled a number of years ago.

Right across the breadth of the Central Bank, we protect the interests of consumers.  As the Deputy will be aware, our mandate is quite broad.  If we think about our role in terms of financial stability and the proper and effective functioning of the wider economy, any regime we have in place is ultimately to ensure the interests of consumers are protected by a well-functioning market and a well-functioning economy.  If you look to our prudential mandate, we ensure firms meet very high standards, are adequately resourced in terms of capital and are solvent.  That is to ensure they are in a position, for example, if I think of insurance firms, to pay out on policies or, if you are engaging in dealing with a bank, that your deposits are safe.<\/p> <p>  If you look to our consumer protection mandate, our core objective is to ensure firms act at all times in the best interests of consumers and treat their consumers fairly.  This is to ensure the regime we impose supervises these firms to ensure they do so and there are adequate and robust consumer protections in place in terms of our regulations and guidelines.<\/p> <p>  That, in turn, leads me to our role in terms of policy-setting.  We actively engage at a European level to enhance and support strong measures for the protections of consumers.  Similarly, at a domestic level, we will engage with the committee and other colleagues to ensure the domestic regime supports the protection of consumers and meets that desired objective.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the fifth component of our mandate extends to enforcement action.  If we find that firms operating in Ireland, or indeed on a cross-Border basis, are not acting in the consumers' best interests, and we have many cases where we have taken strong decisions in enforcement using our administrative sanction powers where we believe firms were not acting fairly or were not treating their customers fairly, right across the breadth of the Central Bank's mandate we seek to ensure the best interests of consumers are protected.  Therefore, I do not see there to be a conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021051200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy"},{"type":"speech","time":1620774000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>In the paper published by Ms Mary Faherty, Dr. Olive McCarthy and Dr. Noreen Byrne of UCC in December 2008, co-sponsored by the Central Bank, and entitled Interest Rate Restrictions on Credit for Low-income Borrowers, they recommended a policy which \"prohibits usurious rates of interest\".

From our perspective, the approach we have taken has been very much around transparency and increasing awareness.  We have also imposed quite a lot of requirements on moneylending firms in terms of how they engage and interact with consumers in terms of being proportionate, being aware of their marketing strategy and engaging in a sympathetic manner with consumers who are experiencing financial distress.<\/p> <p>  We can stand over the regime we have.

The important measure to look at in this context would be the total cost of credit for the customer because there are unintended consequences, as I outlined in the opening statement, in terms of a straightforward and clean cap.  In the legislation as currently drafted and in the regulations, the Central Bank has imposed a big degree of clarity for the customer about the total cost of credit over the length of time he or she is borrowing so that a person knows from the credit agreement right at the outset what he or she has borrowed, and if he or she is paying it back in the short term, on average nine months, exactly what it will cost by the time he or she has paid back the loan.  Furthermore, there is clarity in terms of the provisions of the law that do not allow customers who perhaps have defaulted through no fault of their own or are late in meeting a repayment to be subject to additional penalties or charges in that context.<br\/><br\/>From our perspective, it is a complex issue.  It is something that would require careful consideration.  The better way of looking at things might be in terms of the total cost of credit to the customer because a cap might mean the duration of the loan is extended far beyond and you end up paying much more for your initial &euro;200, &euro;300 or &euro;400 drawdown of the loan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021051200002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy"},{"type":"speech","time":1620774000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The question I had was not whether Ms McEvoy supports a cap but whether she supports, as the report outlined, a restriction on interest rates and charges which can be in the form of the total cost of credit.

Is the consumer protection division of the Central Bank in favour of restrictions on interest rates and charges which, as Ms McEvoy has outlined, may be in the way of the cost of credit?  It is all well and good the Central Bank ensuring moneylenders tell their customers upfront they are screwing them, but we want Ms McEvoy's views on whether perhaps they should not be screwing them in the first place and we need to impose restrictions.

For example, as I noted, the law does not give the Central Bank the powers to impose a cap.  However, in our supervision of the moneylending sector, encompassing new entrants and existing providers launching new products, we have ensured we have intervened where we felt the APR was excessive.  We have had success in that regard with firms reducing their APRs or, indeed, removing a product from the market.  In addition, from the outset when we took over responsibility, we restricted and never allowed payday lending, which is a feature of the UK moneylending sector.  <\/p><p> A proportionate, measured and considered response must be taken in respect of interventions, because I do not believe the Deputy or we in the Central Bank would want a situation where interventions were such that they perhaps resulted in people not having access to regulated financial services and not having the protections afforded by the Central Bank under its consumer protection regime.

The rates are commercial decisions determined by the institution offering the services in Ireland.  That rate is up to the maximum, and the range is from 17% to 187%.  There are two other important points in this regard.  First, if we look at the UK regime, it has imposed a cap on the total cost of credit of 100% for a moneylending loan of up to one year.  In comparison, in the Irish market the total cost of credit in that context for loans from providers for up to one year is 56%.  That is a little over half the rate applied under the UK model.  Second, taking the APRs for periods up to three years, the average is 76%.

Ms McEvoy said it is a commercial decision.  She also made the point that the Central Bank can reject these proposals and it has done so in the past.  Therefore, the Central Bank deemed an APR of 187% appropriate in this case, and collection charges then further push up the cost of credit.  This legislation is about restricting that level of APR and it is intended to be achieved through a multiplier of the cost of credit in the market.  That is what my proposal would be on Committee Stage.  Does Ms McEvoy believe it would be appropriate to restrict that type of cost of credit, or does she, as the director of consumer protection in the Central Bank, actually regard an APR of 187% as what we need in the market in that case?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021051200002#C00600","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620774000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I reiterate those are the commercial decisions of the lenders.  We can intervene where the law states those are \"excessive\", but it does not define what that term means.  I reiterate the point that a proportionate and measured approach must be taken.  We could put a cap on an APR, as I mentioned, but that could turn out to be counterproductive because the moneylender could then extend the duration of the loan.  In that case, the borrower would be paying back much more over a longer time.  Therefore, it is necessary to give a great deal of consideration to the potential impact of putting a cap in place.  As I also mentioned, it is also important to note that we do not want a situation where in some instances the customers of moneylenders may not have access to regulated credit elsewhere, be that through a credit union or bank.  Some customers of moneylenders do have that line of credit available, but some do not.

My intention, therefore, is that the cap would be a multiplier of the cost of credit in the market.  Can the Central Bank provide the committee with information regarding the cost of credit for short-term loans from the retail banks and credit unions?  Is it possible for the Central Bank to do that?  For example, could it be done for loan terms of zero to 12 weeks, 12 to 26 weeks and then 26 to 52 weeks, to enable us to use that information in our consideration of this legislation on Committee Stage?  Is it possible then for legislation that would allow, for example, moneylenders to charge up to three times the cost of credit in the market, as defined by the Central Bank at any given point in time?

I appreciate that.  It would be helpful if the Central Bank could gather that information for the committee.<\/p> <p>  Moneylenders have adapted their methods, which are extremely costly.  Door-to-door collection, for example, is very labour intensive.  The moneylender firms achieve high collection rates, but it also results in other issues, such as the rolling over of loans.  Ms McEvoy will be familiar with the fact that I, along with six whistle-blowers, brought information to the Central Bank regarding the main moneylender in the State and the Central Bank subsequently made a significant finding against that firm as a result.  That type of situation results from the intergenerational relationship and dependency that builds up in that context.  The moneylender gets to know the family and gets to know that communion day is coming up for young S&iacute;ofra or Donal, for example, and sells a loan to the family as a result.  In most cases, the people concerned will have access to lower interest finance through the credit unions or elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  The model has been adapted, therefore, because Covid-19 has resulted in no door-to-door collections.  Many of the customers of moneylenders are now making online payments and, as a result, costs are reduced.  Is now not the time, if ever there was a good time, to examine how we deal with high costs of credit?  There has been adaptation and the model is basically up in the air now.  It could, however, go back to the way it was once Covid-19 restrictions end.  The other option is that we could change the moneylending model into one that is less labour intensive and with lower costs, and, therefore, reduce the cost for consumers.  I would like Ms McEvoy's view on that point.  <\/p> <p>  My other question concerns the issue of Provident, which has ceased doorstep lending from this week.  It has a significant market share.  What is Ms McEvoy's view regarding the Department publishing the promised legislation to increase the cap that currently exists on credit unions?

However, on the level of principle we have no objection to it.<\/p> <p>  There is quite a lot in the Deputy's first point.  I agree with much of what he said, in the sense that Covid-19 has certainly impacted on the door-to-door model of moneylending.  Even more recently, we are seeing trends emerging where consumers are interacting with all financial services firms in a more digital manner.  Covid-19 expedited some of that as well.  There is an argument to be made that there are many different types of customers of moneylenders, and the Deputy alluded to some based on his knowledge and experience.  There are people who have good existing relationships with other forms of lenders, but they use moneylenders as an additional form.  There are those who are, perhaps, less fortunate and have been refused credit elsewhere and a moneylender is their only source of access to regulated finance or credit.  The Deputy asked if now is a good time.  As I said, we would be very supportive of examining any enhancements that strengthen the protections for consumers of moneylenders.  Our approach has always been that we will do so.  In our view, we have kept our regulatory and legislative regime up to date.  We have been clear about expectations.  We reacted to some of the examples the Deputy mentioned in terms of repeat lending to customers who are still on loans and so forth.  That is prohibited under the regulations we introduced last year.  From our perspective, we are very much in favour of a proportionate, but robust, regulatory model.<\/p> <p>  However, it is important to take into account that there are other key stakeholders in Ireland that should feed into this process.  We have been involved with colleagues from the Department of Social Protection, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, Abhaile, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and many others on the high cost of credit working group so we are very happy to participate in any initiative like that.  We are supportive of the objective it is trying to achieve.  We have also engaged with the Department of Finance over the years on different proposals it put forward.  To echo the point, we would be very supportive of initiatives that seek to enhance protections for consumers in a proportionate and measured way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021051200002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy"},{"type":"speech","time":1620774000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I have final questions on this for Ms McEvoy.  With her indulgence, it is straying from the issue of moneylenders and relates to her other role in consumer protection.  I have two questions on the insurance issue.  The issue of business interruption has not gone away.  Many are still complaining about it.  How satisfied is the Central Bank that all insurance policies it has deemed should be paid out are being paid, or does it believe that some case have to be tested in the courts before some final determinations can be made?  Perhaps she would also quantify that.<\/p> <p>  Second, a massive number of people are just scratching their heads and wondering what is happening.  After a long period, the Judicial Council Act 2019 was passed by the Oireachtas.  The judges have done their work.  They have reduced the cost of claims and the cost of awards is now officially reduced by 60% for minor recoverable injuries, yet we hear from businesses that their premiums are increasing and motorists who are renewing their policies are not getting the reductions that were promised by the industry.  Representatives of the industry appeared before this committee and told us bluntly, and we do not know if the figures are right, that if we are not seeing a 20% reduction, we need to be asking some serious questions.  That was based on a 50% reduction; the personal injury guidelines went further than that.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Central Bank and the consumer protection role, what action is the bank taking?  Does the Central Bank have the ability to collect the data to ensure the euro for euro reduction in the level of awards that are being paid from now on has been passed on to the consumer, as opposed to just seeing the reduction in insurance premiums that might be happening from another factor that is not related to claims?  I make that point because when the British Government introduced legislation to cut the cost of whiplash injuries it passed a law to ensure that the insurance companies had to report to its central bank that the cost of premiums reduced in line with the reduction in awards.  As Ms McEvoy knows, the six largest insurance companies in Britain are also the six largest insurance companies in Ireland.  They have expectations that they must live up to in Britain in ensuring that the awards are passed on, which they do not have here.  Does the Central Bank have the ability to collect those data at that granular level and, rather than telling me or the public that insurance premiums have reduced by 4% or 5%, to know exactly that, euro for euro in terms of the awards that have come down, the reduction has been passed on to consumers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021051200002#D00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620774000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>There was a good deal in both questions so I hope I recall them correctly.  First, with regard to business interruption insurance, from the outset we identified this as a key risk.  As the Deputy knows, under Covid-19 we were prompt and acted very quickly regarding our expectations of insurers, setting those out clearly in March 2020 and developing the supervisory framework.  We were clear in the framework that if there was any ambiguity, the insurer must at all times err on the side of the customer.  That is an important point.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about test cases, we were clear that where individuals took test cases against insurers we expected that they would not be out of pocket as a result, that the insurer would be required to pay reasonable costs and, importantly, that the decision taken by the courts in the test case would be applied to all impacted customers, not just those who took the test case at the outset.  Since the courts have opined and made certain rulings on the issue of business interruption, our key priority for last year and carried forward into this year is to ensure that firms are honouring and meeting our expectations.  We have a dedicated team across multiple different skill sets in the Central Bank that is actively engaging with all firms that offer business interruption insurance and ensuring that they are meeting our expectations with regard to customer engagement and our expectation that if it is clear the cover is provided, they pay and pay promptly.  If they are awaiting decisions of the court relating to quantum, interim payments are made in lieu of or in anticipation of final authority being provided by the judge in the court.  I reiterate the point that any ambiguity errs on the side of the customer.  They are important principles enshrined in our supervisory framework for business interruption.  We continue to monitor and supervise.  We have had good engagement with the sector.  We know from our engagement with individual customers as well that the sector is meeting our expectations in many cases.  However, this is something that will span a longer period.  It will certainly span 2021.  I stress that it is a key area of supervisory focus for the Central Bank, and that will continue.  That is the first point.<\/p> <p>  On the second point, I may take that question away.  I know, for example, that there is quite a lot of information floating around relating to insurance and claims.  We have a national claims database, and there is quite a lot in terms of judicial review.  To give the Deputy a more accurate response, if I may I will take that question away and commit to reverting to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021051200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy"},{"type":"speech","time":1620774000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Has the Deputy concluded?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021051200002#D00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1620774000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Yes.

We have published findings on the outcomes of those thematic inspections and those findings will be in the form of a \"Dear CEO\" letter, which would send a wide message across a sector as to our expectations and findings.

The primary purpose of today's meeting is for us to hear the view of the Central Bank on the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill.  My understanding is that it welcomes proposals to protect consumers but has two concerns.  First, it is concerned that lowering the APR may be ineffective and counter-productive and may not lower the total cost of credit.  The second concern is that it may lead to financial exclusion.  In respect of the first concern, what type of legislation does the Central Bank believe would be appropriate in lowering the total cost of credit in the circumstances we are discussing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021051200002#G00900","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620774000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  To reiterate the point, we would support any legislative regime that strengthens and enhances protections for consumers.  As I mentioned earlier, we do not have the legislative power to impose a cap.  Any imposition of a cap would be a matter for lawmakers and politicians in that context.<\/p> <p>  I understand from the discussion earlier with Deputy Doherty that the proposals set out in the original Bill are being revised.  To look at APR in isolation could be ineffective and counter-productive, as Deputy O'Callaghan said.  A cap might, in one sense, provide one degree of stability but that can easily be circumvented by extending the duration of the loan.  In the long term a customer may pay back a loan over a longer term than he or she would in other circumstances.  That can often be the byproduct of the imposition of a cap. <\/p> <p>  Any proposals around this should be considered at a holistic level by all relevant stakeholders across Ireland.  We have undertaken quite a bit of research in terms of workshops with industry in 2018 and with Am&aacute;rach Research in 2013. T he UK has done quite a bit of work on the whole area of APR and their understanding and meaning, in particular in the context of high cost credit loans. <\/p> <p>  I do not have an alternative proposal, but I would caution that a proportionate and measured approach be taken.  The certainty afforded to the total cost of credit regime supports a borrower because he or she knows at the outset what he or she is borrowing and what it is going to cost.<\/p><p>As I mentioned earlier, the existing framework does not allow for the charging of late or default charges, which is an important protection for consumers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021051200002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620774000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Does Ms McEvoy believe that legislation is the appropriate and preferable way to ensure that we can lower the total cost of credit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021051200002#H00200","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620774000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>To be honest, that is a tricky one.

We are very much in the space of greater transparency and greater disclosure to empower consumers and make them aware that this is a high cost of credit and that there are supports elsewhere in the system if needed; to ensure rigour and additional regulation around firms to signal that these are high-cost loans; and to ensure the firms have appropriate marketing strategies that are not marketed at certain groups of customers.  We try to ensure that companies do not issue loans, or give pre-approval or pre-credit for a new loan, to a customer who is already paying off an existing loan.

Some customers will have been refused credit already by the traditional banks or credit unions, or they may have a poor credit history and would not be granted further credit by those institutions.  They may have no other option than to secure sources of credit provided by moneylenders.  My expectation and my wish would be that every consumer in Ireland, at all times, deals and engages with a regulated financial service provider where they have the full suite of protections afforded to them through the Central Bank's regime in this context.

Behind Bainne Beatha, our campaign for improved breastfeeding support services in Irish maternity units, are four working mothers: me, Megan Etherton, Lucia Prihodova and Felicienne Rahill.  We launched in February 2021, and are running this in our spare time without funding or political affiliations.  We are not a breast is best group.  We respect a parent&rsquo;s choice to formula, combination or breastfeed.  However, the Irish maternity service does not appear consistently to support those who wish to breastfeed.<br\/><br\/>We hear often about Ireland&rsquo;s breastfeeding rates being the lowest in Europe, but there is judgement of mothers in that language.  Mothers in Ireland know about the importance of breastfeeding, and according to the Irish Maternity Indicator System, IMIS, report, at 63.8%, the majority of them do initiate breastfeeding, but by the time they leave the hospital, this figure is almost halved to 37.3%.  What happens in those days between birth and discharge from the hospital?  Our report, personal experiences and the stories we have heard since launching provide some insight into the reasons behind this sharp decline.  We would like to share some of those insights with the committee and five key asks of our Government and action by the Houses of the Oireachtas to make vital interventions.<br\/><br\/>From our report, 37% of mothers reported that midwives were too busy and overworked to provide the assistance needed.  A quote:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI have had 3 babies and while the hospital did support breastfeeding, I never saw a lactation consultant despite requests each time.  I was a section mum so in for several days - never available.  Saying you support is not the same as providing hands-on support. Midwives were v good but v busy with everything else. <\/blockquote> <p>I also experienced this on the birth of my first child.  Therefore our first ask is for adequate staffing, and for the number of international board-certified lactation consultants to be increased in line with international benchmarks and to be accessible in all Irish maternity units.<br\/><br\/>One in three mothers in our report received conflicting advice about how to breastfeed.  One respondent said that &quot;All of the midwives said different things which was really hard to filter through as a new mother&quot;.  I too faced conflicting advice during my time in hospital.  Our second ask is to see mandatory evidence-based continuing professional development on breastfeeding for midwives and certified lactation consultants.<br\/><br\/>In our report, one in three mothers were offered formula despite stating their wishes to breastfeed.  One mother wrote, &quot;New mothers shouldn&rsquo;t need an advocate to defend their intention to breastfeed, fending off formula or conflicting advice from the 'experts' when they are exhausted and post partum in the middle of their baby&rsquo;s first night.&quot;  I too left the hospital formula-feeding my baby against my wishes.  Our third ask is a national audit of the implementation of the national infant feeding policy for maternity and neonatal services, and a review of the promotion and distribution of formula practices across all maternity units.<br\/><br\/>The national maternity experience survey of 2020 results showed 47.3% of women did not know how to give feedback or make a complaint about their maternity care.  Therefore our fourth ask is for the national maternity experience survey to expand to evaluate comprehensively service user experiences of breastfeeding support in maternity care, and to have service user representation on the national breastfeeding implementation group for current and future action plans.<br\/><br\/>In our report, we found 60% of mothers sought help with breastfeeding privately, spending an average of &euro;440.  I personally had to spend almost &euro;700 to be able to breastfeed after a difficult experience in hospital.  Maternity units can be a level playing field, offering a great opportunity to reach a cross section of the 60,000 plus women who give birth in Ireland each year and to extend the opportunity to anyone who wishes to breastfeed.  Therefore our final and most important ask is for the full implementation and assessment of the breastfeeding action plan to ensure proactive, skilled, timely breastfeeding assistance for mothers and babies, regardless of location, demographic or ability to pay.<br\/><br\/>There are amazing midwives, public health nurses, voluntary support groups, including Cuidi&uacute;, representatives of which are present today, and lactation consultants who manage to save mothers&rsquo; breastfeeding journeys after their difficult experience in hospital.  However, thousands are falling through the net every year, bringing about added potential health risks for mothers and their babies.  Not investing in this crucial period is a sure-fire way to guarantee we are cutting our breastfeeding rates within hours of birth.  We need to flip the narrative which blames mothers and instead address low breastfeeding support rates in Ireland.  Breastfeeding is a component of the national maternity strategy, the strategy on women and girls from the Department of Justice, the national obesity plan and the national cancer plan.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party identified breastfeeding as a priority in the programme for Government and we would like to see them honour this commitment.<br\/><br\/>We are grateful for the opportunity to be able to share these stories with the committee.  Now we are looking for the full implementation of what has been promised in the national maternity strategy and the breastfeeding action plan.  Breastfeeding reduces risks of multiple health issues for mothers and babies and they deserve the protection of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021051200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Deborah Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1620774000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Byrne and ask Ms Cahill to give Cuidi&uacute;'s opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021051200002#A00600","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620774000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Breastfeeding is one of the smartest investments a country can make to build its future prosperity.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I should say that breastfeeding is something close to my heart and I have nursed four children through various mechanisms because of different influences.  I will come back to that as we go through the questions.<\/p> <p>  I agree that choice is key but that choice must be fully informed.  The education should start before a woman becomes pregnant or a baby is born.  At a much younger age we should educate women about breastfeeding and how it can fit into a lifestyle, along with the difficulties it may present.  Having a baby disrupts a lifestyle as people may know it.  We can accept that and the universal health benefits to both the baby and the mother.<\/p> <p>  There is now a position where women are leaving hospitals, where most births take place, much earlier than they would have before.  That golden window of time and the first few days before a woman's milk comes in fully are absolutely key.  If there is no support or ineffective support, we will simply not have the level of breastfeeding we want to see and we need to see taken at that early stage.  The more women we have breastfeeding at the start clearly leads to higher rates of longer term breastfeeding.  That is a question that must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I had conversations with various people before coming here this morning but I know from personal experience that we must see a societal shift in how we view, support and encourage breastfeeding mothers and remove some of the barriers that exist.  Another Deputy told me yesterday of her experience breastfeeding, and I told her how I nursed one of my children on the floor of a shopping centre, which was unacceptable.  That is an example of a real barrier that could be quite easily challenged or changed.  Again, it would rely on a societal shift.<\/p> <p>  We can consider the professional needs that exist, including lactation consultants, counsellors and peer support, and they must be matched on the other side with a societal shift in how we view breastfeeding.  I agree with Ms Byrne that we need an audit of the infant feeding policies of hospitals.  I would like to see formula being offered as opposed to being the predominantly accepted way in which a mother would feed a child.  It absolutely should be there and there is a role for it but it should be available on request.  Many more women would breastfeed if they knew they would be fully supported from those very early days right through whatever length of time they chose to nurse their children.<\/p> <p>  We must also have a review of our tax system to go with that.  We need to look at how it is we apply VAT to the likes of hospital-grade breast pumps, breast pads and nipple guards.  These are all tools to help a woman breastfeed for longer.  We do not acknowledge they exist and we certainly do not encourage women to use them.  Although we acknowledge there is a problem, we need to get to the point where women know they exist.<\/p> <p>  I say this as a woman whose second child was in the special care baby unit, SCBU, and due to various medical influences at the time, I was pumping and dumping.  I never knew I could hire a hospital-grade breast pump until somebody happened to mention it to me in passing.  It is a question for us to consider.  When we look to address these challenges and encourage women, we must be more varied in our thinking and have a more multifaceted approach to how we do this.  When we identify a challenge or barrier, we must approach it with evidence-based and target-based outcomes for what we want to see.<\/p> <p>  I spoke to a number of providers of breastfeeding support equipment and it was interesting that their view is the practice must be more accessible with better uptake.  When a woman experiences a problem without support or education, the first reaction is to stop, which presents a real challenge.  It is something we should take on board and listen to women about.<\/p> <p>  We must challenge the information and disinformation out there.  There is a lot of information bandied about and some of it is based on tutti-frutti or pie-in-the-sky type of stuff, and that must be challenged.  We must also actively promote the positive aspects of breastfeeding, which are varied.  When we speak of breastfeeding we tend to concentrate on the challenges but there are many positive aspects of breastfeeding.<\/p> <p>  We also need to see a network of professional supports.  Community healthcare organisations, CHOs, were mentioned and mine runs from Westmeath to Louth, so I ask for a significantly greater network than asking a woman in Westmeath to travel to Drogheda.  These networks must be accessible, fit for purpose and almost tailored to what a lady needs.  No two women encountering difficulties with breastfeeding will have the same problem, so such networks must be professional and easily accessible.  The people involved must be aware of a lady's need.<\/p> <p>  GPs and public health nurses are wonderful people but they must have more education and be aware of the supports in the communities in which they work.  When they encounter a lady experiencing difficulties, they should be able to refer her to the support groups, even if they are peer support groups.  They should also put the idea in the mind of a lady who is doing well that she might be able to encourage other women in her network who might be struggling a little bit.  We must have greater education around the supports and ask those who are doing well to relay their experience and perhaps promote breastfeeding.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see a new mother pack for every new mother in the country.  This would be a small pack with various travel-sized bits and pieces.  In that pack there should be more information on breastfeeding.  It could include a couple of breast pads or a nipple protector.  Something along those lines should be included in those packs.  This recognises there are women breastfeeding, feeding with formula or a combination of both.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their time as this has been a very informative discussion.

A big section of our organisation is antenatal education and we also give postnatal support.  Cuidi&uacute; sees community care and continuity of care as important.  As the Deputy and Ms Cahill have said, this is about information, and if mums do not have the information, they cannot be in a place to make a decision.

It is fantastic to hear that &euro;1.58 million is being put into breastfeeding and that the WHO code will be fully adopted.  However, it is only a drop in the ocean.  Society needs to change its attitude towards breastfeeding.  Human milk is for human babies.  There is no two ways about it.  There are many reasons human milk is for human babies.  Anything else is substitute.  I agree that some people may feel under pressure but, as we have said, if they do not have any information, it takes away their choices.  We are all for choice and nobody wants anybody to do something they are not happy or comfortable to do.  As has been said, feeding on a shop floor is not acceptable so who will be comfortable breastfeeding if they have to feed in a toilet?  We have all heard the stories time and again.  It is disgraceful that in 2021 we still hear them.

If a mother is struggling financially in any way, &euro;500 is a lot of money to have to hand when in a vulnerable state and already spending a lot of money on all of the baby paraphernalia required.  Breastfeeding is spoken about as the cheaper option but until the supports are in place so they can be accessed in hospitals and through community and peer groups, and all the areas are covered, mothers have to hire private lactation consultants and hire or buy pumps.

We sit on some of the maternity units but not all.  As volunteers it is quite difficult to get people to volunteer to be parent representatives on these committees but it is vital that women's voices are heard in this sphere.  In the past year, none of these committees has sat anyway as everything seems to have stopped, just like the public health nurses who do the well-baby care visits are no longer always doing so because they have been shifted to Covid and vaccination programmes.  Our mothers and babies are left in the community with absolutely no support.  Having to resort to a private lactation consultant is fine if people have the funding but if they do not have the funds, it means they go completely without help, including State help.  A lot needs to be done on hospital interaction with voluntary groups and with private lactation consultants.  There needs to be a multipronged approach so that stakeholder voices are heard rather than deciding from the top down what is needed in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021051200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Cahill"},{"type":"speech","time":1620774000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>In the witnesses' experience, how many women donate to the human milk bank in Irvinestown?

Given that our breastfeeding rates are disappointingly low at present, we have to wonder how much lower they would be if the voluntary groups were not involved.  At an official level in the health service clearly there are major gaps in the supports that should be available as a matter of course.  From this point of view I thank the witnesses for the work they are doing, as they are making a significant contribution.<\/p> <p>  I want to direct questions to Bainne Beatha.  I thank the witnesses for the documentation they sent in and for the report.  What do they think are the impacts on mothers who do not receive adequate breastfeeding support in hospital?  This seems to be the key period.  We know a large majority of women intend to breastfeed during pregnancy and when they go into hospital but at the point they are leaving hospital and going home these figures have dropped significantly.

Cuidi&uacute; might also respond because it sees mothers after the hospital experience.  When we launched in February, we received an onslaught of messages and we continue to do so.  They are very lengthy messages and some are based on multiple births dating back years.  What has come across very strongly is a feeling of grief and trauma.  There is new research going into breastfeeding grief, which can last for many years.  Part of it is the feeling that choice was taken away.  Mothers might have decided to breastfeed but because of not receiving the support they needed they felt abandoned and vulnerable.  They feel isolated, particularly at present.  People very much look to the experts for guidance when at a vulnerable stage.  They might be after operations and after labour.  They are physically recovering.  They may have sleep deprivation.  New mothers are presented with a little infant and they have to figure out how to care for it.  It is very overwhelming.  To feel abandoned and to ask for help and not receive it is a very painful experience, particularly if someone has really hoped to breastfeed and then have the choice taken away.  These are some of the feelings we have heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021051200002#D01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Deborah Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620774000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I would like to step in here and say it is definitely an issue, to the point that Cuidi&uacute; is creating a programme to train our breastfeeding counsellors in trauma.

The biggest gap in understanding regarding the potential cost of the action plan is the lack of reporting on progress to date.  The most recent report we could find dates from 2017.  The HSE has offered to forward us the implementation reports we have not been able to find online, but which we have been told are public.  It would appear to a lay person that the costliest elements of any strategy will concern ongoing staffing costs.  A key part of the action plan we would like to see implemented is proper staffing and to see the ratio of births to support staff increase.  We were very happy with last night's announcement of the additional lactation consultant posts for maternity units.<\/p> <p>  However, the births to support staff ratio is not defined within the action plan.  It is difficult, therefore, to quantify what level of support we might be aiming for.  The New Zealand ratio was used as the benchmark for the additional posts announced last night.  It seems most important, however, to focus on the impact of not investing in this regard.  What will be the opportunity cost if we do not invest in women initiating breastfeeding?  That is not just a financial cost.  There are potential long-term impacts on the health service in respect of the health outcomes that women are missing out on by not being able to feed.  I refer to cancer risks, potential osteoporosis and also impacts on the health of the child.  There is an ongoing burden for the health service in that respect.  Obesity is also another long-term concern, and that is connected with last night's announcement regarding the Healthy Ireland concept and Sl&aacute;intecare.  <\/p> <p>  We are also talking, however, about the environmental impact of endorsing all this use of formula, when it is not necessarily wanted or needed by every woman.  It should definitely be available as an option, but we are now forcing people to use formula who might not necessarily want or need to do that.  In addition to increased healthcare costs, there is also the question of how not investing in our human capital impacts our society.  The financial costs involved in this regard must be considered as well.  In some situations, significant costs are associated with breastfeeding, but we must also consider the ongoing cost of formula use for a family that may not want to take that approach.  Equally, there is also the trauma we have just been speaking about.  We could go through numerous stories from women who shared their experiences with us and how long those experiences have been sitting with them.  They have told us that it has been such a relief to get this off their chests and to process their experiences.  <\/p> <p>  As Ms Cahill mentioned, Cuidi&uacute; has recognised that aspect and the impact of the trauma.  We would like to see some comparison made between the cost of the action plan on one hand and then the cost of not investing in this area on the other.  We must understand the cost of not breastfeeding, and that has been done in other countries.  Endeavours such as the World Breastfeeding Trends Initiative exist to allow us to benchmark how we are progressing and to see some transparency in respect of our progress.  We are obviously headed in the right direction with these new lactation consultant posts, but we need to be able to see the outcome of a comparison and understand exactly where we are now.  That is what is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021051200002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Megan Etherton"},{"type":"speech","time":1620774000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Etherton.

Turning to the wider context of academic research, what added value does an informal project undertaken by Bainne Beatha, Cuidi&uacute; or any of the other support groups provide to the formal health system?

This undertaking was never intended as research.  We have a disclaimer in the report stating this was an informal questionnaire that Ms Byrne created and then the project grew legs.  The respondents self-selected, and the results we have were determined by those people who wished to share their stories, and those were potentially more likely to be the more negative stories.  However, the national maternity survey 2020 has shown that over 40% of women did not know how to submit feedback about their maternity experience.  Our initiative therefore fills a gap in the absence of any larger project exploring the experience of breastfeeding support in hospitals.  Women would not be pouring their grief out on Instagram if there was some other way in which their experiences were being fed up to a national level, being acted upon and associated changes implemented in a realistic way.<\/p> <p>  The national maternity experience survey does not ask about specific breastfeeding experiences in maternity hospitals and that is a gap in the research.  We hope this qualitative information provides an impetus for a larger and more comprehensive study which will explore the characteristics of the environment.  Rather than just focusing on women who do or do not breastfeed, we want to understand the larger factors at work in this regard.  I refer to women coming out of a hospital, being told their experience may not have been as they might have wanted it to go, and that if their babies are being fed with formula, or however, they should be happy with that and that their babies are healthy and happy and what are they complaining about.  That type of attitude just negates the whole experience for women who may have intended to breastfeed.  Providing an open and independent questionnaire, as we did, allowed those mothers to speak freely and get these experiences off their chests.  It does allow people to coalesce around the issue, and I guess that is why we are here and why these stories have grown legs.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the Deputy's second question about formula, I will pass that over to be answered by Ms Byrne, Ms Cahill or Ms Rea from Cuidi&uacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021051200002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Megan Etherton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620774000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I do not have that much of an answer for the Deputy either, but baby feeding loggers have done much work in that area.

They are not roles purely devoted to lactation consulting.  The people <i>in situ<\/i>are there in other roles, and the aspect of lactation consultant is almost an add-on element.  There might be one dedicated lactation consultant in Cork, one in the National Maternity Hospital and one in the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, and those are the only people who have roles purely as lactation consultants and not as midwives as well.

We need, therefore, training at every level, particularly at the neonatal level and the obstetrician and GP level.<\/p> <p>  Very few GPs will refer women to lactation consultants.  They will refer for a skin disease or a little knobbly bit somewhere on a person's body and yet, women go into GPs with nipples that are literally torn apart and they do not refer them to a lactation consultant.

We, in our campaign, are very aware that we are preaching to the masses.  All of our Instagram followers tend to be female.  Many men have signed the campaign once they became aware of it.  The Senator has mentioned that it was his first instinct to hand this issue over to somebody else because it is not his area of expertise and he has no direct experience.  I am delighted to see that he changed his mind because we need male champions of change.  In the same way that the mother and baby dyad needs a partner to support them, and actually a whole village of support around them, to help the mother and baby achieve breastfeeding, the whole idea of breastfeeding and making a societal change needs everybody involved because, as we mentioned earlier, the knock-on effects of breastfeeding or not breastfeeding affect everyone.  Breastfeeding is a health equity issue that is not just limited to the mothers and infants that we are talking about.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question, potentially, it is easier for people who have had some direct experience of breastfeeding, whether they are male or female, to engage with this and feel that they have either a right or a responsibility to engage with it.  We have tried to make breastfeeding as accessible to anyone regardless of their experience, and regardless of whether they used formula, would like to use formula, did breastfeed, did not breastfeed, will not breastfeed, do not have children, plan on having children or whatever.  Breastfeeding is a bigger societal issue so our goal is to make sure that it is accessible and to get people, like the Senator, on board and feel engaged in the issue, and feel entitled to speak about the issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021051200002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Megan Etherton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620774000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I agree with Ms Etherton.  We very much see the partner's role as hugely important.  Support is key when it comes to breastfeeding.  It is very difficult to start out on one's breastfeeding journey alone without any support and who better to be one's primary supporter than one's partner?  In that regard, our membership is made up of families as opposed to just mothers.<\/p> <p>  Yes, lactation consultations must be available and, ideally, without cost or through a system where cost is not the reason people do not lift the phone to ask for help.  Primarily, from the hospital, we would have a referral pathway and midwives would send mothers home with a list of numbers for them to call, and GPs would have a list of numbers for the mothers to call.  All that would be great so there is never a question in any mother's mind that if she needs help and support, she has numerous numbers to ring, and will get support without question.<\/p> <p>  Mothers should be checked on more regularly.  There are baby checks and a six-week check for mums but we do not have check-ups where mums are asked how they are getting on with breastfeeding, whether they need support with breastfeeding or are having difficulties.  Many people will not speak up if they are not asked questions and they may feel that they lack something because they are unable to breastfeed.  We all know that breastfeeding is difficult to start with and having someone checking to see how one is getting on would really encourage mothers to avail of  support.  Also, word would go out that it is not unusual to need support with breastfeeding.  We are busy in Cuidi&uacute;.  Ms Cahill has been involved for 30 years and I have been involved for 20 years.  We can attest to the fact that many mothers have come through the system and gone on to train as counsellors, which is lovely.<\/p> <p>  Education is hugely important.  All of the lactation consultants in Ireland, as part of their qualification, re-certify every year with Continuing Education Recognition Points, CERPs, and by exam every five years.  We continually go to study days and educate ourselves because things change.  Breastfeeding is not rocket science but one learns more about it as the years go by and we top up our education.  All of the Cuidi&uacute; tutors make sure that they keep up to date with the latest research and avail of the latest conferences to educate themselves.  The same should happen for health nurses, GPs and midwives.

We need continuity of what we are telling mothers and what they see in action, which is where there is a huge gap.  We are telling mums about their choices in antenatal classes yet when they arrive into maternity units to have their babies and try to breastfeed, what they are told is not the same as the information we give them and choice has been taken away from them.  A lot of the time midwives do not have time to spend with mothers.  I do not blame the midwives, they do a fantastic job.  However, staffing and education are issues.  What difference does the first bottle of top-up formula milk make to a baby?  Why should we not do that?  What should the first few hours of birth look like?  What should the start be for a baby?

I asked my friend who works in the medical circle many questions on this topic and gave them my thoughts on the matter as breastfeeding is such a raw and lived experience for people, not one of which I have direct experience.  I cast the net far and wide, and the responses were revealing.  People mentioned two areas when I told them that this meeting was coming up.  There was the issue of support for the person who wishes to breastfeed her baby and the need for structural supports that support continued breastfeeding.<\/p> <p>  I commend my colleagues in F&oacute;rsa on the campaign for breastfeeding rights for special needs assistants, SNAs, that equal those enjoyed by teachers.  While we are talking about a breastfeeding strategy and stuff there is a huge role to be played in terms of the wider population and workplace to properly support anyone who wishes to breastfeed and express their milk.<\/p> <p>  One of the questions that arose, and I wonder whether it is something that the witnesses have come across or had a huge amount of discussion on, is the provision of breastfeeding and supports for mothers who have chronic diseases.  Many women with conditions like Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis or Lupus must take very strong medications, including immunosuppressants, but would like to breastfeed.<\/p><p>There is now an accumulation of evidence that the benefits to mother and baby outweigh any risk of the baby's immune system being suppressed by the minuscule amount of drugs that cross into breast milk.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts on that?  The person I spoke to said women should be supported to breastfeed through counselling and adjustments to the vaccination schedule for babies.  Some live vaccines may be best deferred in babies being breastfed by mothers taking certain medication.  Is it something that has ever arisen for the witnesses? <\/p><p> I will throw the questions out and they can answer them.  This is quite an unusual format.  Sometimes we ask questions in a pow, pow, pow format to try to get juicy answers.  The witnesses represent an advocacy group which is doing incredible work.  This is a very pleasant format in which to be able to converse.<\/p><p> There is a human donor milk bank in the North.  Are there any commitments towards developing and funding such a bank in the Republic?  The phrase used was \"human milk is for human babies\", yet it seems mad to me that we do not have such a facility and people instead have to go to the North. <\/p><p> We talked about hospital grade pumps.  A woman told me she would love to see the option of one free visit at home from a qualified IBCLC and the continuation of care at home.  We discussed workplaces.  It would be great to amend the regulations to allow mothers to take breastfeeding or pumping breaks for up to one year post birth.  The current regulation allows for such breaks for up to six months.  Many people shared many thoughts with me and I do not want to leave anything out.<\/p><p> Some of the people I spoke to said they felt they were being aggressively marketed formula through algorithms and stuff like that, as well as through their own spheres, friends and so on.  Would I be correct in saying that Ireland is quite poor at enforcing the WHO code on marketing formula?  Lots of events are sponsored by formula companies. <\/p><p> People said there is a wider cultural problem.  The generations before us were sometimes discouraged from breastfeeding.  Do the witnesses have any experience of what needs to be done to address what is being passed down through the generations?  It is an eternal cultural problem and not one that exists solely in our hospitals.

In situations like those outlined by the Senator, they have to be dealt with on a case by case basis.  I come back to the education of obstetricians and people in other medical fields.  The first thing they say to women is an almost blanket statement that they cannot breastfeed because they are on medication.  In fact, a lot of research has been done on medication.  Some people may need to check change their medication to a lower risk one in order to breastfeed their babies.  Others will not need to do that.  It depends on the severity of their condition and what medication they are on.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Tom Hale in Texas is doing a lot of work on this area.  He has done a lot of testing.  Every lactation consultant that I know has an app with all of his information on the risk factors for every drug so that people can discuss with mothers who have a condition what the risk factors are and whether medication is high or low risk.  Mothers can then make their own informed decisions as to how they are going to feed their babies.<\/p> <p>  On the implementation of the WHO code, the Government said today that it will fully implement all of the recommendations and resolutions.  That will mean that all of the formula advertising will disappear off our televisions.  That will be significant.

On antenatal training, in a report we found 21% of mothers said the lack of such training through hospitals was a roadblock and that many women wanted to know about the challenges of breastfeeding.  I appreciate it is a fine balancing act because if all people hear are the challenges, that will be less appealing and people will not learn about the amazing benefits and rewards of breastfeeding, not just for the baby but also the mother.  There are long-term physical health benefits as well as emotional benefits.<\/p> <p>  I am in a WhatsApp group with several other mums and all of us said that we would breastfeed to six months.  Due to lockdown we have been at home with our babies for a lot longer and are extending breastfeeding until our children are one or two years old.  That is in line with the WHO recommendation to breastfeed to two years of age.  I had such a difficult start that it has been a real privilege to breastfeed my son for that long.<\/p> <p>  Women need to know about the realities of breastfeeding, and realise that when things are not working it is not just them and help is available.  Often difficulties require very simple solutions and IBCLC could assist them.  There may be difficulties with positioning.  Ms Rea and Ms Cahill are much more expert on this than we are.<\/p> <p>  Senator Hoey referred to the WHO code.  It is not an area we have researched.  The Baby Feeding Law Group Ireland, BFLGI, has done a lot of work on that and I recommend talking to it.  One mother in our report referred to formula being handed around like cups of tea in the hospital.  There seems to be a very heavy reliance on formula and anecdotally we have heard that is because midwives are very busy.  Given that establishing breastfeeding can sometimes take a lot of time, formula is a much easier way to ensure they know babies are being fed.  We need to examine staffing in order to make sure midwives have time to help women one and that there are lactation consultants whose specific role is to address challenges as they arise.

We have not conducted any research on that, but the anecdotal evidence from women is that the sense of feeling and being left alone has been exacerbated. <\/p> <p>  Other research being carried out suggests that women who, like Ms Byrne, have already initiated breastfeeding are breastfeeding for an extended period.

I am seeing no great rise in numbers but my fear at the beginning was that many mothers were not getting the help they wanted due to the lack of support.  I had a fear that the rates would really plummet but it has been the case that many mothers who are concerned about Covid and their babies' health are breastfeeding where they may not have done so previously.  We are certainly seeing a rise in numbers in that regard.  I believe we will come out of it probably where we went into it.  The early studies on breastfeeding and protection for the baby came out quite quickly.  This impacted a lot for some mothers and it certainly had a bearing on the decisions made by a lot of mums.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to donor milk.  It would be terrific if we had a donor milk bank down south.  They offer a terrific service and they are always looking for donors.  They are in very short supply.  A lot of the time they have busy times when they would be a little short.  We know it is so important for babies in a neonatal intensive care unit to receive donor milk if mum is not able to produce the milk herself.  A very informal system of milk sharing goes on around the country.  Lots of mothers share breast milk informally.  It would be terrific if it could be formalised in some way.  This, however, brings money into it and it would exclude some mothers from having the service.  A lot of it comes down to money and that should not be part of a mum's choice to breastfeed.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of antenatal classes and mothers feeling that they did not get enough education, Ms Cahill and I are both antenatal educators with Cuidi&uacute;, and we do cover it.  Anybody who has had a baby will know that on the first baby, one's thoughts are \"How am I going to get this baby out?\"  The mother hears all of the other bits about the baby such as changing nappies, but breastfeeding is on the periphery and she may not be focused on it until the baby arrives home.  Then she realises that perhaps she should have taken that information on board a little more.  Yes, it is absolutely included in all of the antenatal education, but potentially there should be a class very quickly after birth.  I love the idea of a free lactation consultant visit for everybody.  That would make it such an even playing field.  It would make it so much easier for mothers to get the help in a timely manner.  Very often it is just too late: they have made their decision and there is no going back for them.  As Ms Byrne and Ms Etherton have said through lots of their stories, those decisions live on for mothers.  They do not make those decisions lightly and they find it very hard to reconcile afterwards.  We find that with antenatal education, meeting a mother on her second baby is a totally different story to meeting a mother on her first baby.  She is a different person and her decisions are much firmer.  Mothers educate themselves so much differently at that point.  If we could somehow channel that for first-time mothers we would certainly make big strides and help lots more mothers in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021051200002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Rea"},{"type":"speech","time":1620774000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I invite Deputy Gino Kenny.

I have read the witness statements and I thank them for all the work they are doing.  Overnight we heard the positive announcement by the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, of &euro;1.58 million to hire an additional 24 lactation consultants for hospitals.  I am also really delighted to hear that the Government accepts the WHO guidelines that will see a phasing out of the in-your-face marketing and advertising of formula products.  I believe this to be a good thing because a number of things are competing against each other here, including preparing for birth and getting ready, with all that this involves.  There is also the fact that people are consumers.  From a young age and from knee height we are bombarded with advertisements and all sorts of messages, be it from Smyth's Toys or Coca Cola.  This gets inside our heads.  We are brand people.  We go to supermarkets and it has been proven time and again that we pick up items such as Brennan's bread, for example, and certain other brands because we stick with what has been marketed to us.  I believe that the same applies to formula milks.  We need to break away from that.<\/p> <p>  It is good that in the opening statements the witnesses from Bainne Beatha stated that it is not a \"breast is best\" group.  This can often pressurise new mums who may feel they are doing something wrong by not breastfeeding and going the formula route.  It is good that the representatives have said that the groups are there to support and find avenues of making this more feasible and possible.<\/p> <p>  I will jump into a few comments and then I have a number of questions.  The first point is the obvious elephant in the room.  We are discussing babies, birthing and breastfeeding.  The real elephant in the room is that so many partners still cannot accompany the expectant mother to appointments at hospitals.  We have had the political statements and I heard what the Taoiseach said yesterday.  We have had a lot of talk from mums.  Joe Duffy's \"Liveline\" covered this.  Now we need each hospital group to standardise what they do around partners attending appointments.  In general terms, but not in all cases, a woman who is expecting a baby is healthy.  Giving birth is a medical condition but it is different to other hospital contexts in that the person is, generally, not unwell going into hospital to give birth.  Of course there are cases where it happens but, in general, the woman is going in for a few days to give birth to a healthy child, hopefully, and to go home again.  Those appointments leading up to birth are so important.  We need to see some standardisation very quickly on this.<\/p> <p>  My next point is for Ms Cahill.  I was absolutely shocked.  One of my take-home points from her contribution is that antenatal classes have not been happening.  I did not know that or understand that.  This amplifies the whole problem I have just referred to where partners cannot attend some appointments with expectant mums.  I am dad to three smallies - a six-year old, a four-year old and a two-year old.  We went to the antenatal classes for the first child because it is the big unknown at that point.  My knowledge of birthing was leaving certificate biology, a time when I would have been doodling in my copybook and not listening.  Fast forward 12 years, however, and suddenly I needed to know all about this.  My ears pricked up when they started talking about what would happen if we did not make it to the maternity hospital and if I as the dad had to help my wife to give birth at the side of the road.  Suddenly, God almighty, a dose of reality of what may be involved was like a smack in the face.  There has to be some capacity or some way, at least online, to address the lack of classes.  We have all embraced Zoom.  We are meeting today virtually.  There must be some capacity to get those classes up and running, pretty much immediately.<\/p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on if there is a need in Ireland for postnatal classes?  Breastfeeding comes into that realm.  As Ms Cahill and Ms Rea have said, when one goes to an antenatal class the focus is on how a baby is born and on the whole process from labour to birth and everything in between.  Is there a need for postnatal classes?  New parents have nothing to benchmark against.  We phone sisters and brothers, or go to Google and get atrocious answers.  We have people telling us our lives will never be the same again.  This is just from my perspective as dad: it is way worse from the mum's perspective.  There is probably a need, but not everyone will take it up, for postnatal classes.  The same cohort that goes together to antenatal classes may be giving birth in and around the same time.  It makes sense that the same service would be offered to them as a group after the births.  Perhaps the HSE would consider that.<\/p> <p>  I was quite shocked to see Ms Etherton's analysis in her opening statement that 60% of mothers sought help and advice privately on breastfeeding.  This is some 36,000 mums last year, at an average cost of &euro;440 each, who left the net of our public health service to go and get this advice.  This makes it even more important that the lactation consultants are hired.<\/p> <p>  On the points made by Ms Rea, as a person who has been in maternity hospitals a few times, I found that it is very hard to identify who is who.  They are all wearing scrubs.  I remember going down corridors and tapping a person on the shoulder, but they could have been a cleaning attendant, kitchen staff, an obstetrician, or someone on their way down to deliver an antenatal class.  It is very hard to identify people.  Identifying who is the lactation consultant could be a very simple thing each hospital group could do.  It is very hard for a person who is not in a hospital every day to see who is who in that context.<\/p><p>That more or less covers it.  Could the witnesses respond to some of those questions?

Antenatal classes would involve a post-natal reunion.  The normal groups run by Cuidi&uacute; would run act in that way.  It is mother-to-mother support at that stage but they would have an antenatal educator or breastfeeding counsellor there so it is quite informal at that point where mothers are discussing issues among themselves and there is somebody there who has that bit more knowledge and training and is able to steer the conversation in the right direction.  In that regard, it is happening but it is online at the moment.  There is a massive amount of classes available online.  It is about getting people to attend them and getting the information out there.<\/p> <p>  Regarding partners being present at births, the Deputy said he was able to attend the birth of his child and was panicked and worried by the thought of not being able to attend it.  It is incredible that partners are still unable to be with their partners during birth because they are not a visitor.  They are part of that family that is about to be extended and it is a disgrace that this has not happened even now that the advice is that they can be there.  It should have happened as soon as there was mention of it being allowed to happen.  Their support is key.  They are going home with mum.  Their support is huge when it comes to birth and moving forward into their breastfeeding journey.  It should be recognised that they are not visitors; they are part of that same birthing team.  <\/p> <p>  Cuidi&uacute; tries to bridge those gaps but it is about getting the information out there, getting people to attend and getting the likes of GPs and public health nurses to help mothers find supports in their area.

I thank all the witnesses for appearing before us today.  I do not know a huge amount about this issue but I am obviously learning.  It is a fascinating subject.  I am not sure if anybody has mentioned a perinatal division in Ireland.  Approximately a year ago, I saw a report on perinatal care and mother and baby units in Great Britain on the BBC and was really struck by it.  These are specialised units for women suffering from postnatal depression.  I looked at the NHS website.  According to its research, 20% of all new mothers could experience mental health difficulties prior to birth, giving birth and after giving birth.  It was a fascinating report.  During the past year, there have been discussions about a mother and baby unit.  Obviously, that name has connotations in this country but this is a different type of unit.  I think it is going to be on the campus of St. Vincent's Hospital.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on perinatal care?  This unit would be the first of its kind in Ireland.  What outlet do such units give women?  When I watched that report, I was shocked.  When a woman gives birth, in some circumstances, she can experience terrible depression that can have a significant impact on her and her baby.

There is a difference between puerperal psychosis where somebody needs to be hospitalised and postnatal depression.  A woman cannot have her baby with her when she is in St. Patrick's unit.  It is just not possible so there is always separation in the case of puerperal psychosis sometimes for the safety of the baby but usually because of staffing.  There are issues around that.  There should be a mother and baby unit but there is none.<\/p><p>In most cases of postnatal depression, and there is a lack of services for those with very severe postnatal depression, medication is the first route that people will go down and that will usually be accompanied by the statement \"and you will need to give up breastfeeding\".  In fact, the research shows that giving up breastfeeding will make their depression worse and that if they continue to breastfeed, their depression will eventually begin to drop.  They may still need medication, however, and many medications for depression are okay to use while breastfeeding.  Puerperal psychosis is a very different condition and needs to be medically supervised because it is very severe.

Postnatal depression can affect mums of children up to two years of age and they can show signs at any point during that time.  We also have to recognise that much postnatal depression can be a result of the mother's experience.  It can be driven by disappointment or upset.  Birth and breastfeeding are very much hormonally driven, and when many hormones are involved, there will be an imbalance some of the time.  These mothers need care and, as Ms Cahill said, it does not always need to be medication.  Support is the key in those circumstances.  Sometimes medication will be needed, and that is where they need proper guidance and GPs need proper information on what medication is suitable to continue with breastfeeding.  Stopping breastfeeding abruptly is never a good idea either.  We know there will be that drop of oxytocin and prolactin, which will send mothers into a low mood.  The experience of birth and breastfeeding for a particular mum is tied in greatly with the hormones of birth and breastfeeding.  There could also be a predisposition to it.  There is plenty of information out there on the matter.

They are very knowledgeable.  I would count myself as somebody who would know a little about breastfeeding but I have learned a great deal about the structural problems that exist currently.<\/p> <p>  I would be of the opinion that we need a strong public information campaign on breastfeeding to break that intergenerational cycle in relation to breastfeeding.  Many of us would come from families in which nobody that we would know, not our mothers, aunts or other extended family members, would have breastfed.  It is not the norm in Irish families because we have such a low breastfeeding uptake.  A public awareness campaign should definitely be looked into to raise the possibility.<\/p> <p>  I found when I was pregnant that breastfeeding was almost mentioned to me as an afterthought.  It was almost sprung on me the week before I gave birth as to what I would do.  One is completely bombarded.  One is trying to process all this information.  Having that conversation at such a late stage is not healthy and it is not good.  It should be incorporated into secondary school education.  It should be a much broader education for society, not only women but their partners because they are such a vital part in the breastfeeding journey.  One needs the full support of one's partner because it is so difficult.  There is almost pressure on some women to ease the burden at home and give it up, as though it would make everybody's lives much easier if one stopped with this kind of almost nonsense.  Without firm support from one's partner at home, it is very difficult.<\/p> <p>  There are many women who might not have breastfed on their first child.  We need to get the message to them that it is okay, that was their experience but when one is having a second child and subsequent children, perhaps a different choice is there for them.  It is to give women the confidence to say that they want to change their mind on it.  It is not any reflection on their initial decision but that they want to try something different now.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask a question in relation to the initial outlay on breastfeeding.  The witnesses mentioned it was in or around &euro;500.  That is a huge amount of money for anybody.  It lends credence to the idea that breastfeeding is some sort of middle-class pursuit and it is not suitable for women who would not fall into this well-off, middle-class category.  Would they support a grant being given to women who choose to breastfeed to cover those initial outlays that one would have?  Can they suggest any other measures that can be taken to encourage and support more women who would not be from a middle-class background who would not have many financial resources to breastfeed because it is a costly outlay at the start?<\/p> <p>  My second question would be in relation to the role of local authorities in creating public spaces to allow breastfeeding in our communities out and about in town.  One of the witnesses mentioned Dundrum Shopping Centre.  If we are to rely on commercial entities to provide public spaces, we will not get them.  That is the bottom line.  Should local authorities have a role in providing breastfeeding supports?<\/p><p>What do the witnesses see in relation to that?<\/p><p> Another issue, which may have been touched upon in earlier contributions, concerns the impact of the pandemic on breastfeeding rates.  Like Ms Byrne, I have many friends who have actually extended their breastfeeding or who initially thought they would do it for a couple of weeks but have continued to do it far beyond it because they are at home, they are not being disturbed, there is no pressure to get out and about and bounce back to normal and carry on like nothing has happened, so for them it has been positive.<\/p><p> However, there has also been a negative impact, and a number of contributors spoke about the maternity service restrictions.  Do the witnesses feel that a lack of support in relation to the other maternity issues and the lack of an advocate standing by their side to speak up for them impacts on the number of women who are choosing to breastfeed?  Do the witnesses feel that because all of this has been so difficult and women do not have someone to speak up and advocate for them in the couple of days after they give birth, perhaps they want to make things easier for themselves?  Perhaps the witnesses have some further views on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021051200002#M01500","speaker":"1643","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620774000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>On the cost issue and the suggestions as to how perhaps to overcome the barrier to breastfeeding, we mentioned the hospital being a level playing field.  That is an area where people of all different backgrounds will be, so if they get the support from the get-go, it is to be hoped the 63% of mothers who do initiate breastfeeding will be converted to continuing to breastfeed beyond hospital discharge.<\/p> <p>  We focus a lot on the low rates of breastfeeding, but it is also about enabling those who have decided to give it a go and helping them continue with it.  Basically, the more we see breastfeeding in society, the more people will do it.  I have friends and family who work within the maternity services and I did not know that extended breastfeeding reduces the risk of ovarian, cervical and breast cancers.  Therefore, there is work to do on the promotional and educational piece.<\/p> <p>  I believe Ms Cahill mentioned having a free international board certified lactation, IBCL, consultant visit as part of the public health service.  The public nurse does these checks, but if that proposal could be incorporated, it would also enable people of different backgrounds and incomes to address issues at an early stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021051200002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deborah Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1620774000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>We are coming to the end of the meeting and we are over the time limit for using the room.

To answer the Senator's question on the cost, lactation consultants in private practice usually give a patient two hours.  That is a huge difference in timing.  Referrals could be made to lactation consultants in private practice.  Public health nurses spend a maximum on 20 minutes with a mother.  If, upon the identification of a problem, they could refer a mother on to a private lactation consultant who would have the time to visit the mother and get paid by the health system to do so, it would be ideal for everybody, but that is not what is happening.  Therefore, breastfeeding is still, more or less, a middle-class pursuit.  That is just the way of it, really.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021051200002#N01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Cahill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620774000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I just want to touch on the Senator's point about public spacing and making amenities for breastfeeding.

There should not be a question of a mother being moved on from sitting on a park bench or feeding her child wherever she chooses to do so.

I would certainly like to hear more of their views on why breastfeeding rates in Ireland are so low, and in particular, the drop in rates from the 63.8% majority that do breastfeed in hospital to the rate of 37% after leaving hospital.  That issue would be well worth further exploration in respect of questions.
