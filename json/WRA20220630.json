The study of History in itself is an opportunity for students to engage with diverse aspects of human experience in a variety of cultural contexts. The syllabus facilitates students to learn how human history is created by the interaction of different individuals, groups and institutions in a variety of contexts that will invariably invite a multitude of perspectives and understanding. Students are provided with opportunities for reflective and critical work on historical evidence where bias and stereotypes are challenged. <\/p>  <p>  In the Junior Cycle Framework, learning is described in terms of twenty-four Statements of Learning. These statements, taken as a whole, and aligned with the eight key skills, represent the learning that must be provided for in the programme of learning experienced by Junior Cycle students in our schools. Several Statements of Learning relate directly to history. Three statements which affirm the importance of impartiality, objectivity and fairness to the subject of History in the Junior Cycle Framework are: <\/p>  <p>  - &lsquo;the student appreciates and respects how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to the communities and culture in which he\/ she lives&rsquo;; <\/p>  <p>  - &lsquo;the student values local national and international heritage, understands the importance of the relationship between past and current events and the forces that drive change&rsquo;<\/p>  <p>  - &lsquo;the student understands the origins and impacts of social, economic, and environmental aspects of the world around him\/ her&rsquo;. <\/p>  <p>  At primary level,\u00a0Social, Environmental and Scientific Education (SESE) consists of three subjects: Science, Geography and History. SESE enables children to explore, investigate and develop an understanding of local and wider environments.\u00a0History is taught for all children from junior infants to sixth class and the curriculum supports children to develop basic skills as a historian through a knowledge and understanding of people, events and developments in the past.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Department has provided guidelines and identified resources for schools to promote inclusion and respecting diversity. <\/p>  <p>  The Insight series on the Gov.ie website explores the themes of equality, diversity and inclusion.

We are determined to support for the huge efforts we are seeing from our school communities across the country, who have shown huge commitment and generosity in meeting the needs of all Ukrainian children.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the Deputy will appreciate the scale of the response needed, given that well over 30,000 people have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine since the beginning of this war.<\/p>  <p>  By early June, figures show that almost 7,000 children from Ukraine had enrolled in schools in every county across the State. Approximately 4,800 children from Ukraine had enrolled in primary schools, while over 2,000 had enrolled in our post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the area of Citywest in particular, Ukrainian students who are living in the Citywest area of Dublin have so far been accommodated in local schools close to their accommodation. I am advised that the local Regional Education and Language Team (REALT) co-ordinator visits and engages with Citywest regularly.<\/p>  <p>  My Department carried out surveys at Primary and Post Primary level to identify potential capacity. My Department has incorporated this information with other information in the Geographical Information System (GIS) system to enable quick identification of potential capacity near Ukrainian accommodation centres through the Community Analyst reporting system. This includes Citywest.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Our understanding, given the numbers that are currently accommodated, is that there is sufficient capacity in the surrounding schools within the area.<\/p>  <p>  The impact analysis from the GIS system sets out the available capacity near an accommodation centre as well as information on distance, school planning area, current school enrolment information, number of Ukrainian students enrolled etc.<\/p>  <p>  Each REALT team has access to this tool. This reflects their key role in assisting children in finding school places and in supporting schools in their area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge.<\/p>  <p>  This reporting tool enables the REALT co-ordinator to quickly assess the impact of the arrival of a large number of Ukrainian children on school capacity in a particular area. They are then able to work to ensure that existing accommodation capacity within all local schools can be leveraged to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  As part of maximising provision in school settings it may be necessary to access capacity in neighbouring schools within reasonable travel distance (supported as necessary through school transport arrangements).<\/p>  <p>  My Department in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann put in place a process to facilitate the provision of School Transport Scheme Services for children arriving to Ireland from Ukraine.\u00a0For families and children residing in accommodation centres (or similar), school principals may apply for transport for children attending their school who are residing in such accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000058#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000058#WRA03100"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[34906\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000058#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the assessment or analysis her Department has carried out in regard to the new junior certificate Irish programme; if she is satisfied with the new format; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) develops the curriculum, at the Minster for Education's request, through their representative structures. <\/p>  <p>  When developing subject specifications, the NCCA convenes specialist subject development groups. Such a group was established to draft specifications for Junior Cycle Irish. NCCA processes around seeking suitable nominations from stakeholder organisations are clear and robust.\u00a0 All nominating bodies are informed of the nature and scope of the development work in writing and through follow-up conversations, where required. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the subject development group for Junior Cycle Irish, significant emphasis was placed on specialist expertise and knowledge of both L1 and L2 settings. The NCCA also co-opted two additional development group members with knowledge and expertise to further strengthen the group. The opportunity to join the development group through this public co-option process was advertised in an advertising campaign and feature piece on Tuairisc.ie. Over 25 applications were received and two additional experts, one with significant L1 expertise and one with significant L2 expertise were shortlisted and co-opted to the development group. The NCCA has also made provision for the use of task group input, when and where the need arose throughout development process.<\/p>  <p>  Following extensive stakeholder consultation, new L1 and L2 specifications for Junior Cycle Irish were introduced in September 2017. Due to the disruption to learning and the cancellation of the summer 2020 and 2021 Junior Cycle examinations as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible for students to engage with the final assessment component, which is set by the State Examinations Commission, until this year. The cohort of students who have just concluded their Junior Cycle examinations are therefore the first to have engaged with the full range of learning and assessment experiences in line with the specifications for Junior Cycle Irish.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing cycle of curriculum redevelopment, the NCCA reviews the enactment of subject specifications by conducting interim reviews once each subject specification has been experienced across the three-year span of the Junior Cycle. The purpose of such reviews is to capture feedback from teachers, students and stakeholders on their experiences of the new specifications. In February 2021, the NCCA opened a public consultation on draft L1 and L2 specifications for Leaving Certificate Established Irish. In response to subsequent stakeholder requests, the NCCA extended the timeline for this consultation and also undertook to conduct and early enactment review of the specifications for Junior Cycle Irish. Accordingly, the NCCA commissioned Dublin City University to conduct this review,\u00a0 which I am advised is expected to be completed later this year.

Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which they have been identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme.

While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools who need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage.

NEPS provides its service to schools through casework and through support and development work for schools. This includes guidance for teachers in the provision of universal and targeted evidence-informed approaches and early intervention to promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing, social, emotional and academic development. Initiatives such as the Incredible Years Social Emotional learning Programmes and the FRIENDS Resilience Programmes. These programmes have been welcomed by schools and their impact positively evaluated.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  NEPS has developed a range of workshops on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which includes trauma informed\u00a0approaches.\u00a0 The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practising psychologists working in schools.

No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); <\/p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; <\/p>  <p>  iii.

These trends are driven primarily by global factors. The key drivers of this increase are increases in wholesale energy prices as a result of the rapid rebound in global demand, global supply chain disruptions and the imbalance between demand and supply that emerged as economies re-opened.   More recently, as a result of the war in Ukraine, oil and gas prices have risen further.  It is not possible for the Government to fully insulate consumers against these price impacts, however, a number of very significant steps have been taken to lessen the impact of increased fuel prices.  <\/p>  <p>  On fuel excise, a package of measures, to the value of &euro;320 million, was introduced with effect from 10 March until August 31st, reducing the VAT inclusive excise duty on petrol, diesel and MGO by 20, 15 and 2 cent per litre respectively. These reductions mitigate the cost of a fill of a 60 litre tank by some &euro;12 for petrol and &euro;9 for diesel. This assists all transport users, rural and urban, including commuters, business and farmers. In April these measures were extended to 11 October 2022, with an additional 3 cent reduction for MGO. These measures will cost &euro;417mn from 10 March to 11 October.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above rate changes, I also brought forward legislation in Finance Act 2021 to provide for a temporary reduction of 1 cent per litre inclusive of VAT to MOT on petrol and diesel . This reduction came into effect on 1 April. I took this step to partially offset the expected rise in fuel costs arising from an increase in the Biofuel Obligation for transport fuels proposed by my colleague the Minister for Transport. Both rate cuts will remain in place until 11 October this year.  <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the above changes were made within the constraints of the Energy Tax Directive  (ETD).  The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended). Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel, and kerosene, that are used as motor or heating fuels.<\/p>  <p>  The Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS) was introduced in 2013 with the aim of providing support to road haulage and bus transport operators when the retail price of diesel is relatively high. The DRS operates on a sliding scale basis, whereby a partial rebate of MOT is available when the retail price of diesel exceeds &euro;1.00 per litre excluding VAT. The repayment rate increases gradually as the retail price increases, up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre\/&euro;75.00 per 1,000 litres. At current retail prices the repayment rate is at this maximum.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the effective MOT rate on auto-diesel must be considered in ensuring compliance with the ETD.

In line with this provision, a derogation is not sought in relation to each legal case. <\/p><p>Accordingly, the overall amount of RT&Eacute; legal costs and settlements have been disclosed in this manner each year since the 2016 Code was introduced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000064#WRJ00775","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000064#WRJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[35121\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000064#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when payment of a capital sports grant will be made to a club (details supplied); the reason for the delay with this payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>The club to which the Deputy refers was provisionally allocated a grant of &euro;59,500 under the 2017 Sports Capital Programme (SCP) for the provision of pitch floodlights.

As a result, Best Practice Recommendations for the operation of Municipal Districts\u00a0have now been identified. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will issue a Circular regarding theses Best Practice Recommendations to all local authorities in the coming months. It is intended that implementing these practices, where appropriate, will contribute to greater efficiency and effectiveness in the overall operation of Municipal Districts, boost local leadership and support the sustainable development of our\u00a0communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000064#WRJ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000064#WRJ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[35135\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000064#WRJ04400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the total number of affordable purchase homes that have been delivered to date; the local authority areas in which they have been delivered; the sales price of the properties and the income limit for eligible purchasers for each size and type of home in tabular form.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>Housing for All sets out the range of actions necessary to increase the supply of housing to the required 33,000 homes, on average, per year over the next decade. 54,000 affordable home interventions will be delivered between now and 2030 to be facilitated by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), the Land Development Agency (LDA) and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is made available by Government to assist local authority affordable housing delivery, for purchase and rent, through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF), which prior to summer 2021 operated as the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF).  <\/p>  <p>  In the past 12 months, the SSF assisted in the delivery of 50 affordable homes at Enniskerry Road in South Dublin, Ireland's first secure, long term Cost Rental homes.

Affordable sales prices for these schemes will range from &euro;205,000 to &euro;243,000.<\/p>  <p>  Affordable homes supported by my Departments AHF will be made available to eligible buyers at reduced purchase prices through the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme. The provisions of the scheme are detailed under Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021. The percentage difference between the market value of the home and the discounted purchase price is reflected in a redeemable equity stake held by the Local Authority of between a minimum of 5% and a maximum 40% of the value of the home. <\/p>  <p>  The income eligibility criteria for the Local Authority scheme are detailed in the Affordable Housing Regulations 2022, which can be found online at:<\/p>  <p>  www.irishstatutebook.ie\/eli\/2022\/si\/183\/made\/en\/print. <\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of these Regulations, the general rule for eligibility is that an applicant's (or applicants' applying jointly) annual gross income multiplied by 3.5 times cannot exceed 85.5% of the market value of the home in question. This rule can be represented by the formula:<\/p>  <p>  3.5 x A = 0.855 x B<\/p>  <p>  (Where A is the annual gross income of the applicant(s), and B is the market value of the home)<\/p>  <p>  This test looks at whether someone would have the capacity to meet a purchase price of more than 95% of market value using a standard mortgage of 3.5 times income and for 90% of the purchase price (i.e. the maximum mortgage they could obtain without benefiting from one of the limited exemptions from the Central Bank Mortgage Measures).<\/p>  <p>  In the case of a new home with a market value of &euro;250,000, for example, this equation produces the result that the general eligibility limit is an annual gross income of &euro;61,071 (to the nearest euro). Altering the market value of the home will produce different income values accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  As detailed in the Affordable Housing (No. 2) Regulations 2022, once eligibility has been established, affordable homes will be sold to purchasers at discounted prices set according to the purchasing capacity of each applicant household and the minimum level of support which they require. This is subject, however, to minimum prices set by Local Authorities to reflect economic realities and ensure scheme viability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000064#WRJ04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[35136\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000064#WRJ04700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the total number of affordable cost rental homes that have been delivered to date; the local authority areas in which they have been delivered; and the rents being charged by each size and type of home in tabular form.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":429,"content":"<p>Under the Government's Housing for All strategy, 10,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered from 2021 to 2026 by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), Local Authorities and the Land Development Agency (LDA).

It gives flexibility to schools in deploying their resources.  They can take account of the actual learning needs of pupils rather than being guided primarily by a particular diagnosis of disability. The Department has published guidelines for schools as to how they should deploy their resources.  Budget 2022 provides for an additional 620 new SET posts in special education.  This will bring the total number of SET in the mainstream school system to 14,385 in 2022.<\/p><p>Special Classes<\/p><p>Special Classes to support children with significant special educational needs are substantially smaller than mainstream classes and have a pupil teacher ratio as low as 6:1 and will have SNAs assigned to look after the pupil care needs.For example, special classes for children with autism have one teacher and two SNAs for 6 children.<\/p><p>The number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 in 2011, to 2,118 for the 2021\/2022 school year. There are now 1,854 special classes for children with Autism in place: 133 Early Intervention, 1,205 primary and 516 post primary autism special classes. Budget 2022 provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022\/2023 school year. These additional classes will provide over 1,700 new places in 2022.<\/p><p>Overall, there are almost 12,700 pupils enrolled in special classes in mainstream primary and post primary schools representing approximately 1% of the overall pupil population.<\/p><p>Special Schools<\/p><p>Special schools have lower class sizes and will also have SNAs assigned.  They cater for particular categories of disability.  There are 126 special schools providing specialist education for approximately 8,000 pupils annually with over 1,400 teachers. This represents approximately 0.8% of the total pupil population.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 provided for an additional 23 teaching posts and 46 SNA posts in special schools which will create an additional 140 class places.<\/p><p><b>This will provide specialist education to in excess of 8,000 pupils in 2022.<\/b><\/p><p>The allocation of resources to all schools is available on the NCSE website at the following link and <\/p><p>SET Hours and SNA Allocations &ndash; National Council for Special Education (ncse.ie).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000066#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":530,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[35193\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000066#WRL03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which all schools throughout the country continue to make provision for special needs teaching requirements; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":531,"content":"<p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.   <\/p>  <p>  This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs.<\/p>  <p>  The number of teaching posts to support special educational needs across our education system continues to increase and is now at unprecedented levels.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new Special Education teacher (SET) posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022\/23.

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The cost in 2021 was over &euro;289m. <\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the School Transport Schemes, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest national school. At post primary level, they are eligible where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest post primary school\/education centre.  Distance is determined by the Department\/Bus &Eacute;ireann, and rules have regard to ethos and language.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. <\/p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs. The review of the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes examine how the schemes currently operate, including eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.<\/p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report in June 2021.

The Action Plan contains 12 actions that focus on the provision of support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed.  A number of these actions have been implemented in full while others, which by their nature involve continuous action, are the subject of ongoing implementation. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Action Plan, anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools, which include a specific reference to cyberbullying, were published at the beginning of the 2013\/14 school year. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils and in dealing with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Support and resources in the area of online safety and digital citizenship are provided by Webwise. <\/p>  <p>  Webwise promotes the autonomous, effective and safer use of the internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy targeting school leaders, teachers, parents\/guardians and learners themselves with consistent and relevant messages.  <\/p>  <p>  Webwise and PDST Technology in Education are currently developing a new online cyberbullying course which seeks to inform teachers and school leaders about cyberbullying and outlines a school&rsquo;s role in relation to creating an anti-cyberbullying culture and promoting student wellbeing including online wellbeing. This course aims to provide both primary and post-primary teachers with the knowledge, resources and confidence needed to teach about cyberbullying and deal with cyberbullying incidents as they arise.<\/p>  <p>  There are also extensive training and curricular supports, including through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum and the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and on the prevention of bullying including cyber-bullying.<\/p>  <p>  A new Digital Strategy for schools, the Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027, was published in April. The Strategy will advance the embedding of digital technologies across teaching, learning and assessment, building on the work under previous strategies. Online safety and the safe and ethical use of digital technologies is a key component of the new Strategy. The Strategy will continue to work towards ensuring that learners have the opportunity to develop their digital skills so that they can navigate the digital world in a confident and competent manner and that their voices are heard and taken into account in further developments in this area.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in February of this year I established a Steering Committee to review the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying. This Steering Committee is chaired externally by Dr. Noel Purdy of Stranmillis University College in Antrim. This review involves significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and also involves consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students, school management bodies and teacher and school staff unions.  The review is taking into account the significant developments and relevant research since the action plan was published in 2013. It is specifically considering cyber bullying, identity bullying and sexual harassment, among other areas. <\/p>  <p>  The review is also giving detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health which was published last August. <\/p>  <p>  The Steering Committee consists of senior officials from the Department of Education, including the Inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, representatives of the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU), the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU and other external experts and representatives of advocacy organisations which include BelongTo, Webwise, Parentline National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum, Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Independent Living Movement Ireland. The Steering Committee has held seven meetings to date. <\/p>  <p>  The Anti-bullying procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools is also being reviewed and updated in parallel with this work. A working group comprised of representatives from each of the relevant management bodies and teacher and school staff unions, along with representatives from the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU) and the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU has been established to review the anti-bullying procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000067#WRM03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000067#WRM03300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Meals Programme","counter":584,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000067#WRM03200"},{"type":"question","counter":585,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[34162\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000067#WRM03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the measures that she is putting in place to make sure all DEIS schools that are entitled to the meals programme will have access to this service in September 2022 (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":586,"content":"<p>The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,506 schools and organisations benefitting 230,000 children.

The actuarial value of the State Pension is circa &euro;380,000.  The estimate does not include the value of the over 80 allowance, Household Benefits Package, Living Alone Allowance, Free Travel, Survivors Pension on death (assuming qualifying criteria are met by either recipient or spouse) and means-tested payments such as Qualified Adult or Fuel Allowance.  It is, therefore, reasonable to require people claiming a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of reckonable paid contributions over the term of their working life.<\/p>  <p>  There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, there is the contributory principle. Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid as of right, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test. <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, there is the solidarity principle. Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.  In this regard, it should be noted that some PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another. <\/p>  <p>  Where a person enters the social insurance system over the age of 56 they will not be able to make sufficient social insurance contributions to be awarded a State Pension (Contributory) on reaching 66 years of age because it has a minimum contribution requirement of 520 contributions (i.e. 10 years).  In such cases, a level of social insurance refund may be applicable.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that, if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s\/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) is paid, generally, where a pensioner has an adult dependent (e.g. a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant who is financially dependent upon him\/her), who does not have enough contributions to claim a maximum rate State Pension (Contributory) in his\/her own right.  The payment rate for the IQA is up to 90% of a full contributory pension.  The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000068#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Eligibility","counter":642,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000068#WRN02500"},{"type":"question","counter":643,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[35222\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000068#WRN02600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of applications for disability allowance and invalidity pension that have been refused on the grounds of various forms of ineligibility; if provision will be made to re-examine such cases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":644,"content":"<p>To qualify for a Disability Allowance (DA) payment a person must: be substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment; be aged between 16 and 66; satisfy a means test; and be habitually resident in the State. <\/p><p>The total number of DA applications disallowed in 2021 was 13,989.<\/p><p>Invalidity pension (IP) is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and for no other reason and who satisfy the pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions. <\/p><p>The total number of IP applications disallowed in 2021 was 4,551.<\/p><p>Any unfavourable decision of a Deciding Officer must be communicated in writing to the claimant setting out the reasons for the decision.  <\/p><p>It is open to any person to request a review of any statutory decision made by the Department and any new evidence or information provided to the Department will be considered as part of this review.  <\/p><p>It is important to note that any decision of a deciding officer can be revised in light of additional evidence without it ever being in the appeal process.

Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a payment to people on low incomes who are caring full-time for a person who needs support because of age, disability or illness (including mental illness).  The person being cared for must require full-time care and attention.  There are currently 90,833 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  This represents an increase of almost 21% in the past 5 years, from 75,264 in 2017.  This year the estimated expenditure on the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance scheme is over &euro;990 million.As part of Budget 2022 significant changes were made to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means test.  These were the first changes to the means test in 14 years. <\/p>  <p>  -  The capital and savings disregard for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means assessment was increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000, aligning it with that which applies for Disability Allowance. <\/p>  <p>  -  For carer&rsquo;s who work, the weekly income disregard was increased from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse\/partner. <\/p>  <p>  A more generous means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance has been called for over successive Budgets by organisations representing carers.  An increase in the general weekly income disregard will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and therefore provide an income support to carers, whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities. <\/p>  <p>  The change to the income disregard along with the measure in 2020, whereby the number of hours a carer could engage in employment increased from 15 to 18.5 hours will allow more carers who are in a position to work have a higher household income.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the capital disregard will allow carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings, often to provide sufficient moneys to care for a loved one, to retain these savings without it impacting upon their carer&rsquo;s payment.

Critically, we have definitively taken student loans off the table. We have instead chosen a mixed model of investment, which includes funding from the Exchequer, employers and from students. I have been clear, however, that I want to see the student contribution in higher education reduced in a meaningful way over the course of future Budgets. I want this done in a way which does not negatively impact on the sustainable core funding for higher education. Higher Education Institutions currently receive c.&euro;434m from student contributions. That breaks down as &euro;248m from students and circa &euro;186m from the Exchequer through SUSI. Reductions in such income must be offset through increases in other sources of revenue if the quality of higher education programmes and the ability of institutions to meet growing demand is not to be significantly undermined. In addition the Exchequer currently contributes &euro;340m to meeting the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate students in higher education. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Looking forward to future Estimates processes, my Department will publish an annual cost of education paper in advance of each Budget. This will set out the options available to address financial barriers to education, including changes to the student grant scheme, reductions to the student contribution, and other measures. This will seek to inform Budgetary prioritisation to ensure that we fund the most impactful measures to support students and their families. <\/p>  <p>  In addition it is important to highlight the expanding pathways to post leaving cert education which are accessible to all learners as they prepare for their chosen career. In addressing this, as part of budget 2022, we have removed the Post Leaving Certificate participant contribution fee of &euro;200. This will come into effect in September 2022. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We are working hard to introduce new apprenticeship programmes, such as the ones in bar managing and wind turbine maintenance which we launched in March, and we have also improved the financial incentives on offer to employers to take on apprentices, particularly female ones. We are also working hard to improve pathways from further to higher education as part of our Unified Tertiary System strategy. There should be no barriers for students who want to pursue their chosen educational and career goals. <\/p>  <p>  For the academic year 2022\/23, we will also see significant enhancements to the financial supports that students who need them most receive through the Student Grant Scheme; where: There will be an increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance Grant; The income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant will be increased by &euro;1,000; The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant will be reduced from 45km to 30km. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding by way of the Students Assistance Fund to students in eligible Higher Education Institutions who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. The total allocation for the Fund in the 2021\/22 academic year, including additional Covid supports, is &euro; 18.5 million. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000069#WRO03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":706,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000069#WRO03400"},{"type":"question","counter":707,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[35187\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000069#WRO03500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an apprenticeship for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":708,"content":"<p>Under the Further Education and Training Act (2013), SOLAS has statutory responsibility for planning, funding, and co-ordinating Further Education and Training (FET) in Ireland.<\/p><p>My officials have referred your query to SOLAS for direct reply on this individual matter.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical or GP visit cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE also has a system in place for the efficient provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent ongoing medical care or are receiving end of life care.\u00a0 In these cases, a medical card is issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and completed medical report by a healthcare professional.\u00a0 Additionally, patients who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having\u00a0 a prognosis of 24 months or less are also now eligible for a medical card\u00a0without a means assessment.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, for a period of five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000070#WRP05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":787,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000070#WRP05500"},{"type":"question","counter":788,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[35040\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000070#WRP05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a report on the number of public health nurses in Dublin mid-west in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":789,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000070#WRP05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":791,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[35041\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000070#WRP05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a report on the number  of public health nurses per CHO area in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":792,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000070#WRP06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":795,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[34630\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000071#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 99 of 17 May 2022, if he will report on his Department&rsquo;s role on the recently established Strategic Workforce Advisory Group which will examine and make recommendations around strategic workforce challenges in front-line carer roles in home support and nursing homes; the number of meetings attended to date by representative from his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":796,"content":"<p>Following a call for submissions from relevant stakeholders, I established the cross-departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group in March 2022.

The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card and is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.<\/p>  <p>  If an applicant&rsquo;s income is over the limit for a medical card or GP visit card, they may still qualify for a discretionary card. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.

Women&rsquo;s health remains a key priority for the Government and the Department of Health continue to focus on prioritising the care needs of women affected by mesh related complications.<\/p><p>Uro-Gynaecological (Transvaginal) mesh is used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in women and such mesh devices have been widely used for this over the past two decades. However, in late 2017, in line with emerging international evidence, concerns were raised at national level regarding the frequency and severity of complications associated with the use of transvaginal mesh devices. The then Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved.<\/p><p>In November 2018, the CMO&rsquo;s Report on <i>The Use of Uro-Gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures <\/i>was published. The Report contains a number of recommendations regarding the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures. In July 2018, the CMO had asked the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, pending confirmation of the implementation of specific recommendations in the CMO&rsquo;s Report. This pause remains in place.<\/p><p>In April 2019 the HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan to progress the recommendations detailed in this report and the National Women and Infants Health Programme continue to lead on this work for the HSE. <\/p><p>In relation to the service provisions and supports in place to support women experiencing mesh related complications, multidisciplinary specialist services for women suffering from mesh complications are available via the HSE National Mesh Complications Service, based at Cork University Hospital (CUMH) and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin. This service has been fully operational since 1st September 2021. There are designated HSE contact points and associated care pathways to ensure that service needs can be identified and provided for and all persons affected by mesh are strongly encouraged to access these services via their clinical consultant.<\/p><p>Trans-labial and transvaginal education and training was carried out in November 2021 by a Consultant Uro-Gynaecologist from Croydon University Hospital in the UK, on site in CUMH.

This protocol aims to ensure timely access to care under the Treatment Abroad Scheme for this patient group where clinically appropriate.<\/p><p>A key priority is that all women affected by mesh are offered care. Consequently, women affected by mesh have been strongly encouraged to engage with the relevant HSE contact points and the associated care pathways, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for.
