They fear that their premises will be considered places where criminal offences are committed.  However, it is not possible for them to apply for either the gaming licence or permit.  Their concern is that this will eliminate them.  There is a view that they need a form of bespoke regulation and licensing to manage that particular sector.

My response is similar to responses I have given to representatives of a private members' club on the text submitted.<\/p> <p>  I wish to provide some background.  Early in the debate on the Bill, I made the point repeatedly that the existence of such clubs arises on foot of constitutional protection.  Members' clubs are not governed by the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 or by this Bill.  Thus, according to the advice of the Office of Attorney General, there is no need to accept amendment No. 2.  I am told it would risk confusion and perhaps invite legal challenge.  To the best of my knowledge, many of these establishments are not member-driven clubs in the same way as normal sports clubs.  The membership is frequently not a stable feature and may vary considerably from night to night.  I will outline some of the questions that could be asked.  Who on the committee would be legally responsible for ensuring payment of any taxes to the Revenue Commissioners?  Who would ensure adherence to any money laundering laws?  Who would ensure that visitors to the premises do not engage in excessive gambling?  Who on the committee would direct a sharing of any surplus made by the club between all members?  Who might share the losses?<\/p> <p>  Many of these establishments hold themselves out to be casinos.  I am not in favour of any measure that would facilitate casino operations by the back door.  If we went down that road at this time, these establishments would not be subject to any licensing or regulatory constraints.  I also fear that gaming arcades operating in areas where no local authority resolution is in place under the 1956 Act might be tempted to avail of the proposed exemption with the attendant negative impacts I have already outlined.  I fully intend to address the issue of licensing and regulation of casinos in the context of the major reform work under way.  I contend that is the appropriate place to deal with the matter.  At that time, clubs would have the option to apply for a casino licence under regulation and so on.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make two other points.  Amendment No. 1 proposes governing by committee.  That is all; it goes no further.  We are of the view that neither amendment is needed.  Both amendments could open up all manner of unintended consequences.  As matters stand, there is constitutional protection for private members' clubs.  That is what they call themselves and that is what they are.  The advice is not to accept or support the amendments at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#B01000","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is first and then I will follow up with Deputy O'Callaghan and other members who wish to comment on amendments Nos. 1 and 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#B01100","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The Minister of State should consider tabling amendments on Report Stage, although I take the point he has made.

Some are better run and manage their members well and would be bona fides private members' clubs.<\/p> <p>  There seems to be something of a contradiction to my mind in what the Minister of State said.  He referred to unintended consequences but such consequences could arise if matters are left as they currently stand.  It seems that it could be a criminal offence to organise gaming even with a valid permit or licence.  Would it not make sense to include in this Bill a form of licensing for the sector prior to whatever is eventually proposed in the gambling control Bill?  Those who contacted me are concerned about the uncertainty.  All the unintended consequences to which the Minister of State referred could arise as things stand.  There is a justifiable call for clarity and reassurance.  The best way to provide this would be if the Minister of State brought forward a regulatory framework for the sector within this legislation for Report Stage.

I mentioned this during the Second Stage debate.  I think any of us who have been in touch with or contacted recently by individuals affected by the proposed legislation will be aware that this is a very unregulated yet highly competitive industry.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the legislation generally, I think we all agree that it would be preferable if we had very detailed legislation regulating the whole area of gambling and imposing a gambling regulator that could regulate issues such as private clubs, casinos and so on in a consistent way.  I understand, however, that we do not have that in this legislation.  I commend the Minister of State on bringing forward some amending legislation.  I can see what he is trying to do.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendments Nos. 1 and 2, I had considered tabling similar amendments in this format because I was also contacted by, I think, the Gaming &amp;amp; Leisure Association of Ireland GLAI.  There are many different organisations in this sector.  I did not table the amendments for reasons I do not need to go into.  The GLAI's concern is that if this legislation is enacted, it will find itself outside its parameters.  I do not know whether that is necessarily so.  I know that the GLAI has legal advice stating as much.  What it reveals is that we need to regulate all areas of the gambling business, but at present it appears to be the case that only some will be regulated.  I note what the Minister of State says about private members' clubs.  He seems to think it is not necessary for them to be dealt with in this legislation since they are not covered by it.  There is a lot of strength in that argument, considering that they accept they are not regulated by the 1956 Act, which therefore raises the question, why would amending legislation affect them?  I will give consideration to these issues as well.  I may table amendments on Report Stage but, as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, it might be beneficial if the Minister of State gave further consideration to this before Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#C00100","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Reflecting on what my colleague said, I commend the Minister of State on taking the plunge.

Will it ever come?  What is the Minister of State's timescale for it?  It is vitally important.  Regarding the private members' clubs, gambling is a huge problem in Ireland, bigger than drink or anything else, and we need to tackle it.  I commend the Minister of State on taking these steps now to do so, but how long is his timescale for this happening in the future?

Mobile technology is now moving at such a pace that regulations in certain areas are soon outmoded by dint of advances in technology.  We should therefore take an overarching view.<\/p> <p>  I seek clarification on this amendment.  I note the Minister of State's comments on the 1956 Act.  I would like his confirmation on the following question.  Since the Bill does not speak specifically to private members' clubs, could it be said - and I will be guided by the Chairman on this - that one would in effect, by dint of supporting this amendment, be making new law if one were to seek to amend the Gaming and Lotteries Act?

I will do my best to respond to them.  If I miss something, they might remind me of it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked about GAA clubs and so on.  These amendments have nothing to do with any of them, so there is no cause for concern there.<\/p> <p>  A number of colleagues asked about timelines and so on.  I said in my opening remarks that we would not see the heads of the Bill this year.  I hope to have them early next year.  Not only have we to draft the very complex legislation, to which Deputy Sherlock has alluded - it is extremely complex and is changing almost by the month as more things happen - but on top of that we must set up an authority comprising perhaps 100 people.  It will be very expensive and very complex to make sure we have all the right skill sets in place.  Work on both these aspects is ongoing.  There is no point in passing legislation without having the regulatory authority in place to enforce it, regulate it, research it and so forth.  I hope to have the heads of Bill prepared and ready to roll early next year.  At the same time, we are working on the structure of the authority and what it will look like.  As soon as we have that information ready, I would be interested in coming before the committee and getting colleagues' views as to what we propose to do.  If people have suggestions at that time, I would be interested in listening to them.  That gives the committee an idea of progress on the main Bill and where we are with the authority.  They are two mammoth tasks and they must happen together.  It is not a case of one or the other.<\/p> <p>  Regarding private members' clubs, my understanding is that if all of us here decided to form such a club, under the Constitution we could go away and engage in gambling, provided we are members of a private members' club.  This comes under what is understood as free association.  That is what these clubs in effect facilitate.  They are private clubs made up of members on a list who come in and do their business.  They are also businesses, by the way, and they need regulating.  When the main legislation comes forward there will be an opportunity for such businesses to apply for casino licences, as will be provided for in the legislation.  Such licences will be regulated.  This whole area will be taken up at that stage.  If, however, we take these amendments on board now, we will be moving into regulation and recognising these almost as bona fide casinos.  I am slow to do that at this point.  I do not think any of us wants to do it now when we do not have the regulation in place.  We would also in a way be inviting other groups to come forward to apply to become casinos.<\/p> <p>  That is the effect this legislation could have.  The committee itself is not defined as to how it is made up, what it is to do, how it will be structured and so on, and there are other issues in the legislation.  I am always open to considering colleagues' suggestions or questions on Report Stage, and I have listened carefully to what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has said.  If, however, between now and Report Stage, which will be in the autumn, other issues arise, I will certainly be open to doing things then.  I contend, however, that the amendment, as presented, does not fit into the current Bill, which is very much an interim measure.  The amendment would also have other unintended consequences that I am concerned about.<\/p><p>When we do this, I want to do it properly under the full gamut of robust legislation that covers everything, as I think Deputy Sherlock also said.  We also need a regulatory authority in place to enforce the current law, research it and investigate what is going on out there.  I have heard of casinos in other jurisdictions that are quite profitable but they are in large countries.  In the UK, I think they are not and the big casinos have not opened there.  As my colleagues said, an awful lot of stuff is moving online, which is where we are focusing much of our attention.<\/p><p> When we talk abut gambling, the issue of problem gambling and addiction, rightly, always comes up.  It has been argued that any of us here has a right to go out and gamble if we want to.  It is a free country.  However, if somebody has an illness or an addiction, that becomes a health matter.  People with such an addiction need treatment, therapy and counselling.  Regulation can only go so far in protecting and safeguarding people but, if someone has an addiction, we must be careful and recognise that person has an illness, a sickness and needs counselling, therapy and professional help.  <\/p><p> We can do a certain amount through regulation to safeguard people we have discussed many options previously.  I have been at this for quite a number of years now since the hearing of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I was chair, in 2013 when the heads of the Gambling Control Bill were produced.  Some of the stuff works and some does not.  We will have to be careful when we talk about addiction.  We can do a certain amount to make gambling less attractive and glamorous but we must also be careful to make it fair so that a properly tabulated and regulated machine has correct odds and is fair to gambling punters as a business transaction.  <\/p><p> Those are the reasons I am open to reconsidering anything my colleagues bring forward on Report Stage but, at this time, I am afraid that my advice is not to accept them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#C00600","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I agree with an awful lot of what the Minister of State said.  I agree entirely about the significant damage that can be done and all of the committee members have the same objectives for this and future legislation.  I will not press the amendment but I ask him to consider it over the summer.  He must understand the argument that is being made.  He said that this legislation is not governed by the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and, therefore, it does not affect him.  If he is correct about that, all the arguments relating to unintended consequences apply all the same.  By the same token, somebody could go away and set up that same private members club the Minister of State is talking about tomorrow morning and all the same unintended consequences that might exist if they were to be specifically excluded from the legislation could equally apply.  What if the Minister of State is not right and private members' clubs are covered by this?<\/p> <p>  The argument that they are covered is that, until this legislation, it was not an offence to the same extent to be involved in gaming without a gaming permit or licence.  It will now be an offence and whether or not one has a constitutional right to freedom of association, that does not entitle one to break the law in that environment.  That is the concern.  If the Minister of State is not correct, and private members' clubs are included, then they close down and there are job losses and all the rest of it involved in that.  I would like it if he could take whatever preparations are happening in the Department with the Gambling Control Bill, grab that part of the legislation and put it in here.

If we look at the 1956 Act, we will see that section 14 is in Part 3 which deals with the licensing of amusement halls and funfairs.  We have all become aware of how unusual the legislation in this area is because local authorities can opt in to this Part of the 1956 Act - some have done so, while some have not - which means that different systems are operating throughout the country for amusement halls and funfairs, which is unusual from the point of view of legislation.  The amendments arise from a concern that people are spending too much money in gambling.  Section 14(b) of the 1956 Act states: &quot;the stake in each game is not to be more than sixpence for each player...&quot;.  That is still the law.  At paragraph (d) it states: &quot;no player may win more than the value of ten shillings...&quot;.  That may have been amended subsequently, but it is still extremely low.  The Minister has decided to insert a figure of &euro;10 for the stake and &euro;750 for the prize.  I understand the logic behind this.  The purpose of my amendment is to try to prevent people from spending too much money in gambling.  However, since I tabled the amendment, I have been contacted by people who own arcades to say this would be very unfair on them because there is no restriction on those who gamble online in the bet they can place.  They are asking why they will be being restricted under the new regime in the amount a person will be able to gamble on a machine.  It is a further example of how complicated the issue is.<\/p><p>I will not push the amendments on Committee Stage.  I will consider them further on Report Stage and the Minister should do the same.  I am interested in hearing what the Minister of State has to say to them in response, but clearly we need to update the legislation to ensure it will be meaningful.  If we are to provide in the Bill for meaningful stakes and prizes, they will have to be policed.

I do not understand the science, but there is something about the dynamic of slot machines that results in compulsive behaviour.  It is reasonable that there are maximum stakes and we need to make sure they are right.  I do not believe the three cent, or sixpence, limit is applied in practice, but the rate proposed in the Bill is a huge increase on the rate in the existing legislation.

If they are not being pressed, that is Deputy O'Callaghan's prerogative, but it is my understanding of the way it has been interpreted that, strictly speaking, every line is a game.  One could have 25 lines, on each of which one could place a tenner.  That issue needs to be examined.  One can imagine the matrix in the different lines of fruit, other symbols and so on.  The maximum stake is potentially substantially larger than what is officially set out in the legislation because each line is a game and one can win in each of the several combinations, similar to each line in a Lucky 31 being a separate bet.  I would like the Minister of State to examine that issue as we need to make sure we get it right.

Enforcement is a matter for the enforcement authority, the Garda and others.<\/p> <p>  The amendments proposed relate to the maximum stakes and prices which can be played for on a gaming machine at a licensed amusement arcade under the terms of Part III of the principal Act.  The only role for the Minister for Justice and Equality under that Part concerns stakes and prize amounts.  Section 5 substitutes a new section 14 for that section of the 1956 Act.  The amendment concerns, essentially, the updating of a maximum allowable stake and prize amounts.  These are increased from three cent and 50 cent to &euro;10 and &euro;7.50.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked how we arrived at these figures.  There is no science.  I have seen people, with sandwiches and flasks alongside them, sitting in arcades with bags of coins, just feeding them into machines all day.  One can argue that, whether it is &euro;2 or &euro;10 at a time, people with a problem with gambling will keep going until the bag of money is gone.  Gambling addiction is a problem area.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan mentioned that there are people employed in this area.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, he gambles four times a year.  We will not do a roll call of the rest of us but people have a flutter every so often.  Some people gamble a bit more than others while others have an addiction problem and need help.  It has been said that the stakes and prizes are totally unrealistic and out of date.  We must bring them up to some form of realistic modern amount.<\/p> <p>  A new regulation in section 14 will allow the Minister to amend stake and prize amounts.  Through a statutory instrument, the Minister of the day can actually increase or decrease stakes or prizes.  This will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If whatever figure we finally arrive at is not working, the Minister of the day can change that in co-operation with the Houses.<\/p> <p>  In the past, the stakes and prizes were locked into legislation at three cent and 50 cent.  There has been no primary legislation in this area since 1956.  Deputy Pringle alluded to what was really happening on the ground which is another story.  We are trying to bring it up to something realistic.  The &euro;7.50 prize is the maximum amount.  Obviously, that will probably not happen that often.  If people want to gamble, they will want some kind of incentive or thrill to do it.  By having a realistic prize, people will be inclined to have a go and a bit of fun.  It stops being fun when it becomes a problem.<\/p> <p>  The Revenue Commissioners issued 12,113 gaming machine licences and 94 licences for gaming premises in 2018.  Within the past two years, it has undertaken a major enforcement drive against unlicensed premises and machines.  I very much support this effort and hope it will deal with the issues in question.  My own proposals seek to make it clear that licensed gaming machines should only be located in licensed gaming arcades where a local authority resolution is in place.  Again, I hope the Revenue and Garda enforcement efforts will continue to target unlicensed machines and lead to their removal from public houses, take-away food shops and other such locations.<\/p> <p>  This particular stake and prize amount has been in the public domain since we first published the proposals more than two years ago.  This is the first time it has been examined by the D&aacute;il.  Some colleagues in the Seanad raised it as well.  I am open to looking at this over the summer.  We have to be careful that it is realistic.  We are putting in the provision that it can be changed by ministerial order if it is found to be too high.<\/p> <p>  Several Deputies said there is a thrill to the arcades.  There is as much a thrill in gambling online.  It is silent and hidden, however.  I am far more concerned with the migration to online gambling and how we deal with that.  It is not going to be easy.  I would contend far much more is lost online than in the arcades.  The arcades are limited in their opening times and locations, whereas online is open 24-7.  That is where we will put a lot of our efforts to see how we can deal with that.<\/p> <p>  I understand the amendments are being withdrawn.  I agree to examine them again and communicate with colleagues in order that we can agree on some figures.

I am not an expert in identifying what is the appropriate amount that will be effective in trying to tackle compulsive gambling.  However, that is a matter the Minister of State might need to look at.  It might be the case that one does not specify the amount in the primary legislation and leave it for ministerial regulation.

As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, there are organisations which run bingo games for charities.  For example, if a GAA club wishes to organise a bingo night event, it will need a certain amount of equipment and technology to run it.  The concern is that under the legislation as proposed in the amendment to section 28, it will be precluded from obtaining a licence for the purpose of running this lottery.  Our first amendment is to subsection (8) which states: \"A person who holds a lottery permit shall not transfer that permit to any other person and any such purported transfer shall be void and of no effect\".<\/p><p>What we propose is the insertion of wording to the effect of save where a licensee utilises an agent to conduct a lottery on its behalf.  If an applicant which is a charity applies to the District Court for a lottery licence, it cannot then transfer it to somebody else under this legislation, and charities believe that will change the position that operates at present because currently they can be delegated to be run on their behalf.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say on that.  As amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are in this grouping, my amendment No. 8 proposes that \"in the case of the lottery conducted by an agent of the licensee [which is what we are discussing here], not more than 25 per cent of the gross proceeds shall be utilised for the expenses of promotion, including commission\". Obviously, the legislation can and should place a limit on how much money collected can be used for the profits of an agent running this type of operation.  The objective we want is to ensure that most of money will go to the philanthropic and charitable purpose.  I await hearing what the Minister of State has to say in respect of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#G02500","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I will bring in the Minister of State at this point.

They concern section 12, which substitutes section 28 of 1956 Act with a new section that sets out the application process for a lottery licensed by the District Court.  This section maintains the current maximum prize amount of &euro;30,000.  However, it makes provision for a prize fund limit of &euro;360,000 where a once-off annual lottery is promoted under a District Court licence.<\/p> <p>  The District Court grants a licence to an applicant where the applicant fulfils the conditions laid down in the new section 28. There are significant additional conditions for the prospective licensee to meet.  I contend these are necessary and legitimate requirements to ensure the best promotion of the lottery to guard against fraudulent behaviour and to prevent potential criminal behaviour, including money laundering.<\/p> <p>  Any lottery licensee may appoint an agent or agents to help promote a lottery.  This is permitted by the current law and confirmed by court judgment.  This does not mean, however, that the licensee can abandon responsibility or control of the lottery to an agent.  This would undermine the policy and legislative intention of modernising the provisions on the better promotion of lotteries.<\/p> <p>  The amendments proposed by Deputies O&rsquo;Callaghan and &Oacute; Laoghaire would have the effect of allowing the transfer of a lottery licence issued to an applicant by the District Court to an agent to conduct that lottery.  No checks or controls on such an agent, as are imposed on the licensee, are proposed in the amendment.  There are inherent dangers associated with such an approach.  The proposed amendments would appear to arise from representations from some associations which purport to run commercial bingo by acting as agents of lottery licensees.  I have also received those representations.<\/p> <p>  In my view, despite any assertions to the contrary, no pathway was provided in the 1956 Act for commercial bingo as a profit-driven business for agents or operators acting for licensees.  I do not propose to accept the amendments along the lines proposed for the reasons I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#H00500","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I will first ask the proposers of the amendments if they wish to respond to the Minister of State before I call Deputy Brophy.

This matter appears to be raised in almost the same terms by both amendments.  As has been said, this was discussed extensively in the Seanad.  I note the amendments are the same as the text of a Bill submitted by the national lottery to the Department in 2018 and similar to a Bill tabled by Deputy O'Callaghan at the same time.<\/p> <p>  We spoke to the Office of the Attorney General about this and it is in agreement with the position I set out in some detail in the other House.  There is an issue whereby accepting the amendment might lead to further demands from the national lottery, perhaps seeking to prohibit the local lotteries that support sports clubs and community organisations.  Many of our sports clubs and community organisations depend on lotteries.  We could argue they are in direct competition with the national lottery.  A similar argument to that made by the Deputies is that these lotteries for football, rugby, hurling and Tidy Towns also impact on the turnover of the national lottery.  It could be argued they have an impact on sales.  None of us could agree on doing anything to curtail this activity, which directly benefits local sports clubs and other organisations.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers mentioned that the national lottery is now a private company.  The essence of the amendment seems to be to enhance its position as a private company by seeking to end the possibility of licensed bookmakers, land based and remote, offering bets on the outcome of Irish national lottery draws as they might on any other probability outcomes.  Deputy Fitzpatrick made this point.  The Deputies' proposals would allow licensed land-based or online bookmakers to offer bets on any other lottery but not the Irish one.  Should the Deputies' proposition be accepted, I foresee certain legal uncertainties and potential challenges from licensed bookmakers.  I do not think it would achieve what is intended, which is possibly increased sales for the national lottery.  For information, the turnover of the national lottery in 2015 was &euro;670 million, in 2016 it was &euro;750 million, in 2017 it was &euro;800 million and in 2018 it was &euro;805 million.  There was a 20% increase over four years.  This certainly does not suggest much impact since 2015 on the lottery operator arising from the licensing of bets.<\/p> <p>  The contribution of the national lottery to good causes increased each year.  This is to be welcomed, although such contribution is surely critical to having a national lottery in the first place.  The turnover is increasing every year and there is no convincing evidence that betting on lottery numbers undermines funding for good causes or that it threatens the profitability of the national lottery operator in the long term.  As I said, it is now a private company.<\/p> <p>  In addition, there is no evidence that I am aware of that betting on lottery numbers leads to a loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  Licensed remote bookmakers offering bets on lottery numbers and all licensed Irish betting shops must pay tax on every bet they take.  They must pay the current necessary licence fee.  Bookmaker shops also contribute to the Exchequer by, as has been said, providing many jobs in towns and villages throughout the country.  The product offered in betting shops or online is a bet and not a ticket sale.  I understand Irish bookmakers offer bets on one, two, three, four or five numbers being drawn.  In terms of cost to customers, bookmakers accept bets of 5 cent and upwards while the national lottery minimum stake is &euro;5 for two lines without the plus option.<\/p><p>Online operators normally offer bets on the outcome of the national lottery, EuroMillions and other lotteries, with players having to choose the corresponding numbers relating to those draws.  I have not been provided with any information to suggest that the outcomes of the weekly national lottery draws are exempt from being bet on.  Such is the position with football matches and races.  I may bet on their outcomes without hindrance by the organisers of the events.  I am aware of no argument to suggest the national lottery numbers are afforded some special form of legal or intellectual property protection.  In any representations I have received on this matter, the national lottery operator has advanced no such arguments.<\/p><p> As I stated in the Seanad, I have no function in respect of the national lottery as such.  Regulation of its licensing is a matter for the Minister for Finance under the National Lottery Act 2013.  My Department's role concerning licensed bookmakers under the betting Acts is limited to the provision of certificates of fitness for applicants for bookmakers' licences, remote bookmakers licences and for remote betting intermediaries.  The Revenue Commissioners issue licences after that.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform did not provide in the National Lottery Act for any prohibition on licensed bookmakers offering bets on the outcome of the national lottery draws on Wednesdays and Saturdays, nor did the Minister for Finance address this point during the preparation of the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015.  To the best of my knowledge, there are no conditions or prohibitions imposed in the Betting Acts 1931 to 2015 in respect of the nature and extent of the bets that licensed bookmakers, land-based or remote, might offer.  I am sorry for going on a bit but I feel we must ventilate this.<\/p><p> Deputy Jack Chambers asked about unclaimed winnings.  While I agree with the sentiment he expressed, this is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#K01200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I take the point that the company is private.

The company cannot be treated as any other private company because there is a good causes fund from which the public benefits.  It is in the public interest that the fund remain at a high level.  It is also in the public interest to renew the licence at some stage, potentially involving some other company.  In the meantime, we want a healthy fund and as many clubs as possible to benefit.  That is a reasonable public objective.  I would not have chosen the private company route but that is how matters stand.<\/p> <p>  I listened to what the Minister of State said.  Some of the provisions are technical but, on the principal point, it is increasingly the case that very many people are using online companies to bet on the lotto.  There are other elements also, involving bookmakers and all the rest of it, but the question of catching the first element is the difficulty in drafting the Bill as a whole.  A very substantial sum is potentially being lost out on.  Most European jurisdictions protect their national lotteries and the funds that emanate from them.  Could the Minister of state offer a comment on that or clarify matters?  The current position might be healthy but if the drift continues in the direction of commercially operated lotteries with no public benefit, then the national lottery will be undermined.  Nobody wants to go near a lottery of Bride Rovers or Terenure Tidy Towns, for example, and that is not proposed in this amendment.

I tried to limit it a little in order that it would not cover such situations.  The matter is complicated.  We have had a fairly consensual meeting here.  I might return to this amendment on Report Stage rather than pressing it now.  I do not know whether I will necessarily win the argument in any event.

The citizen who wants to have a small bet on the outcome would no longer be permitted to do so under the amendments.  We would curtail that freedom and those placing such bets would move elsewhere.  The amendments would not have the desired impact except in terms of taking away the freedom of our citizens to have a small flutter, to use Deputy Sherlock's words, on the outcome of the lotto.  If we pass the amendments, those are the people who would be affected.  It would not make any difference to the turnover of the national lottery.

Subsection (1) states: \"The Minister for Justice and Equality shall, not later than 3 months after the commencement of this Act, seek a report regarding the prevalence of gambling on an all-island basis.\"  Subsection (2) states: \"The Minister for Justice and Equality shall, not later than 2 years after the commencement of this Act, cause a report to be prepared on the operation of the Act and shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.\"  The issue raised in subsection (1) of the amendment was also raised in the Seanad, as I am sure members are aware.  It regards the prevalence of gambling in general rather than solely problem gambling.  I share with the Deputy and other members of the committee deep concerns regarding how we can best address the issues of harmful gambling which affect the lives of persons so addicted, their families and wider society.  We are at one in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I always place our approach on this matter in a healthcare context and as being for the attention of relevant qualified professionals.  We must be careful not to come to the view or let others think that if we set up our gambling regulator, that will assist problem gambling to a significant extent.  If a person has an addiction, it is a health issue and we must focus on it from that point of view.  A regulator will only go so far.  If a person has an addiction, no amount of regulation will help; rather, he or she needs treatment.  I agree that we must seek to better understand the issues involved and obtain credible evidence on the nature and extent of the problems arising.  As stated by colleagues, gambling is complex and increasingly taking place in an online environment.  It is a matter for the Department of Health.  Obviously, it is not within my remit to carry out a report on the prevalence of gambling in Northern Ireland.  That should go without saying.<\/p> <p>  The drug prevalence survey for 2014-15 published on 27 February 2019 by my colleague, the Minister for State with responsibility for health promotion and the national drug strategy, Deputy Catherine Byrne, contained the first set of data on the extent of gambling in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The data are based on fieldwork carried out between August 2014 and August 2015.  This general population survey of more than 7,000 persons was a collaborative project between the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol and colleagues in the public information and health research branch of the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>Ipsos MRBI carried out the field work and my Department contributed to the cost of the survey.  While I accept that the survey is perhaps a little dated now, it provides a baseline of data to assist in policy formulation and future planning and action on gambling.  The survey found that the prevalence of problem gambling in the general population was 0.8%.  Problem gambling is most common in young males, at 1.9% among males aged 18 to 24 and 2.9% among males aged 25 to 34.  The Health Research Board is now undertaking a prevalence study for 2018 and 2019.  This will further assist in policy formulation, planning and action in this area.  Results are expected in 2020.  This survey will contain a specific section on gambling prevalence with an extended range of questions.  My Department is contributing to the costs of that survey.<\/p><p> While I welcome the concerns that motivate the proposed amendment, I believe that the Government is addressing those concerns through the large-scale professional work by the Health Research Board which is now under way.  We should await those results.  I do not think there is any point in duplicating it.  The first part of the Deputy's proposal risks imposing a significant cost on the Exchequer.  As we are doing it already, I do not see any reason why we should do it twice.  The second part of the proposal seeks to impose a requirement to carry out a two-year review of the operation of the Act.  This period is one normally found in legislation.  My Department will review the provisions of the amended Gaming and Lotteries Act as we work to bring forward proposals for the comprehensive reform of licensing and regulation of gambling in Ireland.  I do not see any particular need to impose this review provision.  I hope that comprehensive legislative proposals for reform will be published in this period.  We are doing substantial work in tandem with this.  I ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing the amendment because this is only an interim measure.  I want to have the limited resources that we have focused on getting the regulator established and the larger Bill drafted and enacted.  If we were to take resources away to do a review of this Act while doing the other at the same time, it may be counterproductive.  I can see the intention of the Deputy's amendment but I think it will happen anyway as we work on the larger Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#M01400","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>We have to be careful.  I have raised the issue of gambling addiction with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  The Department of Health has no interest in dealing with this issue.  The Department of Justice and Equality can keep deflecting from gambling addiction but the Department of Health and the HSE have no interest in doing anything for anyone with a gambling addiction.  If one talks to any front-line health professional, there is no support at all for people with an addiction related to gambling.  As someone who is preparing to regulate the industry and potentially impose levies on it and provide a social fund for it, I think the Minister of State is obliged to front up on the healthcare aspects of this.  We are all fed up with hearing the old Whitehall model of excuse, that it is a different Department's responsibility.  We hear about interdepartmental collaboration and cross-departmental engagement in respect of climate change in particular.  The Minister of State should take the lead on the addiction issue because the Department of Health has no interest.  It has not implemented Crystal Fulton's recommendation on a gambling addiction strategy.  I do not believe that the health system will provide for those with a gambling addiction in the short to medium term.  It is an opportunity for the Department of Justice and Equality to do something.  Perhaps it could develop a private pathway for those with a specific addiction.  It is not good enough to keep deflecting to the Department of Health because, as the Minister of State knows as well as I do, it will not do anything about the problem.  We have to flag that now because if any of us are here in years to come, the Department of Health will have done nothing about this.  Together with my former colleagues, Mick Wallace and Clare Daly, I submitted parliamentary questions on it to which the Department did not even respond.  We need to see more from the Minister of State and his Department, which is trying to do something about it.  I support the amendments from Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire because if it gets the Department to start fronting up, that may be good for people in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#N00400","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I take on board what the Minister of State has said about the amendments and that work is ongoing on the other Bill, such that there is no need to proceed with these amendments because there is a duplication of work.

I think it is essential to have a review clause in all legislation.  I hear what the Minister of State said, as my colleague has said, that this is interim legislation and that he will come back to address the area again.  I echo what Deputy Pringle just said.  Is the Minister of State against the idea of a review in principle?  I understand that he is saying this is interim, so there is no need for it.  We asked for a review of the Parole Bill and the Minister said no.  Standing Order 164A was quoted, stating that reviews take place anyway.  That review is extremely limited.  There is an attitude among various Departments that a review is not necessary because it is an extra burden on the Department.  It seems to me that it is an essential part of any legislation if we are genuinely interested in effecting change although I understand the caution if this is interim legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#N00700","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":171,"content":"<p>On the issue of gambling addiction, research and treatment, the Department of Justice and Equality does not have the health expertise to deal with treatment.

The main legislation which we are working on will provide for a social fund.  There will be levies on the industry, which will be made available for treatment, research, education, raising awareness and so on.  When it comes to treating people who have an illness, I respectfully suggest that this is not the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality but of the Department of Health.

We are undertaking major reform in this area and that is the legislation which should be reviewed after it is published.  This is a small, interim Bill and it does not do much at the end of the day, though what it does is important.  There will not be much to review.
