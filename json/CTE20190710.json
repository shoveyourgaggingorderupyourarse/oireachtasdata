As the Chair said, I am joined by Mr. Robert Deegan who is principal officer in the Department's energy efficiency and affordability division.  Energy efficiency has long been a part of Irish energy policy.  It is deemed to be the first fuel.  Energy efficiency measures are among the most cost effective methods for reducing emissions.  The buildings sector accounts for approximately 24% of Ireland&rsquo;s total energy usage and approximately 10% of our overall greenhouse gas emissions.  For that reason, it is very much centre stage in the all-of-Government climate action plan.<\/p> <p>  To date, the central plank of efforts to drive demand for energy efficiency upgrades has been grant schemes funded by Government and administered by the SEAI.  These include free upgrades for households in energy poverty; fixed grants for a defined list of energy efficiency measures, covering approximately 30% of the total cost; and a pilot scheme offering 50% grants for people who want to upgrade to an A3 deep retrofit.  The total funding allocated for these schemes for 2019 is &euro;85 million.  Overall the funding for energy in the Department's Vote has an increased from about &euro;50 million in 2015 to &euro;140 million in 2019.  <\/p> <p>  Since 2000, more than 400,000 homes have received direct support under these schemes, mostly for lower intensity measures rather than deep retrofitting.  Despite this investment, more than 80% of homes still have a building energy rating, BER, of C or lower. When compared with other European Union, EU, countries our homes use 7% more energy and emit nearly 60% more emissions.  The Government has accepted in the all-of-Government action plan the need to redouble efforts to improve the efficiency of our homes.  This is central to the plan.  <\/p> <p>  The plan represents a significant step-up in ambition.  Indeed, it is not just a step up, it is almost a new staircase.  It sets out, for the first time, 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also puts Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  The plan also sets out new governance arrangements that will be put in place to provide effective oversight of implementation of the plan.  This very much aligns with the relevant recommendations from the Oireachtas and the Citizens' Assembly.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding targets for retrofitting homes, the climate action plan has identified a target of upgrading 500,000 homes to a BER of B2 or cost optimal equivalent, by 2030 as well as the installation of 400,000 heat pumps, to replace older heating systems.  This is an enormous step up and a real challenge.  The plan identifies a range of actions that will drive achievement of the retrofit target.  A central commitment in that regard is the development of a new retrofitting delivery model, which will group retrofits together to achieve economies of scale, leverage private finance, and ensure easy payback methods.  The savings on energy bills from using less energy can help fund this, while homes will be warmer, produce lower levels of emissions and be better for us all.<\/p> <p>  Other measures identified include reviewing and redesigning the grant schemes to ensure alignment with Government objectives and value for money and the introduction of improvements to the BER certificate to provide more guidance to homeowners.  In addition, all buildings undergoing a major renovation, greater than 25% of the building envelope, must bring the rest of the building up to minimum BER of B2 or cost optimal equivalent.  Interactive tools and reports for homeowners will also be developed to identify the impact of energy efficiency upgrades.  There will also be development of the supply chain and training and, crucially, strengthened regulatory and fiscal measures.<\/p> <p>  Achievement of the target will be supported by Project Ireland 2040 with a financial allocation of &euro;3.7 billion to 2027.  This is clearly a significant level of Exchequer investment, but the Government and Ministers have repeatedly acknowledged this will not be enough to meet the level of retrofit required.  That is why it will be important that we move to establish a new retrofitting delivery model, which will support people to make the decision to play their part in addressing climate change by investing their own money in upgrading their homes.  The plan sets out a range of actions to identify additional financing options, including affordable loan schemes that will complement the new delivery model and fill the funding gap.  The plan also commits to the introduction of enhanced delivery models and supports for households with lower incomes.<\/p> <p>  We are at the start of implementing a climate action plan.  It is an enormous task.  Significant progress has been made but we have more to do.  We must now learn from what has worked in the past as well as the experiences in other jurisdictions to design the additional interventions required to meet the Government&rsquo;s new level of ambition for energy efficiency and carbon emissions.<\/p> <p>  We are very happy to be here and we will work as best we can with the committee to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Manley"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Manley and I call Mr. Flannery from the Tipperary Energy Agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#B00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Are we not going to do the questioning-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#B00500","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>No, I am going to let all of the witnesses give their opening statements first and then the members can come in to ask questions of whomever they want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#B00600","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562713200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for the opportunity to present today.  Declan Daly and I represent the Tipperary Energy Agency, a non-profit social enterprise with 26 staff supporting the low-carbon energy transition.  Tipperary Energy Agency has been successfully retrofitting homes throughout Ireland since 2005.  SuperHomes Ireland was created by the agency in 2015 with the aim of becoming a one-stop shop for home energy retrofit.<\/p><p>The European Commission and Parliament have identified the importance of one-stop shop solutions where homeowners can get advice, access to contractors, quality control, grants and finance, all in one place.  By the end of 2019, SuperHomes will have worked on more than 160 deep retrofit projects to BER A3 standard or better, and a further 59 homes to B2 standard.<\/p><p> The increase in carbon taxation and the target of 500,000 homes to be retrofitted to a minimum B2 standard, as set out in the national climate plan, will have a profound effect on how citizens approach energy in their home.  A high-quality retrofit product, on the scale proposed, will require significant investment in developing skills and standards in the sector.  This can be supported by a predictable long-term funding programme, which will also help with disseminating a clear message to the public and allow people to plan for their retrofit.  Financial packages, with low interest rates, tailored towards deep renovation will be necessary to build significant scale in the market.<\/p><p> Not only does deep renovation improve the long-term health of occupants, decrease energy costs and reduce carbon emissions, it produces high-quality job opportunities.  The deep renovation of one home supports an average of one job per year in terms of direct, indirect and induced jobs.  The SEAI deep retrofit pilot programme has demonstrated that there is an appetite in the industry.  However, major skills shortages are already restricting delivery of retrofit projects and driving up costs.  Addressing this shortage of skills will be key to maintaining a high-quality retrofit product that produces positive connotations in the public mind, thereby encouraging uptake.  Our model involves working with local engineers and contractors to build capacity in that area and provide technical and funding support to these projects.  We will be working with 29 separate contractors in 2019.  This approach and the approach taken by other independent energy agencies and community programmes will continue to be an important component in capacity development and industry training.  However, a widescale roll-out of deep renovation is fully reliant on an escalation of training programmes and standards, including new standards in training for heat pump installation.<\/p><p> A year-round, predictable, funding programme offers assurances to contractors, engineers and tradespeople that it is worthwhile to focus their resources towards deep renovation and will encourage businesses to enrol their staff in high standard training programmes.  At present, deep renovation programmes heavily concentrate project delivery in the period from June to October, creating a virtual standstill in delivery during the months between November and March.  A long-term programme will address this resource imbalance faced by contractors and service providers.  A complicated application process and short timelines for delivery create uncertainty and risk, which restrict market development and ultimately make Ireland's targets more difficult to achieve.  In our view, the State should prioritise de-risking renovation rather than increasing financial incentives to unaffordable levels.  A reliable funding model will also make the dissemination of grant supported solutions to the public much more straightforward, with the benefit of greater citizen engagement in the transition.<\/p><p> Low cost finance tailored towards deep renovation will be a theme that will emerge across the board today.  From our direct engagement with homeowners, it is evident that the finance offer has to make sense to members of the public at an instinctual level.  The question is whether they will be happy to upgrade their homes from a D rating to an A rating, for an additional &euro;2 to &euro;4 per day or &euro;100 per month for ten years, and repay the capital investment by the end of this term.  If we want to scale the market, we need affordable financial packages for homeowners, tailored towards deep renovation.  Successful schemes, such as the German KfW renovation programme, offer finance between 2% and 4%.  A long-term, predictable retrofit programme will undoubtedly create a more favourable lending environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Flannery","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562713200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Our insight into the market is based on upgrading approximately 400,000 homes over more than 15 years.  This is of a total stock of 2 million so it is a significant proportion.  This has been at a range of levels, predominantly shallow retrofit.  It is important that we begin to understand these distinctions.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the challenge to 2030, whereby we speak about 500,000 homes, right now through our programmes and the obligated parties, which are the energy supply companies, we can track upgrades and approximately 50,000 people per annum complete energy upgrades to their homes.  This does not include others who do not approach the grant programmes or the obligated parties and those who perform home improvements but do not seek a grant.  In terms of the scale of activity, we need to bring these people to deeper interventions and facilitate them.<\/p> <p>  We need to understand what we have in the building stock.  There are approximately 2 million homes in Ireland, with approximately 1.7 million of them occupied according to the most recent census.  Slightly less than 10% of these are in public ownership or funded by the public purse through approved housing bodies.  This becomes very important because if we understand the status of these homes and have a long-term plan for retrofit, we can create an aggregated portfolio that could be easier to finance.  Looking at this portfolio can allow us to think about it as a battery we can access in an economic downturn, retaining skills and jobs distributed throughout the country and taking advantage of lower cost construction during lean years.  Part of the plan should be looking at the opportunity of addressing a downturn.<\/p> <p>  More than 800,000 homes have building energy ratings, BER.  The key point is to look at where the general spike in ratings is.  Most homes are rated at the lower end of C and the upper end of D.  When we talk about a B2 level of ambition we need to understand where we are coming from and going to.  Interestingly, a spike is developing in A2 and A3 ratings as a result of our highly advanced building regulations.  That spike will continue to grow as we deliver newer houses.  The decline in the number of D and E ratings, which are yellow and orange in the graph, is largely because of the retrofit we have achieved.  Retrofit generally attacks this basket and we can already see the impact of the measures we are taking.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the performance to 2030, our deep retrofit programme seeks to examine the technical, financial and supply chain challenges to getting our housing stock to where it needs to be by 2050.  It also looks at houses that are poorly performing.  We are looking at a change from an F rating up to an A rating.  If we consider where the housing stock in Ireland is on average, which is somewhere between the ratings of C and D, and we know the ambition in the climate action plan is to reach a B2 rating, it is a different size of step we are talking about.  It has different technical and financial asks.  This is something that is very important for all of us in the climate space to understand and communicate consistently to people.  We are not always asking people to put &euro;50,000 or &euro;70,000 into their home.  We are asking something different.  We need to be clear about this and rational in our economic planning for it.  Interestingly, we have upgraded a home to deep retrofit for &euro;20,000.  We have also upgraded a home for &euro;125,000 because there is no typical Irish home or typical performance.  The average is slightly lower than &euro;50,000, just to give a perspective.<\/p> <p>  In terms of aggregation and finance models, a one-stop shop is the Holy Grail.  What is absolutely factually correct is that there is a range of one-stop shop models, with various funding methods, financing propositions for the consumer, back end funding, whether a national bank or the European Investment Bank with alternative investment funds, and various people who catalyse this activity.  In certain countries, it is a combination of Danfoss and VELUX - purely private sector entities - bringing something to the market.  In other countries, such as Ireland, there is a mixture of private sector and not-for-profit organisations bringing something to the market.  In other countries again, it is purely delivered by a national or regional local authority as we traditionally understand them.  What is important here is that there is no silver bullet that we can pluck off the shelf and say that is what we need to do.  We need to think carefully about the risks involved, how we communicate to people in such a way that they want to do it and how we create the supply chain and the financial ease with which it can be executed.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to underplay the role of skills in the supply chain.  Tipperary Energy Agency has already said the skills shortage is a key element that is stifling the delivery of homes in the marketplace.  Separately, it is driving up costs.  We need volume to drive down costs.  We also need more skills in the market to ease delivery and get more volume through the pipeline.  We have been working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the National Standards Authority of Ireland and Wexford and Waterford Education and Training Board, and supporting others indirectly, to make sure those skills are provided but it is a challenge for us.  If we experience an economic downturn, what will be needed to come through it is the skill set and volume I mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562713200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for the opportunity to come before the committee.  The climate action plan places a huge responsibility on the construction industry to deliver 500,000 retrofits in our existing housing stock.  Our message today is very simple.  We are saying the industry will step up, expand our capacity, invest in the required technology and develop workers' skills and competencies in this area.  Of course, there is a \"but\".

We are currently stepping up to deliver these ambitious strategies.  We will also do so for the climate action plan.<\/p> <p>  However, it is important to warn the committee that delivering the climate action plan in addition to these strategies will require innovative programmes to help industry develop its capacity to deliver the deep retrofit programme.  Certainty, in terms of an implementation strategy and grant availability, is essential so that the hundreds of SME construction companies that will deliver the retrofit programme will make the significant upfront investment required. <\/p> <p>  Achieving this ambitious strategy will require more co-ordination with industry and across Government agencies than heretofore has ever been achieved in this jurisdiction.  For example, in 2016, DKM and Solas identified a potential demand for an additional 100,000 workers in the industry up to 2020.  Since mid-2013, an additional 1,000 people per month have joined the industry and the demand for construction activity in infrastructure and housing continues to increase dramatically.  The deep retrofit will require further expansion of the construction workforce at a time when we are approaching full employment. <\/p> <p>  Currently, the industry is partnering with Solas, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and through the construction sector group, to increase the numbers of people working in the industry.  However, it will be critical that the Government co-ordinates these actions and allocates resources committed to in the human capital initiative to developing and dispersing deep retrofit competence and other climate change techniques across the 45,000 companies operating in construction.<\/p> <p>  The climate action plan clearly identifies the significant scale of the challenge and how Ireland will achieve its 2030 targets for carbon emissions and key actions to achieve a net zero carbon emission score by 2050.<\/p> <p>  The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, worked closely with Engineers Ireland on its recent report, State of Ireland 2019: A Review of Housing Infrastructure in Ireland.  We identified a clear roadmap, including financing skills, that should be put in place.  Co-ordinated public investment in infrastructure is essential in delivering our new housing policy and it will be likewise for this particular programme.<\/p> <p>  The industry welcomes the ambition over the next 30-year time horizon.  To have any chance of success, we need to start to make a series of concrete actions today.  This will be challenging considering the 183 actions outlined in the plan.  Action 43, for example, outlines the need for an analysis of existing retrofit actions and the identification of the optimal mix of deep and medium home energy efficiency upgrades across the country.  This analysis will only commence in quarter one of 2020.  This means that the delivery window for 500,000 retrofits will be closer to eight and a half years rather than ten. <\/p> <p>  The CIF also believes that, to be effective, any retrofitting scheme must address houses in their entirety from an energy efficiency perspective.  If the scheme has too narrow a focus on single aspects of improvement, it will not deliver optimum results for the consumer, the industry, the economy and of course the environment. <\/p> <p>  As I have said this will require a huge amount of co-ordination between industry and several Government Departments, including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Finance, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  We are suggesting that an advisory group with industry, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is established with a view to implementing and monitoring against specific targets.  I cannot stress enough the importance of giving certainty to construction companies so that they know there is a pipeline of work ahead which will encourage them to make the funding that is necessary for upskilling and so on. <\/p> <p>  In terms of developing the required certainty, it is worth noting that the existing pilot programme for deep retrofit is due to expire this year.  Ensuring the SEAI is fully resourced to process applications for the current pilot programme is a necessary confidence measure.  Industry responded when the pilot programme was announced with many investing in their capacities to deliver retrofit activity.  <\/p> <p>  The recent example of the home renovation incentive shows how effective these sorts of measures can be for the industry, Government and citizen.  Irish homeowners have spent more than &euro;2,471 million in total carrying out 147,349 home improvement projects over the past four years.  If the incentive is there, the capacity of the industry to respond is also there.  It shows what can happen with the correct alignment between consumer, Government policy and industry&rsquo;s capacity. <\/p> <p>  The retrofit scheme has the potential to underpin our efforts to build a stable and sustainable construction industry.  This stream of work, and that included in the national development plan and Project 2040, can be used to give comfort to young people and their parents that there are viable long-term careers in construction.  The Government, with industry, should also examine the potential opportunities for the development of apprenticeships in areas such as deep retrofit and the message that there are stable and sustainable careers arising in the industry should be communicated to young people. <\/p> <p>  The retrofit scheme could help resolve the growing divide between Dublin and other regions which is a major threat to our economic and societal well-being.  I heard the T&aacute;naiste talking yesterday about concerns over a hard Brexit and the potential loss of 50,000 to 60,000 jobs.  There is certainly scope within the retrofit scheme to provide significant bundles of work for regional construction companies and these companies are dispersed throughout the country and across every community in the country.  Having contractors delivering retrofit in rural and urban areas would provide an economic lifeblood to rural and regional towns and villages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Parlon.

That has an impact on the skill sets of people who want to do this on a year-round basis.  The activity is only in a relatively short period of time so people cannot concentrate on that work alone.<\/p> <p>  What is the long-term proposal that will come from the pilot deep retrofit programme?

There is not another pot with &euro;30,000 to &euro;50,000 there to spend on this kind of programme.  It is not that people do not want to do it but I certainly get the sense that people, in general terms, cannot and will not be able to afford it. <\/p> <p>  When Mr. Manley talks about green finance, it is going to require significant backing of the State.

We have seen examples on the Continent and they have been referenced by the Tipperary Energy Agency in terms of what is on there.<\/p><p> In terms of the time of works, the allocation of work is around the Estimates cycle.  At the end of the year we know what is coming in the following year and then we notify it to the SEAI and it maps out the programme for the following year.  That is something which we need to take on board, in particular as we scale the programmes and get them to a much larger size.  It was also mentioned by Tipperary Energy Agency.  There is no particular restriction on the time of year he work is done but, practically, if people are going to recoup the grant, they will have to make their claim through the contractor and provide the receipts and invoices to the SEAI and the Department by year end.  Typically, we clear off our accounts in the last week of November and the first week of December.  That all acts back and narrows down the time.  It is a fair point on that one.<\/p><p> The most difficult question is the long-term position on the pilot programme.  It was made very clear that it was a pilot programme.  The objective was to establish what the supply chain is like; how we can develop it; how we could mobilise people to do it and what works.  As Mr. Gannon said, no two houses are the same so one must look at how one manages that.  The pilot phase should come to a conclusion at the end of this year and then it has to be reviewed and a decision must be made on which bits work and which bits we must improve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Manley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Are applications still being accepted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#E00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562713200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>The short answer is that I do not know.

It is traditional that we have a closing date for the programmes.<\/p> <p>  I will quickly pick up on the other point, which relates to finance.  I will go back to the slide where I showed what deep retrofit means and what is involved in moving from where the average house is to B2.  We are not asking everyone to look at &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000.  What we are saying to people is we need to collectively understand that a B2 level retrofit is something smaller than that.  Looking at the cost optimal study we completed for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government when it was looking at the renovation regulations, that could be &euro;15,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;25,000, which is still a lot of money.  We still need to get over that hump.<\/p> <p>  A key point in someone's decision-making cycle will be the purchase of a house.  It is perhaps the only point in time when one is talking about an even bigger sum.  In Europe, they are now looking at green mortgages where it is being considered whether finance could be facilitated with a lower mortgage rate for a better house.  Domestically, the home renovation incentive has worked and we need to look at tax rebate in the UK.  They are also looking at stamp duty rebate and whether that would incentivise an upgrade at the point of purchase.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, we have tested finance for retrofit with the credit unions, some of the high street banks and an employer model with a number of different employers, which operates like the bike-to-work scheme whereby they would finance and work through the salary on their side of the net.  No one has been static on this.  Reflecting on Europe, in no jurisdiction do they have a single offering that works.  It is important for us also to understand that in Ireland a single offering may not work, and that a certain demographic might always need grants.  For some, it might be at the point of mortgage and for others it might be taxation.  We need to think of a blend, but we do not have the answer yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>We have a few minutes left in the slot.

The Government's climate action plan refers to 300,000 heat pumps.  We know from our field visit to the Tipperary Energy Agency that it is not just about replacing the heat pumps.  If I was to get a heat pump in my house, because of its age, I would have to replace all the radiators.  Multiple items would have to be replaced; it is not just a case of replacing the boiler with a heat pump.<\/p> <p>  In other committees the time ticks down in terms of the amount allocated to the questioner rather than the combined question and answer time.  I have limited time.  Could the witnesses comment on the challenges of retrofitting 1970s and 1980s apartment complexes?<\/p> <p>  One of the most impressive pieces of work we did was the field trip organised by the Tipperary Energy Agency and Tipperary County Council.  As far as I know the agency provides a one-stop-shop, so if I want to retrofit my house I go to the agency, get the BER organised, it finds out what range of retrofit I want and it provides accredited engineers and companies so that we do not get cowboys.  We need to consider a similar model either on a county-by county basis or at national level.  As Deputy Dooley said, one of the greatest challenges that faces us when we decide to retrofit is that we get bamboozled with the volume of information coming at us.  Second, because of the amount it will cost, people are entitled to the best advice and not to have a cowboy or cowgirl come in and fleece us for a low-rate job.

There are always going to be costs associated with the work but the value to the homeowner should be evident right from the outset.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the reference earlier to a costing of &euro;50,000, that is probably an average of what we see, but there is no one particular house; there is a multitude of houses.  The price may go from &euro;30,000 to &euro;70,000 or even beyond that.  That is an eye-watering sum for anyone to consider, so the transition must be explained to the homeowner in a clear way.  People must know what they are going to get and have confidence that what has been recommended will deliver it.  We can see from our analysis of work that we have carried out that 60% to 70% in savings is possible.  When one does it properly, one can see the long-term payback.  One can work it out.  When one blends it with the right type of financial offer and the closer one brings that to ten or 15 years the more sense it will make to the public.  The message must be communicated very clearly by an independent professional that is trusted.  That is our view in terms of how we go forward.<\/p> <p>  The pilot programme has been very successful in terms of switching contractors and others onto what it means to deep retrofit but it is a pilot and we acknowledge that.  We are looking forward to a scheme that is year 'round.  The timescale for delivery is March-April to November-December, which may be extended, but they are the confines in which we are working.  What we do find with those constraints is that contractors who are trying to dedicate themselves to retrofit in the long term let go staff or take staff on a part-time basis and that will limit their capacity to deliver.

Thus, if someone does energy efficiency work on a house, it is guaranteed for 35 years.  How we do that without locking out the small contractors, who will not be able to get the bonding and insurance related to finance of the level in question for that period, will not be not easy.<\/p> <p>  With regard to smart finance, the relevant action in the climate action plan is No. 54.

There is not much point in doing so unless we get the delivery model right.  If we put too much money into the system too soon, it will simply result in an escalation of price.

There is the shallow one and then there is the deep retrofit.  Could I get a breakdown of the figures for shallow retrofit versus deep retrofit?  Some colleagues have rightly said that when people hear that it might cost &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000, they shy away.  It is almost like breaking it down into chunks and explaining to people that shallow retrofit is the road to it.  Not many people would have the entire amount to do their homes.  Given that the most inefficient houses in this State were built before 1979, which was when the idea of energy saving and insulation first came in, I note that 50% of our housing stock is pre-1979.  Obviously, theses house are the most expensive ones to retrofit.  They involve the deep retrofit about which we are talking.  As 72% of homes in rural areas are detached houses, we are talking about large areas.  Our homes are larger than the European average.  We have more rooms per person.  We seem to live in luxury but in the cold.  It is a bigger area in its entirety to retrofit, not just by unit but by square acreage - whatever measurement is used - so we have more to retrofit.  Given the really prohibitive costs, which most people would say that they cannot afford, the green economy, greening our environment and electric vehicles, those demands are almost coming at us because we are being made to feel guilty about what we are doing.  Sometimes that is contraindicated in terms of people taking responsibility and getting something out of it for themselves because there is a feeling of punishment and dipping into our pockets once again.  We are only shortly out of a massive recession that did a lot of damage to people in this country.  Would it be worthwhile prioritising the interventions, whatever they may be - shallow or deep retrofits - for pre-1979 homes given that they make up 50% of homes in this country?  Another issue is doing it chunk by chunk focusing on attic and roof insulation with the draughtproofing.  We did it previously in the 1980s.  Other issues include low energy lighting, the lagging of water pipes and tanks and the shallow retrofit that is relatively affordable and much more easily grasped by people.<\/p> <p>  For a while, I have been very curious about the material used for insulation on the exterior - what is known as wrap-around.  We saw the horrific fire hazards shown in the Grenfell Tower fire.  How combustible is that material?  Have we figured that out?  It is not just about homes.  There was a fire at a hospital in Melbourne last week that involved wrap-around insulation.  Parts of some hospitals in Britain have been shut down for a number of months or years to take off all this cladding.  This cladding can be very dangerous for householders, hospitals and schools.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#G01700","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>The Senator has used up five minutes of her ten-minute slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#G01800","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Insurance costs have skyrocketed on the back of this insulation material.

Yes, the numbers are large.  It could be up to &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000.  I bought my house for less than that when I bought it many years ago.  It is a very large sum of money.  That is why we are looking so hard at the long-term financing option and delivering that at a very low cost of interest over a long-term period in order that things can happen.  The simple reality is that dealing with climate change is not free.  If it was, we would have done it before.  We must make changes now.  We would not have used petrol or diesel if it had always been cheaper to do other things.

Is the Department's policy going to punish them as opposed to people who are wealthy and can afford to insulate their homes?  In addressing this issue, how will the Department ensure the just transition?  I assume that it is not referring to companies that sell petrol on the side of the road or to other companies that produce polluting products, but to householders and, since public transport is not good enough, people who drive cars.<\/p><p>Is the SEAI concerned that the better energy warmer homes scheme and the warmth and well-being pilot scheme, which provide supports for retrofits, are limited to those who are in receipt of the fuel allowance and that people who are just over the eligibility criteria cannot avail of them?  The Government has set its face against raising the eligibility criteria.  What do the delegates from the SEAI think of this point?  I meet the people affected every week.  Elderly people, people with disabilities and so on tell me that they would like to retrofit their homes but, because their incomes are just over the threshold, they cannot benefit from the schemes and the costs of the other schemes are too punitive for them.  For those over the eligibility criteria, the costs are generally punitive.  Do we not need something that is much more radical in this regard?  I do not know whether my next point has already been discussed, but if the ESB or the State in some shape or form gave people grants upfront, could the difference between their current emissions and the reductions that would result from the retrofitting be the basis of any repayment of grants?  In other words, they would never pay more as a result of getting a loan and the grant would still be repaid because it is only the difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#H02000","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I might ask the delegates from the Department to answer the questions to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#H02100","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562713200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Regarding the Deputy's first question, there are long-term externalities.  For example, the cost I impose if I drive a diesel car and the cost of the diesel itself are not the same.  That applies to us all when we do something that imposes a cost on others that we do not pay for ourselves.  This is not demonising anyone.  Rather, it recognises that the person making the decision is sometimes not the person who bears the cost.  This issue has been examined.<\/p> <p>  Regarding criteria, there is a finite sum of money available for most of the schemes that we fund and the SEAI operates.  Those criteria seek to prioritise a group of people in that space.  If we expanded eligibility, we would expand the financial demand, but how would that be financed?  We recognise that, if there is a cut-off point and someone is just a tiny bit over it, it can seem very inequitable.  However, that is where it is at.<\/p> <p>  On the suggestion of the ESB, any of the other energy companies or a different State body having a role, we see that as part of the future whereby part of the savings that a person makes - there is a range of allowances in that regard - could form part of the scheme's financing.  Some people are able to finance changes themselves, while others cannot.  Currently, we provide 100% financing for those in the most difficult circumstances.  The climate action plan makes clear that the scale of investment required across residential and other sectors cannot be done by a Government cheque.  There simply is not enough money to pay for it.  It is a question of finding a balance between that and creating grant supports and other financing mechanisms so that we get done what needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#H02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Manley"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I next invite Mr. Gannon and Mr. Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#H02300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562713200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>The two questions to us are inter-related.

Generally speaking, it is those who cannot pay whom we try to address through the warmer homes programme.  Although we do not have empirical evidence, we noticed throughout the recession that those with an ability to pay constituted a declining cohort.  They are often referred to as the squeezed middle.  There was a dearth of activity in that area.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the second question, there is probably no single solution for Ireland.  In light of how other countries intend to approach financing homeowners, it is likely that there will always be a cohort who can only be activated through a grant.

It was examined in Ireland in 2013 and 2014, but conditions did not seem right.  As part of the review in the all-of-Government action plan, though, it must be considered as an option, given that it works.

Aggregation is defined in the climate action plan as an area-based approach, which would bring together a standardisation of approach, aggregation of skill sets, aggregation of finance and aggregation of expertise.  This is very much in focus.  Action No. 46 provides for setting up a taskforce on that, which is already being activated.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of landlords, it is a very difficult issue to manage because the current position of those in the rental sector is very difficult.  It is a very tight market at the moment and increasing the standards in an already tight market is difficult to manage, but it does have to be part of our future.  It is very much in focus and is also identified in the climate action plan.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about Energiesprong method.  It is cited as one of the examples in the programme.  It is a very attractive proposition that provides a total offering to the householder whereby they get a technical assurance as well as the physical work.  It brings finance to the process also.  It is fine to say it is a good model but we need to look at how it might be made to work in Ireland.  Our tenure is very different from that on the Continent.  We do not tend to have corporate bodies with large housing stocks on similar sites where they can actually decant one group and move people through it.  Nonetheless, the system offers the future.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of ventilation, I am not an expert and I am sure the representatives from Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can be more accurate on that question with regard to how one looks at managing airflow in a very tightly sealed building.  The sealing of a building in itself will not work, so airflow is important.<\/p> <p>  On the 30 year period for finance, it would not be set in stone.  When looking at very large sums of money for deep retrofitting of housing spreading that at near zero cost over longer periods can make it a much more attractive proposition.  Again, it is an element that has to be looked at.  Action No. 54 in the climate action plan looks very much at developing a new financing model.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that if we were to move away from the smaller grants it would not be very attractive, but action No. 52 - the third bullet point - proposes to develop the proposal for the phase-out of grants for shallow energy retrofitting measures by 2022.

They pick the shallow retrofits.  When the difficult conversations come around on switching from fossil fuels or putting on solar panels are the high cost options.  The shallow retrofit costs in the region of &euro;3,000 but once the homeowner does that it makes it difficult for the likes of us at the coalface to go out to the homeowners and convince them to do the difficult things such as the windows, the heat pump or the external cladding, which are the expensive works.

That sort of security allows the homeowner to borrow at a much lower interest rate.  They typically borrow at rates of 2% or 2.5%.  Those rates are a game changer.  We can all identify the problem we are seeing at the moment, which is slow finance that is not tailored towards renovation.

Smart systems and programmes are designed to tell heat pumps not to come on at 6 p.m., when everyone is going home to cook his or her dinner.  Because one's house is well insulated, the heat load comes down drastically.  One programmes the system to come on at noon or 2 p.m. when everyone is at work.  One programmes the heating system to tell it not to come on during the peak periods; one preheats one's house by telling the system to come on in the evening.  As a heat pump is designed to be always on, the peak usage will be taken out of the grid once we install more heat pumps in the system.  In addition, research has been carried out into a smart tariff, whereby people are incentivised by being charged a higher rate after 6 p.m., but in the middle of the day it drops to perhaps 8 cent instead of 18 cent.

A couple of themes have been touched on into which I would like to dive a little more.  It is good to hear that the scale is increasing, but we want it to increase even further.  The question of aggregated solutions is important.  In that context, I was particularly interested in the better energy communities scheme within the SEAI.  The scheme seems to be one in which the driver must come from a community.  Is it one in which a much more active role could be played in seeking to encourage, target or co-operate, for example, on incentivised or larger subsidisation offers to communities?  In other words, rather than relying on the push coming from the individual or a collection of individuals, we could look to have a real pull factor and a push in how we build.  Clearly, there is economy of scale in costings in that regard.  If we are looking to move towards large-scale and aggregated actions, might there be something said about financing?<\/p> <p>  One of the other issues that has been coming up consistently is the core requirement for predictability.  Some of the issues surrounding predictability seem to concern finance flow.  We really cannot afford to have these issues block the flow.  The other issue concerns public buildings, in respect of which a very constructive proposal was made.  Then there is the idea of retrofitting.  Predictability is important, not just for the construction industry but also for employees.  I sit on the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We have dealt with the issue of insecure work in the construction industry, where people are paid as individual contractors, rather than as employees.  Again, longer term contracts could prove to be an incentive in that regard.  Similarly, I expect pressure to be put on companies to reflect the insecurity their employees face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019071000002#M01300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>May I bring in Mr. Gannon to respond to those comments?

The better energy communities model grew from an area-based model which sought to look at a certain locality, parish or electoral area to get the community involved.  The more successful schemes had that aim in mind.  With a programme such as this, one always sets a bar, whereby there is an evaluation matrix.  Particularly where we have co-ordinators or intermediaries whose businesses are dependent on it, whether it be a social enterprise or a private sector business, they tend to move towards satisfying that matrix.  We have better energy communities projects coming through.  They could consist of three homes on Inishmore, two on Arranmore and three in Sligo and some businesses.  We are trying to bring it back to an area based model over time.  With an area based model we can look at predictability.  A contractor can come into a specific area and mobilise in a much smaller one.  A key component is the sustainable energy communities network.  What we are trying to do is generate awareness and a competency and empower local communities to be confident enough to do some of this work themselves, while providing them with support and experts.  However, we want them to do it, instead of having an organisation coming in as the expert and, because there is expertise, charging a premium.  There are nearly 300 communities to be found in every county in Ireland.  We provide them with support and mentors and there is oversight and funding to deliver their own master plan.  That is the final point.  As it is the community's master plan, we do not prescribe how it should defines its low-carbon future.  The community defines it; we just give it the expertise.

The years preceding the broadcast and, indeed, the weeks since have been an incredibly difficult journey for me and my family.  I have been unable to work since 30 May 2018.<\/p> <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to outline my experience of the background behind some of ESB&rsquo;s non-compliance issues.<\/p> <p>  First, with regard to propane gas, ESB Networks staff use propane gas primarily to heat plastic type insulation.  In April 2015, ESB Networks staff ignited a high-pressure gas main in Knocklyon in Dublin.  The subsequent investigation found serious shortfalls across three broad categories: training; documented safe system of work; and safe tools and equipment.  The risk was so large that the ESB Networks health and safety programme board committed to resolving all the issues by June 2016.  This commitment preceded my appointment to the role of technical development manager.  However, once I came into the role I started receiving ongoing complaints from staff as regards hot works issues.  What brought the issue to a head was that most of the actions from the investigation were not started by December 2017 when a near carbon copy incident occurred in the UCD campus in Belfield.  Thankfully, no one was seriously injured that time.<\/p> <p>  I raised the propane gas issue as one of 20 risks in February 2017 in what I understood to be a protected disclosure.  However, in the 12 months post February 2017, I received six different instructions from senior management on how to progress the propane gas issue and despite my best endeavours I received no commitment on resources, senior management buy-in or finance in that time.  That led to understandable frustration on my behalf.  I understand a full roll-out has been happening since I submitted protected disclosure No. 4 to the Minister in January 2019.<\/p> <p>  Second, with regard to fluid-filled cables, ESB Networks has approximately 120 km of high voltage cables which use a mixture of fluids as an insulating medium.  As per the agreed PR3 submission to the regulator, they contain 300,000 l of oil.  The annual leakage rate over the past 20 years averaged 50,000 l per annum.  That is a leakage rate of 17%; in the worst years it ran at 30%.  UK utilities using similar cables have a leakage rate of approximately 2% annually.  ESB is an associate member of the UK based Energy Networks Association, which provides expert guidance on dealing with fluid-filled cable leaks.  The average leakage rate of 50,000 l compares poorly against the ESB Networks policy target of 15,000 l per annum.  In 2017, five cable circuits were shown to have an environmental risk rating of nine and were all non-compliant with both the UK and ESB standards.<\/p><p>The PR4 submission to the regulator by ESB Networks referred to environmental risk 23 times.  Although the replacement fluid is biodegradable, 90% of the fluid employed by the ESB contains some element of mineral oil, and the internal ESB guidance is quite clear that ESB Networks is obliged by law to design out and manage the environmental risk posed by leakage from fluid-filled cables on its network.  It is my understanding that leakage detection and minimisation performance have improved since I submitted protected disclosure No. 1 in January 2019.<\/p><p> Third, regarding sulphur hexafluoride or SF6 reporting, in February 2017 I raised an issue concerning maintenance, repair and calibration of SF6 handling equipment.  Due to resource constraints since 2013, these high-cost units were not subjected to any oversight as regards a maintenance regime.  This was causing significant issues for front-line staff as regards complying with the F-gas directive.  The more I looked into the overall SF6 issue, the more concerned I became.  Once again I raised any issues I came across with management along with proposed solutions.  However, SF6 did not seem to be a priority.  I escalated the Moneypoint leakage issue in August 2017 and I understand that the reporting to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, was amended following this.  However, I was instructed after this by a senior manager not to raise any other environmental issues within ESB Networks.  Moneypoint 400 kV substation leaked more SF6 gas in 2017 than the entire of the UK transmission network.  As per the F-gas directive, records are to be kept for five years.  However, there has never been a coherent national approach to SF6 reporting, and our regime will not stand up to external scrutiny across any of the 18 high-voltage supervisor areas.  This is an institutional fault, not any individual's fault.  However, front-line staff may be exposed to draconian personal liability if they knowingly keep topping up a leaking device.  It is my understanding that significant improvements to the SF6 gas handling and reporting regime have been made since I submitted my protected disclosure No. 7 to the Minister in January 2019.<\/p><p> Fourth, regarding flexible earths, in June 2016 I was asked to go to the UK to carry out an in-depth study of ESB Networks' earthing practices on foot of allegations made by a supplier of earthing material to ESB Networks.  Rather than debunk these allegations, the study validated many of them and also showed other areas where ESB Networks were not aligned with minimum industry standards in the UK.  I expected that this report would be acted on within a reasonable timeframe.  However, it was not until the disaffected supplier contacted the Health and Safety Authority that ESB Networks started allocating proper resources to resolve the issues.  It is my understanding that further improvements have been made since I submitted protected disclosure No. 4 to the Minister in January 2019.<\/p><p> It is with a profound sense of regret that I find myself before the committee washing the dirty linen of a company for which I have worked all my adult life and to which I owe an awful lot.  I continue to try to operate in the best long-term interests of the ESB, and this has taken a very heavy toll on my personal and professional life.  The ease with which the ESB can choose which parts of its own procedures and policies, and indeed national and European legislation, to comply with and which parts to ignore is not a work practice that is sustainable in the current climate or which aligns with the company's purported values.  I take some succour that the ESB is now a more compliant and safer utility for its workers and the public on foot of my actions.  I do not regret appearing on the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" episode \"ESB Leaks\".  I am perplexed, however, as to how it ever got this far.  I offer my time to all State agencies and any subsequent investigations which require clarification on any of the issues I have raised.  I also wish to place it on record that I never acted with malicious intent.  I was simply trying to live by the ESB motto, \"Never turn a blind eye\".  I was also trying to do the right thing for my colleagues' safety at what has turned out to be substantial personal cost.

I have been trying to understand how we got to this point.  We are a very large player in the Irish industry.  The various State agencies should have oversight of us but we have far more technical expertise than somebody who comes in from outside.  We would not get away with some of the things we were getting away with in the UK because the regulators there have the required expertise and experience to ask the real questions and hold suppliers accountable.  For example, oil leakage is published annually in the UK in a public report that anyone can see.  It is listed as a percentage of overall oil usage.  Leakage of sulphur hexaflouride, SF6, is reported annually in the UK.  If a provider leaks it must account to Ofgem - the British equivalent of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU - for why it leaked.  Providers are penalised financially for leaks.<\/p> <p>  Anecdotally I have heard that Belgium only has leakage equivalent to seven bottles of SF6 gas.  I do not know how true that is but having spoken to the various experts in the company, my best guess is that Ireland leaks somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 bottles of SF6 gas.  Moneypoint has been leaking for years and we have been putting SF6 gas into it.  We have always viewed SF6 as an &euro;800 bottle of gas, but it is not really.  I viewed it as a potential &euro;50,000 fine.  The guys there are incredibly conflicted.  I have found this throughout the country.  They are expected to keep gassing up breakers that leak on a regular basis.  If the engine of a car was leaking one could just keep topping it up with oil, but that is not sustainable in the long term.  SF6 gas seems like a relatively benign issue, but 1 kg is the equivalent of 24 tonnes of CO2.  The way we handled it was not sustainable in the current climate.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Did the handbook Mr. O'Loughlin mentioned come out in 2012 or 2013, at roughly the same time as the other reforms?

As I said earlier, the people whom I contend are the more farsighted in the company reckon I have done it a massive service because we have been compelled to grasp very difficult nettles, such as the SF6 reporting.  Staff are asked to go out and regas breakers that are continually leaking.  That is a clear breach of the F-gas directive.<\/p><p>Is the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, an oversight or a policing authority?

There are many clever people in ESB at the other side of the table pushing back on what I am saying but the figures speak for themselves.  In the submission to the regulator we continually say why we need to do this work and that it is environmentally damaging.  On the other hand, we are saying that the cable fluid is biodegradable.

ESB has always been a company that strives to do the right thing.  For over nine decades we have worked in and with communities enabling development and better standards of living.  Over that time, we have evolved our work practices, adopted new technologies and dealt with the legacy of older technology in a proactive way.  Notwithstanding the fact that in recent years we have made significant progress on the safety and environmental issues raised, we recognise that we can do more.  I would like to address a number of the significant matters raised in the recent programme.  At the outset, I note the Chair's advice.<br\/><br\/>The 3,000 staff of ESB Networks install, operate and maintain the electricity distribution system and install and maintain the electricity transmission system.  We use our network of over 180,000 km of lines and cables to connect and provide services to 2.3 million customers in homes, farms and businesses throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  Our role is connecting people and businesses to the electricity they need.  ESB Networks also has a key role supporting the national climate action plan.  We work to create a brighter future for the communities we serve and lead the transition to a low carbon future powered by clean, renewable electricity.  This involves connecting more renewable generation so that 70% of electricity comes from renewables by 2030.  We also distribute that clean electricity to facilitate the decarbonisation of heat, transport and industry.  <br\/><br\/>The programme raised the issue of fluid filled cables.<b><\/b>Without wanting to minimise in any way the challenges we face relating to legacy fluid filled underground cables, they were for many years the technology of choice for electricity networks in cities all over the world.  That leaves ESB, along with the many worldwide utilities operating city networks, with the ongoing challenge of managing fluid filled cables for many years to come, although these cables now make up less than 1% of Ireland&rsquo;s underground cable network.  The fluid is an essential component of the electrical insulation of the underground cables in question and the fluid is readily biodegradable.  Notwithstanding this, we know it is important to minimise and eliminate the leakage which can occur, for example, as a result of damage from construction activity or deterioration of the outer casing of the cables.  We have taken many concrete steps to improve, and our current performance in 2019 is comparable with that of our international peers and comparators.  Those concrete steps include replacing almost 20% of underground fluid filled cables so far, thereby removing the source of 40% of the historical leakage, and investing in specialist detection equipment that allows us to track down leaks more quickly.  Our current rate of fluid leakage is in line with international comparators at 10 cu. m per year.  We have reported the rate of fluid usage in underground cables annually to our sectoral regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, since 2007.<\/p><p>Our records show five occasions over 26 years, since 1993, when cable fluids spilled into water.  In each case we notified the relevant local authority, Waterways Ireland, or both, and immediately mobilised an environmental response.  However, we acknowledge and accept that a greater and more systematic level of liaison with the relevant local and other statutory authorities on cable leaks would be appropriate.  That is happening.  <\/p><p> SF6 gas is a standard insulating gas used in switchgear all over the world.  It is specified by the international manufacturers of modern switchgear because its properties make it particularly good in providing the insulation and arc suppression required to safely operate high voltage switchgear.  At ESB Networks we comply with the requirements of the EU F-gas directive and have reported our annual usage of SF6 gas to the EPA since 2006.  One of the characteristics of SF6 gas in switchgear is that a certain level of leakage is anticipated.  Until 2019 ESB Network&rsquo;s SF6 gas usage was higher than that of peer comparators.  It was primarily an issue with HV switchgear at our Moneypoint transmission substation.  Now that the switchgear has been de-energised, taken out of service and replaced, our SF6 gas usage will be significantly lower.  This was a major project started some years ago and it has now finished.  The switchgear has been de-energised in the last month or so.<\/p><p> It is important to address the aspects of safety culture raised in the programme.  For many years the ESB has invested in an open culture to encourage employees to identify and report safety issues or potential safety issues of which they become aware.  We believe they are a leading indicator, increasing people&rsquo;s involvement in safety issues and cumulatively reducing the likelihood of injuries.  ESB Networks has over 3,000 highly trained and very committed employees who, between them, raised over 4,500 good catches in 2018.  We acknowledge and appreciate the commitment of all those who openly raise safety suggestions, believing this to be the key to a continuous safety culture.  For example, the decision to replace the hand-held propane gas blow-torch referenced in the RT&Eacute; television programme came about as a result of our employees identifying issues and reporting incidents in their use.  After a review process, that model of torch was replaced.  We have a well resourced safety organisation which audits, reviews and supports safety performance in dealing with any issue or incident raised in the normal course of daily operations. Our safety and environmental systems are audited annually and accredited to OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 standard.<\/p><p> The ESB has a very clear policy on speaking up.  We provide comprehensive support for employees who feel the need to speak up, including a 24-hour confidential helpline that can be accessed by phone or online and an opportunity to directly contact the ESB&rsquo;s group internal auditor.  ESB Networks is an open organisation.  The issues highlighted in the RT&Eacute; television programme had been identified as part of our safety and environmental reporting systems and many had already been the subject of internal review, investigation and action.  With the disclosures from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, any concern raised that had not been investigated within ESB Networks was assigned for investigation.  The investigations were carried out by people with the appropriate expertise from areas of the ESB outside ESB Networks or using external specialist expertise, where appropriate.  At the request of ESB&lsquo;s chief executive, we are also commissioning an external review of the potential for environmental impact of ESB Networks operations to ensure our internal assessments are comprehensive.<\/p><p> I would like to address aspects of security and the reliability of the Dublin city network raised in RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s television programme.  The Dublin city electricity network, including the underground fluid filled cables in question, has been designed, configured and operated to provide a high level of security and reliability typical of any modern city.  The high and medium voltage network is monitored 24\/7 in real time using a modern operations management system.  Accordingly, customers in Dublin, whether domestic or business, enjoy a reliable, resilient and high quality electricity supply.  The ESB has always been a company that strives to do the right thing.  Throughout our history we have evolved our work practices, adopted new technologies and dealt with the legacy of older technology in a proactive way.  Notwithstanding the fact that in recent years we have made significant progress in safety and environmental performance, including in dealing with the issues raised, we recognise and acknowledge that there are a number of areas where we could and should have done more.  We recognise the opportunities for further improvement into the future.  My colleagues and I will be happy to address questions committee members may have on these or relevant matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hayes and his colleagues for coming before the committee.

A document is being circulated to members with pictures of four types of fluid filled cable.  All cables have the same components: copper as a conductor - that is what carries the electrical power; an insulator which stops the power from escaping the conductor; an earth sheath around the outside to ensure the cable operates safely; and another covering which forms a protective outer layer.  In the illustration provided for members in the top left hand diagram the fluid passes through the centre of the conductor and the insulating medium is paper on the outside of the copper, but the fluid seeps into the paper and it is the combination of the fluid and the paper which provides the isolation.  The image on the top right hand side shows a different construction.  It is a three-phase cable.  The fluid passes through the copper pipe on the outside of the cable.  The image on the lower left hand side shows a different construction again.  The fluid is not in separate ducts and the cable is immersed in it.  The diagram on the bottom right hand side is of the modern cable.  Plastic is used.  No fluid is used as an insulating medium.  Our new cable is of this XLPE construction and there is no need for fluid.  Our network has 25,000 km of cable, of which less than 1% is fluid filled.  The cables were installed largely between the 1950s and 1970s.  The last of it was installed in 1989.  It is a technology which has been moved away from across the world, but all large cities have legacy cables that are managed.  There are also leakages which they also must manage.  It is not an issue which is unique to Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Mulvaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Mr. Mulvaney is comfortable that it is absolutely biodegradable, certified and tested to the standard identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#R00500","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562713200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Mulvaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I assume the EPA will have a view on the matter when it completes its investigation.

I was shocked by the contents of the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  My sense of the ESB is that it is a big professional organisation.  I was an ESB employee for three years.  Even then its motto was \"Never turn a blind eye\", though that was a few decades ago.  As the ESB is seen as a reliable company with a huge emphasis on safety and on workers being well treated, there is some concern when an issue like this crops up.  The ESB will need to carry out a number of projects over the coming years because ESB's networks will require a huge upgrade to deal with the electrification of transport and greater electrification of many sectors due to climate change.  New infrastructure will be installed, some of which already has planning permission.  It is important that both the public and members, as public representatives, can defend and stand over the ESB's record as our company, that is, as a State company.  We want it to be a safe pair of hands in constructing networks, installing infrastructure and operating safely and I am sure that is what the ESB also wants.<\/p> <p>  The revelations in this programme are damaging.  There is a question about whether the leaked material is oil or fluid and whether it is biodegradable.  In the real world, equipment and infrastructure installed up to 60 years ago are now past their best-by dates.  The water network is in the same position and replacing that network also is a challenge.  However, it is better that we know what is wrong and that these issues are brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.  In this case, the relevant local authority, Dublin City Council, knew what was happening and brought it to the attention of the Environmental Protection Agency.<\/p> <p>  It was said that what leaked from the underground cables is biodegradable.  However, a confidential ESB document shows the ESB had been fully aware of the environmental hazards caused by those leaks since 2009, which is concerning.  The document also states the Inchicore circuit presents the highest environmental risk due to the fact that its route runs parallel to the Grand Canal.  That shows there already was some concern at that point that the environmental impact was severe.  It went on to state that an acid replacement and maintenance report on the Grand Canal in Dublin was conducted in 2014, and that ESB Networks had considerable difficulties accessing that route's cables in order to repair leaks.  The report claimed this was an area where leaks \"could present a very high environmental impact\".  Between 2012 and 2014, 10,000 l of oil leaked into the waterway alone.  It is hugely concerning that this was not brought into the full light of day at the time.<\/p> <p>  Representatives from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, were before this committee yesterday.  The ESB has to make a pitch to the CRU if it wants to do a capital upgrade.  As I recall, the ESB looked for spending of &euro;20 million between 2011 and 2015 for upgrade works of this type but only &euro;6 million was used.  I am trying to balance this in my head, while trying to be fair to the ESB.  I understand that was during the austerity period and that the ESB was subject to austerity like everyone else.  Why, however, was this allowed to go on when it had authorisation to spend &euro;20 million?  Why was there not a more open process in dealing with this?  No matter how bad a situation, it is always better that the relevant authority knows what is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#T00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I will bring the witnesses in on this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#T00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562713200,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Mulvaney to address that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Hayes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562713200,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Stanley.  He has raised a number of different issues and I will try to get to all of them.<\/p> <p>  First, he mentioned a specific leak and said that a certain amount of fluid went into the canal.  However, that fluid did not leak into the canal.  There was a leak from a cable near the canal, but the canal banks are impermeable clay structures for keeping water in, and so the only way for fluid to get into the canal is to go in over the top.  As that particular cable is 1.2 m below the level of the canal, no fluid from that particular leak got into the canal.  Having said that, it was a big leak and it took more time to find than to repair.  The repair itself is a tricky piece of work but finding the leaks in these cables can be quite challenging.  The traditional method for finding a leak in a cable, which might be a number of kilometres long, is to dig a hole halfway along the cable, bring liquid nitrogen down to freeze the cable, and then monitor the pressure on either side of the frozen piece to see which side the leak is in.  That must be done a number of times to find the leak.  We have invested in a newer technology where gas is put into the fluid and a detector essentially sniffs that gas out.  However, that technology did not work in the case of that leak because it was right under the middle of a very busy road and the old method of digging and looking for the leak took a long time. <\/p> <p>  The Deputy's last point was about the ESB's spend.  We agree work programmes with the regulator on a five-yearly basis when we cover various price reviews and agree a programme of work we are going to get done.  Over the last number of price reviews, we have changed out 44 km of that underground fluid-filled cable, which brings the total length of the cable network down to 177 km.  We did this using a risk-based method, whereby we replaced the cables with the history of most leaks first.  By taking out 20% of the cables, we got rid of 40% of the leaks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Mulvaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Mr. Mulvaney said that 177 km of cables remains.

Assuming the gas is penetrating the ground, one can home into the leak within a radius of 3 m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#U01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Mulvaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Are the repair works successful?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#U01800","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562713200,"counter":412,"content":"<p>Yes, the repair works are successful.

As I am not a technology expert, I am not too sure where this gas is used but I understand Mr. O'Loughlin's concern was that its use was far in excess of international best practice and that the reporting, monitoring and accounting of its use did not give an accurate assessment of what was happening.

It is used as an insulator and is a very good insulator.  It also has arc suppression qualities.  If one flicks a light switch, one might get a spark which is fine but if the voltage is very high, it is very important to have an arc suppression medium in place when doing that.  SF6 is good for doing that.  That is why it is used around the world in distribution and transmission systems as an insulation.  As a consequence, the equipment can be much smaller than if one was using a different medium.  That is important when we are trying to build stations which are required in urban or other areas where land can be difficult to get.  It is used all over the world for that reason.<\/p> <p>  SF6 is a greenhouse gas and we are mindful that we have to manage its usage.  The F-gas directive was issued in 2006 and updated in 2014.  We are constantly improving what we do.  Some equipment that has SF6 gas has been on the system and in use for a long time.  Moneypoint power station was built around 1980.  This relates to the fact that we are always trying to get better at what we do.  In 2015, we had a suite of management procedures on how to deal with and manage SF6 procedures.  In addition, we are looking at our inventory.  I spoke about our inventory of equipment and noted that we are keeping a record of the equipment we have.  We are constantly improving in this regard, as I explained.  Under the regulations in place at the time, information on the exact amount of gas in the switchgear was not required.  All of our newer equipment is in compliance with the current regulations and it is clear exactly how much SF6 gas is in that type of switchgear.  We are always trying to improve the inventory and that has been happening.<\/p> <p>  There is some leakage and we acknowledge that.  The leakage rate in comparison to other international utilities has been higher.  Part of the reason for that was the older switchgear that was put in place in Moneypoint in the 1980s.  That has now been replaced by newer switchgear and we are already seeing the impact of that.  When building a transmission station one needs a number of years to retire the old gear and bring in the new gear because it is a big job.  Our usage of SF6 gas in 2018 was significantly less that it was in 2017 because we had already moved some of the circuits from the old Moneypoint switchgear into the new switchgear.    <\/p> <p>  Ireland has 60 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.  To place SF6 gas usage into context, it equates to 0.027% of Ireland's overall greenhouse gas emissions.  That is not to minimise the fact that we have to manage it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#V00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Quane"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>SF6 has a potency 23,000 times greater than CO2 in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071000002#V00900","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562713200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Yes, it has.

They fear that their premises will be considered places where criminal offences are committed.  However, it is not possible for them to apply for either the gaming licence or permit.  Their concern is that this will eliminate them.  There is a view that they need a form of bespoke regulation and licensing to manage that particular sector.

My response is similar to responses I have given to representatives of a private members' club on the text submitted.<\/p> <p>  I wish to provide some background.  Early in the debate on the Bill, I made the point repeatedly that the existence of such clubs arises on foot of constitutional protection.  Members' clubs are not governed by the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 or by this Bill.  Thus, according to the advice of the Office of Attorney General, there is no need to accept amendment No. 2.  I am told it would risk confusion and perhaps invite legal challenge.  To the best of my knowledge, many of these establishments are not member-driven clubs in the same way as normal sports clubs.  The membership is frequently not a stable feature and may vary considerably from night to night.  I will outline some of the questions that could be asked.  Who on the committee would be legally responsible for ensuring payment of any taxes to the Revenue Commissioners?  Who would ensure adherence to any money laundering laws?  Who would ensure that visitors to the premises do not engage in excessive gambling?  Who on the committee would direct a sharing of any surplus made by the club between all members?  Who might share the losses?<\/p> <p>  Many of these establishments hold themselves out to be casinos.  I am not in favour of any measure that would facilitate casino operations by the back door.  If we went down that road at this time, these establishments would not be subject to any licensing or regulatory constraints.  I also fear that gaming arcades operating in areas where no local authority resolution is in place under the 1956 Act might be tempted to avail of the proposed exemption with the attendant negative impacts I have already outlined.  I fully intend to address the issue of licensing and regulation of casinos in the context of the major reform work under way.  I contend that is the appropriate place to deal with the matter.  At that time, clubs would have the option to apply for a casino licence under regulation and so on.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make two other points.  Amendment No. 1 proposes governing by committee.  That is all; it goes no further.  We are of the view that neither amendment is needed.  Both amendments could open up all manner of unintended consequences.  As matters stand, there is constitutional protection for private members' clubs.  That is what they call themselves and that is what they are.  The advice is not to accept or support the amendments at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#B01000","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is first and then I will follow up with Deputy O'Callaghan and other members who wish to comment on amendments Nos. 1 and 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#B01100","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":485,"content":"<p>The Minister of State should consider tabling amendments on Report Stage, although I take the point he has made.

Some are better run and manage their members well and would be bona fides private members' clubs.<\/p> <p>  There seems to be something of a contradiction to my mind in what the Minister of State said.  He referred to unintended consequences but such consequences could arise if matters are left as they currently stand.  It seems that it could be a criminal offence to organise gaming even with a valid permit or licence.  Would it not make sense to include in this Bill a form of licensing for the sector prior to whatever is eventually proposed in the gambling control Bill?  Those who contacted me are concerned about the uncertainty.  All the unintended consequences to which the Minister of State referred could arise as things stand.  There is a justifiable call for clarity and reassurance.

The GLAI's concern is that if this legislation is enacted, it will find itself outside its parameters.  I do not know whether that is necessarily so.  I know that the GLAI has legal advice stating as much.  What it reveals is that we need to regulate all areas of the gambling business, but at present it appears to be the case that only some will be regulated.  I note what the Minister of State says about private members' clubs.  He seems to think it is not necessary for them to be dealt with in this legislation since they are not covered by it.  There is a lot of strength in that argument, considering that they accept they are not regulated by the 1956 Act, which therefore raises the question, why would amending legislation affect them?  I will give consideration to these issues as well.

Since the Bill does not speak specifically to private members' clubs, could it be said - and I will be guided by the Chairman on this - that one would in effect, by dint of supporting this amendment, be making new law if one were to seek to amend the Gaming and Lotteries Act?

I will do my best to respond to them.  If I miss something, they might remind me of it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked about GAA clubs and so on.  These amendments have nothing to do with any of them, so there is no cause for concern there.<\/p> <p>  A number of colleagues asked about timelines and so on.  I said in my opening remarks that we would not see the heads of the Bill this year.  I hope to have them early next year.  Not only have we to draft the very complex legislation, to which Deputy Sherlock has alluded - it is extremely complex and is changing almost by the month as more things happen - but on top of that we must set up an authority comprising perhaps 100 people.  It will be very expensive and very complex to make sure we have all the right skill sets in place.  Work on both these aspects is ongoing.  There is no point in passing legislation without having the regulatory authority in place to enforce it, regulate it, research it and so forth.  I hope to have the heads of Bill prepared and ready to roll early next year.  At the same time, we are working on the structure of the authority and what it will look like.  As soon as we have that information ready, I would be interested in coming before the committee and getting colleagues' views as to what we propose to do.  If people have suggestions at that time, I would be interested in listening to them.  That gives the committee an idea of progress on the main Bill and where we are with the authority.  They are two mammoth tasks and they must happen together.  It is not a case of one or the other.<\/p> <p>  Regarding private members' clubs, my understanding is that if all of us here decided to form such a club, under the Constitution we could go away and engage in gambling, provided we are members of a private members' club.  This comes under what is understood as free association.  That is what these clubs in effect facilitate.  They are private clubs made up of members on a list who come in and do their business.  They are also businesses, by the way, and they need regulating.  When the main legislation comes forward there will be an opportunity for such businesses to apply for casino licences, as will be provided for in the legislation.  Such licences will be regulated.  This whole area will be taken up at that stage.  If, however, we take these amendments on board now, we will be moving into regulation and recognising these almost as bona fide casinos.  I am slow to do that at this point.  I do not think any of us wants to do it now when we do not have the regulation in place.  We would also in a way be inviting other groups to come forward to apply to become casinos.<\/p> <p>  That is the effect this legislation could have.  The committee itself is not defined as to how it is made up, what it is to do, how it will be structured and so on, and there are other issues in the legislation.  I am always open to considering colleagues' suggestions or questions on Report Stage, and I have listened carefully to what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has said.  If, however, between now and Report Stage, which will be in the autumn, other issues arise, I will certainly be open to doing things then.  I contend, however, that the amendment, as presented, does not fit into the current Bill, which is very much an interim measure.  The amendment would also have other unintended consequences that I am concerned about.<\/p><p>When we do this, I want to do it properly under the full gamut of robust legislation that covers everything, as I think Deputy Sherlock also said.  We also need a regulatory authority in place to enforce the current law, research it and investigate what is going on out there.  I have heard of casinos in other jurisdictions that are quite profitable but they are in large countries.  In the UK, I think they are not and the big casinos have not opened there.  As my colleagues said, an awful lot of stuff is moving online, which is where we are focusing much of our attention.<\/p><p> When we talk abut gambling, the issue of problem gambling and addiction, rightly, always comes up.  It has been argued that any of us here has a right to go out and gamble if we want to.  It is a free country.  However, if somebody has an illness or an addiction, that becomes a health matter.  People with such an addiction need treatment, therapy and counselling.  Regulation can only go so far in protecting and safeguarding people but, if someone has an addiction, we must be careful and recognise that person has an illness, a sickness and needs counselling, therapy and professional help.  <\/p><p> We can do a certain amount through regulation to safeguard people we have discussed many options previously.  I have been at this for quite a number of years now since the hearing of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I was chair, in 2013 when the heads of the Gambling Control Bill were produced.  Some of the stuff works and some does not.  We will have to be careful when we talk about addiction.  We can do a certain amount to make gambling less attractive and glamorous but we must also be careful to make it fair so that a properly tabulated and regulated machine has correct odds and is fair to gambling punters as a business transaction.  <\/p><p> Those are the reasons I am open to reconsidering anything my colleagues bring forward on Report Stage but, at this time, I am afraid that my advice is not to accept them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#C00600","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I agree with an awful lot of what the Minister of State said.  I agree entirely about the significant damage that can be done and all of the committee members have the same objectives for this and future legislation.  I will not press the amendment but I ask him to consider it over the summer.  He must understand the argument that is being made.  He said that this legislation is not governed by the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and, therefore, it does not affect him.  If he is correct about that, all the arguments relating to unintended consequences apply all the same.  By the same token, somebody could go away and set up that same private members club the Minister of State is talking about tomorrow morning and all the same unintended consequences that might exist if they were to be specifically excluded from the legislation could equally apply.  What if the Minister of State is not right and private members' clubs are covered by this?<\/p> <p>  The argument that they are covered is that, until this legislation, it was not an offence to the same extent to be involved in gaming without a gaming permit or licence.  It will now be an offence and whether or not one has a constitutional right to freedom of association, that does not entitle one to break the law in that environment.  That is the concern.  If the Minister of State is not correct, and private members' clubs are included, then they close down and there are job losses and all the rest of it involved in that.

If we look at the 1956 Act, we will see that section 14 is in Part 3 which deals with the licensing of amusement halls and funfairs.  We have all become aware of how unusual the legislation in this area is because local authorities can opt in to this Part of the 1956 Act - some have done so, while some have not - which means that different systems are operating throughout the country for amusement halls and funfairs, which is unusual from the point of view of legislation.  The amendments arise from a concern that people are spending too much money in gambling.  Section 14(b) of the 1956 Act states: &quot;the stake in each game is not to be more than sixpence for each player...&quot;.  That is still the law.  At paragraph (d) it states: &quot;no player may win more than the value of ten shillings...&quot;.  That may have been amended subsequently, but it is still extremely low.  The Minister has decided to insert a figure of &euro;10 for the stake and &euro;750 for the prize.  I understand the logic behind this.  The purpose of my amendment is to try to prevent people from spending too much money in gambling.  However, since I tabled the amendment, I have been contacted by people who own arcades to say this would be very unfair on them because there is no restriction on those who gamble online in the bet they can place.  They are asking why they will be being restricted under the new regime in the amount a person will be able to gamble on a machine.  It is a further example of how complicated the issue is.<\/p><p>I will not push the amendments on Committee Stage.  I will consider them further on Report Stage and the Minister should do the same.  I am interested in hearing what the Minister of State has to say to them in response, but clearly we need to update the legislation to ensure it will be meaningful.

I do not understand the science, but there is something about the dynamic of slot machines that results in compulsive behaviour.  It is reasonable that there are maximum stakes and we need to make sure they are right.  I do not believe the three cent, or sixpence, limit is applied in practice, but the rate proposed in the Bill is a huge increase on the rate in the existing legislation.  We need to examine revising it downwards from &euro;10, a proposal we would view favourably.  <\/p> <p>  On a technical issue - I would like the Minister of State to examine this - I would have supported the amendments.  If they are not being pressed, that is Deputy O'Callaghan's prerogative, but it is my understanding of the way it has been interpreted that, strictly speaking, every line is a game.  One could have 25 lines, on each of which one could place a tenner.  That issue needs to be examined.  One can imagine the matrix in the different lines of fruit, other symbols and so on.  The maximum stake is potentially substantially larger than what is officially set out in the legislation because each line is a game and one can win in each of the several combinations, similar to each line in a Lucky 31 being a separate bet.

Enforcement is a matter for the enforcement authority, the Garda and others.<\/p> <p>  The amendments proposed relate to the maximum stakes and prices which can be played for on a gaming machine at a licensed amusement arcade under the terms of Part III of the principal Act.  The only role for the Minister for Justice and Equality under that Part concerns stakes and prize amounts.  Section 5 substitutes a new section 14 for that section of the 1956 Act.  The amendment concerns, essentially, the updating of a maximum allowable stake and prize amounts.  These are increased from three cent and 50 cent to &euro;10 and &euro;7.50.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked how we arrived at these figures.  There is no science.  I have seen people, with sandwiches and flasks alongside them, sitting in arcades with bags of coins, just feeding them into machines all day.  One can argue that, whether it is &euro;2 or &euro;10 at a time, people with a problem with gambling will keep going until the bag of money is gone.  Gambling addiction is a problem area.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan mentioned that there are people employed in this area.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, he gambles four times a year.  We will not do a roll call of the rest of us but people have a flutter every so often.  Some people gamble a bit more than others while others have an addiction problem and need help.  It has been said that the stakes and prizes are totally unrealistic and out of date.  We must bring them up to some form of realistic modern amount.<\/p> <p>  A new regulation in section 14 will allow the Minister to amend stake and prize amounts.  Through a statutory instrument, the Minister of the day can actually increase or decrease stakes or prizes.  This will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If whatever figure we finally arrive at is not working, the Minister of the day can change that in co-operation with the Houses.<\/p> <p>  In the past, the stakes and prizes were locked into legislation at three cent and 50 cent.  There has been no primary legislation in this area since 1956.  Deputy Pringle alluded to what was really happening on the ground which is another story.  We are trying to bring it up to something realistic.  The &euro;7.50 prize is the maximum amount.  Obviously, that will probably not happen that often.  If people want to gamble, they will want some kind of incentive or thrill to do it.  By having a realistic prize, people will be inclined to have a go and a bit of fun.  It stops being fun when it becomes a problem.<\/p> <p>  The Revenue Commissioners issued 12,113 gaming machine licences and 94 licences for gaming premises in 2018.  Within the past two years, it has undertaken a major enforcement drive against unlicensed premises and machines.  I very much support this effort and hope it will deal with the issues in question.  My own proposals seek to make it clear that licensed gaming machines should only be located in licensed gaming arcades where a local authority resolution is in place.  Again, I hope the Revenue and Garda enforcement efforts will continue to target unlicensed machines and lead to their removal from public houses, take-away food shops and other such locations.<\/p> <p>  This particular stake and prize amount has been in the public domain since we first published the proposals more than two years ago.  This is the first time it has been examined by the D&aacute;il.  Some colleagues in the Seanad raised it as well.  I am open to looking at this over the summer.  We have to be careful that it is realistic.  We are putting in the provision that it can be changed by ministerial order if it is found to be too high.<\/p> <p>  Several Deputies said there is a thrill to the arcades.  There is as much a thrill in gambling online.  It is silent and hidden, however.  I am far more concerned with the migration to online gambling and how we deal with that.  It is not going to be easy.  I would contend far much more is lost online than in the arcades.  The arcades are limited in their opening times and locations, whereas online is open 24-7.  That is where we will put a lot of our efforts to see how we can deal with that.<\/p> <p>  I understand the amendments are being withdrawn.

I am not an expert in identifying what is the appropriate amount that will be effective in trying to tackle compulsive gambling.  However, that is a matter the Minister of State might need to look at.  It might be the case that one does not specify the amount in the primary legislation and leave it for ministerial regulation.

As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, there are organisations which run bingo games for charities.  For example, if a GAA club wishes to organise a bingo night event, it will need a certain amount of equipment and technology to run it.  The concern is that under the legislation as proposed in the amendment to section 28, it will be precluded from obtaining a licence for the purpose of running this lottery.  Our first amendment is to subsection (8) which states: \"A person who holds a lottery permit shall not transfer that permit to any other person and any such purported transfer shall be void and of no effect\".<\/p><p>What we propose is the insertion of wording to the effect of save where a licensee utilises an agent to conduct a lottery on its behalf.  If an applicant which is a charity applies to the District Court for a lottery licence, it cannot then transfer it to somebody else under this legislation, and charities believe that will change the position that operates at present because currently they can be delegated to be run on their behalf.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say on that.  As amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are in this grouping, my amendment No. 8 proposes that \"in the case of the lottery conducted by an agent of the licensee [which is what we are discussing here], not more than 25 per cent of the gross proceeds shall be utilised for the expenses of promotion, including commission\". Obviously, the legislation can and should place a limit on how much money collected can be used for the profits of an agent running this type of operation.  The objective we want is to ensure that most of money will go to the philanthropic and charitable purpose.  I await hearing what the Minister of State has to say in respect of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#G02500","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I will bring in the Minister of State at this point.

They concern section 12, which substitutes section 28 of 1956 Act with a new section that sets out the application process for a lottery licensed by the District Court.  This section maintains the current maximum prize amount of &euro;30,000.  However, it makes provision for a prize fund limit of &euro;360,000 where a once-off annual lottery is promoted under a District Court licence.<\/p> <p>  The District Court grants a licence to an applicant where the applicant fulfils the conditions laid down in the new section 28. There are significant additional conditions for the prospective licensee to meet.  I contend these are necessary and legitimate requirements to ensure the best promotion of the lottery to guard against fraudulent behaviour and to prevent potential criminal behaviour, including money laundering.<\/p> <p>  Any lottery licensee may appoint an agent or agents to help promote a lottery.  This is permitted by the current law and confirmed by court judgment.  This does not mean, however, that the licensee can abandon responsibility or control of the lottery to an agent.  This would undermine the policy and legislative intention of modernising the provisions on the better promotion of lotteries.<\/p> <p>  The amendments proposed by Deputies O&rsquo;Callaghan and &Oacute; Laoghaire would have the effect of allowing the transfer of a lottery licence issued to an applicant by the District Court to an agent to conduct that lottery.  No checks or controls on such an agent, as are imposed on the licensee, are proposed in the amendment.  There are inherent dangers associated with such an approach.  The proposed amendments would appear to arise from representations from some associations which purport to run commercial bingo by acting as agents of lottery licensees.  I have also received those representations.<\/p> <p>  In my view, despite any assertions to the contrary, no pathway was provided in the 1956 Act for commercial bingo as a profit-driven business for agents or operators acting for licensees.

What we are proposing is more positive in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  In all stages of the debates on the Bill so far, no one has opposed the modernisation of the lottery licence application and issue process but it is useful to discuss it.  The grant by the court of a lottery licence is a significant matter.  The Deputies' amendments would effectively hand over lottery licences to agents who would not have to go through the licence application of the court.  <\/p> <p>  The proposition in the Deputies respective second amendments would only guarantee an agent a fixed proportion of the total lottery proceeds while not giving any mandated return to the charitable or philanthropic organisation cause involved or to the prize fund.  The impact would be that we would focus on the takings of an agent when we should focus on the good cause that needs the funds.  That is why the amendments are not balanced.

This matter appears to be raised in almost the same terms by both amendments.  As has been said, this was discussed extensively in the Seanad.  I note the amendments are the same as the text of a Bill submitted by the national lottery to the Department in 2018 and similar to a Bill tabled by Deputy O'Callaghan at the same time.<\/p> <p>  We spoke to the Office of the Attorney General about this and it is in agreement with the position I set out in some detail in the other House.  There is an issue whereby accepting the amendment might lead to further demands from the national lottery, perhaps seeking to prohibit the local lotteries that support sports clubs and community organisations.  Many of our sports clubs and community organisations depend on lotteries.  We could argue they are in direct competition with the national lottery.  A similar argument to that made by the Deputies is that these lotteries for football, rugby, hurling and Tidy Towns also impact on the turnover of the national lottery.  It could be argued they have an impact on sales.  None of us could agree on doing anything to curtail this activity, which directly benefits local sports clubs and other organisations.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers mentioned that the national lottery is now a private company.  The essence of the amendment seems to be to enhance its position as a private company by seeking to end the possibility of licensed bookmakers, land based and remote, offering bets on the outcome of Irish national lottery draws as they might on any other probability outcomes.  Deputy Fitzpatrick made this point.  The Deputies' proposals would allow licensed land-based or online bookmakers to offer bets on any other lottery but not the Irish one.  Should the Deputies' proposition be accepted, I foresee certain legal uncertainties and potential challenges from licensed bookmakers.  I do not think it would achieve what is intended, which is possibly increased sales for the national lottery.  For information, the turnover of the national lottery in 2015 was &euro;670 million, in 2016 it was &euro;750 million, in 2017 it was &euro;800 million and in 2018 it was &euro;805 million.  There was a 20% increase over four years.  This certainly does not suggest much impact since 2015 on the lottery operator arising from the licensing of bets.<\/p> <p>  The contribution of the national lottery to good causes increased each year.  This is to be welcomed, although such contribution is surely critical to having a national lottery in the first place.  The turnover is increasing every year and there is no convincing evidence that betting on lottery numbers undermines funding for good causes or that it threatens the profitability of the national lottery operator in the long term.  As I said, it is now a private company.<\/p> <p>  In addition, there is no evidence that I am aware of that betting on lottery numbers leads to a loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  Licensed remote bookmakers offering bets on lottery numbers and all licensed Irish betting shops must pay tax on every bet they take.  They must pay the current necessary licence fee.  Bookmaker shops also contribute to the Exchequer by, as has been said, providing many jobs in towns and villages throughout the country.  The product offered in betting shops or online is a bet and not a ticket sale.  I understand Irish bookmakers offer bets on one, two, three, four or five numbers being drawn.  In terms of cost to customers, bookmakers accept bets of 5 cent and upwards while the national lottery minimum stake is &euro;5 for two lines without the plus option.<\/p><p>Online operators normally offer bets on the outcome of the national lottery, EuroMillions and other lotteries, with players having to choose the corresponding numbers relating to those draws.  I have not been provided with any information to suggest that the outcomes of the weekly national lottery draws are exempt from being bet on.  Such is the position with football matches and races.  I may bet on their outcomes without hindrance by the organisers of the events.  I am aware of no argument to suggest the national lottery numbers are afforded some special form of legal or intellectual property protection.  In any representations I have received on this matter, the national lottery operator has advanced no such arguments.<\/p><p> As I stated in the Seanad, I have no function in respect of the national lottery as such.  Regulation of its licensing is a matter for the Minister for Finance under the National Lottery Act 2013.  My Department's role concerning licensed bookmakers under the betting Acts is limited to the provision of certificates of fitness for applicants for bookmakers' licences, remote bookmakers licences and for remote betting intermediaries.  The Revenue Commissioners issue licences after that.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform did not provide in the National Lottery Act for any prohibition on licensed bookmakers offering bets on the outcome of the national lottery draws on Wednesdays and Saturdays, nor did the Minister for Finance address this point during the preparation of the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015.  To the best of my knowledge, there are no conditions or prohibitions imposed in the Betting Acts 1931 to 2015 in respect of the nature and extent of the bets that licensed bookmakers, land-based or remote, might offer.  I am sorry for going on a bit but I feel we must ventilate this.<\/p><p> Deputy Jack Chambers asked about unclaimed winnings.  While I agree with the sentiment he expressed, this is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#K01200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I take the point that the company is private.

It is also in the public interest to renew the licence at some stage, potentially involving some other company.  In the meantime, we want a healthy fund and as many clubs as possible to benefit.  That is a reasonable public objective.  I would not have chosen the private company route but that is how matters stand.<\/p> <p>  I listened to what the Minister of State said.  Some of the provisions are technical but, on the principal point, it is increasingly the case that very many people are using online companies to bet on the lotto.  There are other elements also, involving bookmakers and all the rest of it, but the question of catching the first element is the difficulty in drafting the Bill as a whole.  A very substantial sum is potentially being lost out on.  Most European jurisdictions protect their national lotteries and the funds that emanate from them.  Could the Minister of state offer a comment on that or clarify matters?  The current position might be healthy but if the drift continues in the direction of commercially operated lotteries with no public benefit, then the national lottery will be undermined.

If we say he or she cannot bet on the lotto, the most likely next course of action will be to bet on the generation of six random numbers in, say, the UK lotto, rather than change over and make a decision to buy a lottery ticket.  Therefore, I cannot see the purpose of the amendments.  I do not see what they will achieve at all.  I do not even believe that, if accepted, they would protect the fund or increase the profitability of the national lottery.  It is so marginal that the gamblers will just switch over to betting on something different.  Six numbers are six numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#L00800","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in that the sale of the national lottery was a mistake.

The Deputy's proposal is not in line with the intention of the Bill, which is to do with gambling rather than unclaimed prizes in the national lottery, but I will raise the issue with the Minister.<\/p> <p>  The 2014-15 survey of gambling prevalence published in February of this year by the Department of Health indicates that the most prevalent forms of gambling engaged in were games associated with the national lottery.  The operator has quite an aggressive ongoing advertising campaign and I have certain issues with some of the messages portrayed, such as winning islands and so on, which glamorise gambling.  As I stated, turnover has increased every year.  The betting on lottery numbers with other betting providers is not impacting on the turnover of the national lottery.  In fact, it is going the other way.<\/p> <p>  I am taken by Deputy Sherlock's comment that the impact of these amendments would be to prevent people having a flutter on the numbers on a Saturday night or a Wednesday.  The citizen who wants to have a small bet on the outcome would no longer be permitted to do so under the amendments.  We would curtail that freedom and those placing such bets would move elsewhere.  The amendments would not have the desired impact except in terms of taking away the freedom of our citizens to have a small flutter, to use Deputy Sherlock's words, on the outcome of the lotto.  If we pass the amendments, those are the people who would be affected.  It would not make any difference to the turnover of the national lottery.  There is no guarantee that people who currently bet on the national lottery numbers would not decide to bet on something else instead.  The amendments would not have the desired effect. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#M00300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I will draft an amendment to address the issue I raised.

It regards the prevalence of gambling in general rather than solely problem gambling.  I share with the Deputy and other members of the committee deep concerns regarding how we can best address the issues of harmful gambling which affect the lives of persons so addicted, their families and wider society.  We are at one in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I always place our approach on this matter in a healthcare context and as being for the attention of relevant qualified professionals.  We must be careful not to come to the view or let others think that if we set up our gambling regulator, that will assist problem gambling to a significant extent.  If a person has an addiction, it is a health issue and we must focus on it from that point of view.  A regulator will only go so far.  If a person has an addiction, no amount of regulation will help; rather, he or she needs treatment.  I agree that we must seek to better understand the issues involved and obtain credible evidence on the nature and extent of the problems arising.  As stated by colleagues, gambling is complex and increasingly taking place in an online environment.  It is a matter for the Department of Health.  Obviously, it is not within my remit to carry out a report on the prevalence of gambling in Northern Ireland.  That should go without saying.<\/p> <p>  The drug prevalence survey for 2014-15 published on 27 February 2019 by my colleague, the Minister for State with responsibility for health promotion and the national drug strategy, Deputy Catherine Byrne, contained the first set of data on the extent of gambling in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The data are based on fieldwork carried out between August 2014 and August 2015.  This general population survey of more than 7,000 persons was a collaborative project between the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol and colleagues in the public information and health research branch of the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>Ipsos MRBI carried out the field work and my Department contributed to the cost of the survey.  While I accept that the survey is perhaps a little dated now, it provides a baseline of data to assist in policy formulation and future planning and action on gambling.  The survey found that the prevalence of problem gambling in the general population was 0.8%.  Problem gambling is most common in young males, at 1.9% among males aged 18 to 24 and 2.9% among males aged 25 to 34.  The Health Research Board is now undertaking a prevalence study for 2018 and 2019.  This will further assist in policy formulation, planning and action in this area.  Results are expected in 2020.  This survey will contain a specific section on gambling prevalence with an extended range of questions.  My Department is contributing to the costs of that survey.<\/p><p> While I welcome the concerns that motivate the proposed amendment, I believe that the Government is addressing those concerns through the large-scale professional work by the Health Research Board which is now under way.  We should await those results.  I do not think there is any point in duplicating it.  The first part of the Deputy's proposal risks imposing a significant cost on the Exchequer.  As we are doing it already, I do not see any reason why we should do it twice.  The second part of the proposal seeks to impose a requirement to carry out a two-year review of the operation of the Act.  This period is one normally found in legislation.  My Department will review the provisions of the amended Gaming and Lotteries Act as we work to bring forward proposals for the comprehensive reform of licensing and regulation of gambling in Ireland.  I do not see any particular need to impose this review provision.  I hope that comprehensive legislative proposals for reform will be published in this period.  We are doing substantial work in tandem with this.  I ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing the amendment because this is only an interim measure.  I want to have the limited resources that we have focused on getting the regulator established and the larger Bill drafted and enacted.  If we were to take resources away to do a review of this Act while doing the other at the same time, it may be counterproductive.  I can see the intention of the Deputy's amendment but I think it will happen anyway as we work on the larger Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019071000002#M01400","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562713200,"counter":637,"content":"<p>We have to be careful.  I have raised the issue of gambling addiction with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  The Department of Health has no interest in dealing with this issue.  The Department of Justice and Equality can keep deflecting from gambling addiction but the Department of Health and the HSE have no interest in doing anything for anyone with a gambling addiction.  If one talks to any front-line health professional, there is no support at all for people with an addiction related to gambling.  As someone who is preparing to regulate the industry and potentially impose levies on it and provide a social fund for it, I think the Minister of State is obliged to front up on the healthcare aspects of this.  We are all fed up with hearing the old Whitehall model of excuse, that it is a different Department's responsibility.  We hear about interdepartmental collaboration and cross-departmental engagement in respect of climate change in particular.  The Minister of State should take the lead on the addiction issue because the Department of Health has no interest.  It has not implemented Crystal Fulton's recommendation on a gambling addiction strategy.  I do not believe that the health system will provide for those with a gambling addiction in the short to medium term.  It is an opportunity for the Department of Justice and Equality to do something.  Perhaps it could develop a private pathway for those with a specific addiction.  It is not good enough to keep deflecting to the Department of Health because, as the Minister of State knows as well as I do, it will not do anything about the problem.  We have to flag that now because if any of us are here in years to come, the Department of Health will have done nothing about this.  Together with my former colleagues, Mick Wallace and Clare Daly, I submitted parliamentary questions on it to which the Department did not even respond.

Is the Minister of State against the idea of a review in principle?  I understand that he is saying this is interim, so there is no need for it.  We asked for a review of the Parole Bill and the Minister said no.  Standing Order 164A was quoted, stating that reviews take place anyway.  That review is extremely limited.
