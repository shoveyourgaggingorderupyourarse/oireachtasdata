Successive Governments have reaffirmed this policy both in Government decisions and through legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The Attorney General&rsquo;s office advises that the legislation is clear and provides a strong basis for the existing and continued use of the PSC across the public service.<\/p>  <p>  The PSC provides citizens with the convenience of only have to submit information to verify their identity once.  As an example about 70,000 people use the PSC to apply for passports each year; we pay over 600,000 people approximately &euro;150m through our post offices each week using the PSC as the identifier in each case; 600,000 free travel journeys are made using the PSC each week, about 400,000 PSC users use the MyGovID service to access online services with Revenue, SUSI, the National Driving Licence Service, Welfare and, shortly, the NCS.<\/p>  <p>  The PSC has strong public support &ndash; approaching 90% of the adult population hold a PSC and research indicates they overwhelmingly value the card, are fully aware of and agree to the sharing of data required to enable its use across the public service, believe that they have more than enough information about the purposes of the card and understand why, and do not object to, their data being retained.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2017 the DPC commenced an investigation into the SAFE \/ PSC process and delivered its final report to the Department on 15 August 2019.  On 17th September, the Department published the report of the DPC together with a summary of its own response to the findings of the report, and related correspondence between it and the DPC. <\/p>  <p>  As stated earlier this month, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Paschal Donohoe T.D. and I informed Government that we are satisfied that the processing of personal data related to the PSC does in fact have a strong legal basis, the retention of data is lawful and that the information provided to users does satisfy the requirements of transparency.  This opinion was arrived at following very careful consideration both of the report and of the strong legal advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office. <\/p>  <p>  The DPC had requested that the Department implement a number of actions on foot of the publication of their statement on Friday 16th August, within a very short time frame.  However, based on the strong legal advice received, we believe that it would be inappropriate, and potentially unlawful, to withdraw or modify the use of the PSC or the data processes that underpin it, as has been requested by the DPC.<\/p>  <p>  The Department sought to meet with the DPC on two occasions since receipt of the report with a view to outlining the basis for its conclusions and seeking to clarify a number of matters of concern relating to inconsistencies between both within the DPC's Report and between the report and the accompanying letter from the DPC.  The request for a meeting was declined on both occasions.<\/p>  <p>  The Department wrote to the DPC to advise it of the decisions now taken and understands that the DPC is now in the process of preparing an enforcement notice.  To date, the DPC has not issued an Enforcement Notice.  On receipt, the Department will consider the scope and terms of the enforcement notice and respond appropriately at that time.  It should be noted that the findings in the DPC report do not have the force of law until such time as they are formalised in an enforcement notice.  <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime the Department will continue to conduct SAFE registration and issue the PSCs.  It will also retain the supporting documentation collected as part of the SAFE process.  The reason for this is that it is not sufficient, in the case of a dispute over any decision, to simply record that decision was taken it is also necessary to produce the documentation on which the decision was grounded.  Other bodies, for example credit unions, public utilities and banks, similarly retain documentation submitted in support of applications for their services for as long as the person concerned is a customer of their organisation. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that data relating to individuals is securely held and used only for relevant business purposes.  The Department&rsquo;s commitment to safeguarding data is reflected in its use of advanced data processing and storage technology hosted in secure, State owned and operated, data centres and is reinforced by a range of legislative and administrative provisions that are designed to protect the rights and interests of individuals. <\/p>  <p>  Neither the PSC, nor the underlying Public Service Identity dataset, contains any information relating to the holder&rsquo;s use of public services. <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) restricts the sharing and use of the Public Service Identity (PSI) data to a number of specified bodies set out in Schedule 5 of that Act and only in relation to a transaction a person has with that specified body.  It is important to note, contrary to statements by some commentators, that the sharing of the PSI dataset does not involve sharing information regarding use of public services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500062#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Review","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500062#WRA01500"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[38807\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500062#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if increasing the financial thresholds for carer&rsquo;s allowance will be investigated; if the introduction of discretionary assessments in cases of extreme extenuating circumstances similar to the discretionary system utilised in the medical card application process will be investigated; the position regarding the measures taken to reduce the waiting times for decisions on applications for carer&rsquo;s allowance and other payments across the social welfare spectrum; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who look after people in need of care and attention on a full time basis.

Social welfare schemes such Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (CA), with a number of complex qualifying conditions can take longer to process.  Before a decision can be made on entitlement to CA, evidence must be provided in respect of the care recipient&rsquo;s care requirement, the level of care the carer provides and the carer's means.  It is also the case that in order to register their claim and establish an early entitlement claim date many people submit a claim without first securing all of the necessary supporting documentation.

The contract included an option to extend the term of referrals for a period no greater than two years.<\/p>  <p>  This extension is important as it will ensure that the Government retains the necessary labour activation capacity to deal with any labour market uncertainty that arises as a result of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, it provides my Department with the opportunity review all contracted public employment services and to design and develop a comprehensive model that will incorporate various models of response and be fit for purpose for the Irish labour market from 2021 onwards.  <\/p>  <p>  As per the econometric review, JobPath has been and continues to be a successful service in providing a comprehensive and value for money activation service for the long-term unemployed.  On this basis, my Department triggered the extension provisions of the existing contracts with the JobPath providers and secured agreement on the extension of these contracts on existing terms and conditions for a further twelve months.  <\/p>  <p>  This is not a renewal of the JobPath contracts but the execution of the extension clauses of the existing contracts.<\/p>  <p>  In order to assist my Department in designing and developing an appropriate  contracted public employment service model, external consultants are to be engaged and this procurement process is currently underway. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500062#WRA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":42,"content":"<p>Question No. 26 answered with Question No. 18.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Maintenance Payments","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500063#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[38311\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500063#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the work her Department is undertaking regarding a statutory maintenance agency; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>The Family Law Acts place a legal obligation on parents to maintain their children.

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. <\/p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. <\/p>  <p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Ms Regina Doherty, T.D. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples. This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.<\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. <\/p>  <p>  Further, I have been advised by Revenue that, from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners at this time.  This is because married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status and it would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500064#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500064#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[38980\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500064#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on removing the restriction in which tax relief is only available for physiotherapy sessions on the basis of a general practitioner referral; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>Tax relief in respect of health expenses is provided for in section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.

This includes criteria that must be met under the provisions of CEN 1789:2007, the European standard specifying requirements for the design and equipping of ambulances used for the transport and care of patients.

The supply of an ambulance is not included in any of those categories. However, the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme provides for a refund of VAT and VRT on the purchase of an ambulance for transport of a disabled person or persons within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations. The scheme is open to organisations who fall within the definition of &ldquo;qualifying organisations&rdquo; where their purpose is to provide services to persons with a disability (within the meaning of the Disability Act 2005) and is engaged in the care and transport of a person or persons with a disability. <\/p><p>Under the Charities VAT Compensation Scheme, charities which are registered with the Charities Regulator can claim for VAT on any expenditure incurred in relation to their charitable activities, except where the charity is already entitled to a refund, deduction, relief or repayment of that VAT.

For example, if 70% of their income comes from non-public funds they may claim back 70% of the eligible VAT incurred.  However, as there is a capped amount of funding available annually under the scheme, charities will be paid on a pro-rata basis where the total amount of claims received exceeds the cap.

The purpose of this approach is to recognise that fluctuations in the business cycle may run over several years and that it would be unbalanced to tax profits earned in one year and not allow relief for losses incurred in another. <\/p><p>The treatment of losses in Ireland is a long standing feature of our tax system and is a standard feature of the tax systems in all OECD countries.

I am advised by Revenue that its criterion to be considered a HWI and to therefore come within the remit of the HWI branches of its Large Cases &ndash; High Wealth Individuals Division (LC-HWID) is individuals with net assets of &euro;20 million and over.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that as there is no statutory obligation on individuals to return details of their net worth on returns of income it is not possible to estimate the number of individuals with a net worth within the thresholds requested by the Deputy.<\/p><p>Revenue has had a focus on HWIs over a long period. HWIs have been managed by dedicated units within its Large Cases Division since it was established in 2003. Revenue split its Large Cases Division into two divisions in 2018, one of which, LC-HWID, has a focus on HWIs, avoidance and pensions. As reflected in one of the recommendations in the Annual Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG), the new Division reviewed the case base with a view to increasing the number of HWIs it manages.  This review has been published on the Revenue website, www.revenue.ie, and provides more detail on the criteria used by Revenue to identify taxpayers with net assets falling within the revised threshold. <\/p><p>The allocation of resources is a matter for Revenue but I understand that Revenue&rsquo;s structural realignment, of which the setting up of the LC-HWID was a part, was supported by an expansion in the number of specialist and experienced staff assigned to the oversight of the new Division&rsquo;s case base.  The number of staff currently assigned to the HWI branches is c.60.  I also understand that Revenue established a new Division, the Medium Enterprises Division, to manage the affairs of the tier of cases, both corporate and individuals below that of the Large Cases Divisions. <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the HWI case base is adjusted periodically but not necessarily on an annual basis. The following Table provides the number of cases in the HWI case base for the years indicated:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Number of HWIs<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2004<\/td><td>250<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>571<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>480<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2019<\/td><td>955<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>I am satisfied that the structural realignment by Revenue combined with the risk focused approach to compliance management, will continue to deliver an outcome where HWIs pay the appropriate tax in accordance with the legislation. I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to estimate additional audit yield related to cases recently coming within the responsibility of LC-HWID. There is a presumption of honesty by taxpayers who pay on a self-assessment basis and no category of taxpayer would be regarded, in advance of a case appraisal, as likely to give rise to audit yield. All taxpayers are subject to risk evaluation and intervention as appropriate so bringing a particular category of taxpayers within the remit of the LC-HWID would not, of itself, be a determinant of an increased audit yield.  Revenue&rsquo;s overall approach to managing compliance is to make the appropriate intervention following appraisal of the risk factors in each case.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to say to the Deputy that over the last number of Budgets I supported the business case put forward by Revenue in relation to additional resources, both personnel and ICT, and I will continue to examine any proposal put forward by Revenue in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500065#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500065#WRD01300"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[39080\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500065#WRD01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when a report by an organisation (details supplied) into public banking will be available in view of the fact a commitment was given that it would be ready for distribution by early summer 2019; if steps can be taken to expedite same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":150,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department in conjunction with the Department of Rural and Community Development, issued a report on Local Public Banking in Ireland last year.

I am further advised that in recent months the Immigration Service has consulted closely with the HSE to determine if the terms of the Scheme require any amendments.

Exit from and re-entry into the State is not permitted during this 90-day period, except in exceptional circumstances.  The terms of the AWS also provide that at least one month must elapse from the expiry date of the 90 day permission before a new application may be made. The rationale for this approach, which applies to all such permissions, is rooted in the principle that an atypical permission is not a substitute for the replacement of full time labour (either sourced within Ireland or the EU or through the Non EEA employment permit regime). Therefore, a person granted such permission cannot automatically roll over their atypical permission.  These conditions have applied to permissions granted under the Scheme since its inception. <\/p>  <p>  Atypical immigration permissions are specifically designed to cover short term employments in the State and there are alternative options available for longer term employment through the employment permit regime of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500066#WRE03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Drugs Strategy Implementation","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500066#WRE04000"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[38922\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500066#WRE04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the work of the working group on alternative sanctions for drugs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":211,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Government established a Working Group to consider alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use in December 2017.

For example, the operator of the centre must make a room available to facilitate meetings.  The composition of each group varies from centre to centre but will include staff members, residents and volunteers from the local community.  Officials from the Department will occasionally attend meetings particularly if invited by the group to do so.

Examples of groups that have engaged with Friends of the Centre include local Tidy Towns committees, sports clubs, men&rsquo;s sheds and Mother and Baby clubs.

The Deputy will be aware that national security is outside the competence of the EU, so ongoing day-to-day cooperation in this area with the UK will continue following Brexit, whatever form it ultimately takes. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, considerable planning and preparation across the criminal justice area has been ongoing to take account of the potential impact of Brexit, including in relation to ensuring the continuance of effective extradition arrangements between Ireland and the UK. This is necessary because of Britain&rsquo;s proposed departure from the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) system. While the EAW will cease to apply when Brexit occurs, the High Court in the meantime is continuing to deal with outstanding UK EAW cases. <\/p>  <p>  Following examination of the options available for extradition arrangements between Ireland and the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the fall-back solution is to apply the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition, to which both Ireland and the UK are party, to extradition arrangements between Ireland and the UK. <\/p>  <p>  The provisions of the Convention are given effect to by Part II of the Extradition Act 1965. The 1965 Act has been amended by Part 13 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019, which can be commenced when Brexit occurs, in order to ensure that this is a workable solution.  <\/p>  <p>  As such, I can confirm for the Deputy that should the UK leave the EU without a deal, the UK will as a consequence lose access to the European Arrest Warrant mechanism and will be treated as a third state for extradition purposes. However extradition would be possible between Ireland and the UK under the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition, as is the case for other third states. <\/p>  <p>  EAW cases still active on the date of the departure of the UK from the EU would cease to have effect.  As the Deputy will appreciate, what would happen in any particular case will depend on the individual circumstances of that case. However and in general, if an EAW request ceases to have effect, a new request under the Council of Europe Convention on Extradition would have to be issued before the matter could be considered further.  I can assure the Deputy that this issue has been factored into contingency planning on these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500067#WRF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500067#WRF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[39011\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500067#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the upgrade works at the Clondalkin Towers direct provision centre, which despite being required to commence within six months of the new contract being signed have not yet commenced; the works to be undertaken at this location; the reason they have not started; when they will start; and the engagement his Department and-or RIA have had with a company (details supplied) to ensure this key aspect of the contract is complied with.","asker":"1215","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department advertised a tender competition in September 2018 for suitable premises within 40km of Newbridge, Co.

No. 14 of 2011. The Directive places the onus on all economic operators (ie manufacturers, distributors, importers) to ensure that only safe toys are placed on the market. If economic operators become aware that toys on the market present a potential hazard they must take appropriate measures, up to and including a recall of the items, to ensure that the risk is removed. Any such action taken by an operator must be notified to the relevant market surveillance authority, ie the CCPC. Where the CCPC finds unsafe toys on the Irish market, it will act to ensure that the responsible economic operators remove the toys from the market until they are in compliance with the legislation. <\/p>  <p>  Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions, including carrying out investigations of unsafe toys. As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the CCPC, I, as the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation have no direct function in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I can confirm that the CCPC is aware of the recent survey by the British Toy and Hobby Association. The CCPC has also informed me that the issues raised by the survey are familiar to the CCPC and these issues have also been found during the CCPC&rsquo;s routine market surveillance activities. For the period between January 2016 and July 2019, the CCPC investigated 259,218 toys to check if they were compliant with S.I. No. 14 of 2011 and approximately 28% were found to be non-compliant. Where the relevant economic operator was not able to bring these products into compliance they were then removed from the market.<\/p>  <p>  The CCPC has also recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Customs Service in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, which will provide for greater cooperation between the two bodies and improve the market surveillance of products entering the Irish market. The CCPC is also currently increasing the number of trained staff in its Product Safety Unit and expects the level of both proactive and reactive market surveillance activity to increase in the future.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the European Commission has recently agreed and published a new Regulation (Regulation 2019\/1020 on the Market Surveillance and Compliance of Products) that will give extra powers to market surveillance authorities, such as the CCPC, to regulate products (including toys) sold online. The Regulation will also ensure closer cooperation between market surveillance authorities and customs services in the EU to address the issue of unsafe products (including toys) being imported from third countries. The Regulation will apply from the 16th July 2021 throughout the EU and officials from my Department are currently engaged in preparing implementing legislation to give full effect to all safety and co-operation aspects of the Regulation.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to ensuring that products sold by online marketplaces meet Irish and EU standards, I can inform the Deputy that all products placed on the EU market must be safe. Where a product sold online originates in a country outside the EU, the economic operator will have to comply with the relevant customs authorities (whether in the State or in another jurisdiction) in relation to legislation covering products at point of entry into the EU. <\/p>  <p>  Should the Deputy have any information in relation to unsafe toys or other products on the Irish market, she should make contact with the CCPC directly to provide any relevant information on these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500067#WRF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Conventions","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500067#WRF04000"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[38936\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500067#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when Ireland will ratify the International Labour Organisation Convention and Recommendation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>I welcome the adoption of Convention 190 Concerning the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work and the accompanying Recommendation 206 at the 108th Session of the International Labour Conference (ILC) last June.

Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple can earn in the region of &euro;37,500 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance.  A half-rate Carer's Allowance is also payable with other welfare payments. <\/p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payments of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn an income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  The continued application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.  <\/p>  <p>  Deductions included for Carer's Allowance include PRSI, union dues, superannuation (pension contributions) and travel expenses. This is in line with most social assistance payments.  The proposal by the Deputy to assess means on net disposable income minus family expenses could potentially include taking account of  costs such as mortgage repayments, dependent children, college fees, Fair Deal contributions, medical costs, etc. Any such change to include other costs and deductions in the calculation of income would have significant budgetary implications and would give rise to inconsistencies in how means tests are applied across schemes. It would also significantly increase the complexity of the means assessment and inevitably prolong the assessment process. <\/p>  <p>  The formula for assessing means from capital (savings, shares and property) for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance whereby the first &euro;20,000 of capital is disregarded is line with most social assistance schemes.  The assessment of capital reflects an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that capital, or to realise the value of the property, to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means-tested welfare payment.<\/p>  <p>  The matter of making the payment exempt from tax is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  <\/p>  <p>  In assessing weekly family income for Working Family Payment (WFP) purposes, most weekly social welfare payments are assessed.  Budget 2012 contained a measure which provided for the assessment of Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payments in determining entitlement to WFP. This measure brought the treatment of these two payments for WFP purposes into line with the treatment of all other primary social welfare payments.  It also provided for a more consistent approach to the concurrent payment of WFP with other social welfare payments. Moreover, while this measure reduced a person&rsquo;s secondary payment (WFP) it did so without affecting their primary payment, in this case Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, therefore targeting available resources at those in most need.<\/p>  <p>  For Working Family Payment purposes, any combination of hours that reaches 38 hours each fortnight is acceptable. A person can combine their weekly hours with their spouse, civil partner, cohabitant's hours to meet the condition.  Therefore a carer&rsquo;s working hours can be taken into account for WFP purposes.  To take into account the hours worked by a carer for WFP purposes and to not assess the income into the household generated by those hours would be inequitable in terms of how income from all other earnings is assessed.    <\/p>  <p>  Finally, as of end of July 2019, there were 82,015 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The projected expenditure on Carer's Allowance in 2019 is almost &euro;840 million. Any changes to qualifying criteria for these schemes, including income disregards, would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500070#WRJ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[38997\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500070#WRJ03900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will extend the number of hours a carer can work per week; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":382,"content":"<p>Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention on a full time basis.

The projected expenditure on Carer's Allowance in 2019 is almost &euro;840 million. <\/p>  <p>  A primary qualifying condition for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment is that the applicant provides full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care.

Accordingly, under existing arrangements, a household that applies, for example, to Dublin City Council can, if qualified for support and should they choose to do so, be entered on the waiting list of three of the four local authorities in Dublin city and county.<\/p>  <p>  All four Dublin authorities have provisions in their allocation schemes for inter authority\/mutual transfers for sitting tenants whereby the authority is prepared to accommodate applications for inter authority\/mutual transfers provided certain criteria are met. All four Dublin authorities also make provision in their allocation schemes for households wishing to move to a home more suitable to their household needs. However, decisions on all applications are entirely a matter for the local authority concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a commitment has been given to examine the possibility of introducing a &ldquo;housing passport&rdquo;. The basic premise is that households in receipt of, or qualified for, social housing support in one local authority area could potentially transfer to, or be allocated, social housing in another local authority area. This will offer more flexibility and choice to social housing applicants and tenants on a national basis. I am currently finalising proposals in relation to this matter. It is my intention to bring forward any proposed changes needed to implement the housing passport proposal to Government as part of a comprehensive social housing reform package of measures in the near future. A key aim of the package will be to ensure that social housing supports are more responsive and flexible to the varying needs that exist at different stages of the life cycle of a social housing tenant. The issue raised by the Deputy in respect of tenants wishing to right-size clearly falls within this broader policy objective.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of older people, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health, published a joint policy statement, Housing Options for our Ageing Population, on 27 February 2019, which builds on policy as outlined in Rebuilding Ireland and the National Planning Framework 2040. The statement sets out forty actions which the two Departments want to progress with a view to developing new models of housing and supports for older people.  These include options in relation to rightsizing in both public and private housing.  An independently chaired implementation group is working to drive progress on the actions and to ensure that there is an integrated approach to their development over the timescales set out in the statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500072#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":446,"content":"<p>Question No. 176 answered with Question No. 169.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment Eligibility","counter":447,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500072#WRL01600"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[39062\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500072#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if all means from employment are assessed when calculating a HAP payment for a person in receipt of a disability allowance and working; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":449,"content":"<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is a flexible and immediate housing support that is available to all eligible households throughout the State. <\/p>  <p>  All households in receipt of HAP pay a differential rent based on the rent scheme set by the relevant local authority. The right of local authorities to set and collect rents on their dwellings is laid down in section 58 of the Housing Act 1966. The making or amending of such schemes is an executive function and is subject to broad principles laid down by my Department including that &ndash;<\/p>  <p>  - the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households;<\/p>  <p>  - provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship; and<\/p>  <p>  - appropriate local factors should be taken into account including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwellings and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.<\/p>  <p>  Each local authority has its own separate differential rent scheme or schemes in operation. As rent is calculated using each local authority&rsquo;s own formula, the schemes do vary in a number of ways from each other.  This is particularly the case when it comes to what may or may not be considered as reckonable\/assessable income for rent purposes e.g., disability allowance and carer's allowance. However, all local authority rent schemes would include the employment income of the tenant and most would do so based on net income, that is income net of income tax, Universal Social Charge and PRSI. <\/p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides for the Minister to introduce a national rents framework for social housing tenants. Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft of such a framework, which has as its main aim the harmonisation of local authority rents, including a set of standardised income disregards, whilst retaining the general principle of rents related to household income.  <\/p>  <p>  This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities.  The overall objective is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable and prioritise those on lowest incomes. I expect that the review will be completed in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500072#WRL01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":451,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500072#WRL02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500072#WRL01900"},{"type":"question","counter":451,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[38920\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092500072#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of works to enhance the Hill of Tara complex.","asker":"1225","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":452,"content":"<p>The Hill of Tara is one of Ireland&rsquo;s premier national monuments and is of international prominence and importance.
