In that regard  Comhairle Na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council) was established in February 2004 as a non-statutory body with a primary focus on the priority areas of access to the countryside, developing a countryside code, and developing a countryside recreation strategy.  <\/p>  <p>  Under a Comhairle na Tuaithe initiative, in 2011, a Mountain Access Scheme to facilitate access to the uplands for hill walking and similar activities was developed in two pilot areas; one at Mount Gable in Connemara and the other in the MacGillycuddy Reeks in Co Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  In order to help progress the Mountain Access Scheme, SLR Consultants with the support of the former Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, South Kerry Development Partnership and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, were tasked with assessing the potential for structured permissive access to the MacGillycuddy Reeks uplands and to identify the most appropriate management structure to ensure the sustainable management of the integral environmental and cultural heritage of the Reeks, while providing long term clarity on permissive recreational access to the mountains.  I understand that the SLR report also suggested a set of Key Performance Indicators covering issues such as management, revenue, training &amp;amp; education, enterprise and communication.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the recommendations in the SLR report, a Management Forum, whose job it was to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the report, was established in the Kerry pilot area in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe also established a Mountain Access Project Steering Group in 2014, which was tasked with reviewing progress in respect of the Mountain Access Pilots, developing signage for Mountain Access Pilot areas, and issues around a National Indemnity Scheme. During this time, tendering took place for the design of a mountain access logo, and mountain access signage and information panels for the two pilot areas, which are now in place.<\/p>  <p>  On 6th June last, at its first meeting of 2019, I presented a new mandate to Comhairle na Tuaithe which will reinforce and strengthen its advisory role in relation to the sustainable development of the outdoor recreation sector in Ireland.  At this meeting, I also announced the appointment of Dr. Liam Twomey as the new Chair of Comhairle.  <\/p>  <p>  I have also asked Comhairle to identify opportunities to develop rural enterprises based on outdoor recreation activity, and to consider the scope for the development of a new National Strategy for Outdoor Recreation, taking account of recent developments and investments across the sector. <\/p>  <p>  Also, as the Deputy will be aware, my Department has been working to develop a National Indemnity Scheme to indemnify private land owners, particularly in Mountain Access Scheme areas, with regard to the use of their lands for recreational purposes which when in place will further facilitate access to the countryside for recreational purposes, including mountain climbing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100058#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100058#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[30078\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100058#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the position regarding streamlining the criteria required for small grant applications, for example, LEADER; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>My Department operates a number of schemes that can provide small-scale financial supports and grants to community groups and organisations. <\/p>  <p>  These include the Community Enhancement Programme and the CL&Aacute;R Programme.

These events and other ongoing measures will ensure that our funding has the broadest possible reach and that all eligible groups have the opportunity to access available supports. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100058#WRB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100058#WRB03300"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[30427\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100058#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the drawdown in funding to date of the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme for the allocations in 2017 and 2018.","asker":"1335","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>The Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS) provides funding for the development of new outdoor recreational infrastructure and for the maintenance and promotion of existing outdoor recreational infrastructure in rural Ireland.<\/p><p>The following table outlines the amounts allocated and drawn down to date under the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS) 2017 and 2018.

This is underlined by a commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the level of female participation in the Defence Forces. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Unlike some other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions with regard to the assignment of\u00a0men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. Women, therefore, play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of Defence Forces operations at home and overseas on peacekeeping missions. In this regard, the Defence Forces participates on an international level in the sphere of Women, Peace and Security (WPS). Ireland's third National Action Plan\u00a0 on WPS renews Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the Women, Peace and Security agenda, setting out how Ireland will continue to promote and implement the objectives of the agenda in its programme support activities, diplomatic advocacy and policy-making across the interrelated areas of peace, security and development. In relation to overseas deployment, a female Officer in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, is currently serving as Advisor to NATO Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Representative for Women, Peace and Security and a female officer in the Acting rank of Brigadier General has been appointed Deputy Force Commander in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF). In 2016 a female officer commanded a Defence Forces contingent in UNDOF on a six month tour of duty. <\/p>  <p>  The participation by female personnel in all aspects of Defence Forces operations is further exemplified in the Defence Forces Equality Policy and the Defence Forces Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Statement and Action Plan, which outlines the Organisation&rsquo;s commitment to gender equality and its proactive approaches to recruiting females. <\/p>  <p>  In line with these policies and commitments,\u00a0a number of initiatives have been implemented to increase the level of female participation in the Defence Forces. For example:\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  - Special consideration is paid\u00a0to women as a target group for recruitment and within the general recruitment framework. <\/p>  <p>  - In order to extend the reach to the target demographic of 18-26 year old women, the Defence Forces has initiated a collaboration with Irish sporting bodies, commencing with the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU). <\/p>  <p>  - The introduction of best practices in recruitment\u00a0such as\u00a0the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants and a\u00a0balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0A Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. The Defence Forces are committed to gender equality and employ a gender perspective\u00a0in all policies and regulations. Gender Advisors are available to all Brigades and Services and trained Gender Focal Points are deployed with all overseas units and ships in order to promote a gender perspective in operations.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A Defence Forces Women's Network has been established with the aim of increasing the participation of female personnel at all levels of the organisation. The Network allows women to identify any actual or perceived barriers to participation, which then feed into wider HR retention policies. The Defence Forces were shortlisted for the CIPD (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development) Awards 2018, Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion category, for its Women&rsquo;s Network initiative.<\/p>  <p>  A number of family friendly overseas appointments for commissioned and enlisted personnel have been introduced, where the normal 6-month tour of duty can be &lsquo;shared&rsquo; with another member of the Defence Forces resulting in a 3 month deployment. <\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces maternity policy includes measures such as Defence Forces personnel not being detailed for overseas\/sea going service until a child has reached the age of two, to allow the mother to care for the child as part of a family friendly policy.<\/p>  <p>  Over the course of the White Paper on Defence 2015, a ten year strategy, further initiatives and projects will be developed to encourage more women to apply for the Defence Forces and to increase female participation at all ranks. This will include a survey to identify any impediments to the advancement of women in the Permanent Defence Force, as well as the impact of the requirements of career courses and overseas service on female retention and advancement.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100059#WRC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"White Paper on Defence","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100059#WRC03700"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[30533\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100059#WRC03800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the status of the development of the new institute for peace support and leadership training as outlined in the White Paper on Defence; the educational and organisational partnerships the institute has made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":128,"content":"<p>The White Paper on Defence includes a commitment to evaluate the potential development of a new Institute for Peace Support and Leadership Training at the Defence Forces Training Centre in the Curragh.

The primary aim of Ireland's PfP participation is to enhance the Defence Forces&rsquo; interoperability with other professional military forces for the purpose of engaging in UN authorised peacekeeping and peace support operations led by the UN, EU or NATO. <\/p>  <p>   Ireland participates in the PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP), which is a mechanism for planning and capability development for Defence Forces deployment on peace support operations that allows for external review of defence capability and provision.  PARP is based on a biennial cycle which defines priority areas, elaborates mutually agreed planning targets known as PARP goals, identifies the steps required to meet those targets and jointly reviews progress in implementing them.  The cyclical nature of the PARP process along with the further assistance received from NATO in providing their experience to Defence Forces capacity and capability ensures on-going development in our Defence Forces based on the current and ever changing security environment.  Ireland completed it's PARP assessment process in June this year.<\/p>  <p>   The PARP assessment is based on an analysis of a number of predetermined goals, of which some are now considered implemented with the capabilities being maintained, some are fully completed, and some are currently being implemented.  Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in Partnership for Peace has delivered significant improvements for our Defence Forces in terms of capability development and operational capacity. This has enabled us to make a positive impact, particularly in undertaking more demanding international crisis management operations.<\/p>  <p>   In tandem with the recent PARP review, given that this year marks the 20th anniversary of Ireland's participation in PfP, a review of the scope and effectiveness of Ireland's engagement in PfP has been initiated by the Department of Defence in association with colleagues in the Defence Forces and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The purpose of this review is to ensure that Ireland is getting full value from our PfP engagement, including on interoperability and capability development, given the changing nature of the security environment and the threats faced.  This review has included meetings at senior official level with NATO staff and a more expansive and in-depth engagement between the Department, the Defence Forces, and the NATO International Staff who conduct the biennial PARP reviews.  It is expected that this review will be completed later this year.  <\/p>  <p>   The PARP assessment documents contain confidential information.  The documents have not been published to-date and it is not my intention to depart from the standing practice of not publishing the PARP documents.  A report and assessment on the feedback from the recent engagement with the NATO International Staff on the PARP process and on capabilities should be finalised in the coming months and I will consider the report and its conclusions at that stage.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100061#WRE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Pay Commission Reports","counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100061#WRE03500"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[30828\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100061#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if the Public Service Pay Commission survey on the numbers intending to leave the Defence Forces will compromise existing future peacekeeping deployment;

Libya, like all other countries, must manage migration in full compliance with international law. This is a matter primarily for the Libyan Government, which bears the responsibility and has the presence on the ground, rather than for external actors such as the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is maintaining its political pressure on the Libyan authorities to end the system of detention centres. For example, when the EU High Representative met with the Prime Minister of Libya and the UN Special Representative for Libya in February, she raised conditions in detention centres. Ireland and the EU will continue to raise this issue at every appropriate opportunity. <\/p>  <p>  The EU is also working to ensure that other options exist to provide humanitarian assistance to refugees and migrants, by supporting the work of UNHCR and IOM, and I had the opportunity to discuss the situation in Libya today with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Filippo Grandi.\u00a0In December 2018, the Libyan authorities agreed to the opening of the UNHCR Gathering and Departure Facility, as a hub to help refugees and asylum seekers to be swiftly evacuated. This is only a temporary solution for particularly vulnerable groups, including those who have been evacuated from detention centres near conflict areas. The EU will continue to work with the UN agencies, the Libyan authorities and others to find sustainable alternatives to the system of detention. <\/p>  <p>  Through our cooperation with the UN and the African Union, the EU has also helped over 45,000 migrants stranded in Libya to return voluntarily to their countries of origin, and has evacuated close to 4,000 persons in need of international protection. Since many more people remain at risk, the EU will continue to work with its partners to relocate them to safe places swiftly to receive assistance.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome reports from UNHCR this week that the Libyan Government has decided to release migrants and refugees from Tajoura detention centre, which was struck in a horrific attack earlier this month. I understand that the majority of migrants and refugees decided to leave the detention centre, and are being provided with support by the UNHCR. This is a positive development, but of course it comes too late for those who lost their lives in the attack. I call on the Libyan authorities to continue to cooperate with UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies to empty all the migrant detention centres in Libya as soon as possible, and in line with their responsibilities under international law.<\/p>  <p>  Efforts to ensure the wellbeing of refugees and migrants in Libya remain constrained by the current security and political situation there. Libya is in the midst of a civil war and conflict there has severely limited the capacity of the international community to monitor and influence events on the ground. The EU Delegation to Libya had to be relocated to Tunisia, and most EU Member States with Embassies in Libya had to close these, due to the growing security threat. There is also a governance vacuum in many parts of the country, and access for international organisations seeking to monitor and alleviate conditions for migrants is restricted in many areas. Governments need counterparts, if we are to exert pressure &ndash; counterparts which are actually in control of the territory where abuses happen. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans and migrants and refugees in Libya will require restoration of political stability and an end to lawlessness in Libya. This requires the formation of a fully functioning and unified Government, and a return to order throughout the country. The UN Special Representative Ghassan Salam&eacute; is working to achieve this. The EU will continue to work with the UN and others to support and reinforce Libya's sovereign institutions. In the meantime, we will maintain pressure on all parties to ensure unhindered access for humanitarian organisations to improve conditions in detention centres, to increase alternatives to detention, and, ultimately, to put an end to the system of detention in Libya.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100062#WRF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Security Council","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100062#WRF02600"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[30658\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100062#WRF02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of Ireland&rsquo;s bid for a seat at the UN Security Council; the expenditure to date for the bid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>There are under eleven months remaining until the expected date of the election for the two available seats in the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) on the UN Security Council for the 2021-2022 term.

The year one detailed Progress Report was published concurrently with the summit and is available on www.gov.ie<\/p>  <p>  To date new Embassies have opened in Wellington, Bogot&aacute;, Amman, Monrovia and Santiago de Chile, and new Consulates General in Vancouver, Mumbai and Cardiff. This brings to 88 the number of diplomatic Missions in the network. The expansion will continue this year to include new Consulates General in Los Angeles and Frankfurt. Embassies in Kyiv, Manila and Rabat will follow shortly thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  Our new Missions are working to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s international visibility; promote our prosperity, build new community and political contacts; protect and advance Ireland&rsquo;s interests and values; and deliver on our commitments under Ireland&rsquo;s new policy for International Development &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;. We continue to make progress in increasing the number of officers in missions that currently have one or two officers.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We have sought to deepen our engagement with the multilateral system with the launch last July of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign for a seat on the United Nations Security Council. Officials from my Department both at home and abroad have been actively presenting Ireland&rsquo;s case and seeking support among the other 192 UN Member States. This has provided Ireland with an invaluable opportunity to build relationships and contacts across the world, which will stand to us long after the campaign has ended. <\/p>  <p>  In October we obtained observer status at the Organisation of the Francophonie &ndash; an important step in increasing our engagement with the French speaking world. <\/p>  <p>  More recently I launched a new strategy for the US and Canada and a White Paper on International Development Policy. Work is underway on strategies for Latin America and the Caribbean as well as the Asia Pacific Region. And a series of consultations are also underway for a new Diaspora policy. <\/p>  <p>  A critical component of the Global Ireland programme is identifying new opportunities to diversify our markets in a post-Brexit world. &euro;8 million was allocated in budget 2019 to support the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise development network internationally. This investment will allow for a more targeted expansion of our State Agencies in both emerging and established international markets.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In my Department planning is underway for Ireland&rsquo;s participation at Expo 2020 in Dubai. Expo will showcase Ireland to a global audience, in a region with huge trade and investment potential and will support a 'Team Ireland' approach to promoting Ireland as a global partner for the development of new ideas and technologies, as well as an attractive location for business and investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100062#WRF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100062#WRF03800"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[30662\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100062#WRF03900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of staff in each embassy and consulate in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network of Missions around the world is critical to the achievement of our foreign policy and trade goals such as ensuring the efficient delivery of passport and consular services to our citizens, supporting emigrant organisations and outreach to the diaspora and other networks of influence.<\/p><p>Our Embassies and Consulates contribute directly to safeguarding our interests in negotiations on the UK exit from the European Union and they are helping to ensure that Ireland plays a full part in shaping the future development of the European Union.<\/p><p>The work of my Department in promoting a more just, fair, secure and sustainable world continues through mission engagement with multilateral institutions and agencies, including those of the United Nations, and via implementation of the Irish Aid programme in partner countries.<\/p><p>Our staff in Embassies and Consulates also make a strong contribution to job creation, exports, tourism and education in Ireland by assisting Irish businesses overseas in close cooperation with State Agencies.<\/p><p>Our capacity to deliver on these key goals will increase with the expansion of my Department&rsquo;s Mission network abroad under the Global Ireland Initiative.

A no deal Brexit will have severe economic and political implications for Ireland, North and South. The process of engagement with the European Commission, with its twin objectives of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it and at least avoiding physical infrastructure at the border on the island of Ireland, continues.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I have spoken with my EU counterparts about this work, and made clear that in addressing the border, Ireland is committed to protecting the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. Our place in the Single Market is a vital part of our economic model and crucial to Ireland's prosperity.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  EU partners have repeatedly made clear the EU&rsquo;s solidarity with Ireland on this issue.

While we continue to plan for all scenarios, work on no deal Brexit preparations has the highest priority across Government departments and State agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Following its approval by the Government, the updated Brexit Contingency\u00a0Action Plan was laid before the Oireachtas and published on Tuesday 9 July. Its contents will be debated in detail in this House today. The Contingency Action Plan reflects the extensive work which has taken place at EU level and on a whole-of-Government basis to prepare for a no deal Brexit, including by setting out the next steps to be taken between now and 31 October. <\/p>  <p>  At EU level, there is agreement on a range of temporary contingency measures in key areas, including maintaining basic air connectivity and road haulage access between the EU and the UK in the event of a no deal Brexit. These measures have been undertaken in tandem with our ongoing engagement with our EU partners and with the European Commission, on key outstanding issues, including on potential supports for Ireland and affected sectors.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Government's work to reduce delays at ports and disruptions to supply chains, additional infrastructure has been put in place to manage the necessary checks and controls on our trade with the UK on an east-west basis post-Brexit.  Work at Dublin Port has involved nine projects across eight sites to deliver 13 new inspection bays, documentary and identity check facilities, office facilities and parking for up to 128 heavy goods vehicles. Plans are in place for a further 18 inspection bays. A 24-hour service will be provided at Dublin Port, and extended hours to match arrival times will be provided at Rosslare Port with on-call service provision outside these hours. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue accelerated and expanded recruitment and training schedules to meet the 12 April 2019 deadline, with an additional 400 staff trained and ready by that date. Revenue will continue to build on this and will have 450 additional staff in place by 31 October. Additional staff recruited in preparation for Brexit are deployed across a number of functions, with approximately half on import and export trade facilitation activities. Revenue will continue to monitor the need for further recruitment, deployment and training. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) had approximately 190 staff ready to carry out import controls and export certification on 12 April 2019. Further staff will be ready to carry out controls in the additional inspection facilities that will be available by 31 October. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE had 59 staff trained and available to conduct no deal Brexit (import and export) activities in time for the 12 April deadline. The HSE is progressing recruitment for a further intake of staff before the end of October. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue are confident that their IT systems will handle the increased transaction levels in a no deal scenario. DAFM&rsquo;s necessary IT systems were in place by March 2019.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As stated in the Action Plan, there should be no illusion - a no deal Brexit will be highly disruptive and will have profound political, economic and legal implications. Our need to prepare prudently is more pressing than ever. Citizens and businesses cannot assume that because a no deal Brexit was averted in March and April that the same will happen in October.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The time between now and the extended Article 50 deadline of 31 October must therefore be used wisely and effectively, by exposed businesses in particular, on increased preparedness measures. It is only by Government, business and citizens working together, both nationally and with our EU partners, that we can aim to mitigate, as far as possible, the impacts of a no deal Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  We are determined to be as prepared as we can be, deal or no deal, for the changes Brexit will bring. We will continue this work as a fully committed EU Member State and with the unwavering solidarity and support of our EU partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100062#WRF05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Visits","counter":326,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100062#WRF05600"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[30731\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100062#WRF05700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on his recent trip to Germany; the discussions he had relating to Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":328,"content":"<p>I accompanied President Higgins and his wife Sabina on a State Visit to Germany last week, from 2 to 5 July. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The State Visit was a truly memorable event which highlighted the historic and contemporary links between our two countries. \u00a0The success of the visit will, I believe, form a strong basis for further deepening and growing our already excellent bilateral relations in the years ahead.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The President&rsquo;s programme included engagements in Berlin, Leipzig, W&uuml;rzburg and Frankfurt.

On a political level, we already cooperate closely through a number of institutions, most notably the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council, both of which are institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.\u00a0<\/p><p>The British Irish Intergovernmental Conference was established to deal with &ldquo;the totality of relationships&rdquo; between these islands and to promote bilateral cooperation at all levels on all matters of mutual interest within the competence of the two sovereign Governments. It provides an important opportunity to consider the East West relationship and a forum to discuss important issues, as the agenda of the last meeting reflected, including political developments in Northern Ireland, East-West economic cooperation, security cooperation, issues relating to the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland, and issues of rights and citizenship. There have been three meetings of the Conference over the past year, in London last July, in Dublin in November and again in London on 8 May last.<b><\/b><\/p><p>For its part, the British-Irish Council brings together the Irish and UK Governments, the Devolved Administrations in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh,  as well as representatives of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. The Council continues to work on areas of shared importance, with the Taoiseach and Minister Bruton attending the most recent Summit meeting in Manchester two weeks ago.<\/p><p>There are also strong inter-parliamentary relations maintained and developed through the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA), which brings together elected representatives from the Oireachtas, the UK Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Scottish and Welsh devolved Assemblies, as well as the representative assemblies for the Channel Islands and\u00a0 the Isle of Man. Three of the four BIPA Committees have carried out inquiries into the consequences of the UK exit from the EU for various sectors across this island, meeting with practitioners and stakeholders to hear evidence and further the discourse around this issue of primary importance.<\/p><p>However, notwithstanding the important work of these Institutions, there is a real danger that, post-Brexit, our two countries could lose the habit of cooperation that we have developed working side by side in EU institutions since 1973. Therefore, we will need to work hard to protect and develop our relationship as close neighbours and good friends. <\/p><p>That is why, at last November's British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, we discussed a joint paper outlining a possible model to maintain and strengthen the high level of bilateral co-operation between Ireland and the UK post-Brexit. <\/p><p>As announced following the Conference, this model would include top level summits involving the Taoiseach and Prime Minister and senior Irish and UK Ministers.\u00a0These summits would be supported by close bilateral work at both political and official levels. <\/p><p>This commitment was reaffirmed at the most recent BIIGC, held in May this year, and officials on both sides have commenced the process of turning these ideas into a detailed practical plan of work with a view to presenting a fully worked through proposal for future East-West cooperation.<\/p><p>The Embassy of Ireland in London remains our largest bilateral Embassy globally, and has had additional staff assigned to it since the Brexit vote to reflect the fact that our relationship with the UK is such a high priority. Our Consulate in Edinburgh continues to be very active, and our Consulate in Cardiff has reopened in recent months. Our Global Ireland policy contains a pledge to open an additional consulate in another British location post-2019. &lsquo;Team Ireland&rsquo; also enjoys a significant footprint in Britain with our trade, tourism, and investment agencies continuing to make a positive impact. <\/p><p>I am therefore confident that these existing structures and proposed new arrangements will provide ample opportunity for positive engagement between our two Governments into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100063#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Policy","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100063#WRG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[31193\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100063#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the areas being prioritised in terms of EU policy over the next five years aside from Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>In June, the European Council adopted a new Strategic Agenda 2019-2024 to guide the work of the Union over the next five years.

scenario (i.e. an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU, to include a transition period until the end of 2020), an additional 600 Revenue staff would be required.<\/p><p>In September 2018, the Government granted approval in principle for the phased recruitment of an additional 600 Revenue staff to meet the challenges posed by Brexit. <\/p><p>Budget 2019 provided Revenue with an additional &euro;10 million\u00a0pay provision, for 270 of the additional 600 staff to be recruited during 2019, to manage an orderly UK withdrawal. Following a Government Decision in December 2018, it was agreed to accelerate Revenue&rsquo;s recruitment programme in preparation for Brexit. <\/p><p>In the period from 2017 to date, I am advised that Revenue has assigned over 450 additional staff to customs related roles, deployed across a range of functions, with the majority assigned to import and export trade facilitation activities and policy and operational roles. Resources are deployed based on evolving business needs and to tackle any risks as they emerge. Revenue will continue to adjust its recruitment and training plans in response to business needs, including Brexit-related developments. <\/p><p>With regard to question 30735  , I am advised by Revenue that the EU Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) programme, aims to enhance international supply chain security and to facilitate legitimate trade and is open to all Irish businesses who are involved in making Customs declarations. <\/p><p>There is no legal obligation for businesses to become an AEO in order to trade with the UK post-Brexit. While there are benefits to AEO there are also obligations, so a decision to apply for AEO is a matter for careful consideration by each business based on a full assessment of its supply chain and operating model. Full details of the AEO programme are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie. <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that in 2018, 30 of the 42 applications for AEO status were received by Revenue in the second half of that year and the increased interest in AEO has continued in 2019 with 82 applications to date.<\/p><p>The breakdown for each of the years 2012 to 2018 and to date in 2019 is as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>AEO Applications<\/th><th>AEO Authorisations Granted<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>42<\/td><td>21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2019 to date (09\/07\/19)<\/td><td>82<\/td><td>46<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>With regard to questions 30983 and 31361  , Revenue identifies businesses that trade with the UK by analysing the VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) data. <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it is currently analysing VIES data from 2018 which has identified approximately 92,000 businesses having traded with the UK in 2018. On further examination of the data, Revenue identified that approximately 70% (65,000) of these businesses do not currently hold an EORI number. <\/p><p>Details of the value of trade with the UK in 2018 for the approximate 65,000 businesses who do not have an EORI number is set out in the following table:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Value of Trade<\/th><th>Number of Businesses (approximately in each category).<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;&euro;1M<\/td><td>250 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;100K-&euro;1M<\/td><td>2,600<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;50k - &euro;100K<\/td><td>2,800<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;5K &ndash; &euro;50K\u00a0 <\/td><td>19,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&amp;lt; &euro;5K <\/td><td>*<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>* Revenue is continuing its analysis of data in order to establish the number of businesses that had only one transaction or a minimal level of transactions in the year.<\/p><p>Revenue pointed out that for businesses that may have had only a once off transaction or infrequent trade with the UK, it may be that such transactions and trade are not expected to arise post Brexit. It is a matter for each business to assess its supply chain in the context of Brexit and determine what steps it needs to take to be prepared.<\/p><p>Revenue advised that acquiring an EORI number is the minimum requirement for businesses that wish to trade with, or through, the UK when they leave the EU.\u00a0 It is a simple and free online process which is available on a 24-hour basis. Once a business is registered with the Revenue Online Service (ROS), the turnaround time for Revenue to process an EORI number application is approximately 3 minutes. <\/p><p>Details of the number of EORI registrations applied for and issued since 2017 is as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Number of EORI   Registrations<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>2,595<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>2,976<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2019 to date**<\/td><td>7,128<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>**reflect figures up to 8 July 2019<\/p><p>Revenue continue to encourage businesses that have not yet applied for an EORI number and who will need one post Brexit to do so as a matter of urgency. In that regard I am advised that Revenue will be in direct contact with such businesses over the coming weeks. Once businesses have acquired an EORI number they need to continue their preparations to ensure they avoid significant delays in moving goods to, from or across the UK. At a minimum, every business should have the facility to make customs declarations or have plans in place for a customs agent to do so; know the origin and Commodity Code of their goods or products, and talk to the person who transports their goods or products to make sure they have the information they need to be able to move those goods or products.<\/p><p>In relation to question 31360  , I am advised by Revenue that it estimates that there will be an increase in customs declarations from current levels of approximately 1.6m per annum to over 20 million per annum post-Brexit. Consequently, a key priority for Revenue has been to upgrade the relevant IT systems to ensure that it can cater for this potential volume increase in the post-Brexit environment and to work with the relevant software providers in supporting their preparedness for Brexit.<\/p><p>In Budget 2017, I included provision for a &euro;2 million investment in scaling up the Revenue customs IT framework. As a result of this, Revenue carried out significant work to increase systems capacity to cater for trade with the UK as a third country.\u00a0 I am advised by Revenue that robust stress and performance testing has taken place to ensure their systems will have capacity to cater for the volumes and the impact on the systems, particularly at peak times. This upgrading was completed prior to 31 March 2019 and I am advised by Revenue that it is confident that the IT systems will handle the increased declaration levels in a no-deal scenario.<\/p><p>I am further advised that Revenue has engaged directly with software providers and customs agents to ensure these key players are aware of the requirements in the post-Brexit environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100063#WRG05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100063#WRG05900"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[30771\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100063#WRG06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost of implementing a living wage &euro;12.30 for all employees directly employed and or in agencies under his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":403,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the cost of implementing a living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour for all employees directly employed by my Department would be approximately &euro;82,000 annually.<\/p><p>Of the 17 bodies under the aegis of my Department, I am informed that 8 would incur no additional costs by implementing a living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour.

The EROI benchmark is calculated based on the comparison of NAMA&rsquo;s projected terminal surplus position with NAMA&rsquo;s initial investment, as adjusted to exclude the &euro;5.6 billion in State Aid which NAMA was required to pay to the participating institutions as part of the loan acquisition price. NAMA&rsquo;s EROI target benchmark, as approved by its Board in 2014, is 20%. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that this surplus has yet to fully crystallise and that the transfer of surplus funds to the Central Fund can only begin after NAMA's remaining subordinated debt and equity obligations have been repaid in full, which is expected to be in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  It is currently envisaged that the available surplus will be transferred to the Exchequer in 2020 and 2021. It is estimated that &euro;2 billion will be transferred in 2020 with a further &euro;2 billion being transferred in 2021. This timeline is contingent on NAMA&rsquo;s projected surplus of &euro;4 billion remaining unchanged. <\/p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules at that time.

Under this programme, the ESRI produced research on the carbon tax in 2018, including on the distributional impacts of a once-off increase in the tax. The research found that households at all income levels will face similar percentage increases in consumer prices in the event of such an increase, but with the impact felt differing on the basis of the carbon intensity of the goods they consume and the ease with which households can switch their consumption. In the case of a &euro;5 increase in carbon tax, the research found that costs would increase by &euro;0.45 per week for the poorest households and by &euro;2.30 a week for the richest, reflecting the different consumption patterns experienced by these households. However, in terms of shares of income, the impacts on poorer households was found to be more than double that on richer households. For a &euro;5 increase, the poorest households will have to spend 0.16% more of their income to continue the same level of consumption (of all commodities), whereas the richest will have to spend 0.07% more.<\/p>  <p>  The model used in this research was limited to performing a static analysis and could not capture the impact of producers and consumers altering their behaviour in reaction to increases in the carbon tax. The next phase of this joint research work underway utilises\u00a0a the more dynamic Ireland Environment-Energy-Economy (I3E) model which can examine phased increases in tax rates over time. As part of this work, the Department has also commissioned the ESRI to undertake an extension of the model to distinguish impacts by household income level and location. This research is currently in progress and is expected to be completed in advance of the budget so as to inform budgetary decisions on the carbon tax.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100064#WRH06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":471,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100064#WRH06200"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[30854\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100064#WRH06300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the different income streams directly paid by persons to his Department or agencies under his remit, such as motor tax; the number of persons making annual payments; the value of same; the number of payments made through staged or increment payments; the value of same; the additional income generated as a result of payments being made on an incremental basis; if incremental payments are not available, the reason for same; the corresponding figures for 1999 and 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":473,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that there are no income streams paid by persons directly to my Department.<\/p>  <p>  One of the seventeen bodies under the remit of my Department, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, has such an income stream in the form of the Local Property Tax (LPT).<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, approximately 735,000 property owners (53% of LPT property owners) made payments on an annual basis with an approximate value of &euro;240m and approximately 660,000 property owners (47% of LPT property owners) made payments on a phased basis with an approximate value of &euro;250m. <\/p>  <p>  Local Property Tax was introduced with effect from 1 July 2013.

The approach ensured the taxpayer record was fully up to date prior to the P21 Statement being generated and avoided the possibility of an overpayment or underpayment being incorrectly reflected.<\/p><p>The commencement of PAYE Modernisation means that Revenue is now receiving real-time pay and statutory deductions information from employers\/pension providers for their employees\/pension recipients on or before each pay date. The availability of such real-time data will allow Revenue to automatically provide preliminary End of Year Statements to all employees\/pension recipients each year, for example, the End of Year Statements in respect of 2019 will be available in early 2020. <\/p><p>The End of Year Statement will include the pay, tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) information for each employment\/pension, as reported by the employer\/pension provider, and will indicate if an over-deduction or under-deduction of tax and USC has occurred. The availability of the End of Year Statement will encourage taxpayers to claim any additional tax credits or reliefs, such as health expenses, or to declare any additional incomes, which can be done by completing a pre-populated Form 12 tax return. Once a taxpayer confirms that the End of Year Statement is correct, a P21 Statement will issue and any overpayments will be automatically refunded.<\/p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s innovative use of real-time information to streamline and simplify the PAYE process ensures that taxpayer records are fully up to-date and all employments, pensions, incomes, credits and entitlements accounted for before a final review is conducted and a P21 issued. It is hoped this simplified facility will encourage taxpayers to claim their entitlements and ensure as far as possible, that they pay the right amount of tax at the right time. <\/p><p>Finally, I commend Revenue for the very significant improvements it has made to the PAYE system and the efforts it has made to simplify the tax system for citizens.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100065#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":484,"content":"<p>Question No. 192 answered with Question No. 188.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Investigations","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100065#WRJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[30975\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100065#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the enforcement investigations being undertaken by the Central Bank in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":487,"content":"<p>I am advised by the\u00a0Central Bank that it\u00a0does not publish details of ongoing enforcement investigations.\u00a0<\/p><p>However, as part of the Tracker Mortgage Examination (), the Bank\u00a0confirmed that in parallel with its supervisory work, enforcement proceedings commenced against six lenders: permanent\u00a0tsb plc; Ulster Bank Ireland DAC; Bank of Ireland Group (The Governor and Company of Bank of Ireland and the Bank of Ireland Mortgage Bank trading as Bank of Ireland Mortgages); KBC Bank Ireland plc; Allied Irish Banks, plc; and EBS DAC.<\/p><p>On 30 May 2019, the Central Bank fined permanent tsb plc &euro;21,000,000 in respect of serious failings to 2,007 tracker mortgage customer accounts.

The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplements was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector and has never been disputed by Revenue. Revenue has referenced the original scope of its zero rating concession but acknowledged that the scope had broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. After undertaking a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable and engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018.

to immediately stem or reverse premium price rises.\u00a0 This is because there are many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address this issue in particular the fact that for constitutional reasons, it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and for legal reasons it cannot direct insurance companies as to the pricing level which they should apply in respect of businesses seeking insurance.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to reemphasise how important this issue is for the Government.\u00a0 As the Deputy is aware, the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.\u00a0 The Deputy will recall that the CIWG has produced two reports since its inception and has been working to implement the 33 recommendations of the Cost of Motor Insurance Report published in 2017, as well as the 15 Recommendations of the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report, published in 2018.\u00a0 To that end, the key achievements to date from the two reports, including the following:\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - the passing of the Judicial Council Bill by the Oireachtas on 9 July in order to\u00a0implement the\u00a0\u00a0recommendations of the Personal Injuries Commission regarding award levels in this country, including a judicial recalibration of the existing Book of Quantum guidelines;<\/p>  <p>  - the commencement by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;<\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance;<\/p>  <p>  - reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019;<\/p>  <p>  - commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p>  <p>  - the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,<\/p>  <p>  - various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).\u00a0 The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.\u00a0 In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.\u00a0 Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy and I have worked closely with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD to progress the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas as a matter of priority.\u00a0 I am therefore pleased that the Bill was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 9 July, and I expect it will be signed into law by the President shortly.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Now that the Bill has been passed, it will be a matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to establish the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.\u00a0 While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly and will take account of the PIC&rsquo;s benchmarking report.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the remaining recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and I expect to publish the Ninth Update Report by the Cost of Insurance Working Group in the coming weeks.\u00a0 I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100065#WRJ05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration Data","counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100065#WRJ05400"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[31292\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100065#WRJ05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of the VRT rebate for electric cars in 2018;

that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.\u00a0 Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.\u00a0 This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.\u00a0 Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the difficulties faced by returning emigrants in respect of motor insurance was recognised by the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s\u00a0 (CIWG) and was the subject of a particular recommendation.\u00a0 In this regard, a protocol was agreed between Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance in relation to returning emigrants, under which insurance companies committed to accepting the driving experience of such drivers gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.\u00a0 The details of it is available on Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s website and the websites of its member companies. <\/p>  <p>  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated differently to any other driver, subject to verification of their continued driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.\u00a0 Thus, a returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending that time abroad.\u00a0 Furthermore, under the protocol, insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein.\u00a0 My Department continues to review the implementation of this recommendation through its regular engagement with Insurance Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I understand that in general, insurance companies set a date by which a no-claims bonus will expire, where the driver has held no insurance in their own name for two or more years. \u00a0This applies whether the person continues to reside in Ireland, or they decide to move abroad and it is primarily a commercial matter for insurance companies.\u00a0 Therefore, if the person is abroad for less than two years, then it should not be necessary to continue to pay for a policy while abroad.\u00a0 However, the protocol states that if more than two years have passed since the Irish motor insurance policy was cancelled\/lapsed, the Irish No Claims Discount is no longer valid.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this, if the person has been abroad for longer than two years, Insurance Ireland members have agreed through the protocol that if the person has claims-free driving experience in a different country in their own name, they will take this experience into consideration if that person seeks a quotation from an insurer, on their return to Ireland, subject to the appropriate verifiable documentation being provided.\u00a0 If the Deputy is aware of instances where it appears that a person is having problems in this regard, I would suggest that the person contacts Insurance Ireland, who operate a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.\u00a0 Insurance Ireland can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I believe that the overall implementation of the CIWG&rsquo;s recommendations is having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance.\u00a0 The latest CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak, consequently the average consumer should be seeing reductions when renewing their motor insurance.\u00a0 In addition, I would note that representations made to my Department from returning emigrants have dropped significantly in the last year.\u00a0 I am hopeful that this reflects that more are receiving insurance cover in line with the protocol referenced above.\u00a0 The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100066#WRK00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance

implications and therefore it has taken more time to implement than was anticipated when the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published.<\/p><p>I agree with the view of the CIWG that a new fully functioning integrated fraud database should be established. \u00a0In this regard, I believe that the State managing and controlling the existing database would be a sub-optimal solution in dealing with the issue of insurance fraud.\u00a0 I would note that the proposal that this new integrated fraud database be managed by an independent not-for-profit body but funded by industry, would meet the objective of removing industry&rsquo;s control of the database and be more economical as the taxpayer should not have to pay for a service which is ultimately of benefit to insurers. \u00a0In addition, the nature of the CIWG proposal is that it will most likely make the existing database redundant as it relates to fraud detection.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Finally, it should be noted that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation and therefore have no role in the operation of, or the provision of information to the organisation mentioned or this database.

The FEMPI legislation introduced measures that directly reduced pay, and reduced annual pensions of public servants, subject to certain rates, thresholds and exemptions. As both the annual pensions and lump sum payments of members of pre- 2013 public service pension schemes are directly linked to salary at retirement, the reductions to the pay of public servants would have had a knock on impact on the lump sum payment they received at retirement. <\/p><p>However because of what is known as the first grace period, those who retired between 1 January 2010 and 29 February 2012 did not have the first FEMPI pay reduction (imposed 1 January 2010) reflected in the salary rate used to calculate their annual pension or their lump sum. A second round of FEMPI reductions was imposed in 2013 (imposed on 1 July on public servants with an annual remuneration above &euro;65,000). However the second grace period meant that those who retired from that point onwards (assuming their pay was affected by those reductions while still serving) did not have those reductions reflected in the salary rate used\u00a0to\u00a0calculate\u00a0their annual pension or lump sum.<\/p><p>Thus it is only those who retired from 1 March 2012 onwards whose lump sums are potentially, indirectly impacted by FEMPI, and it is only the first FEMPI reduction which could have had an impact. However salaries of all serving staff have been increased, and some restored to pre-FEMPI rates, through pay increase measures contained in FEMPI Act 2015 and The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the first of these measures being applied from 1 January 2016. Thus the lump sums of those retiring since such pay increases were introduced are not affected to the same extent, or if the salary has been fully restored by the time they retired their lump sum is not affected at all. (As of June 2019, pay reductions have been fully reversed for all public servants earning up to &euro;30,000 and this includes approximately 9,500 civil servants).<\/p><p>Due to the fact that there was no explicit measure to reduce lump sum payments contained in the FEMPI legislation, but rather an indirect impact, and to varying degrees, on certain lump sums, the information requested is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work. <\/p><p>However the following table illustrates an example of the impact on the lump sums of individuals who retired between 1 March 2012 (the date after the expiration of the first grace period) and before the date of the first pay increase,\u00a0at different salary rates.

In November 2018, my Department published a consultation paper on valuing greenhouse gas emissions in the Public Spending Code, along with a review of the other central technical appraisal parameters used in the Code.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The paper on valuing greenhouse gas emissions concluded that the model currently in use for pricing carbon in the Public Spending Code is outdated. It proposed a new methodology that values future greenhouse gas emissions according to a shadow price of carbon that is based on the estimated marginal cost that will be faced by society in achieving Ireland&rsquo;s legally binding 2030 greenhouse gas emissions target.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In practical terms, this means a new shadow price of carbon for non-ETS emissions of &euro;32 per tonne in 2020, rising by &euro;6.80 a year to reach &euro;100 per tonne by 2030. Beyond 2030, it is proposed that the shadow price of carbon will continue to\u00a0rise by 5% a year. This means that the shadow price of carbon rises to &euro;128 for 2035, &euro;163 for 2040, &euro;208 for 2045 and &euro;265 for 2050.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The consultation period has now concluded and my Department has completed its evaluation of the responses received. It is my intention to publish a decision paper detailing my Department's response to the views received along with a circular revising the Public Spending Code to take account of the revised shadow price of carbon during the course of July. The circular will also update other technical parameters, including a downward revision of the test discount rate from 5% to 4%.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Collectively, these reforms will ensure that the Public Spending Code incorporates a more realistic appreciation of the climate consequences of all Government investment decisions. Once the circular is published the use of the revised values will be mandatory for all appraisals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100066#WRK05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Project Ireland 2040 Administration","counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100066#WRK05400"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[30833\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100066#WRK05500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the review of selection criteria for Project Ireland 2040 funds has commenced to ensure low-carbon investments are prioritised for funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":596,"content":"<p>The selection criteria for the Project Ireland Funds are a matter for the four Departments running the Project Ireland 2040 competitive funds, namely:\u00a0 <\/p><p>- the Minister for Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation for the Disruptive Technologies Fund,\u00a0 <\/p><p>- the Minister for Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; the Environment for the Climate Action Fund,\u00a0 <\/p><p>- the Minister for Rural &amp;amp; Community Development for the Rural Regeneration &amp;amp; Development Fund, and <\/p><p>- the Minister for Housing, Planning\u00a0 &amp;amp; Local Government for the Urban Regeneration &amp;amp; Development Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100066#WRK05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":597,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100066#WRK05700"},{"type":"question","counter":598,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[30859\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100066#WRK05800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the different income streams directly paid by persons to his Department or agencies under his remit, such as motor tax; the number of persons making annual payments; the value of same; the number of payments made through staged or increment payments; the value of same; the additional income generated as a result of payments being made on an incremental basis; if incremental payments are not available, the reason for same; the corresponding figures for 1999 and 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":599,"content":"<p>Due to the nature of\u00a0their roles, neither my Department nor the\u00a0bodies under its\u00a0aegis have annual\u00a0income streams from sources\u00a0similar to\u00a0motor tax, directly paid by persons to them.\u00a0 The Office of Public Works will respond\u00a0directly to the Deputy in line with Standing Order 42A.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100066#WRK05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Spending Code","counter":600,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100066#WRK06000"},{"type":"question","counter":601,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[30874\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100066#WRK06100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the changes to procurement procedures after the national children&rsquo;s hospital capital overrun; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":602,"content":"<p>As part of the ongoing reform of Ireland&rsquo;s capital management systems, the Office of Government Procurement is conducting a review of construction procurement and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is reviewing the Public Spending Code.

The Act also provides for the funding of research to provide information on existing and likely future skills requirements of the economy. <\/p><p>The creation of the fund was announced in Budget 2000 by the then Minister for Finance to raise the skills of those in employment, to give jobseekers relevant skills and to facilitate lifelong learning.  The NTF replaced the Apprenticeship Levy which was set up under The Industrial Training (Apprenticeship Levy) Act 1994. In May 2010, responsibility for the NTF was transferred from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p><p>During the recession, the focus moved sharply from training those in employment to supporting unemployed people back into the workplace. However there has been a fundamental shift in the labour market over the last 6 years with unemployment falling from a 16% high in 2012 to 5.6% in February 2019. This has been reflected in a changed and rebalanced suite of NTF-funded programmes to support the larger working population, to address the higher demand for lifelong learning as the influence of technology increases and to seek to address emerging areas of skills and labour shortage. <\/p><p>The NTF enables more flexible responses to changing economic\/labour market conditions. As the economic climate has improved, expenditure on training for those in employment has increased with a corresponding reduction in expenditure on training for those seeking employment. This trend is evident from 2014 to 2018 and will continue in 2019.<\/p><p>Following a consultation process, the Government, as part of Budget 2018, decided to raise the rate of the National Training Fund (NTF) levy by 0.1% in 2018 to 0.8%. As part of Budget 2019, the levy was raised by a further 0.1% to 0.9% and by 0.1% in 2020 on the basis of the implementation of planned reforms.<\/p><p>An independent review of the National Training Fund was commissioned by the Department of Education and Skills as part of the package of reforms. This independent review, which was undertaken by Indecon, was published by the Minister for Education and Skills on 17 August 2018.  The report made 14 specific recommendations across 4 key areas:<\/p><p>- Reform of the future direction of the NTF.<\/p><p>- Utilising the NTF to support investment in Higher Education.<\/p><p>- Enhancing enterprise engagement and input to NTF priorities.<\/p><p>- Improvements in monitoring\/evaluation of the NTF.<\/p><p>An Implementation Plan to deliver the recommendations contained in the Independent Review was published as part of Budget 2019 along with details of a new advisory group to the National Skills Council in order optimise enterprise engagement on NTF priorities. <\/p><p>I attach a file showing the amount collected from the NTF levy and the expenditure as requested and the number of participants funded by the National Training Fund from 2010 to 2018, which is the information available.  <\/p><p>Additional information is available in the recently published expenditure report available at the following link:<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100068#WRM04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Skills Development","counter":718,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100068#WRM04300"},{"type":"question","counter":719,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[31135\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100068#WRM04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of businesses that availed of enterprise training, workforce learning and upskilling services from Skillnet Ireland on an annual basis over the 2014 to 2018 period; the annual breakdown in participation in percentage terms by firm size (details supplied); the annual allocation to Skillnet Ireland in each year over 2014 to 2018 period; and the amount allocated in 2019.","asker":"1250","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":720,"content":"<p>Skillnet Ireland actively supports and works with businesses in Ireland to address their current and future skills needs.

Mathematical proficiency has been adopted as a key aim in policy documents on mathematics in many countries, for example, the US (CCSSM\/NGA, 2010), New Zealand (Anthony &amp;amp; Walshaw, 2007) and Australia (ACARA, 2009). <\/p><p>The NCCA will publish the draft Primary Mathematics Curriculum for junior infants to sixth class in 2020 for consultation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100069#WRN05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Appeals","counter":806,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100069#WRN05300"},{"type":"question","counter":807,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[31288\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100069#WRN05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of school transport appeals lodged to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":808,"content":"<p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department. <\/p><p>There are currently over 117,500 children, including\u00a0over 13,000 children with special educational needs, transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually.<\/p><p>The School Transport Appeals Board is independent of my Department.\u00a0 Under the terms of reference of the\u00a0Board, the Board determines appeals against decisions made by, or on behalf of, the Department of Education and Skills regarding the provision of school transport services and\/or grant-aid under the terms of the School Transport Schemes.<\/p><p>I can advise that a total of 94 appeals were lodged to date for the 2019 school year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100069#WRN05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Data","counter":809,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100069#WRN05600"},{"type":"question","counter":810,"qnumday":309,"qnumall":"[31289\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100069#WRN05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of applications received for the school transport scheme in 2018; and the number of places provided.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":811,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[31290\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100069#WRN05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children provided with school transport on a concessionary basis through the school transport scheme.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":812,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 309 and 310 together.<\/p><p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department. <\/p><p>There are currently over 117,500 children, including over 13,000 children with special educational needs, transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually.<\/p><p>The purpose of the scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  <\/p><p>Children are generally eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school. <\/p><p>Children who are not eligible for school transport, under the terms of the scheme, may apply to Bus &Eacute;ireann for transport on a concessionary basis only.

The remit of the GNECB includes\u00a0playing a pro-active role in the prevention and detection of fraud, and\u00a0acting as a central repository for fraud related intelligence and therefore the GNECB effectively houses the Garda fraud unit.<\/p>  <p>  In relation specifically\u00a0to insurance fraud investigation, which has been discussed on a number of recent occasions in this House, I have previously outlined how the Garda Commissioner is of the view that a divisional focus on insurance fraud is preferable to the establishment of a centralised insurance fraud investigation unit. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will no doubt be aware of Deputy Commissioner John Twomey's appearance in front of the\u00a0Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 9th July. At the Committee, the Deputy Commissioner clearly set out the organisation's plans for fraud investigation:<\/p>  <p>  \"At meetings between Commissioner Harris and Minister D&rsquo;Arcy, both parties were agreed that private funding of a specialist insurance fraud unit was not the preferred option...<\/p>  <p>  Commissioner Harris has also informed the Minister that in line with the overall Garda strategy, GNECB will focus on major organised frauds including insurance cases and individual insurance frauds will be dealt with at divisional level. This is in line with the greater emphasis on divisional-led policing as outlined in the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.\u00a0This divisional-led approach is currently being trialled as part of our four Divisional Policing Model pilots.\"<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Commissioner Twomey went on to state:<\/p>  <p>  \"The Commissioner believes that it is important that there is sufficient expertise at divisional level to deal with individual frauds. Each division already has a number of Garda&iacute; trained in fraud investigation and 50 more will be trained this year. The resource requirement for each Division will be different and will depend on the number of crimes reported and requiring investigation. Further\u00a0 resources &ndash; 6 Sergeants and 6 Garda&iacute; - have also recently been provided to GNECB to assist in all areas of fraud investigation. It is anticipated that a competition for positions in GNECB will commence in the second half of this year.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop in-house expertise in\u00a0investigating insurance-related fraud.

The programme outlines the steps SPSV operators can take to make life safer, more secure and compliant with current health and safety legislation, and there is a specific\u00a0section on looking after their personal security.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, I am informed that all taxi drivers, as part of their initial training and preparation for examinations, are provided with the Official Manual for Operating within the SPSV Industry. This manual is produced by the NTA in consultation with the Garda Crime Prevention Unit and contains a chapter entitled Staying Safe. The chapter offers a range of information and suggestions on how to deal with difficult customers or dangerous situations. This includes suggestions on taking extra care in isolated areas, making eye contact with the customer when the customer gets into the car, and arranging a code word with the dispatch operator or a colleague that can be used in communication with them if danger is perceived.<\/p>  <p>  Information regarding ways to reduce the risk of robbery is also provided. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has recommended that taxi drivers:<\/p>  <p>  - avoid carrying large sums of cash where possible;<\/p>  <p>  - not show, or tell, customers how much cash they have and be discrete with their cash when giving a customer change;<\/p>  <p>  - not display valuables; and,<\/p>  <p>  - lock their vehicles while in isolated areas or waiting for a customer to arrive.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also advises that taxi drivers who have been the victims of robbery or fare evasion should not chase the perpetrators because this might put their <\/p>  <p>  personal safety at further risk. In addition, it is advised that taxi drivers should not take any action that might be deemed to be illegal or, again, put themselves at risk, such as detaining a passenger by force. The advice from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to taxi drivers is to make contact immediately on 999 or 112 if they have been the victim of an assault, robbery or fare evasion and, if safe to do so, remain at that location until Garda&iacute; arrive.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, matters relating to legal protections for public transport workers would generally fall to my colleague, Minister Ross, at the

The Superior Courts have an inherent supervisory role over solicitors including, particularly, the High Court, which can impose sanctions for professional misconduct up to and including the striking off of\u00a0any solicitor concerned.\u00a0This is to ensure that solicitors comply with their ethical obligations and act with the highest standards of conduct while also allowing the court to discipline or penalise solicitors who have failed in their duty to the court. The court therefore relies on solicitors to comply with their duties and to take careful instructions from their clients, to prepare their pleadings carefully, and to represent their client as best they can while complying with their duties to the court of candour and disclosure. <\/p>  <p>  Similarly, barristers have a duty to the court. Under the Professional Code of the Honorable\u00a0Society of the King's Inns it is the duty of barristers to act at all times with honesty and integrity and not to engage in conduct which is prejudicial to the administration of justice. They are also obliged to comply with the provisions of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 and any relevant code issued by the Regulatory Authority.\u00a0 Specifically, barristers have an over-riding duty to\u00a0the court to ensure, in the public interest, that the proper and efficient\u00a0administration of justice is achieved and they must assist the court in the administration of justice and must not deceive or knowingly mislead the court. \u00a0The Code of Conduct of the Bar of Ireland also provides that a barrister shall not knowingly make, procure or countenance the making of any false or misleading statement of fact, whether express or implied, written or parol, with regard to any matter in which the barrister is engaged to any court or other body. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted, therefore, that the courts supervision of these matters is\u00a0in addition to those broader measures that also apply to solicitors and barristers in the conduct of their business under their respective professional regulatory regimes. These are matters which will fall, to a growing extent,\u00a0to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which will come into substantial operational mode\u00a0in this area from October 2019. This will happen\u00a0under Part 6 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 which I will be commencing at that time. The Authority\u00a0will then deal with disciplinary and conduct\u00a0matters in relation to both solicitors and barristers.\u00a0\u00a0This will\u00a0be bolstered by the separate establishment of the new Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal which will address serious misconduct in relation to both solicitors and barristers - including in terms of their possible striking off or disbarment with the approval of the High Court.<\/p>  <p>  As I have set out , there are serious consequences for\u00a0any legal practitioner who may be found to have acted\u00a0in contravention of those duties owed to\u00a0the court, including as the Deputy has raised, where this may involve an element of fraud. I would also point out that this is without prejudice to\u00a0any investigation of\u00a0such fraudulent matters by\u00a0the competent authorities under the criminal law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100073#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":1040,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[31429\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100073#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the integrated insurance fraud database will be up and running; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1041,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter again. On 6 February 2018, in response to parliamentary question 65, I advised the Deputy that my Department had established a Working Group to progress the action points raised under recommendation 25 of the Cost of Insurance Working Group's Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, i.e. the establishment of a fully functioning integrated insurance fraud database for industry.<\/p><p>This Working Group continues to meet in order to establish an appropriate mechanism whereby insurance companies can share information to assist in the combatting of fraud. However, data protection-related issues have dominated the group&rsquo;s deliberations and ultimately have made it impossible to establish the database by the end of 2018, as had been scheduled.<\/p><p>The Working Group has engaged in discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC), the respective UK bodies dealing with insurance fraud (the Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department and the Insurance Fraud Bureau), and completed a report which includes the recommended agreed parameters of the database, who is to be responsible, how it will be funded, and who will have access.<\/p><p>As noted last year, the application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the related Data Protection Bill will have a significant impact on any new data sharing arrangements between industry members and between the industry and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. As such, the establishment of any new data sharing structures will require careful consideration against the changes to the legislative landscape. More generally, a critical balance will also be sought to ensure that data sharing between insurers is maximised while, at the same time, the data rights of the public are protected. Any changes, therefore, must be proportional to their effect.<\/p><p>The report of the Working Group was submitted to the Office of the Attorney General and the ODPC and in response, the ODPC strongly endorsed the group&rsquo;s view that a detailed Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) was required in order to answer outstanding concerns regarding the potential addition of new datasets to Insurance Ireland's existing InsuranceLink database, and the increased sharing of data. <\/p><p>The ODPC recommended that further work be completed to detail the evidential requirements for the creation of a new database or the enhancement of the existing InsuranceLink database. The benefits of such a database should be assessed against the potential harm or detriments that could occur to individuals and their fundamental rights. The Office of the Attorney General has also considered the Working Group&rsquo;s report and further consultation will take place following the conclusion of the outstanding data protection matters.<\/p><p>In October last year, Insurance Ireland completed a DPIA in relation to matters such as the information currently held on InsuranceLink, as well as the specific additional data it is proposed will be shared, plus the additional circumstances under which the data will be shared. <\/p><p>Since receiving the DPIA, my officials conducted preliminary consultations with the ODPC, followed by more detailed consultations with the Department's internal Data Protection Support and Compliance Office (DPSCO). Subsequently, it was agreed by the Working Group (which met most recently in June 2019) that my officials would submit Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s DPIA on InsuranceLink to the ODPC on behalf of Insurance Ireland. The DPIA was submitted to the ODPC, in accordance with Article 36 of the GDPR, on 14 June 2019 and a response is awaited.<\/p><p>Engagement will continue with the insurance industry to see if it is possible to develop an enhanced version of the existing industry database, with the management of the database to be with an independent, not-for-profit body. This approach will provide for complete and open access to the data held on the database for all existing and new entrant market participants.<\/p><p>Subject to consultation with the ODPC, the next phase towards implementation of recommendation 25 will require the identification of such an appropriate independent body to manage the database. These matters will continue to be monitored by the Cost of Insurance Working Group, who produce public-facing reports to track the progress of each recommendation on a routine basis: <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100073#WRR01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service Data","counter":1042,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100073#WRR01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1043,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[31432\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100073#WRR01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Courts Service will establish and maintain a register of personal injury actions; the reason this has not been done; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1044,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, recommendation 27 of the\u00a0Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance prepared by the Cost of Insurance Working Group\u00a0is to review section 30 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 which provides that the Courts Service will establish and maintain a register of personal injuries actions.\u00a0 <\/p><p>My Department\u00a0submitted a report to the Cost of Insurance Working Group in February 2019 following its review of section 30 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.

The package of Brexit supports encompasses finance, advisory and awareness.  DBEI&rsquo;s focus is on helping firms to improve their competitiveness and innovation, and to diversify markets.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are working to provide extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. The suite of enterprise and finance supports now in place covers the spectrum of potential Brexit impacts and aims to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  I made Brexit one of my top priorities in the allocations of funding for 2019 in my Department and I have allocated further funding to Brexit-related support from agencies and offices of my Department as part of Budget 2019. I have allocated an additional &euro;5 million capital funding to the Local Enterprise Offices, an increase of 22% for 2019, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to InterTrade Ireland to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. I have allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2m to IDA Ireland to expand their global footprints and drive the diversification of trade and investment. Additional resources have also been distributed across Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority and the NSAI for 2019 to support enterprises adjust to the new relationships with the UK and pursue new opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland (ITI) works with SMEs on an all-Ireland basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. To date, more than 4,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. <\/p>  <p>  ITI offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. <\/p>  <p>  ITI Brexit Start to Plan vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. 1,613 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 1,405 have been approved. ITI new Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000\/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This will allow businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs] are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, 644 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. 605 LEO clients have been approved for the Technical Assistance Grant. <\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Office interactive one day Prepare Your Business for Customs workshop helps businesses understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to succeed in a post Brexit environment. 531 Participants have so far attended this Customs Training. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme. The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. <\/p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, developed in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, provides relatively short term working capital, 1 to 3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. <\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme is available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Over 3,700 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions. EI is working closely with regionally-important larger companies in exposed sectors such as food to support strategic investments to build resilience &ndash; EI invested&euro;74 million in these businesses in 2018. EI has also hosted 11 Brexit Advisory Clinics. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, eligible EI client companies can respond to the threats and opportunities posed by Brexit by accessing the Agile Innovation Fund.  This fund supports clients to quickly develop innovations and respond to opportunities and threats in new and existing markets. The new Fund allows companies to access up to 50% in support of innovation projects with a total cost of up to &euro;300,000. A recent EI survey showed that EI clients that have availed of Innovation Capability, Funding and Collaboration support saw a 67% increase in global sales.<\/p>  <p>  EI also launched a Customs Insights online course which is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of the above schemes are open to all SMEs, not just agency clients. Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  In my meeting with Commissioner Vestager on 24th January 2019, we discussed the severe challenges that Irish businesses, especially SMEs, will face when the UK leaves the European Union and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.  We agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner&rsquo;s team in addressing any State aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the ultimate shape of Brexit and its firm-level implications become known.  The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in November 2017, the Commission approved a Rescue and Restructuring Scheme for Ireland for Undertakings in Difficulty.  Under the scheme, an undertaking is considered to be in difficulty when, without intervention by the State, it will almost certainly be condemned to going out of business in the short or medium term. <\/p>  <p>  While the nature of the UK's departure from the EU still remains to be determined, Brexit continues to represent a significant challenge for businesses in Ireland. I want businesses, particularly those most impacted by Brexit, to know my Department and agencies are here to help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100073#WRR02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cyber Security Protocols","counter":1052,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100073#WRR02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1053,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[30580\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100073#WRR02300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the cybersecurity protocols under the remit of her Department; if it has had a cybersecurity breach in the past 12 months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1054,"content":"<p>My Department has not had a cybersecurity breach in the past 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  In line with best practice my Department adopts a defence in depth approach to cybersecurity protection with a combination of technological controls and processes in place.

The Irish standards and regulations were introduced to protect consumers by preventing the rapid spread of a fire started on or near furniture. These standards are in line with those introduced in the UK, which is particularly relevant given the cross-border trade in furniture on the island of Ireland and the presence of furniture manufacturers along the border area.<\/p>  <p>  The UK has undertaken two consultations (in 2014 and 2016) on the suitability of the UK regulations but has yet to amend its regulations. In view of the similarity of the regulations in both jurisdictions, my Department has liaised very closely with the relevant department in the UK and continues to monitor the situation to keep abreast of developments in that jurisdiction. My Department also liaises, both formally and informally, with other stakeholders in Ireland on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  Having similar regulations in place on both sides of the border gives consumers clarity and certainty that uniform safety standards apply, while manufacturers have certainty that their products can be sold in both jurisdictions without going to the added expense of manufacturing furniture according to different standards and legislation. Any change in existing regulations, or replacement thereof, will have to provide a robust level of safety when it comes to furniture going on fire. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is conscious of the need to ensure that if replacement regulations are to be introduced, they must be effective and evidence-based, bearing in mind the tension between short term effects (in relation to flame retardant chemicals providing time to escape a fire and the impact on fire crews&rsquo; operations) and possible long-term health considerations.

Almost 60% of Irish SMEs report a good understanding of the likely implications of Brexit impacts that are relevant to their business. The findings of our latest research suggest that planning for Brexit is increasing with almost 50% of SMEs taking some form of active engagement (up from 42% in 2018) in the form of planning or any other  mitigating steps. Among the most impacted businesses, progress is also being made, for example more than half of exporters indicate that they have a Brexit plan. Among Enterprise Ireland clients, 85% have taken action in respect of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last two years my Department has worked to raise awareness of the key Brexit challenges which include supply chain, tariffs, customs, regulatory standards, working capital and movement of labour, goods and services; to build business preparedness levels; and to put a comprehensive set of supports in place for businesses. My Department and I have been active in the promotion of schemes and supports through participation in different campaigns, including the whole-of-Government 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign features workshop events throughout the country, aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit.

That is why my Department started developing supports for businesses from the time when Brexit first became a possibility.<\/p><p>My Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports, schemes and advisory resources to ensure that to ensure that businesses around the country are prepared for Brexit. While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying and managing key risk areas and develop practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation increased by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m. This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on last year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and, an increase of &euro;14.2m in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m. I also provided extra staff for the regulatory bodies of my Department to ensure they are properly resourced to address the additional demands that Brexit will create.<\/p><p>I allocated an extra &euro;5m to the 31 Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs], up 22% on 2018. The LEOs are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs are there to support businesses in preparing for Brexit, to ensure that businesses are informed and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. <\/p><p>In addition, 644 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. 605 LEO clients have been approved for the Technical Assistance Grant. <\/p><p>The Local Enterprise Office interactive one day Prepare Your Business for Customs workshop helps businesses understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to succeed in a post Brexit environment. 531 Participants have so far attended this Customs Training.<\/p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s response to Brexit, I allocated &euro;3 million in additional resources to Enterprise Ireland [EI] in budget 2019. EI has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.<\/p><p>Over 5,300 business have used EI&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms have a plan in place, while 199 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 266 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 16 Brexit Advisory Clinics. <\/p><p>EI also launched a Customs Insights Online course at the beginning of the year. This is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. There have been over 1,260 Customs Insights Course participants.<\/p><p>I also allocated &euro;2.75m additional capital to EI to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, including Brexit.<\/p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s response to Brexit, I allocated &euro;2million in additional resources to IDA Ireland, while an extra &euro;10 million has been allocated for the Agency&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme. IDA Ireland continues to work closely with international clients, from a range of sectors, to help them assess and prepare for the potential impacts of Brexit, and to capitalise on any opportunities for additional Brexit-related foreign direct investment (FDI) in the future. <\/p><p>The IDA offers support and advice on Brexit-related risks and opportunities and the Agency&rsquo;s Brexit Toolkit, which is available to clients, includes the full range of supports across training, research and development and capital investment.<\/p><p>The Agency is working hard to avail of new investment opportunities from non-traditional target markets. The Agency&rsquo;s efforts in this context have already yielded positive results, with over 80 Brexit-related investments and 5,300 associated jobs won to date. In addition, the Agency has recently launched a marketing campaign in key international markets to communicate clearly to both current and potential investors that, Ireland&rsquo;s investment proposition remains strong and that Ireland remains an attractive location for investment.<\/p><p>Funding to InterTrade Ireland has been increased by 18%. InterTrade Ireland plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. So far this year, more than 3,200 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.\u00a0 <\/p><p>ITI offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. <\/p><p>ITI Brexit Start to Plan vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. 1,613 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 1,405 have been approved. ITI new Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000\/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTrade Ireland paying 50%. This will allow businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.<\/p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, has leveraged up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million - &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short-term working capital, 1 to 3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them to innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and, if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.\u00a0 <\/p><p>As at 5 July, there have been 669 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 608 have been approved to date by SBCI. 150 of those applications have progressed to sanction at bank value, to a total value of &euro;32.93 million.<\/p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme, launched in March, makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years. This scheme is available to eligible businesses in Ireland and the primary agriculture (farmers) and seafood sectors to support strategic long-term investment. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the scheme operator, opened for eligibility applications on 17th April and up to July 8 it received 524 eligibility applications and issued 482 eligibility letters.<\/p><p>The first table attached sets out the uptake of the different Brexit-related supports available through the Department and its agencies as at 28 June 2019.<\/p><p>The second table attached sets out the respective exchequer increases in allocations to ITI, EI, IDA and the LEOs between 2018 and 2019 and the cost\/expenditure of the supports available. Whilst these increases are not all due to Brexit, they are mainly provided to assist the enterprise agencies in their responses to the challenges posed by Brexit.<\/p><p>While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the delays to Brexit may have led businesses to defer their immediate planning. However, the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will mean changes for Irish businesses. I want businesses to know that my Department and its agencies are here to help.\u00a0 The existing supports, schemes and advice are in place to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario.\u00a0<\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>Scheme<\/b><\/th><th><b>Uptake (28 June 2019)<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Brexit Loan Scheme<\/td><td><b>669 <\/b>applications received, 608 approved by SBCI,<b> 150 <\/b>Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of <b>&euro;32.93 <\/b>million.<br \/><br \/>(Uptake as of 5 July)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Future Growth Loan Scheme<\/td><td><b>524 <\/b>applications received, 482 approved by SBCI,<b> 17 <\/b>Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of <b>&euro;2.96 <\/b>million.<br \/><br \/>(Uptake as of 8 July)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard - online platform for Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit <\/td><td><b>5,334 <\/b>Brexit Scorecards have been completed.<b> 1095<\/b> LEO clients have completed the scorecard.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant<\/td><td><b>199<\/b> Be Prepared Grants have been approved<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new   markets<\/td><td><b>171<\/b> companies have been approved under this initiative<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Prepare to Export Scorecard<\/td><td><b>3,833 <\/b>Prepare to Export Scorecards have been completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Customs Insights Online Course<\/td><td><b>1,269 <\/b>Customs Insights Course participants<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding<\/td><td><b>55<\/b> Agile Innovation projects have been approved<br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics<\/td><td><b>16<\/b> Brexit Advisory Clinics have been run with over <b>1,200<\/b> in attendance<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience<\/td><td><b>266 <\/b>&ldquo;Act on&rdquo; Plans have been completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period<\/td><td><b>1,073<\/b> Strategic Consultancy Grants have been approved<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Technical Assistance Grant for Micro Export - an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities<\/td><td><b>605<\/b> clients were approved assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant<br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients<\/td><td><b>340<\/b> LEO clients have participated in the programme <br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring<\/td><td><b>644<\/b> mentoring participants solely focused on Brexit <br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Brexit Seminars\/Events <\/td><td><b>4,655<\/b> Participants at the Brexit Information events<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Customs Training Participants<\/td><td><b>531 <\/b>Participants attended Customs Training<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service<\/td><td><b>3,219<\/b> SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2019.

This ambition is underpinned by deliverables to complement the implementation of the Affordable Childcare Scheme including the introduction of additional ways to reduce costs, enhance supply and improve quality.<\/p><p>-Fostering participation in the labour force through flexible working solutions. This ambition assists in the development of an inclusive society. It is underpinned by a number of deliverables including the development of guidance for employers on family-friendly working options and the extension of unpaid Parental Leave to allow for greater flexibility of parents.<\/p><p>Improving incentives to participate in the labour force. This ambition includes a deliverable to consider income tax arrangements for second earners that optimise financial incentives to work, taking account of the impact that the income tax system may have on female participation in the workforce.<\/p><p>-Encouraging adult dependents and beneficiaries of other full-time welfare payments to engage in activation, enter and\/or stay in the workforce. This ambition is underpinned by deliverables such as the development of a return to work service as part of the Public Employment Service offering; assisting women returned to work in the technology sector through Skillnets Ireland Women ReBOOT programme; and a review of recent analyses of inactivity to identify policy issues to support the development of policy responses.<\/p><p>Undertaking promotional campaigns to encourage greater levels of participation in the labour force. This ambition is underpinned by deliverables including a communications campaign to promote awareness of the Public Employment Service as a real recruitment option, especially for those groups with lower participation rates; and the development of promotions for female participation as part of Jobs Week 2019 and Jobs Fairs.<\/p><p>Employment rates by sex, age and citizenship (%), European Labour Force Survey, Eurostat, Q1 2019<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100073#WRR06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Data","counter":1094,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100074#WRS00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1095,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[31110\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100074#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the annual number of exporting firms between Enterprise Ireland client companies and IDA supported companies over the 2014 to 2018 period and to date in 2019, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1096,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland supports companies in urban and rural areas to start, innovate and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future.

Trade matters are discussed by a different Council formation, whereas the Competitiveness Council - or COMPET - is generally composed of &quot;industry&quot; Ministers.<\/p><p>With regard to your request for an overview of EU Trade agreements and trade discussions, the EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), go beyond the reduction or elimination of conventional tariff barriers to include: <\/p><p>- non-tariff and regulatory barriers, services, <\/p><p>- investment, <\/p><p>- recognition of professional qualifications, <\/p><p>- intellectual property rights, <\/p><p>- access to public procurement, <\/p><p>- regulatory cooperation, <\/p><p>- sustainable development, <\/p><p>- labour and environment.  <\/p><p>They help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish-based firms.<\/p><p>The latest up-to-date information on specific FTAs is as follows: <\/p><p>EU-Canada (CETA) - On 21st September 2017, CETA was &quot;provisionally applied&quot;, under which EU\/Irish companies gain access to the removal of customs duties and substantially improved access to the Canadian public procurement market. CETA also opened up new sectors of the Canadian services market, reduced regulatory barriers and provided more transparent rules for market access.  <\/p><p>Ireland already has a strong trading relationship with Canada which is reflected in the &euro;3.2 billion worth of annual trade between both countries.  The value of Irish exports to Canada is worth &euro;2.4 billion whilst the value of Irish imports from Canada is worth &euro;780 million.  <\/p><p>EU-Japan - The EU-Japan Economic Partnership (EPA) was signed in Tokyo on the 17th July 2018.  The European Parliament and Japan's National Diet voted to ratify the EPA in December 2018 and the Agreement entered into force on 1st February 2019.  Tariff reductions will be delivered on a phased basis over a period of up to 15 years.  It is expected that the Agreement will open up new opportunities for Irish exporters and companies across a wide range of sectors, including the agri-food sector, which will see particular benefits with new access for dairy products and beef. It will also facilitate greater ease in doing business in the financial services, med-tech, and green energy sectors and across the full range of trade interests that Ireland and Japan share. The Agreement also creates opportunities for Irish-based manufacturers in our pharmaceutical sector through an expansion of existing Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) on Good Manufacturing Practice to cover new pharmaceutical products.<\/p><p>EU-Mexico - On 21 April 2018, the EU and Mexico announced that they had reached Political Agreement in their negotiations to modernise the existing EU-Mexico Global Agreement to broaden its scope to include regulatory cooperation, more trade in agriculture and food, common phytosanitary standards (food safety and animal and plant health), sustainable development, rules of origin, public procurement.  The EU and Mexico hope to finalise the full legal text before the end of the year.  The final text will be reviewed by lawyers from both parties, a process called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo;.  After this, the agreement will be submitted for the approval of EU Member States and of the European Parliament before signature. The Agreement will provide a platform to increase Irish exports to Mexico, this will be significant for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy, pork and beef products.  Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives.  There are also many exciting opportunities in Mexico for Irish businesses including in the automotive, aeronautics, electronics, financial and telecommunications sector.<\/p><p>EU-Singapore - The EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed by the EU and Singapore at the 12th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit on 19th October 2018.  The FTA was ratified by the European Parliament on 12 February 2019.  The aim is for the FTA to enter into force during 2019.  The deal goes beyond many other free trade accords in committing to open up public procurement, an area where the EU has many leading suppliers, and agreeing on technical standards in areas such as motor vehicles, electronics and green technologies.<\/p><p>EU-Vietnam - A Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was successfully negotiated with Vietnam in 2015.  The European Commission and Vietnam signed the FTA on 30 June 2019 in Hanoi.  The hope is that it will be ratified by the European Parliament during 2019.  The EU-Vietnam FTA will eliminate over 99% of tariffs and will unlock a market with huge potential for Irish exports.  The FTA will also create opportunities by addressing other barriers to trade and will address trade-related areas such as public procurement, regulatory issues, competition, services, investment, intellectual property rights, and sustainable development.  The Agreement creates opportunities for the Irish Agri-food sector, in particular. Ireland's food exports to Vietnam have grown considerably in recent years and the FTA will support further growth.  There are opportunities for Ireland to grow exports in dairy products, pork, seafood, and alcoholic beverages by taking advantage of reduced tariffs under the FTA.  Currently tariffs on EU exports of spirits to Vietnam are particularly high at 48% and will be eliminated under the FTA. The elimination of tariffs of 15% on frozen pork products is also significant for Irish producers.<\/p><p>EU-Mercosur - The EU has recently reached political agreement on FTA with the Mercosur region (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay).  The EU-Mercosur Agreement is the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date.  The Agreement covers a population of over 770 million with trade in goods and services valued at &euro;122 billion.  It aims to reduced and, in some areas, eliminate trade tariffs between the EU and the Mercosur region.  In 2018, Ireland exported &euro;0.5 billion worth of goods to the Mercosur region.  In 2017 &ndash; the latest year for which data is available &ndash; services exports to Mercosur totalled almost &euro;1.5 billion.  Trade with this region has grown by 19% in the period 2010 to 2016.  The EU-Mercosur Agreement will, we anticipate, allow Irish exporters to expand faster, and will open opportunities across a wide range of sectors &ndash; in business services, chemicals, machinery, medical devices and processed food and dairy.  This Agreement will see a significant reduction or elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade that will allow a cross flow of trading and investment between Ireland and the rest of the EU, and the Mercosur region. The EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement will make exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase the demand for Irish products.  The final text of the Agreement will be reviewed by lawyers from both parties, a process called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo; and translated into the various EU and Mercosur languages.  After this, the agreement will be submitted for the approval of EU Member States and of the European Parliament before signature - a process we believe will take 2 years based on previous FTAs.<\/p><p>EU-Australia and New Zealand - Negotiations for separate FTAs with Australia and New Zealand commenced in July 2018.  Three rounds of negotiations have been held with the most recent taking place from 25th-29th March 2019.  The fourth round is expected to take place during July 2019.  Good progress has been made in many areas to date, however more challenging discussions are also anticipated on sensitive issues such as recognition of the EU&rsquo;s Geographic Indicators for food and beverages, and in finding agreement on the structure of tariff offers.  To date there have been four rounds of negotiations for an EU-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement with the most recent taking place from 13th-17th May 2019 in Wellington.  Overall, progress has been constructive with some chapters capable of being closed.<\/p><p>EU-Chile - The EU and Chile launched negotiations for a modernised Association Agreement in November 2017.  There have been three rounds of discussions to date, the latest taking place in Brussels, 28 May-1st June 2018.  Over the course of the round the negotiating teams discussed all the issues covered by the Agreement.  While no date has been confirmed for the fourth round of negotiations, both sides agreed on work in relation to various areas, and contact will continue to this effect to continue advancing in all areas of preparation for the next round of negotiations.<\/p><p>Indonesia - Indonesia is a member of the ASEAN group.  The first FTA negotiations with Indonesia took place in September 2016.  The eighth round of negotiations took place in Jakarta from 17 - 21 June 2019.  The potential for further progress before October is limited as Indonesia will not have a new government in place until then following elections in April.  The negotiations are approximately at the half-way point.  Good progress has been made in a number of areas, however more difficult discussions undoubtedly lie ahead.<\/p><p>EU-US trade discussions - On the 25th July 2018, European Commission President Juncker and President Trump met in Washington to launch a new phase in the close friendship and strong trade relations between the United States and the European Union.  They agreed a Joint EU-US Statement to &ndash;<\/p><p>- work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies (on non-auto industrial goods) and to work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans,<\/p><p>- strengthen strategic energy cooperation to potentially increase US imports of (LNG) to diversify the EU&rsquo;s energy supply,<\/p><p>- launch a close dialogue on standards to ease trade barriers, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs, and<\/p><p>- work closely together with like-minded partners to reform the WTO and to address unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, industrial subsidies, distortions created by state owned enterprises, and overcapacity.<\/p><p>An EU-US Executive Working Group (EWG), was established on foot of the July joint statement, co-chaired by EU Trade Commissioner Cecelia Malmstr&ouml;m and the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.  The EWG is vehicle for carrying forward this joint agenda and is scheduled to meet again in early May 2019.<\/p><p>On 15 April 2019 the<b><\/b>EU Council voted by qualified majority to approve the negotiating directives for the commencement of trade negotiations with the US in the sectors of conformity assessment (making it easier for companies to prove their products meet technical requirements on both sides of the Atlantic) and one on the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods (excluding agricultural products).  The approval of the negotiating directives is a key step on the road to a possible future trade agreement between the EU and US.  Furthermore, these mandates will enable the EU Commission, in consultation with Member States, to work towards removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to EU-US trade in industrial goods, key goals of the July 2018 Joint Statement of EU Commission President Juncker and US President Trump.<\/p><p>A recent economic analysis released by the EU Commission found that a targeted EU-US agreement eliminating tariffs on industrial goods would increase EU exports to the US by 8% and US exports to the EU by 9% by 2033.  In this context where Ireland and the US have a bilateral trading relationship worth more than &euro;100 billion per annum, the potential gains for Ireland, and resultant employment, from an EU-US trade agreement would be very positive.  <\/p><p>It will be a matter for the EWG to determine the timing of future EU-US trade negotiations.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to proposed duties on EU imports, I assume that this refers to two long-running disputes between the EU and US regarding alleged subsidies provided to their respective commercial aircraft manufacturers, Boeing (US) and Airbus (EU).  In both cases the WTO has found that the EU in relation to Airbus, and Washington State in relation to Boeing, provided subsidies to support these airlines in contravention of WTO rules.<\/p><p>The US has requested the authority to impose countermeasures worth $11.2 billion, commensurate with their estimation as to the adverse effects caused by EU subsidies to Airbus.  However, a WTO arbitrator is currently evaluating the claim and the report is due before the end of 2019 such that the amount has yet to be determined.  However, in advance of the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision, the US published in April 2019 a draft list of products that may attract increased tariffs.  This US list is divided into two sections, the first included aircraft related products and is targeted at the four Member States (France, Germany, Spain and the UK) that provided support to Airbus the second section targets a wide range of products to be applied across all 28 EU Member States.  Included in both sections are products that Ireland exports in significant volumes to the US, including aircraft and aircraft parts, butter, cheese and liqueurs. <\/p><p>On 1st July the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) published a supplementary list of product lines which may be subject to increased tariffs.  The list includes agricultural products exported by the EU 28.  Dairy spreads, Italian cheeses, olives, coffee and pasta are all included, as are Irish and Scotch whiskies, as well as pork products.  This supplemental list adds 89 tariff subheadings with an approximate trade value of $4 billion to the initial list published in April.  In line with its standard procedures, the USTR has invited written submissions on the supplemental list and will hold a public hearing on 5th August 2019.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the US lists (initial and supplemental) are only proposed lists and it will be for the WTO arbitrator in the case to determine the amount of possible damage.  Only after the WTO Arbitration report is issued can the US choose products to impose tariffs on and only up to a value that matches the amount awarded. <\/p><p>The EU has stressed that the arbitrator in the Airbus case has yet to release its report which could permit the EU to impose tariffs on the US to the value of the arbitration findings,<\/p><p>Importantly, the EU remains open for discussions with the United States on both cases and believes the US estimate of $11billion worth of tariffs to be greatly exaggerated.  Ireland continues to support the EU position of seeking a negotiated resolution to the Airbus\/Boeing disputes that is to the benefit of both sides and has encouraged discussions to start as early as possible to this end. <\/p><p>Finally, at a national level, my Department continues to monitor the potential impacts of the trade measures being proposed by the US.  Officials in my Department continue to engage with the European Commission on the matter as it is important that we maintain a common EU position, principally given that the EU Commission has competency on trade matters under the EU Treaties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100074#WRS02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":1117,"qnumday":425,"qnumall":"[31119\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100074#WRS02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if changes to EU state aid rules as a policy lever to support exposed firms and exports from a no-deal Brexit were discussed at the informal EU Competitiveness Council meeting in Helsinki; and if not, the reason Ireland did not raise the issue.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1118,"content":"<p>My colleague Minister Breen attended the informal EU Competitiveness Council meeting on 5 July to which the Deputy refers. \u00a0State Aid rules did not feature on the agenda of this meeting. \u00a0The Competitiveness Council is a consultative committee and is not a forum for direct representations from Member States. \u00a0Changes to State Aid rules is therefore not part of the remit of the Council.<\/p>  <p>  However, my Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. \u00a0My Department has been working closely with the EU Commission and DG Competition since November 2017 through the Irish\/EU Technical Working Group on State Aid.

The &euro;1.25m fund, is targeted at retailers with an online presence to encourage acceleration of their online offerings and can be used to fund research, strategy development, implementation and training. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The fund will provide grants between &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000 on a match fund basis with the purpose of enhancing their online offering. Applications for funding under this pilot Scheme are considered on a competitive basis under calls for applications. Once the fund criteria is met, at least half of the total number of funds will be awarded to Irish retail businesses based outside of Dublin. By delivering the Online Retail Scheme, I intend to support Irish retailers to innovate, and through innovation, increase their competitiveness and international reach.<\/p>  <p>  The first call opened on 24th October 2018 and closed on 5th December 2018, I announced the eleven successful applicants on 1st March 2019 in Skibbereen, Co. Cork. The approved applications were in sectors ranging from; pharmacy, giftware, lifestyle, entertainment, outdoor clothing and equipment, garden furniture and safety equipment. Following the first call, my Officials in conjunction with EI, undertook a review of the feedback on Call 1 to examine ways in which the Scheme offering could be strengthened.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of that, I approved that the eligibility criteria of the scheme be expanded to widen the reach of the scheme. The scheme will now accept applications from\u00a0Irish-based\u00a0retailers with 10 or more full-time employees (including over 250 employees). Call 1 of the Online Retail Scheme was open to applications from Irish owned retail businesses with 20 or more employees, and who have a physical retail outlet. By opening up the Scheme\u00a0\u00a0to more retailers for Call 2, \u00a0I expect to see even stronger interest and volume of applications. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland delivered advisory clinics for retailers at the Retail Excellence Retail Retreat Conference 21-22 May, 2019. The clinics offered retailers an opportunity to raise questions or issues in relation to the application process for Call 2 of the pilot Online Retail Scheme and receive expert advice from Enterprise Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Peer learning is an integral aspect of the pilot Online Retail Scheme in order\u00a0to encourage knowledge sharing. Enterprise Ireland have already held online retail specific workshops with the successful entrants from Call 1 and further workshops are planned for the successful applicants from Call 2.<\/p>  <p>  The second call of the pilot Online Retail Scheme opened for applications on 19 June 2019 and will close at 3pm on 31 July 2019. I look forward to announcing the successful applicants from Call 2 later this year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100074#WRS06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Ireland Portfolio","counter":1161,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100074#WRS06900"},{"type":"question","counter":1162,"qnumday":440,"qnumall":"[31263\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100074#WRS07000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will consider approving Mullingar as a preferred location for an advanced technology unit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1163,"content":"<p>As part of its &euro;150m Regional Property Programme (RPP) the IDA are directly investing in a building programme to help ensure property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding in Ireland, thereby encouraging more foreign direct investment (FDI) in the regions.\u00a0 Budget 2019 also saw the Agency allocated an additional &euro;10m for the RPP bringing its yearly capital budget for property to &euro;47m. <\/p>  <p>  While Mullingar has\u00a0not been\u00a0selected by the IDA as a location for\u00a0an Advanced Technology Unit (ATU), the Agency continues to draw the attention of investors\u00a0to the town.

This reply was taken as a composite with 31016\/19, 31017\/19, 31018\/19 and 31019\/19. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health takes the management of patient safety very seriously. In November 2015, the Government approved a major programme of patient safety reforms which included the establishment of a National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) in the Department of Health. The NPSO was established in December 2016 to oversee a programme of patient safety measures. The programme of patient safety centres on initiatives such as the establishment of a national patient advocacy service, the introduction of a patient safety surveillance system, the measurement of patient experience and extending the clinical effectiveness agenda. <\/p>  <p>  In line with international best practice, the Department has been driving a progressive legislative framework to build an open and just culture for patient safety which balances the need for an open and honest reporting culture that facilitates a learning environment, and quality healthcare with accountability for both individuals and organisations. Disclosure and reporting are opportunities to learn, to improve, to address errors that have happened and to apply the lessons to make the service safer for the next patient and the patient after that. The programme of legislation being progressed includes the Patient Safety Bill, which will provide for the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events, and a Patient Safety Licensing Bill, which will introduce a regulatory regime for all hospitals as well as certain designated high-risk activities. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, on 25 October 2017, I launched the National Standards on the Conduct of Reviews of Patient Safety Incidents. These standards, developed jointly by HIQA and the Mental Health Commission, set out a new approach to the way health providers respond to, review and investigate incidents in order to determine as quickly as possible what may have transpired, and why, to ensure that they can immediately implement any improvements necessary to prevent a re-occurrence.   <\/p>  <p>  Finally, in 2018 the Health Service Executive (HSE) launched it new Incident Management Framework and in June 2019 launched their interim revision of the Open Disclosure policy: &ldquo;Communicating with Patients Following Patient Safety Incidents&rdquo; replacing the HSE Open Disclosure Policy 2013. The Department will shortly establish a new Independent Patient Safety Council. I have recently appointed the Chair of the Council. The first task of the Council will be to undertake a detailed review of the existing policies on Open Disclosure across the whole healthcare landscape. The Independent Patient Safety Council will include strong patient and public representation and international patient safety expertise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100081#WRZ07700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Health Initiatives","counter":1694,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100082#WRAA00400"},{"type":"question","counter":1695,"qnumday":619,"qnumall":"[31025\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100082#WRAA00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a refund under the cross border initiative will be expedited for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1696,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100082#WRAA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Agency Staff Expenditure","counter":1697,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100082#WRAA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1698,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[31031\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100082#WRAA00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the spend on agency staff for mental health services in each of the years 2014 to 2018 and to date in 2019;

The Pathfinder team should develop mandatory protocols which will work to safeguard young people against potential changes in policy that could negatively impact on youth mental health<br \/><br \/>1.2 - Policies involving young people should be published in simple, straightforward language that young people can understand<br \/><br \/>1.3 - A process of youth consultation should be carried out when designing mental health and other support services and facilities for young people<br \/><br \/>1.4 - An independent National Youth Mental Health Advocacy and Information Service should be established. Consultation should be informed by children and young people and should include the HSE, which is developing a tender for a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) youth advocacy pilot.<\/td><td>Work has been advanced to establish a Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Team. There has been considerable communication and work performed in addressing outstanding governance, staffing and funding issues. Activities are not yet complete in fully developing and rolling out a Pathfinder unit, but work is on-going. <br \/><br \/>At the end of May Minister Daly had a constructive meeting with Minister Donohoe and his officials. They are very supportive of the proposal, subject to resolving the outstanding matters.

Work has been completed to determine the merits of establishing the advocacy service as (i)a separate structure independent of the HSE, (ii) a structure within the Child Ombudsman or indeed (iii) a new NGO agency. A draft business plan has been drafted and data from the HSE pilot will provide a template for how best to proceed in an Irish context. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Awareness and Training<br \/><br \/>2.1 - A series of sustained and evidence based awareness campaigns should be developed, specifically targeted at children and young people, to improve mental health, emotional literacy, build resilience, and aid the development of coping mechanisms<br \/><br \/>2.2 - Sustained, quality-assured and evidenced-based training programmes should be funded to provide support to individuals in the public, voluntary and community sectors who have contact with young people so that those trained might be in a better position to promote positive mental health<\/td><td>The HSE have been examining International awareness initiatives that might be applicable in this jurisdiction. <br \/><br \/>Little Things Mental Health Campaign for 2nd level students:<br \/><br \/>HSE Mental Health has been running the Little Things Campaign since 2014 to promote protection and improvement of mental health for the whole population. The campaign focuses on 9 protective factors that can help build resilience and improve mental health and wellbeing. There were 87,000 followers of Little things on social media in 2017. There were 3.2m visits to yourmentalhealth.ie between 2014 and 2017.<br \/><br \/>In 2017 work commenced on adapting the Little Things Campaign to tailor the messaging and make it more relevant to young people, who are also listed within Connecting for Life as a priority group. Using research conducted by online youth mental health service, ReachOut.com, which highlighted key areas of stress for young people the HSE identified 6 issues to include in the new campaign; Exams, Sleep, Digital devices and Bottling up your feelings, Relationships and Image. <br \/><br \/>Imagery and messaging has been developed for 4 of the key areas and will be made available as poser packs to schools, youth and sports clubs around the country. The messaging has been developed to inform young people about the things they can do to reduce stress and anxiety. <br \/><br \/>The campaign will be promoted on Radio, Social Media and through Digital ads targeting young people through relevant channels. We will be signposting to yourmenalhealth.ie for more information on the topics and will also promote the Childline text and phone option for any young person that might need immediate support. Content on all 6 issues, developed in partnership with SpunOut will also be hosted on ymh.ie.<br \/><br \/>HSE\/USI ReCharge Mental Health Campaign for 3rd Level Students:<br \/><br \/>HSE Mental Health is also funding a new Mental Health awareness campaign with USI to target third level education students. This campaign is due to be launched on the 12th of November in University College Cork. The HSE funding has been used to create a new campaign logo and tagline, three new posters to address the effects that Alcohol, Sleep and Exams can have on mental health and ways to help manage any stress related to those issues. A new leaflet with more information on protective factors and ways to seek help will also be produced as well as content on both USI.ie and yourmentalhealth.ie.

The training has been shown to improve attitudes towards people with mental health difficulties, reduce stigma, improve knowledge, and improve people&rsquo;s confidence in providing help and likelihood to advise people to seek professional help. Over 2000 individuals and professionals have been trained in 2018 and the training will continue in 2019.<br \/><br \/>Perinatal Training<br \/><br \/>The HSEs Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Services Model of Care was launched on 30.11.2017. Its implementation is now being directed and overseen by the Clinical Lead and Programme Manager. Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Teams are being recruited for the maternity hospital\/service hub in each of the six Hospital Groups. Two of the teams are now operational. As part of this implementation a mental health midwife is also being recruited for each of the maternity hospitals\/units with two for the four larger services, those with over 8,000 deliveries per year. Apart from the perinatal psychiatrists heading up each specialist hub team who are directly trained in the speciality, all other staff will require training in perinatal mental health. The National Implementation and Oversight Group is in the process of drafting a training document and in the meantime all newly recruited staff are being provided with the appropriate induction and training.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Telephone Line <br \/><br \/>3.1 - The Taskforce recommends increased investment in age-appropriate, scalable digital youth mental health supports in conjunction with existing providers to ensure all young people ages 0-25 have access to an active listening service and dynamic signposting tool.<\/td><td>HSE Mental Health has sought to advance the establishment and operation of a single and stand-alone National Mental Health Service Telephone Contact Facility to effectively manage mental health service related queries emerging from the community.

The policy statement provides an overarching structure encompassing existing, ongoing and developing work in the area of wellbeing. It builds on the good work already happening in schools to ensure that best practice in whole-school wellbeing promotion is embedded across the system.  The policy outlines a multicomponent, whole school preventative approach to the promotion of wellbeing with interventions at both universal and targeted levels.   This policy requires that a Wellbeing Promotion Process is developed and implemented, through the use of the School Self-Evaluation (SSE) process, in all schools by 2023.  <br \/><br \/>The policy includes a set of Statements of Effective Practice in relation to wellbeing promotion within the school system. The statements will support schools in reviewing their current provision in four key areas of wellbeing promotion, culture, curriculum, policy and partnership and in setting goals for improvement.  In order to support schools in the implementation of this Wellbeing Policy it is planned to develop and rollout a comprehensive programme of professional development, commencing in 2019.  This will include facilitating the engagement of schools in the school self-evaluation for wellbeing promotion process, which will build professional capacity in schools.  It also includes the provision of a comprehensive and easily-accessible set of resources to address school-identified wellbeing promotion needs.  The roll out will be aligned with the Junior Cycle Wellbeing Programme and the Schools for Health Programme delivered through the HSE, Health<br \/><br \/>The Department of Education and Skills has introduced a new Wellbeing programme for schools which forms part of the new Framework for Junior Cycle.  It was introduced to first year students from September 2017.  Guidelines on Wellbeing in Junior Cycle have been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and are available at . Schools will use the guidelines in formulating their individual Wellbeing programmes from September.  There will be 400 hours of timetabled engagement for the Wellbeing area of learning over the 3 years of Junior Cycle.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Third level supports<br \/><br \/>6.1 - The current provision of counselling and mental health supports in higher level institutions should be maintained and enhanced<br \/><br \/>6.2 - The Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills should develop appropriate indicators to assess student experience in higher education in the system performance framework for higher education<br \/><br \/>6.3 - Prioritise the implementation of recommendations contained in &ldquo;Mental Health Matters&rdquo;<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Supports<br \/><br \/>7.1 - The Task Force recommends that local government work with relevant agencies, youth groups and community groups to provide safe, &lsquo;youth friendly&rsquo; spaces, sporting and cultural facilities that are conducive to promoting good mental health. These should include the provision of pleasant spaces and facilities for young people to access qualified health and mental health care in the community.<br \/><br \/>Evidence-based, quality-assured training in youth mental health should available to all individuals working with young people in the community<\/td><td>The provision of Youth Friendly Spaces in community settings is a high priority for local government. Working with youth groups and community groups, service providers have been asked to try to include youth friendly spaces so that mental health can be supported. The thrust of Government policy has been towards enhancing mental health support in the community since &lsquo;A Vision For Change&rsquo; was adopted in 2006. This policy will be continued when the refreshed policy is published later this year.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Accessibility and Alignment<br \/><br \/>8.1 - Pathfinder should carry out a detailed assessment of the services and supports currently available in relation to youth mental health, in order to identify gaps in service provision and to scope what improvements could be achieved through greater coordination<br \/><br \/>8.2 - The HSE should improve provision of mental health supports to young people at the primary care level to reduce the pressure on the tertiary referral services and improve waiting times<br \/><br \/>8.3 - The HSE should establish a National Lead for Youth Mental Health and a Lead for Youth Mental Health in each Community Health Organisation (CHO) to co-ordinate the provision of services and address gaps in service provision, including out of hours services. The CHO Leads will liaise with relevant agencies to develop appropriate communication protocols, standardised assessment processes and coordination of service provision. This joint working will bring together expert stakeholders to identify and address potential blocks to service provision and seek to reduce current wait times nationally with the introduction of other more appropriate interventions in primary care.<\/td><td>DCYA and the Department of Health established a Working Group in 2018 to scope connectivity in the area of youth mental health.   The group is made up of senior officials from both Departments with representatives from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency and the Health Service Executive. <br \/><br \/>The key objective of the working group is to examine psychological and mental health services for children and young people with the aim of agreeing a clearer continuum of provision and strengthening alignment between providers. <br \/><br \/>Tusla and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol for inter-agency collaboration among the two organisations. Discussions are ongoing between the two organisations to ensure collaboration is effective and sustained. <br \/><br \/>A key initiative that will inform the further advancement of the work of the group is the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project, and it is important that the Working Group align with this initiative. Centralising the work in this way will provide a clear overview of existing provision and proposed plans from across the relevant departments and agencies so as to identify gaps in provision, areas of alignment and areas for further development. <br \/><br \/>Part of the recommendation refers to recruitment of HSE leads but the job specifications for full time staff are hard to define. At a recent meeting with HSE, Task Force representatives and NGO sector it was agreed to wait for the establishment of Pathfinder team to work on specific job specifications for the recommended posts.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Consent Issues<br \/><br \/>9.1 - Legislation should be published to give effect to the recommendations of the Expert Group on the Review of the Mental Health Act, 2001 with regard to children, including reforming the consent provisions, to allow young people under 18 direct access to mental health services<\/td><td>There are on-going discussions and legislative work in the Department of Health regarding amending the legislation to allow children under 16 access mental health services without the need to have parental consent.

It is expected that the Commission will need approximately six months to review the heads.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Improving Knowledge<br \/><br \/>10.1 - A funded strategic national research programme on youth mental health will be developed<br \/><br \/>10.2 - International sources of funding (for example from European Union or philanthropic organisations) should be leveraged to enhance this research strategy on youth mental health research<\/td><td>There have been discussion with the HRB on how best to approach these recommendations. There will be a need for new additional funding and this will need to be tied in the with the creation of the Pathfinder Team who will have responsibility to create structures for administering grants and creating criteria for issuing research funding. <br \/><br \/>PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies) programme of research, funded by the HSE, is investigating how best to deliver mental health services and interventions to families where a parent has a diagnosed mental illness. Recent years have seen growing recognition of the importance of parental mental health and the need for more integrated and effective service responses to parents with mental illness and their children (Wilson et al., 2010; HSE, 2015). This research aims to:<br \/><br \/>1. To identify mental health services in Ireland that currently deliver, or are interested in developing and delivering family-focused intervention(s) for families where a parent has a diagnosed mental health problem (and their children aged 0-18years). <br \/><br \/>2. To subsequently investigate in more detail the implementation and effectiveness of selected interventions in order to inform a &lsquo;think family&rsquo; care delivery agenda in Ireland (and internationally).<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100083#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Incidence","counter":1770,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100083#WRBB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1771,"qnumday":644,"qnumall":"[31055\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100083#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children under 18 years of age who died by suicide in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1772,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100083#WRBB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Data","counter":1773,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100083#WRBB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1774,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[31056\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100083#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children who died while in the care of the HSE in each of the years 2015 to 2018 and to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1775,"content":"<p>I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100083#WRBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Reports","counter":1776,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100083#WRBB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1777,"qnumday":646,"qnumall":"[31064\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100083#WRBB01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if monthly financial reports on the costs and revenue incurred during the month are generated by the HSE; if these reports are shared with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; if these reports are published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1778,"content":"<p>As part of the monthly performance cycle, my Department holds the HSE to account for its expenditure and for the delivery of the services set out in the National Service Plan.

The Terms of\u00a0Reference for the Forum outlined that its deliberations should be in line with the principles from the National Farmed Animal Health Strategy:<\/p>  <p>  - Working in Partnership;<\/p>  <p>  - Acknowledging Roles and Responsibilities;<\/p>  <p>  - Prevention is Better than Cure; and<\/p>  <p>  - Reflecting Costs and Benefits\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the total annual net cost of the TB Programme is over &euro;90 million a year of which &euro;45 million is provided by the Exchequer, &euro;35 million from farmers and &euro;10 million from the EU. EU co-funding for the TB Programme peaked at &euro;12.7 million in 2014 but has been falling steadily since then. The EU has capped its contribution at &euro;8.3 million for 2019 marking a 35% reduction in 5 years. All indications suggest further significant cuts are likely requiring this shortfall in funding to be met by the State and farmers. With this is mind and reflecting the Costs and Benefits principle from the National Farmed Animal Health Strategy, I understand the Forum is proposing an independent review into the Costs and Benefits of the TB Programme to inform its future financing.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note the existing levels of support provided to\u00a0Irish farmers when they experience a TB restriction. For every reactor (animal identified as infected with TB) taken from a farm, the herdowner is\u00a0compensated for the open\u00a0market value of that animal as\u00a0if it was otherwise healthy. This is\u00a0referred to\u00a0as the On Farm Market Valuation Scheme. \u00a0The cost of this Scheme increased from &euro;10.5 million in 2017\u00a0to &euro;14.3 million (+36%) in 2018. Separately, Ireland operates a number of supplementary compensation schemes which are not replicated in other countries that have a bovine TB Programme. These schemes (Hardship Grant, Income Supplement and Depopulation Grant) are designed to assist farmers with additional costs and consequential losses associated with a TB restriction. Following increases in rates and changes to eligibility for these schemes in 2015, the cost of these schemes has increased by &euro;1.7 million (80%)\u00a0relative to 2015 when disease metrics have remained broadly stable over\u00a0that period.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Currently, approximately 4,000 farm families per annum suffer the hardship and stress associated with a TB outbreak and associated restrictions. Trends to date in 2019 suggest a similar number of farm families will be afflicted with a TB breakdown this year, marking the fifth consecutive year of stagnation in TB herd incidence. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, eradicating the disease as quickly as possible will result in significant savings for all affected stakeholders and a reduction in associated stress for herdowners. As outlined above, the direct savings to farmers if the disease were eliminated is estimated at approximately &euro;35 million per annum, and that is before any market or other impacts are factored in. \u00a0I am committed to supporting measures which can support this objective.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the TB Stakeholder Forum's most recent meeting was on June 25th and\u00a0I expect\u00a0that the Chairman will send me an Interim Report shortly.

In June 2018 the range of energy efficiency measures available under the BEWH Scheme was expanded to include &lsquo;deeper&rsquo; measures. Under the expanded scheme, in certain circumstances, external or internal wall insulation, central heating and replacement windows, can be provided where a technical assessment (by SEAI contractors) considers them necessary. These additional measures brought the level of retrofit into alignment with that envisaged by the National Development Plan, but changed the relative attractiveness of availing of other 'shallower' interventions.

The plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also put Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. We have a great window of opportunity to reverse the current trend in emissions and secure a healthy more resilient future for the country. It means changing the way we heat our homes, the way we travel and the way we power the country.   The step-up in ambition in each of the sectors covered by the plan will require investment across the entire economy. Overall, through the mix of technologies and measures identified, the plan sets out the pathway that represents the least-cost burden to the economy as a whole. <\/p>  <p>  A significant portion of the technologies and measures set out in the plan will result also in net lifetime cost savings to the economy as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of costs to the Exchequer and other public funding, the plan will be funded through Project Ireland 2040 which provides &euro;30 billion for low carbon and sustainable mobility investments in the period to 2027.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the actions in the plan do not require public funding. The actions contained in this plan fall broadly into four categories:<\/p>  <p>  - public funding provided in the annual estimates process and in Project Ireland 2040 <\/p>  <p>  - measures such as setting a long-term trajectory for the carbon tax, in order to change long-term behaviour and decisions to encourage investment in more sustainable choices <\/p>  <p>  - new regulations to end certain practices (e.g. phasing out oil and gas boilers in homes or introducing low emission zones in cities) <\/p>  <p>-   actions to promote public and community engagement and participation in reducing our emissions<\/p>  <p>  Under the Climate Action Plan, a system of carbon budgets is being developed. This will have a significant impact on the way in which the system of government works, with each relevant Minister being responsible for carbon emissions for their sector. Each Department will not just be required to stay within their fiscal budget, but also to stay within their carbon budget, which will be the total amount of emissions which their sector will be permitted to produce in a particular period. This new system of carbon budgets will be introduced into law by a new Climate Action (Amendment) Bill. <\/p>  <p>  Each Government Department will have to determine the optimum approach to utilising the funding available to it to support the policies necessary to meet the targets proposed for each sector. The cost of delivering each target will depend on the mix of regulations, taxes, and subsidies which the Government may choose to deploy to achieve the target abatement range in each sector. The Climate Action Plan will be updated annually, which will allow us to take into account changing technologies and changing costs as we seek to meet 2030 and 2050 climate targets. <\/p>  <p>  Public funding will be required to deliver some of the actions which have been set out. However, the plan proposes to introduce reforms so we maximise the impact of the funding which is available. This is particularly so in the case of retrofitting. The Plan identifies a range of measures that will be needed to deliver the retrofit target. A central commitment in that regard is the development of a new retrofitting delivery model, which will group retrofits together to achieve economies of scale, leverage private finance, and ensure easy pay-back methods.

The band is particularly attractive for wireless broadband services, allowing higher speeds and greater coverage over long distances.\u00a0 An EU level Decision has been adopted in order to co-ordinate release of the band in all Member States by 30 June 2020. This proposal will allow mobile broadband services to use this part of the spectrum band, which will provide enhanced mobile services.\u00a0 My Department\u00a0and ComReg have been working to ensure the necessary measures are taken to facilitate a clearance of the spectrum to meet the\u00a02020 timeline for clearing broadcasting services from the band. In addition, ComReg published a preliminary consultation in June 2018 on a proposed award of spectrum rights of use covering multi- band spectrum, to include the 700 MHz band. On 18 June 2019, ComReg issued a response to consultation and further consultation on\u00a0the proposed multi-band and spectrum award for the 700 MHz, 2.1 GHz, 2.3 GHz and 2.6 GHz bands.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of ongoing efforts to improve mobile telephony coverage nationally, the Programme for Government specifically included a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.\u00a0The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in\u00a0December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website,\u00a0containing 40 actions to alleviate\u00a0some of the coverage deficits across the country.

The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018.

In June 2018 the range of energy efficiency measures available under the Better Energy Warmer Homes\u00a0Scheme was expanded to include &lsquo;deeper&rsquo; measures.\u00a0 Under the expanded scheme, in certain circumstances, external or internal wall insulation, central heating and replacement windows, can be provided where a technical assessment (by SEAI contractors) considers them necessary.

However it is critical that we build capacity sustainably, ensuring that all contractors delivering these ever-increasingly complex retrofit projects are adequately skilled and resourced.\u00a0 The new Climate Action Plan includes a number of measures which will build the supply chain for energy efficiency retrofits required to meet our 2030 targets including support for the development of necessary skills across the education and training system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100088#WRGG05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":2168,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100088#WRGG05200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":2167,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100088#WRGG05100"},{"type":"question","counter":2168,"qnumday":785,"qnumall":"[30525\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100088#WRGG05200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the BusConnects plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2169,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

The <i>Plan<\/i>clearly recognises that Ireland must significantly step up its commitments to tackle climate disruption. As the transport sector accounts for a little over one quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s non-ETS emissions there is no question that it must feature strongly in the national decarbonisation effort. <\/p><p>Cutting congestion is an action which would contribute positively to the decarbonisation effort. Congestion also imposes significant costs on residents, commuters and businesses in urban areas.  My Department is already seeking to address congestion and its negative impacts by encouraging modal shift away from private passenger cars towards public and active travel. To this end, a significant investment of &euro;8.6 billion is being made to increase the capacity and attractiveness of sustainable mobility under the National Development Plan 2018-27 as part of <i>Project Ireland 2040<\/i>.  <\/p><p>The potential roles of congestion pricing, low-emission zones and demand management were considered during the development of the <i>Climate Action Plan <\/i>and consequently, Action 81 calls for the development of a regulatory framework on low emission zones and parking pricing policies, the granting of local authorities with the power to restrict access to certain parts of a city or a town to zero-emission vehicles only, and the examination of the role of demand management measures in Irish cities, including low emission zones and parking pricing policies. My Department has lead responsibility for the implementation of this action.  Later this year, and in collaboration with the local authorities and the NTA, we will commission a study to:<\/p><p>- Consider key management drivers in an Irish context (e.g. congestion, air quality, climate considerations);<\/p><p>- Review international best practices on measures such as urban congestion charging, low emission zones and parking pricing policies; and<\/p><p>- Recommend the most appropriate responses for Dublin\/Cork\/Galway\/Limerick taking into account overall transport strategies in each case.<\/p><p>Stakeholder consultation will need to be undertaken as part of this Demand Management study.

My Department has been consulting extensively with the Maritime sector, including shipping, port and other key maritime stakeholders, regarding Brexit issues on an ongoing basis.  These consultations have included a Transport and Logistics All Island Sectorial meeting in Dundalk in January 2017, three Brexit Maritime Transport Workshops \/ Seminars (in April 2017, March 2018, and January 2019) with a further Maritime Transport Workshop \/ Seminar planned for September 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  Eight meetings have been held specifically with shipping companies and shipping interests in January and February 2019 alone, and these discussions with shipping companies have been continued by my Department since then as well by the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) who report to my Department.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2018 IMDO report on the Implications Of Brexit On The Use Of The Landbridge acknowledges that &ldquo;for Ireland, maritime links represent a key means of ensuring its direct connectivity with mainland Europe, particularly in view of the uncertain evolution of trade flows passing over the United Kingdom 'land bridge'.  The viability of the ongoing use of the landbridge route to access the single market in a no deal Brexit scenario is a serious concern for Irish importers and exporters and the impact of any disruption to the landbridge cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, particularly in a no-deal scenario.<\/p>  <p>  The assessment of my Department and the IMDO, based on extensive and ongoing consultations with the shipping sector, is that sufficient capacity should be available on direct routes to continental ports following a &lsquo;No Deal&rsquo; Brexit and should demand for further capacity arise, the shipping sector can respond quickly to meet such demands.       <\/p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, there has already been a significant market response evidencing the capacity of market participants to respond to shifts in trade patterns resulting from Brexit. In 2018, CLdN launched MV Celine, the World&rsquo;s largest RoRo vessel, and in 2019 launched the MV Laureline RoRo vessel, significantly increasing capacity on the Dublin&ndash;Rotterdam and Zeebrugge routes.  <\/p>  <p>  Irish Ferries' investment of &euro;150 million in its newest passenger and freight vessel, MV W.B. Yeats, provides year-round freight capacity between Ireland and France of 165 HGVs per sailing or 60,600 HGVs per annum. This additional capacity alone will be sufficient to cater for a substantial switch of UK landbridge traffic to direct links to EU ports, should such a demand arise. Also, in May 2018, Brittany Ferries' launched a direct route from Cork to Santander in northern Spain, and a vessel of similar size to the W.B. Yeats is due to be delivered on the Irish Sea routes in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, as announced this week, BG Freight Line is commencing a direct Waterford-Rotterdam weekly LoLo freight service, which will act as a deep-sea feeder through Rotterdam port and onwards to worldwide destinations for Irish importers and exporters.<\/p>  <p>  If disruption is to arise, it would likely be most acute in the immediate period following a no-deal Brexit as a result of a short time lag between an increase in demand for direct connectivity to the Continent and a market response, as shipping companies assess the actual difficulties and implement a response. The clear view of my Department and the IMDO is that the optimal solution in response to increased demand for extra capacity to continental Europe in a &lsquo;No-Deal&rsquo; Brexit scenario is for industry to respond to market changes in a timely manner.  <\/p>  <p>  Overall, this has been happening to date as I have set out above.  A number of actions are being implemented by my Department and the IMDO to encourage this responsiveness.  These will include a focussed awareness campaign by early September aimed at shipping companies, importers and exporters to create a dialogue between them to identify any new market demands as early as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100090#WRJJ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":2286,"qnumday":828,"qnumall":"[31363\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100090#WRJJ02600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the meetings he has had with haulage companies in the context of Brexit and the potential for delays at Dover and Calais; his plans to assist the sector and avoid delays at ports particularly in the event of a no-deal Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2287,"content":"<p>My Department has maintained close contact with road haulage stakeholders including the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA), the Freight Transport Association of Ireland (FTAI), IBEC, the Irish Exporters Association and the British-Irish Chambers of Commerce in the context of Brexit and continues to work with the industry representative bodies in order to keep hauliers and business informed of developments, in keeping with our long-established practice. <\/p><p>Most recently, two meetings, instigated by my Department, were held in late May with representatives of the FTAI and the IRHA respectively, to discuss Brexit and the whole-of-Government and importantly industry preparations as we approach 31 October. The readiness of the haulage sector, the introduction of additional customs controls and SPS checks East\/West, and the temporary EU contingency Regulation aimed at ensuring basic road freight connectivity between the EU and UK were discussed. <\/p><p>My Department hosted a Brexit Freight Forum with key road transport and maritime stakeholders including haulage industry representative bodies on 21 January 2019. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine were also in attendance and addressed the Forum. My Department also previously held a similar Brexit Freight Forum in March 2018.<\/p><p>In February and also in March, my Department was represented at the Irish Retail Grocery and Distribution Sector Roundtable hosted by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and engagement with this sector, including haulage industry representatives, is continuing.  <\/p><p>In March, my Department issued a comprehensive Brexit Communications Notice to all licensed international road haulage operators outlining the position on a range of transport issues which would arise in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This notice is published on my Department&rsquo;s website and the information available online will continue to be updated to keep industry stakeholders informed of Brexit developments. <\/p><p>A very important development to note is that the EU has adopted Regulation (EU) 2019\/501 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 March 2019, which will ensure the maintenance of basic road connectivity for road freight transport in the event of a no deal Brexit. This temporary measure, effective until 31 December 2019, allows UK hauliers to continue to access the EU on the basis that the UK gives reciprocal access to EU companies and operators. This Regulation is currently due to expire on 31 December and over the coming months, Ireland and other EU Member States will engage further with the Commission on this measure.<\/p><p>The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) study into the implications of Brexit on the use of the landbridge, published in November 2018, estimated that approximately 150,000 Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) travel between Ireland and the continent via the landbridge each year. This would equate to a weekly average of approximately 2,880 HGVs moving between Ireland and the continent via the landbridge, although there can be peak times within each week, and also on a seasonal basis. A cross-departmental Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was established in October 2017 and has been working on measures aimed at ensuring the ongoing effective and efficient use of the landbridge post-Brexit, including the key Dover-Calais route. My Department is represented on this Group and engagement with our EU partners to find solutions to minimise the potential disruption to Irish hauliers&rsquo; access to and through the UK in the event of a no deal Brexit continues.<\/p><p>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, along with other Government Departments, has emphasised the importance of stakeholders taking all necessary steps within their control to prepare for Brexit, including undertaking contingency planning to minimise the impact of Brexit on their operations.

Contractual arrangements are also drawn up with the release of funding based on the achievement of key milestones in the projects. <\/p>  <p>  No significant time delays or cost overruns have yet been identified through this process and good progress is already being made on the implementation of successful projects.  A number of the projects have already met their first milestone and had funding released.   To date, &euro;1,722,043 has been drawn down from the Fund by seven separate projects.  I expect that payments from the Fund will significantly accelerate over the coming weeks and months as further milestones are achieved across all the 84 projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100092#WRLL00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":2417,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100092#WRLL00900"},{"type":"question","counter":2418,"qnumday":874,"qnumall":"[31081\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100092#WRLL01000","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the number of capital projects being undertaken by his Department; the final agreed tender price; the estimated cost of each capital project in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1334"},{"type":"question","counter":2419,"qnumday":875,"qnumall":"[31097\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100092#WRLL01100","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the capital projects completed since 2010; the final agreed tender price for each project; the actual cost of each project; if the actual cost exceeded the tender price; the reason therefor in each case in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":2420,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 874 and 875 together.<\/p><p>My Department utilises capital funding to promote rural and community development and support sustainable communities. <\/p><p>The majority of capital funding is routed through local authorities who directly deliver projects utilising this funding.<\/p><p>I can confirm that my Department has not directly procured or delivered any capital project since its establishment in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100092#WRLL01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Development Initiatives","counter":2421,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100092#WRLL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2422,"qnumday":876,"qnumall":"[31153\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100092#WRLL01500","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the level of protections and supports available to a local community which is anxious to preserve and continue to use a historical community and former school building (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":2423,"content":"<p>My Department provides a range of supports to communities and community centres nationwide, in both urban and rural areas, by helping citizens to participate in the development of their communities and by providing funding to improve facilities.<\/p><p>My department funds the Community Enhancement Programme which funded capital projects to the total value of &euro;12.5m in 2018 and can be used to contribute towards the renovation of community infrastructure.

There have been a further 10,000 approved applications in the first six months of 2019.

Ireland continues to enjoy the highest per capita concentration of Men&rsquo;s Sheds in the world. I provided funding of &euro;500,000 to support the work of Men&rsquo;s Sheds in 2018 and this year I have decided to build on that with a further &euro;500,000 in recognition of the contribution these groups are making to life in Ireland. A number of Women&rsquo;s Sheds have emerged in communities in recent times and in order to support this positive development I have decided to make this funding also available to these groups. <\/p>  <p>  - The LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 which will provide &euro;250 million in financial resources to address the challenges facing rural areas over the course of the programme period, particularly under the themes of economic development and social inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  - Volunteering plays a critical part in empowering individuals to become more involved in their communities and is proven to assist with the development of mental health wellbeing.

There are several differing elements involved in each calculating method.  For example, the Yearly Average (YA) method does not include a limit on credited contributions.  The interim Total Contributions Approach (TCA), as launched in January 2018, does have a limit on credits but allows up to 20 years HomeCaring periods be added to paid contributions to increase a person&rsquo;s rate.  The YA method rewards those with a shorter timespan between first and last social insurance contributions while TCA looks at a person&rsquo;s aggregated contributions without regard for timespan.  Under YA, there is no maximum number of contributions required, while under TCA 40 years is the maximum required.  <\/p>  <p>  The elements which make up each method are set out in law.  Accordingly, it is not possible to choose those elements from either method that may prove most advantageous to an applicant.  To allow pensioners choose the elements in how their pension is calculated would likely incur very significant costs which could further undermine the sustainability of the State Pension.  My department will spend over &euro;8 billion on pensions in 2019 and this figure is already increasing year on year to the tune of c.&euro;1 billion every five years based on demographic changes alone.  Instead, pensioners are paid using whichever of the two methods of calculation is most beneficial to them.     <\/p>  <p>  The person in question applied for a pension and was assessed with having a yearly average of 21 based on 922 reckonable paid contributions and 107 reckonable credited contributions over 48 years.  This places the person into the 20-29 rate band which equates to a payment rate equal to 85% of the maximum rate pension. <\/p>  <p>  A review took place on the person concerned as part of the on-going rate review project.  The review resulted in a payment rate equal to 82.02% of the maximum rate pension based on 922 reckonable paid contributions combined with 677 HomeCaring periods and 107 reckonable credits. <\/p>  <p>  As the person is already in receipt of 85% of the maximum rate of pension, it is more financially beneficial for them to remain on their existing payment.

The Department will forward letters to the last known address of the member based on its records if this address differs from that which the pension provider has.  It is important to note that in all such cases the Department does not share personal data with any third party, and relies on Article 6(f) of the GDPR to perform the communication with the customer.<\/p>  <p>  The Department does not hold information on individuals' private pension entitlements and therefore the host mailing service cannot help people trace unclaimed pensions.  If a person believes that they may have an unclaimed pension entitlement the person should contact former employers and pension companies so they can check their records.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100093#WRMM04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Redundancy Rebates","counter":2520,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100093#WRMM04400"},{"type":"question","counter":2521,"qnumday":913,"qnumall":"[31104\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100093#WRMM04500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of restoring redundancy rebates to businesses by 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2522,"content":"<p>It is an employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy to eligible employees.

The scheme was never intended as a support to businesses to hire staff.  The scheme is funded from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).<\/p>  <p>  Up to 2011, the scheme provided a rebate of 60 per cent to employers who provided statutory redundancy payments to their employees.  I am advised by my Department that in Budget 2013, the rebate payment was abolished.  This decision was made because of the high cost of the rebate and its impact on the financial sustainability of the social insurance fund at the time of the economic crisis.  Furthermore, the rebate to employers was paid regardless of a company&rsquo;s financial situation and ability to pay, thus benefitting viable and profitable companies, including multinational companies. It was not a targeted use of the resources of the Social Insurance Fund. <\/p>  <p>  The redundancy payments scheme as it now operates benefits employees whose employers are unable to make statutory redundancy payments.  Employers who declare they cannot sustain the cost of redundancy payments, while continuing to trade, are required to submit verified financial information to prove this and are liable to the Social Insurance Fund for any redundancy payments made on their behalf.   This ensures that the current scheme takes into account both an employer's ability to pay redundancy payments and that the Social Insurance Fund can be reimbursed in the future, through debt repayment if an employer's financial position improves.<\/p>  <p>  Any proposals to restore the redundancy rebate scheme and any development of policy in this area would have to have regard to: the level of costs involved in restoring the rebate; the many other demands on the Social Insurance Fund including this Government's decisions to extend social insurance benefits to self-employed workers and to provide for paternity benefit and parental leave benefit; and other supports available to businesses who wish to hire staff. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100093#WRMM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","counter":2526,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100093#WRMM05000"},{"type":"question","counter":2527,"qnumday":915,"qnumall":"[31142\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100093#WRMM05100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if legislation will be passed in order for a public services card to be produced as a form of identification (details supplied).","asker":"1369","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2528,"content":"<p>Under current legislation, a Public Services Card (PSC) cannot be requested by any public or private body or person that is not designated as a specified body in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).

Under the terms of the RAS scheme, payments by the tenant in excess of the rental amount specified in the RAS contract to the landlord are not permitted.  In a scenario where a landlord has requested a payment in excess of the agreed rental amount, the tenant has the option of referring a complaint to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 &ndash; 2019 and it would be a matter for the RTB to decide on the appropriate sanctions to apply.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, a tenant sources their own accommodation in the private rented sector. The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is covered by the Residential Tenancies Acts.  The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on the household size and the rental market within that area. <\/p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  In addition, the normal 20% discretion beyond the rent limits is increased to 50% for homeless households in the Dublin Region.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord.  This reflects the fact that, unlike Rent Supplement, where payment ceases in certain circumstances, HAP support can continue to be paid where a household&rsquo;s income increases, including for reasons of the tenant taking up full-time employment.  In those cases, it would therefore be expected that some tenants would consider rental options, which they source themselves in the private rental market, that would involve them paying an element of rent beyond the HAP rent limits, enabled to do so by their improved income position.  <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that HAP tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where they are not satisfied that the household would be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.  <\/p>  <p>  At the end of Quarter 1 2019, there were over 45,000 active tenancies being supported under the HAP scheme. Collection of data in relation to the number of households making a top-up payment to their landlord does not form part of the standard reporting process of my Department.  However, the information available to the HAP Shared Service Centre operated by Limerick City and County Council indicates that approximately three quarters of all HAP tenancies are fully supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100094#WRNN06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":2618,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100094#WRNN07000"},{"type":"question","counter":2619,"qnumday":946,"qnumall":"[30857\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100094#WRNN07100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the different income streams directly paid by persons to his Department or agencies under his remit, such as motor tax; the number of persons making annual payments; the value of same; the number of payments made through staged or increment payments; the value of same; the additional income generated as a result of payments being made on an incremental basis; if incremental payments are not available, the reason for same; the corresponding figures for 1999 and 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2620,"content":"<p>Details of income streams paid directly to my Department are recorded as Appropriations-in-Aid in the annual Appropriation Accounts which are published by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and made available via their website www.audit.gov.ie .

In the case of Dublin, the City Council also provides fire services on behalf of the other three Dublin local authorities. My Department supports the fire authorities through setting national policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding. The capital programme includes recoupment for the purchase of fire appliances and emergency equipment and the construction and upgrading of fire stations within the overall funding available. <\/p><p>While the fire authorities obviously have a critical role, the people that control buildings have primary statutory responsibility for ensuring the safety of persons using the building. In this regard, inbuilt features such as layout and fire resistance are critical as are fire detection and alarm systems. Safety features should support early detection, safe evacuation of occupants and the containment of fires. The appropriate measures vary based on the scale, density and height of buildings and are set out in Building Regulations and associated Technical Guidance and Codes of Practice. <\/p><p>It is important to note that there has been a steady decline in the number of fire incidents and the number of fatalities resulting from fires in Ireland. With a three year averaged annual fire death rate of less than six per million of population, Ireland is among the countries where fire fatalities are deemed to have been minimised.  Of course, we must remain vigilant and work to avoid the tragedy of fatalities from fire, the vast majority of which occur in the home. However, it is important to recognise the positive impact of improvements in community fire safety strategies and fire brigade response. <\/p><p>In terms of equipment, management of the number, type and age profile of fire appliances is a matter for each of the fire authorities based on their local needs and requirements. Continued investment in the national fleet is one of the key priorities for the Fire Services Capital Programme. Under the capital programmes since 2008, my Department has funded nine &lsquo;Class B&rsquo; appliances and two turntable ladders for Dublin and close engagement continues with fire authorities in relation to future needs. In this regard, in assessing requirements, fire service management use multi-annual data of actual fires to determine &quot;Area Risk Categorisation&quot; (ARC) for each fire station area benchmarking against national standards, set out for the first time in the 2013 policy document &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe&rdquo;. <\/p><p>The ARC process helps fire service management establish a risk grading of: very high risk (A); high risk (B) medium risk (C); low risk (D); or very low risk (E) categories across areas.

Significant environmental damage is caused by wildfire and, more specifically, illegal\u00a0burning. This issue has become more acute in recent years, as evidenced by the recent spate of fires in various parts of the country, including earlier this year at Torc Mountain in Killarney National Park, Co. Kerry.\u00a0 Wild fires are not a natural phenomenon in Ireland and can have a local impact on species that cannot escape, or that lose breeding habitat as a result. Such impacts are generally fairly short term, but could be very serious for species that are already in decline, such as curlew. Some plant and moss species \u00a0may be lost\u00a0 or greatly reduced. UK research showed that where scrub such as gorse is burned it can have a lasting impact on soils and cause increased erosion which can in turn impact on rivers through increasing siltation of the water, especially if this burning happens repeatedly. <\/p>  <p>  I strongly condemn the spate of wildfires in recent years and would appeal to members of the public to be conscious of the dangers posed by fire on open ground. Even planned and\/or \"controlled\" burning can get out of hand very quickly, so it is critically important that every member of society realises the damage that can be caused to property and, indeed, the health and welfare of family, neighbours and the wider community, and the responding emergency services. The main source of wild fires is thought to be the deliberate starting of fires without concern for the consequences.\u00a0 Aside from such malicious activities, one of the main challenges is to encourage members of the public, (including landowners, farmers and recreational users of publicly accessible land), to act responsibly at all times, to be mindful of their own safety and the safety of others, to be mindful of the need to protect property, both publicly owned and privately owned and to appreciate the value of our natural heritage, particularly in our National Parks, Nature Reserves and Designated (Natura 2000) Sites.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0With regard to the National Parks, on an on-going basis, officials from my Department \u00a0are in close liaison with both the Garda&iacute; and the Fire Service. With regard to gorse fires in particular, there are a number of Inter-Agency Gorse Fire Groups that explore issues surrounding such fires. My Department, through its National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), is one of a number of agencies represented on such groups.\u00a0 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also represented on these groups and lead any criminal investigation).\u00a0There are a number of these groups in different locations around the country. They are convened by the Fire Services Department of the relevant Local Authority and the Chief Fire Officer for the Local Authority. Generally, the Chief Fire Officer for the Local Authority would chair the meetings and maintains records. Usually, the membership of such groups would include representation from stakeholders such as:<\/p>  <p>  - Fire Services Department of the Local Authority<\/p>  <p>  - Garda&iacute;<\/p>  <p>  - Forest Service Section of the Department of Agriculture and Food<\/p>  <p>  - NPWS<\/p>  <p>  - Coillte<\/p>  <p>  - Teagasc<\/p>  <p>  My Department (NPWS) meets and liaises with the Fire Officer directly as appropriate and necessary. For example to review arrangements and practical details in respect of our National Parks and other recreational properties e.g. re access point, codes, etc.<\/p>  <p>  Some 14 per cent of the terrestrial area of the State is designated and this includes many remote and inaccessible areas.\u00a0 Most land in special areas of conservation, special protection areas and natural heritage areas is in private ownership.\u00a0 Through the NPWS, my Department directly manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 87,000 hectares. These important biodiversity areas are located all around the country.\u00a0 \u00a0Given the sensitivity of these habitats, with regard to firebreaks, there are a number of ecological concerns with regard to their use. A balance has to be achieved between works necessary or desirable to assist in the control of wild fires within designated areas on the one hand and the sustainable conservation and protection of the qualifying interests within such sites. Where possible, targeted and minimal on site work &ndash; including the cutting back of combustible material (furze, heathers, over-grown grassland areas) &ndash; to create these &ldquo;natural fire breaks&rdquo; could help to control the spread of wild fires, without impacting significantly on habitats.\u00a0 My Department remains very committed to the prevention, early detection and minimisation of the impacts of such fires, and recently piloted a joint action with Coillte using drones to assist  in the early identification of fires and communication of real-time information to my staff when they work with the emergency services to prevent such fires from spreading. <\/p>  <p>  Given the sheer scale of property involved, (for example, Killarney National Park on its own comprises over 10,000 Hectares (26,000 acres) coupled with the remote locations of much of the designated lands and the sporadic occurrence and dynamic nature of such fires, it is very difficult to provide a visible &ldquo;presence&rdquo; on the ground to discourage and prevent unauthorised burning in the countryside.\u00a0 Equally, trying to identify those who deliberately set fires in open areas without concern for the consequences can be challenging. \u00a0NPWS staff remain ever-vigilant when conditions exist that might result in fires in the National Parks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100095#WROO03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":2659,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100095#WROO03600"},{"type":"question","counter":2660,"qnumday":962,"qnumall":"[30767\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019071100095#WROO03700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the estimated cost of implementing a living wage &euro;12.30 for all employees directly employed and or in agencies under her remit;
